This has consequences on the costs of trucking companies waiting long times behind the gates. Furthermore, it leads to containers arriving too late at the hinterland, a lower port attractiveness and high emissions of idling trucks. One possible policy to deal with this issue is to steer trucking companies towards night-time transport. However, this requires hubs with extended opening hours. The objective of this research is to investigate the implication of such policy further by evaluating and simulating the actors and their (inter)actions in the container transport system. This research uses a combination of qualitative (semi-structured interviews with actors) and quantitative (agent-based modelling, discrete event simulation, queueing theory and discrete choice modelling) methods to assess the impact of hubs with extended opening hours on freight transport under various scenarios. These scenarios compare possibilities for a chassis-exchange or a container hub and investigate the choice of trucking companies to use such hubs. Results determine that if a container hub would be introduced, other actors need to partly pay for trucking companies using the hub so that the hub capacity is fully used. This study reveals concrete recommendations on the type and location of the hubs to mitigate waiting times at terminals' gates and transport more containers per day. For example, a chassis-exchange hub can reduce the total waiting time at four container terminals by 420 hours per day. If trucking companies would invest in a chassis-exchange scenario, the profit is estimated to be around two to four thousand euros per day.","waiting times; container terminals; night-time truck transport; chassis-exchange; container hub","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

(graduation committee); Helder, Jesse (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The rise of alarming cyber breaches and cyber security attacks is causing the world to consider the security of our cyber space. A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a center where the security of a company is monitored to prevent cyber breaches. Security analysts in the SOC examine alerts that come from different devices and analyse what is causing these alerts. The SOC receives a high amount of false positive alerts and duplicates. Therefore security analysts will only react to alerts that seem critical. The problem is that analysts discard alerts that look like false positives but are actually genuine attacks. To tackle this problem of alert fatigue, related work has tried to implement machine learning models to reduce the number of alerts. However, the amount of workload that is reduced is still unsure. We argue that many machine learning models cluster the alerts that are easy for analysts to assess. This thesis compares traditional machine learning techniques with the state-of-the-art neural network DeepCASE and computes the amount of work that is reduced for the analysts. It also compares the machine learning models with a simple heuristic that reduces the duplicates in the dataset. We also enhance DeepCASE to find more sophisticated attacks. We show that using a simple heuristic is as good as using an advanced machine learning algorithm. We also show that using the enhanced version of a state-of-the-art neural network can find more sophisticated attacks.<br","Security Operations Center; Neural network; Machine learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

(mentor); Zubova, Anastasia (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","To this date, simulating the dynamics of a fluid remain extremely expensive for most practical design prob- lems. The large range of length and time scales to be resolved makes it especially computationally heavy. In engineering applications, the standard is still the RANS approach for CFD modelling. Most commonly the so- called two-equation models are used. The use of CFD in the aerospace design process is still severely limited by the inability to accurately and reliably predict turbulent flows with significant regions of separation. More accurate modelling approaches including LES are often not practical to use in engineering applications.<br/>In the recent work of Deltares, such problems also arise. Research has been performed on water flow be- hind an underflow gate. The flow phenomenon that occurs closely resembles that of a wall-bounded jet. The reason such research has been performed is to better predict the turbulent behaviour of the jet downstream to predict possible damage to sediment. Seven weirs on the Meuse are planned to be renovated or replaced. Currently, bed protection is designed using physical scale models. Ultimately numerical models are to be the new standard for designing bed protection behind an underflow weir.<br/>In their work experiments have been performed to acquire PIV data of the velocity field. This has been compared to their results of multiple CFD simulations which have been performed with different levels of fidelity. Several gate openings, changing the effective Reynolds number, have been used to compare the experimental results with the simulations. They concluded that although the velocity field solution of the simulations is good enough for engineering practices, all simulations show a mismatch in the area of the shear layer between the jet and the main flow.<br/>In recent years more and more research has been done in the applications of machine learning. The capabilities of ML have increased rapidly and are now also used in closure modelling. Alongside this are the continuously improving experimental capabilities which allow for much higher resolution information. The combination can be used for data-driven techniques to improve upon current RANS models.<br/>In recent work, the paradigm of field inversion has been proposed. Here instead of calibrating the mod- elling coefficients, a corrective field is used to effectively address the modelling deficiency. The correction field has been applied to the production term of the specific turbulent dissipation rate transport equation. To infer the values of the highest probability for the corrective field inverse methods are proposed. The method proposed uses Bayesian inversion, which includes an optimisation process. As the problem consists of a large number of variables normal optimisation processes are too expensive. Therefore, the adjoint method is proposed to compute gradients efficiently.<br/>In this work, the goal is to extend upon the recent work on field inversion. The paradigm will be applied to the underflow weir case of Deltares. The experimental data will be used to infer a spatially varying corrective field used to correct the simulations to improve their predictive capabilities. As the density of data points is often far smaller than the density of simulation cells, and often data sets do not cover the whole simulation domain the paradigm is extended to accept imperfect data.<br/>It was found that with these extensions a correction field could be found that can lower the cost function by a factor of two. The prediction of flow features behind the weir were predicted more accurately using the newly found corrected model.","CFD; Data Driven; Field Inversion; Adjoint; Continuous adjoint","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

In today’s society, we value autonomy and we strive to ensure that everyone can lead their life as autonomous as possible. In fact, we view autonomy as ultimate independence and freedom from outside influence. But by insisting so hard on independence and personal responsibility, it can feel like failing if you do not manage to do everything on your own. From the research done in this project, it was found that autonomy is more than being able to do everything yourself. Autonomy actually means making decisions and doing things in a way that you like or need. This can also mean that you do not want, can or should do it alone and that you need or want to be supported by the world around you. You decide yourself, as an individual, who or what can provide that support. The relationships you are part of are part of the context you are in and which can support you the way you want. The insights gained throughout the project are boiled down into a comprehensible framework explaining the different components of autonomy: the individual, important relationships, boundaries of support, and the context. Exploring the framework with designers revealed that the framework could be implemented throughout the design process in different capacities. As the first step to designing with autonomy is understanding what autonomy is, the choice was made to come up with a design for the first phase of the design process. The framework has served as the foundation for the development of a toolkit for designers. The Autonomie voor/in/met/en Design toolkit supports designers in communicating the importance and complexity of autonomy with their clients at the start of a project, by providing tools to uncover assumptions the client might have regarding the autonomy of their target group. While the toolkit is designed for the first phase of the design process, it is the first step in putting autonomy higher on the priority list of designers and clients.","Autonomy; Service design; Toolkit; Positive Health","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

However, if consumers rarely bring back EOU products, manufacturers can hardly close the loop (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2013). <br/>This thesis project collaborates with Philips, aiming to motivate Philips Grooming consumers to return used products to Philips so that devices can be recycled or refurbish. However, consumers rarely return the device. Therefore, this project intends to explore how an effective take-back program can be developed to change Grooming consumers’ behaviour towards returning.<br/>Fogg behaviour model is the key methodology supporting the project research.

Yet these endeavours should not come at the expense of the accessibility of the city. Therefore, many cities try to promote the use of sustainable modes of transportation by developing transit-oriented neighbourhoods. An ongoing debate related to these developments is the development timing of the public transport connection. Even though it is generally assumed that early provision of public transport is favourable, the significance of this notion has not yet been studied, and the considerations of the different parties involved in the decision making process in practice are unclear. Therefore, the aim of this research is to explore what development strategy of public transport in a residential area results in high ridership levels while still being feasible for the different parties involved. This is done through an evaluation of both the influence of development timing on travel behaviour and an evaluation of the development process based on stakeholder interviews. The results suggest that it is indeed beneficial to provide public transport from the moment the first inhabitants start to live in the area. However, the study also revealed that provision in a later stage does not necessarily mean that it is doomed to fail, as the car-ownership levels can slowly decrease in the years after the public transport is provided. The stakeholder interviews show development strategy needs to be tailored to the specific development, as the feasibility of a development strategy and the need for early provision are highly dependent on the location and the budget available for the subsidisation of public transport is limited. Thus, a tailor made solution is required for each location.","Development timing; Public transport; Travel Behavior; Mode choice","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

(mentor); Jepma, E.J. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In 2021, a group of angry farmers drove their tractors to the ‘Malieveld’ (‘Main square’) in The Hague, to protest the new nitrogen regulations. They felt angry because the politicians were not listening. When reading this news and following the politics around the farmers, a present call for sustainable change within agriculture could be heard. However, the changes which are currently spoken about, such as reduction of nitrogen or the number of dairy cattle, seems to be a black-and-white approach to frame the problem and does not represent a real or focused long-term plan. <br/><br/>Therefore, the aim of this project is to investigate the current system surrounding the dairy cow to find a new perspective on the complexity of the problem, and to create a fitting intervention which should bring about change towards a sustainable agriculture. This project will zoom in on specifically the Frisian dairy agriculture, exploring this context on a systemic level, and investigate using the ‘Transition Design’ method.<br/><br/>To gain insights in the complex system around the Frisian dairy cow, various stakeholders were identified. Some of these stakeholders, such as farmers or experts on nature or soil, were interviewed, while other stakeholders’ perspectives were investigated through in-depth research. <br/><br/>During the project, a new perspective arised. It can be concluded that the whole system surrounding the Frisian dairy cow is one large interwoven network. With at the centre not the dairy cow, but the one stakeholder which is directly connected to the entire system as every stakeholder depends on this: the soil. Without a healthy soil, which supplies raw materials, the entire identified system will not exist. Within our currently built agricultural system the discovered problem is that the soil will be depleted over the coming years and biodiversity will be expelled. Within this current system profits are not fairly distributed. The present system is mainly focused on yielding high profits by the banks, the food industry, and supermarkets.<br/> <br/>Based on the research, a desired future vision was created which helped to map out the pathway of transition. To accelerate the transition of the current system of the dairy cow towards the desired future, an intervention was designed. This intervention was focused on helping young professionals to develop a level of self-reflection with which they can link their behaviour towards buying certain dairy products to the invisible exiting consequences of the Dutch soil degradation.<br/><br/>Through a diverse set of testing rounds with different iterated prototypes, the intervention was tested among the target group. This showed that through the designed intervention, a new awareness was created regarding the present state of our food or dairy system. In conclusion, it showed that the intervention increased the level of self-reflection in the habits of consumers towards buying and consuming food with all the connected consequences.<br/><br/><br/>This project however has some limitations, the research had some time constraints and was conducted by only one individual. Therefore, when analysing, concluding and interpreting the data, the outcome, the new vision surrounding the Dutch dairy cow and the designed intervention could be received as subjective. Additionally due to the short time period of the research, not every stakeholder could represent them-self. <br/>If the research was to be reproduced, all the stakeholders of the system should represent themselves, to create an equal and complete view on the current system.<br/>Moreover, if the project was to be reproduced it should be continued by a larger team of diverse (design) researchers to create a more objective data analysis outcome.<br","Transition Design; Dutch Agriculture; Dairy industry; Systemic change; Healthy soil","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://totindebodem.nl/ Website_Totindebodem_DesignConcept","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The construction industry is transiting from paper-based systems engineering to Model-Based Systems Engineering, especially in the development phase of large infrastructure projects. The configuration management database, which manages the systems engineering information, is considered to be a the central systems in the Model Based Systems Engineering development. In current practice not all individuals perceive the benefits of the implementation of systems engineering tools. The context study shows the fundamental differences in systems engineering processes consisting of requirements analysis, functional analysis, design synthesis, verification and validation, system analysis and control. Based on the Integral Project Model, the technical management department has the biggest stake in the development phase. The roles considered in the technical management department are the specialty engineer and the lead engineer. The literature study presents the information needs characteristics (individual demographics, context, frequency, predictability, importance and complexity) as well as the fitness for use assessment method. The practical study shows that the information needs of the particular users differ per process as the roles have different tasks and responsibilities. As a result, the fitness for use of the configuration management database is also considered differently. The specialty engineer mainly requires information for decision making whereas the lead engineer focusses on management activities. The specialty engineer, which is mainly involved in the design synthesis and the system analysis processes, experiences problems obtainability, completeness, timeliness and coherence of the information. As a result, the specialty engineer implements workarounds, which might cause a snowball effect. The lead engineer mainly experiences problems with the functionalities of the system in the requirements and functional analysis. As a result, the lead engineer implements workarounds such as Word or Excel. As the specialty engineer experiences the majority of the problems, the design of solutions focusses on the specialty engineer. The solutions proposed consists of establishing physical relations between objects, implementation of abstraction levels, information presentation in the shape of a one stop page and information presentation in the shape of custom queries. The physical relations between objects and the abstract levels enable the one stop page and custom queries. The one stop query meets the predictable and recurrent information needs of the specialty engineer, whereas the custom query meets the unpredictable, new, urgent and complex information needs. The practical relevance of the solutions has been explained by a use case example in the shape of a simplified tunnel project. The relevance of the one stop page and custom query solutions are illustrated by stating the information needs in the particular processes and how the solutions meet these needs.","Systems Engineering; Model Based System Engineering; Fitness for use; Information needs; Configuration Management Database; Large Infrastructure Projects (LIPs); Specialty engineer; Lead engineer; CME; Construction; Workarounds; Information overload","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

The energy transition is needed, though it still has its problems. To be able to realize an energy­-neutral tunnel, different components are combined like renewable energy generation and energy storage. By linking tunnel systems not only with the energy grid for the supply of power but also connecting solar panels and batteries a complete system, or microgrid, is created. Lots of interesting developments are currently ongoing in this field, but momentarily, the main problems are simulation and scaling. Tunnels, combined with this so called energy transition are undergoing lots of changes with the energy supply and demand. The scaling for the renewable energy generation and the demand of the tunnels do not match over time and thus different solutions like battery storage are added. By combining multiple sub-­systems, the scaling becomes non-­linear and the control of energy flow complicated. The goal of this research is to combine new developments and knowledge to create a simulation model for the control and scaling of these microgrids. Research on the topic will be expanded and used in the creation of an energy control model within MATLAB®. With the use of this energy control model and found research results, a MATLAB® simulation model can be created. By using resulting correlations for the energy generation, demand, and behavior the subsystems for energy-­neutral tunnels can be determined more precisely. For the completion of this research, not only academic papers but also knowledge from professionals within Croonwolter&amp;dros is used as well as data and measurements from within the company. The model works and shows different results, it seems like the scaling of the number of solar panels as well as the storage capacity of the batteries has the most effect on energy neutrality. By selecting different parameters as well as different business cases, the system can be optimized for each specific situation. The selection algorithm and data conversion within the model result in an expansion of knowledge not only for the control of energy flows, but also for the spread of energy demand for tunnels. The model can become more exact and optimized if more measurements become available and are added. The model is applied by the company directly for the scaling of energy-­neutral tunnels and can also be applied for future expanding research on energy-­neutral tunnels or other microgrids with the same working principles.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-03-31","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Process and Energy Technology","",""

The focus of this thesis is on the digital transformation within the de Volkskrant organisation and was commissioned by DPG Media, de Volkskrant’s parent company. <br/>Since the digital transformation started, de Volkskrant has been struggling to keep up with technological developments. Partly because they rely on DPG Media to facilitate the infrastructure of their digital products, but within the de Volkskrant organisation, there is a lack of vision on what de Volkskrant should be as a digital medium. Therefore, this thesis explores the possibilities and challenges de Volkskrant currently faces and how the context, readers and organisation all play a role in that.<br/>I used two methods; Human-Centred Design(UCD) and Design-Based Research (DBR). From this research, I concluded that the service that should be designed for de Volkskrant should be a mobile application. The interaction vision for this mobile application is the following: The mobile app guides the de Volkskrant reader through the articles and archives of de Volkskrant. It supports them in learning new things and exploring new perspectives. After reading digital news, readers feel in control, empowered, and accomplished. Additionally, some advice to the de Volkskrant organization was developed: By becoming a digital-first organisation, de Volkskrant can accelerate its digital transformation. It should play to its strengths of being a brand that readers go to for its good analytical articles and columnists. Additionally, it should use the development of its digital products as opportunities for change by involving all levels of the organisation into the design process. Thus, the result of this thesis is a proposal for a mobile app design as well as advice for the de Volkskrant organisation on how to accelerate the transition to a digital-first mindset and utilise the design process along the way to incite change within the company. To summarise, de Volkskrant should implement features into the mobile implication such as Dossiers, that bundle articles, and Overview, which provide a visual overview of articles, to not only create a better reading experience but to increase collaboration between departments as well. <br","Digital Transformation; human-centred design; design based research; Communication Design; Interaction Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction | Science Communication","",""

It is looking for solutions that extend data interactions to the field of behavioral change while taking both energy use and people’s comfort into account. <br/>This graduation project explores how to communicate information related to indoor climate and energy to motivate secondary school students to save energy through social dynamics at school. The final design of this project is a digital application that promotes sustainable behavior among students. <br/>In the exploration phase of the project, extensive user research including co-design sessions with users and literature review into the topic of social dynamics between students and their attitudes towards sustainability helped to understand users comprehensively. It revealed most students don’t have the motivation to contribute to energy conservation for the school. Yet, there is intensive social interaction within student cliques which is a potential means to motivate students to engage with sustainability. Further research through context study of the technical infrastructure and literature review into indoor climate science and its relationship with users narrowed down the solution space for the next defining phase. Based on the exploration, the design goal was defined and followed by the iteration phase. A series of design prototypes, based on the information communication method, was created and tested with the participants to inform the final design. <br/>The final concept PROMOTIVATE is an interactive application that motivates secondary school students to act on sustainable actions in the school context. It features group-based competitions, sustainable actions, and information related to indoor climate and energy. The application enables students to take action and contribute to sustainability at school through teamwork in a competitive manner. <br/>A clickable application was evaluated with participants using qualitative methods of observation and interviews, and quantitative methods of survey. It is experienced as motivating and encouraging for participants with an easy-to-use interaction. Participants were motivated and encouraged by diverse features of the final concept. The practical information provided in the application related to detailed descriptions of the energy-saving actions was clear for participants. They also motivated each other in the group. <br/>The design research and practice conducted in this project prove that social dynamics can play a big role in engaging users with the topic of energy conservation. Furthermore, it showed that the information on indoor climate and energy can be used to evoke motivation and confidence, which offers interesting directions for future work. To be more specific, the research suggests the potential for further development of the functioning system that links to the energy use data and the indoor climate data in ENERGE data dashboard to make sustainable actions more down-to-earth.","Social dynamics; Interaction design; Sustainable behavior change; co-design; Research through Design; Secondary School; energy conservation; Sustainability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Y. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Designing and modeling compatibilized polymer blends require accurate interface model. In addition, it is possible that crazing occurs during failure of the interfaces leading to large deformation prior to complete failure and therefore must be accounted for by the interface model.<br/><br/>A preliminary literature review showed that existing formulations for the large<br/>deformation account for the nonlinearity by adjusting the assumptions. For example, Van den Bosch et al. (2007) proposed redefining the local basis at each integration point. In contrast, Reinoso and Paggi (2014) argued that this did not account for geometric nonlinearity and proposed including the first derivative of rotation vector in the finite element equation. However, the mixed-mode responses of the models were not characterized and validated thoroughly. Therefore, we studied the response from standardized mixed-mode tests to compare the large displacement formulation with the commonly used small-displacement formulation of the cohesive zone model.<br/><br/>The standardized tests used by Moreira et al. (2020) for characterizing the mixed-mode behavior of ductile interfaces inspired the tests used in this study. When implemented with the BK criteria, the mode partitioning method used by Moreira et al. (2020) results in a wider spread of the mean predicted mode ratio and the mean predicted fracture toughness. However, the corresponding mode ratio predictions are similar when the predicted fracture toughness is close to expected. Therefore, while the power-law is better for implementing the mode partitioning method, we can use the predictions from the mode partitioning method implemented with the power-law to find the BK parameter.<br/> <br/>Further, simulating the mixed-mode fracture tests with properties presented by<br/>Moreira et al. (2020) showed that bulk materials with high modulus or stiffness, such as carbon fiber reinforced plastics, do not undergo nonlinear deformation to require the large deformation formulation. However, for bulk materials with lower modulus or stiffness, the responses of the two formulations in question are different. Additionally, for a given load case, a cohesive zone with anisotropic fracture properties experiences a different mode ratio when implemented with the large displacement formulation than the small displacement formulation. Moreover, more significant influence of the stronger mode on the load case results in greater difference between the mode ratio experienced at the interface. Nevertheless, the large displacement formulation is also applicable for stronger mode-II interfaces. However, a further investigation involving physical experiments is required to compare the response of the two formulations to the behavior of real material systems.","Cohesive Zone Modeling; Finite Element Method; ABAQUS; Polymer Interface; Crazing; Large Deformation; User Element (UEL) Subroutine; Standarized tests; Mixed-mode Characterization; Interface Characterization; Mode Partitioning Method; czmtestkit","en","master thesis","","","","","","ISBN 978-94-6366-528-5 https://pypi.org/project/czmtestkit/ Python Package Index for czmtestkit developed for the project https://czmtestkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html Documentation for the PyPI package named czmtestkit","","","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","VENI",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The coastal zone is becoming more vulnerable due to growing concentrations of human population, settlements, and socio-economic activities. The Rhine-Meuse Delta is low-lying land, which makes it vulnerable to flooding. The Maeslant barrier is a storm surge barrier which should prevent flooding in the low-lying land behind the barrier. Various climate models have predicted that sea level rise will occur. The predicted sea level rise is more than what was anticipated during the design stage of the Maeslant barrier. Due to the increasing water levels, the closing frequency of the barrier will increase. This has a negative effect on the reliability of the barrier, as the components are used more often. The Maeslant barrier also needs to discharge river water during a storm closure when the water level on the rear side of the barrier becomes too high due to river inflow. This discharging process is a complex process which contributes greatly to the failure probability of certain components. <br/><br/>Delta21 is a spatial plan to redevelop a part of the Dutch delta to mitigate the effects of climate change which are sea level rise and increased river discharges. Delta21 claims to improve the safety of the entire Rhine-Meuse delta till a sea level rise of 1.1 m. Delta21 pleads for a central approach to focus on improving pump capacity in the main water systems instead of raising and strengthening all the dikes. The main goal of Delta21 is to reduce the flood risk in the downstream area. Due to the large pump capacity available, Delta21 can replace the discharging function from the Maeslant barrier. This simplifies the closure operation of the Maeslant barrier to only retain seawater during storms on the North Sea. The effect of the simplified closure operation has consequences on the reliability of the Maeslant barrier. <br/><br/>Therefore, the main objective of this master thesis is to find out how the failure probability of closure of the Maeslant barrier with the simplified closure operation changes in the Delta21 configuration.<br/><br/>To fulfil the objective, the first step was to find out how the Maeslant barrier itself works and how the discharging procedure impacts the failure probability of closure. Then, a hydraulic system analysis was done to understand how Delta21 impacts the current configuration of the Rhine-Meuse delta. In the next step, the new situation with Delta21 was schematized into a simple hydraulic model which has been verified and validated. <br/>By making the variables in this model probabilistic, a Monte Carlo simulation was done to find out what the probability of a negative head difference larger than 1.5 m was. The simulation was done for the situation without and with 0.6 m sea level rise. <br/>The next step was the failure probability analysis. In the qualitative analysis of the failure probability analysis, different failure mechanisms and failure scenarios are identified for the Maeslant barrier in the current situation, and for the Maeslant barrier in the Delta21 configuration. In the quantitative analysis, the probabilities for the defined failure mechanisms and failure scenarios are calculated according to the upper bound approximation, for the current situation and with Delta21. The probability which was calculated with the Monte Carlo simulation is also used here. Ultimately, a fault tree can be composed on the basis of the qualitative and quantitative analysis for the Maeslant barrier in the current situation and the Delta21 configuration.<br/><br/>The failure probability of closure has been reduced by a maximum of approximately 10%. This is because many systems and operations were simplified because of the simplified closure operation. <br/>Additionally, the failure probability analysis also provided insight in how the probability of flooding changed for Rotterdam with the Maeslant barrier in the Delta21 configuration. While the failure probability of closure was reduced by a maximum of 10% with Delta21, the probability of flooding for Rotterdam has increased by 53% when using the full pump capacity from Delta21. This increase is not significant since the probability of flooding remains very small. Due to the removal of the discharging function with Delta21, the probability of several flooding scenarios increased drastically which resulted in the increase in the probability of flooding for Rotterdam.<br/>With a sea level rise of 0.6 m, the probability of flooding increased approximately 500% for the current situation (without Delta21). When comparing Delta21 with no sea level rise to Delta21 with 0.6 m sea level rise, the increase was also present with approximately 375%. This is less than 500%, which indicates that Delta21 is effective to mitigate the effects of sea level rise compared to the situation without Delta21.<br","Maeslant Barrier; failure probability; Reliability; hydraulic model; DELTA21; Rijkswaterstaat; Flooding; Fault Tree; Event Tree; Storm surge barrier","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

However in order for them to stay a global leader Vanderlande and keep the innovation standard high, they started developing a set of design roadmapping workshops called The Long Now (TLN) project The TLN is a project that developed a set of design roadmapping workshops, which resulted in a future vision together with a set of new product service concepts for the airports platform. Having the results, the team working on TLN was looking for a way to present them to the board of Vanderlande. But therefore the results of these roadmapping workshops had to be made more tangible. And this graduation project aims to develop a smart design strategy roadmap, which has the ability to internally align Vanderlande Industries with the long now (TLN) project. <br/><br/>In order to come to the right design strategy method I first performed research in three directions: Research on Vanderlande and the way operating within the company, research on design roadmapping and finally research on smart roadmapping. <br/><br/>Having performed this research I came to the conclusion that there had to be made an interactive platform which displays the results and needs to be adjustable, accessible and connectable. Knowing this I developed a design strategy method based on website design and user experience containing six steps. <br/><br/>The six steps went as followed: first user classification in which you determine the end-user. Second, user class description in which you find the user needs. Thirdly comes the object modelling of the scope, looking at the content and functional requirements of the smart design roadmap. The fourth step includes the object modelling of the structure. Fifth is navigational design, aiming at the way you can walkthrough the roadmap and finally was implementation design. This is where you created the actual look and feel of the smart design roadmap. <br/><br/>After performing these 5 steps it was still an iterative proces in which I co-designed the smart design roadmap with multiple people before I came to my final design. <br/><br/>But when I came to my final design, I was able to conclude that when performing the six steps of the design strategy I was able to develop a smart design roadmap that internally aligned Vanderlande with TLN and it became a lot more tangible due to supportive technologies, new partnerships and well visualised solution development. <br/><br/>I do still recommend however to validate both the results from the TLN workshops as well as the smart design roadmap with more people within Vanderlande as this currently only has been done by the team working on TLN.","Design Roadmap; lean development; iterative","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Vibratory installation of piles and casings can be extremely economical, therefore the contractors prefer pile driving. When compared to impact pile driving, vibratory pile driving generates less noise but this installation method is still fraught with uncertainties (Rausche 2003). Environmental effects (such as ground vibrations) have negative impacts which could lead to damage and failure under special circumstances.<br/><br/>The vibrations from the pile driving generate excess pore pressures and cause settles leading to failure in slopes. As part of the optimisation of mooring places for inland shipping and small coasters in Calandkanaal, the port of Rotterdam authority had a number of mooring places modified in the second half of 2016. A point of attention was the lack of analysis and a testing framework as there were uncertainties in excess pore pressure generation, an exposed area in the slope and slope stability. Based on these uncertainties, the work presented in this report tries to bridge this gap by answering<br/>the following research question:<br/><br/>How can the existing knowledge on pile driving by means of vibratory installation be efficiently integrated into a 3D model which can practically estimate the factor of safety of the slope during vibratory installations?<br/><br/>To answer the main research question, a few sub-questions were formed, which are as follows:<br/><br/>• How can the vibratory parameters be integrated to model the slope stability?<br/>• What is the thickness of the highly degraded zone around the pile due to vibratory pile driving?<br/>• What are the limitations of the study?<br/><br/>The proposed work uses the vibratory pile driving data to generate excess pore pressure data using an empirical pore pressure model given by Green &amp; Mitchell (2004) referred here as the GMP pore pressure model. Along with the pore pressures by using an empirical attenuation relation, the extent of the liquefied zone was determined giving an idea about the area of the slope affected by pile driving.<br/><br/>For slope stability, PLAXIS 3D is used along with its flow module. PLAXIS 3D gives an idea of the expected displacements in the geometry (slope) and the factor of safety. In a way to incorporate vibration effects, only the pore pressure are used as load inputs because of the difficulty of inducing<br/>pile driving vibrations in a static calculation.<br/><br/>To add pore pressures into the geometry, a well was used with the infiltration function for the amount of time the pile was driven in the actual project. The volume input for the well infiltration is calculated in the same way as it was done in the actual project shown in the work of de Nijs (2019). PLAXIS 2D and D-geo stability software packages are also used in an attempt to make comparisons with the PLAXIS 3D model and validate the whole analysis.","PLAXIS 3D; Slope stability; factor of safety","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

This will help drivers get gradually used to ADS, eventually transitioning to fully autonomous driving in the distant future. There are more vehicles on road now equipped with lane-keeping systems and other driver assistance systems due to the added benefit of safety. One such Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) feature is the lane-keeping system which has plenty of performance evaluation research being done on it but lacks research from an Operational Design Domain (ODD) perspective in simulation. ODD is the set of conditions for which the vehicle is designed to function. There are many ODD taxonomies present in academic literature for the classification of ODD attributes in the ODD definition. These are recommended to be used by Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) to classify their ODD definition of the system for effective comparison between the same ADAS feature offered by two different OEMs. However, this is not seen to be done by the OEMs and causes a disparity between the ODD definitions, leading to misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the defined ODD. The OEMs do not exactly specify the ODD boundaries in publicly available instruction manuals of the vehicles. The conditions where the system cannot function properly are very vaguely mentioned. Furthermore, the different OEMs provides the same ADAS feature with different names with differently defined ODD boundaries. Bringing these ODD definitions of all these OEMs under one umbrella is currently being attempted by policymakers and regulatory organisations. A standard way of testing the impact of the different ODD attributes on the performance of a lane-keeping system is still absent. Therefore, this research aims to provide a method to assess the ODD boundaries of a lane-keeping system using the simulation software Prescan by Siemens and is intended to be used by researchers, policymakers and OEMs to refine the ODD and to test the effect of the ODD attributes on the performance of the system. It was found in this research that there is a strong interdependency between the tested ODD attributes. This can lead to a possibility that the ODD definition may not exactly be a straightforward set of specific values in the form of a table, but instead can be dynamic considering this interdependency. It was also observed that some test cases classified inside ODD from the initial ODD assessment had poor lane-keeping performance and some test cases classified outside ODD had good lane-keeping performance. Another observation from the test cases was the ability of the test vehicle to move at higher speeds in narrow lane widths with good lane-keeping performance compared to wider lane widths. This falls in line with findings from previous literature and will require validation. The research approach of this study is used to develop a conceptual framework to assess the ODD boundaries of an ADAS feature in a simulation environment.","Autonomous vehicles; Operational design domain; Lane Keeping Assistance; Simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Glass is a fascinating material that has also been used as a primary construction material in various remarkable buildings since the last century. Unfortunately, a lot of carbon dioxide is released during the production of glass because of the extreme heat required. The construction industry accounts for ten per cent of global CO2 emissions. If a focus in this sector is put on recycling, reducing and reusing, emissions can be drastically reduced because of less needed new building material. However, structural glass is currently hardly reused. A second challenge arises with existing demountable structures made of glass like the LocHal: these are not weatherproof, thus unsuitable as sheltered accommodation.<br/><br/>In response to the absence of adequate standardised structural glass building systems, this research project proposes a preliminary design for a modular, transportable art pavilion with an appropriate structural verification. The research question is therefore: ’How can glass be applied as load‐bearing material in temporary modular building units to realise easy‐to‐ (dis)assemble, transparent and transportable structures?’.<br/><br/>A case‐study is introduced to find an answer to the main research question. The fictive scenario is sketched to design a temporary art pavilion which stands for one to three months in a city centre in the Netherlands. After this period, the pavilion should be demounted and transported to the next destination. The information described here determines the boundary conditions for the design and calculations. The imaginary pavilion is 24 m in length, 10 m in width and 2.5 m in height. The inner walls in the pavilion are retained to create a natural walking path inside. On the short side of the pavilion, doors are inserted as an entrance and an exit. From the available literature, the transportability of the building elements and the requirement for thermal insulation appear to be important preconditions for the final design.<br/><br/>The design is based on four different types of prefabricated building elements: roof panels, wall panels, floor panels and base profiles. The roof panels are of 220 mm thick cross‐laminated timber (CLT), in length six or three metres and have a width of 2.5 m. The wall panels are of laminated glass, 2.5 m in height and come in two types. Insulated glass units (IGU’s) of 6 or 5 m long function as exterior walls. These consist of an outer sheet of 10 mm fully tempered glass, a 15 mm cavity of 90% argon gas and a triple laminated inner panel of 5.10.5 mm heat‐strengthened glass. The inner walls are of a composition of 5.10.5 mm heat‐strengthened glass. The glass is laminated with a SentryGlas® interlayer of 1.52 mm. CLT is also used for the floor panels, now with a thickness of 210 mm and lengths of 6 and 3 m. The base is defined by steel ’cap’ (RHSFB, lengths of 6 and 5 m) and ’hat’ (THQ, length of 4.25 m) profiles. Both profiles are 265 mm in height.<br/><br/>Roof connections, wall connections and base connections were designed and dimensioned, in total seven different types. The most innovative and structurally interesting joints are two wall connections. These connections consist of a so‐called ’coffee‐ cup‐hand’ system; titanium elements laminated 30 mm into the middle sheet of the wall panels. The wall panels are checked on maximum deflection and tensile stress, as well as the local tensile stress in the glass and in the SentryGlas® interlayer around the laminated titanium elements. All checks comply with the maximum allowable values described in the Eurocodes and in literature.<br/><br/>The conclusion is that the proposed design, with some enhancements to be made, satisfies the structural‐, building physics‐ and practical requirements as a transportable and a relative transparent building system for structural glass. With this building system, glass can be integrated as a load‐bearing material for designs of temporary structures.<br/><br/>Engineers who wish to apply this building system in practice are advised to first enhance the roof connections. For transportation means, the grid‐measurements should be decreased by 8% to fit the components in a regular container. For practice, it is also advised to deal with factors such as installations and drainage systems, which were not included in this study. Follow‐up research could focus on the adaptability of the building system when the building is used with a more permanent function. In addition, it is mechanically interesting to further investigate how the wall connections interact with each other in a 3D analysis and lab experiments.","structural glass; building engineering; civil engineering; modular construction; demountable construction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

These extraordinary properties make graphene a suitable material for applications like mechanical reinforcements, protective coatings, supercapacitors, sensors, etc. However, when trying to extract these properties experimentally, the challenge of producing pristine graphene prohibits researchers from attaining the required results. The challenge is primarily due to the formation of structural or surface imperfections during the fabrication, transfer or manipulation of the membrane. In addition, graphene possesses a low bending rigidity which inevitably leads to the out-of-plane crumpling of the film. So, determining the effect of these imperfections on the mechanics of graphene is critical to ensure development in the research field and application pertaining to graphene. The main focal point of this work is to experimentally determine the effects of surface corrugations, in the form of out-of-plane crumples, on the mechanical constants of the graphene membrane. In this study, two types of graphene membranes are considered, one is a flat membrane, and the other is a heavily crumpled membrane. The atomic force microscope is used to probe the membranes, and the mechanical constants are extracted from the resulting force deflection characteristics. The mechanical constants of the flat membrane, 2D Young’s modulus (E2D) and pretension (σ0) were found to be 140.42 ± 44.52 N/m and 0.119 ± 0.049 N/m respectively. The values obtained suggest a softening behaviour of the membranes, which is due to the intrinsic crumpling of the membrane in the out-of-plane direction. Surprisingly, in the case of heavily crumpled membranes, E2D and σ0 were found to be 393.34 ± 145.12 N/m and 0.203 ± 0.069 N/m respectively. The values obtained suggests that the heavily crumpled membranes provide greater resistance to deflection than the flat samples. However, it is essential to understand that the values do not depict the effective Young’s modulus or intrinsic strength of the membrane. The presence of folds in the heavily crumpled membranes is the reason for their higher resistance to deflection. The evolution of these folds, when subjected to nanoindentation, is also discussed in this work. This research helps provide insights into how the graphene membrane responds mechanically in the presence of crumples and also provides progress in realising the applications of crumpled graphene membranes.","Crumpled Graphene; Atomic force Microscope; 2D Young's Modulus; Pretension","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-03-30","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Dynamics of Micro and Nano Systems","",""

Attempts have been made to design emotion recognition systems for everyday settings. The ubiquitous nature of Intelligent voice assistants (IVAs) in households, make them a great anchor for the introduction of emotion recognition technology to consumers. The existing systems lack such pipelines and rely on dictionary-based architectures in their design. Further, these systems lack conversational properties and are merely an extension of information retrieval engines.<br/><br/>In this setting, we propose to introduce and develop emotion recognition pipelines that are suited to the interactions, common with these IVAs. To augment the existing emotion recognition pipelines which rely on audio information, we look at physiological information derived from wearables. Our proposed model uses multimodal embeddings with a Siamese Network to achieve the task of emotion recognition from a few samples. Physiological signals of blood volume pulse (BVP) and electrodermal activity (EDA) are used as additional input embeddings to two audio embeddings arising from the speech samples. We employ the state-of-the-art training schedules for Siamese Networks, which use a very limited amount of training on support datasets via sample pair comparisons. The performance of the model is evaluated using weighted binary accuracy and f1 scores.<br/><br/>The proposed model is applied on two datasets that denote two unique experimental settings - the K-EmoCon dataset and RECOLA dataset. We demonstrate an improvement in the state-of-the-art accuracy with the K-EmoCon dataset with accuracies of 63.97% and 66.91% on arousal and valence dimensions respectively. Further, on the RECOLA dataset, the model performs moderately well with 53.81% and 53.87% respectively for arousal and valence dimensions. In addition to this, we present a study of the effects of variation of available support set for training from the dataset. We make some salient observations for these experiments across individual participants and also identify how the label distributions affect the performance of the model. Further, we investigate the impact of real-world noise samples from the DEMAND dataset on the two datasets. We observe that the proposed model is robust and performs sustainingly well even in the presence of imputed noise. <br","Emotion Classification; Audio Classification; Deep Learning; few shot learning; Mel Spectrogram; Chatbot; Wearable Technology; Voice Assistants","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

Through a T-shaped case study (e.g. a multiple case study with one case worked out in-depth), current barriers in adoption are uncovered. These are then integrated into an actionable framework that can be used by organizations implementing medical technologies in SSA to uncover barriers applicable to them, as well as proposed mitigating strategies to overcome these barriers. Themes included affecting adoption in this thesis are: maintenance, training, organizational and behavioral change. Barriers discovered can be divided into three categories. The first being resource-barriers, covering time, money, human and materials. Secondly, institutional barriers, covering policy, trust and the need for breaking habits. The last barrier category covers communication between client and organization. The framework offers the possibility to find applicable barriers based upon characteristics of an implementation situation. The implementation situation herein is medical equipment (ME) being implemented by an organization (O) into a client organization (CO).

This thesis explores the impact from traditional to renewable district heating (DH) on the Dutch electricity and heating sector, at both a national and regional level. The results provide relevant lessons for policy-makers and project developers regarding the realization of DH projects and the electricity and heat transition overall. The main research question is answered: <i>What is the impact of the transition from traditional to renewable district heating on the Dutch electricity and heating sector?</i><br/><br/>Both qualitative and quantitative methods are applied within this exploratory research. On the national level, future trends within the electricity and heating sector are analyzed using scenario analysis and energy flow analysis (EFA). On the regional level, regional energy plans are analyzed in order to determine how the trends are substantiated within the region North-Holland South. This case study includes a stakeholder analysis, interviews with involved actors and an EFA. <br/><br/>The results show that there is uncertainty regarding the realization of the national heat and DH transition. The national transition to renewable DH does not always seem to make sense alongside the strong expectations of a fully renewable electricity supply. Nonetheless, within the region North-Holland South, renewable DH is expected to be one the main heating alternatives. The transition to renewable DH can partly substitute the current natural gas-based heat supply and provide some relief for the electricity sector, when renewable high- and/or low-temperature DH sources are available. However, local renewable DH sources are still uncertain.<br/><br/>The desirability of the shift to renewable DH depends on the regional context. Important factors are energy source availability and the decision-making by municipalities. In the region North-Holland South, uncertainty regarding the source availability of the planned renewable heating alternatives results in risks. The implementation of renewable DH can contribute to spreading these risks, and can provide some relief for the electricity sector, as a significant electrification is expected. However, spreading the risks does naturally not remove these risks. Municipalities in the region North-Holland South lack experience regarding the local heat transition. This can lead to ineffective decision-making, resulting in misaligned local initiatives and malfunctioning infrastructural and heat source lock-ins. <br/><br/>To steer the heat transition, concrete choices regarding renewable heating sources and synergies between electricity and heat must be made and effective legal and regulatory frameworks are urgently required. Therefore, municipalities are strongly advised to collect new knowledge, expertise and competences and assertively collaborate with provinces, energy producers and grid operators. It is particularly important to be aware of the risks and stimulate the development of renewable heat sources and heat storage. Implementing these recommendations within the region North-Holland South and possibly within other energy regions contributes to the realization of the national heat transition and therefore a future low carbon Dutch energy system. <br","District heating; Renewable heat sources; Energy system design; Integrated energy system; Scenario analysis; Case study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Under structural assumptions on the underlying Kendall’s tau and conditional Kendall’s tau matrices, we introduce new estimators that have a significantly reduced computational cost while keeping a similar error level. In the unconditional setting we assume that, up to reordering, the underlying Kendall’s tau matrix is block-structured with constant values in each of the off-diagonal blocks. The estimators take advantage of this block structure by averaging over (part of) the pairwise estimates in each of the off-diagonal blocks. Derived explicit variance expressions show their improved efficiency. In the conditional setting, the conditional Kendall’s tau matrix is assumed to have a constant block structure, independently of the conditioning variable. Conditional Kendall’s tau matrix estimators are constructed similarly as in the unconditional case by averaging over (part of) the pairwise conditional Kendall’s tau estimators. We establish their joint asymptotic normality, and show that the asymptotic variance is reduced compared to the naive estimators. Then, we perform a simulation study which displays the improved performance of both the unconditional and conditional estimators.

This paper presents an intuitive visual interface that allows operators to simultaneously control a 6DOF camera platform and a robotic manipulator whilst experiencing the remote environment through a virtual reality head-mounted-display (VR-HMD). The proposed system, Orbital Head-Mounted Display (OHMD), utilizes head rotation tracking to command camera movement in azimuth and elevation directions around a fixation point located at a robot's end-effector. A human factor study was conducted to compare the interface acceptance, perceived workload, and task performance of OHMD with a conventional interface utilizing multiple fixed cameras (Array) and a standard head-mounted display implementation (HMD). Results show that both the OHMD and HMD interfaces significantly improve task performance, reduce perceived workload and increase interface acceptance compared to the Array interface. Whilst orbital head-mounted display excelled in usefulness, the standard HMD interface allowed operators to perform robotic welding tasks significantly faster. Still participants reported they preferred OHMD due to the increased assistance and freedom in viewpoint selection.","Teleoperation; head mounted display; Visual feedback; Virtual reality","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

This is known as the classic influence maximization problem.

Furthermore, the unequal seeding disperse algorithm (USD), equal seeding disperse algorithm(ESD) and origin seeding disperse algorithm(OSD) have been developed to improve the influence maximization in temporal social network. The purpose is to find the most cost-effective user seed-set in any given period of time to maximize the influence of target users and increase the number of influenced users. According to the experimental test result, it is found that unequal seeding disperse algorithm perform better than the other two algorithms. In this paper, many experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness of all the three algorithms using real social network data sets.

Central themes in thesis are reusability, parametric modelling and generative design. <br/><br/>The construction sector is responsible for a large amount of pollution due to its high energy consumption during extraction and transportation of raw materials. Paradoxically, this offers the construction sector a unique opportunity to notably decrease its negative environmental impact. More and more industrial halls are built due to an increase in online shopping and the subsequent need for the distribution of consumer goods. However, the current inefficiency in shadow cost reductions of main load bearing elements presents a problem for the decrease in harmful emissions as a consequence of construction.<br/><br/>Shadow costs associated with structural elements decrease as a result of reuse. Connection types have been identified as the most influential factor for reusability. Therefore, a connection reusability factor was developed which was given according to four material independent criteria. Subsequently, a corrected shadow cost (CSC) can be calculated by multiplication of this reusability factor with the original ECI. However, this method is experimental and is not sufficiently corroborated by relevant literature yet.<br/><br/>A parametric model of an industrial hall was constructed in Dynamo which could be optimized using a genetic algorithm in Autodesk generative design in order to minimize the shadow costs of the design. No biogenic carbon storage was accounted for during these optimizations and only single span hinged construction elements were assessed. Furthermore, all designs were assumed to be located in a rural part of Dutch wind zone II and no fire protection measures were accounted for in the ECI or price of the designs.<br/><br/>Based on these assumptions, several conclusions could be drawn from the optimization of an arbitrary hall and two case studies. For the boundary conditions that were selected for the arbitrary hall, steel elements performed best with regard to the total ECI value as well as the corrected shadow costs. Contrary to popular belief, timber elements performed best in terms of price. A combination of both materials therefore has a high probability of resulting in the most cost effective ECI optimization. The results from the first case study indicate that the ECI of an existing hall could be reduced by 16 % as a result of the optimization methodology as presented in this thesis. The second case study was not accurately comparable enough to the optimized hall as a result of large differences in the connection types that were used.<br/><br/>The results that are presented in this thesis are based on specific loads, connection types and boundary conditions and configuration of the halls. The conclusions that are drawn in this thesis are therefore only valid in case similar halls with similar boundary and load conditions are assessed.<br","Parametric Design; Generative Design; Shadowcosts; Environmental impact; Reusability; industrial halls; Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

Nevertheless, this trend towards the use of cloud-based email services brings societal implications for the sovereignty of European data. Email services hosted with foreign cloud service providers can be susceptible to surveillance by foreign governments and intelligence agencies, which violates privacy of European individuals. The attack space further includes invasion with political and monetary incentives that may also impact security, as data is hosted with cloud service providers who might have weak security protocols. We measured the level of cloud adoption for seven crucial sectors in Europe: executive governments, healthcare, SME’s, higher educational institutes, NGO’s and financial services. We have conducted a DNS analysis on MX records from a Farsight (SIE) dataset to measure the prevalence of cloud service providers. The results revealed the prevalence of extremely dominant cloud service providers, Microsoft and Google in Europe. The dominant position obtained by these providers means that two aspects in governance of this socio-technical system in Europe must be attended to if Europe wants to regain control over their data and infrastructures: (1) European regulation focus needs to shift and (2) awareness must be raised at managerial level in enterprises.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-03-29","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

With mild dementia, people struggle with planning and figuring out the order of the cooking steps. Also, they find it challenging to stay focussed on the tasks at hand. Furthermore, their short-term memory causes them to struggle to remember instructions and which steps they have already done. <br/>However, cooking has immense benefits, such as giving a person a sense of autonomy, respect, and purpose and helping bring people closer together. Furthermore, cooking trains cognitive and motoric skills, which allow people with dementia to retain their skills for as long as possible. Currently, there exist recipes designed for people with cognitive impairment, but they do not meet the needs and desires of each individual. In contrast, occupational therapists create individual step-by-step plans, but these require much time and insight. Therefore, this thesis aims to help guide people with mild dementia through a cooking activity at home or at dementia meeting centres in collaboration with other clients or caregivers in a scalable yet personalised way. <br/>Through an iterative approach with extensive involvement of the target group, a new recipe format was developed that suits the needs of people with dementia. The paper recipes use visual elements combined with textual descriptions to optimise understanding and following the recipe. Users navigate through the steps using a pawn to remember which step they are working on, and others can keep track of their progress. Caregivers are best aware of the person with dementia’s instructional needs, cooking habits, and food preferences. Thus, our application Happje enables caregivers to write recipes themselves by writing the steps in a way that suits their client. Happje automatically adds corresponding icons, puts the steps in the correct layout, and helps with exporting or printing the recipe. <br/>The recipe format was evaluated with the intended target group, context, and activity to see whether it helped achieve the design goal. Clients quickly understood the steps through the recipe’s visuals, layout, and step formulation. However, navigating through the steps was more challenging as clients forgot to move the pawn consistently. The collaborative cooking activity was greatly enjoyed by participants and well suited for both families at home and friends at meeting centres. Most (but not all) caregivers appeared capable and motivated to write the recipes. <br/>We recommend improving the navigation of the recipe by redesigning the pawn and adding a digital recipe mode to Happje. We suggest further developing Happje and testing its usability with the target group. Further studies could evaluate how practicing with the recipes could improve following the recipes, collaboration, and trust between caregivers and PwDs.","Dementia; Cooking; design; iterative; evaluation; guiding; recipe","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The \ga showed a larger change in gaze behavior between the before and after training tests, accompanied by a reduction in flight performance. Detection task performance was comparable for both groups. The gaze director thus seemed to distract participants from the tasks.

In order to learn more about the extent to which these perturbations can be handled, a new experimental setup is required, which can deliver large perturbations to cyclists and bring them to fall. This thesis describes the detailed design and evaluation of such a setup. Several requirements are formulated regarding different experiment aspects that the setup must adhere to. The proposed design consists of a treadmill on which a subject rides a bicycle. Ropes are guided from the ends of the bicycle’s handlebar toward the front and back of the setup, where they are attached to four motor units of a robotic rope-pulling system. Based on a feed-forward conversion added with PI force feedback control, a shared controller commands the motors to maintain a tracking force or perturb the cyclist by applying a net torque on the handlebar for a short time. An active safety harness is the main feature that prevents the subject from harm. Meanwhile, motion capture recordings of strategically placed passive markers and data from inertial measurement units on the bicycle are collected. With appropriate processing, the angles and angular velocities that describe the dynamics and control of the bicycle-rider system can be obtained from these measurements. The force data is also collected, by the controller. Interesting results that can be obtained with this setup include the probabilities to fall after perturbations of variable forces and the data required to evaluate the equations of motions of the bicycle-rider system during and shortly after a perturbation. This can be used to provide a baseline against which future bicycles can be compared and it is useful for validating rider models. The experiment shows consistent performance and generates high quality measurements. Neither the 12 pilot participants nor the 26 subjects who participated in follow-up experiments encountered any safety issues. The experiment could even be improved by resolving issues regarding the motor behaviour and CPU overloads. The workload of the experiment operators could be decreased if intervention of the safety harness was trained on cycling and coupled to deactivation of the treadmill. A next step would be to automate the data processing by developing a classifier that distinguishes recoveries from falls.","Bicycle balance; Perturbation study; Experiment design; Cycling; Safety","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-03-29","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

(mentor); Uijlenhoet, R. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Rain gauges are a powerful tool to measure rain entering a watershed. When water flow through a watershed is modeled, these rainfall measurements are used as inputs. Hydrological models have become increasingly complex as they more accurately represent the physical processes occurring. This is mostly done by increasing the spatial and temporal resolution of the model. As this resolution is increased, the inputs also need to increase. This thesis looks into if rain gauges are in the right place when used as inputs for hydrological models. This has been done by analysing four factors which literature showed to have affect rain gauges. The four considered factors are: the distribution of rain gauges, the steepness of the slope they are on, the location on that slope and their location within a watershed. For each of these factors algorithms have been developed in Python which compute relevant information on a given station. These algorithms have been applied to 368 gauges across the United Kingdom (UK), available from an open data source. The rain gauges are well distributed across different altitudes matching the distribution of heights across the UK. Above 400 m there are no gauges and this area is therefore underrepresented. The spacing of stations is good, a few close together and some isolated gauges on islands. The steepness of slopes varies strongly, when a steepness of 25% is used as a threshold only around 3% are on too steep of a slope. A fair amount of gauges are on ridges. Especially those near the coast have steep seaward slopes and thus will suffer from underestimating the actual rainfall. Within watersheds gauges are often near rivers causing other areas of the watershed to be underrepresented, especially areas of higher elevation. In future research it is recommended to use more gauges in the data set. Secondly focusing on a baseline comparison can help identify which stations are placed incorrectly. Lastly it is recommended to vary the resolution of elevation data and the spatial area considered, focusing on watersheds.","Rain gauge; GIS; Spatial analysis","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","GitHub containing used code - https://github.com/Daafip/Are-rain-gauges-in-the-right-place","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

When the weight deviates from the initial estimations, it would predominantly lead to unwanted changes in speed and stability.<br/>The objective is to research a standardized way of estimating the weight of a superyacht in different stages of the project, including validating the current, improved, and new methods and combining this in a single tool. In the design phase, at the beginning of the project, most weight items or groups are based on comparisons with another yacht. Currently, this is done based on a single ship similar to the new design. Still, a significant improvement will be to compare the new design with multiple yachts, with the possibility for the designer to choose the comparison vessels.<br/>The margins can also be researched. Currently, only the starting margin and the production margin at the end are set, but not in between. A guideline should be provided to indicate what margin is expected during each project stage. Also, the complexity level can influence the expected margin, which can all be placed in a table for a clear overview.<br/>The center of gravity estimation of the items is done similarly to the weights. The weight distribution of the yacht is currently not included in the weight estimations, but it will be included in the new weight estimation tool. To achieve this, besides the CoG, the length of the items also needs to be noted for the longitudinal weight distribution. With this information, distribution along the ship in the length direction can be calculated per meter. The model can be validated by comparing these early design stage estimation methods with the more detailed estimates at the end of the engineering stage.<br/>Finally, the research question can be answered, concluding the research. The weights and centers of mass of a superyacht can be predicted in the design phase by comparing the new ship to a database of existing yachts. These estimations can indicate the calculations’ completeness and accuracy at the engineering phase. The weight list includes margins based on the project’s stage and complexity. This way, the estimations and calculation accuracy are transparent and explainable. Also, the longitudinal weight distribution is added to complete and track the center of gravity estimations. Both the design and engineering department can present their findings and estimations next to each other, resulting in a clear overview of development during the project.","Superyacht; Lightship; Weight Estimation; Center of gravity; Design; Marine Engineering; Marine Technology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Marine Engineering","",""

(mentor); van Engelen, J.M.L. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","This project is executed in collaboration with Eveon Containers, a young start-up in the online retail of containers, as part of my Master thesis. In consultation with Eveon Containers, I decided to integrate the project and implement the results directly within the current business processes and assignments. The ideas and results solved the current needs and problems within the start-up. The project resulted in a practical solution presented as a vision for the coming eight years and consist of five deliverables that address important future subjects such as sustainability, the changing needs of customers, and market transformation. These deliverables take the form of a research report deconstructing the container market, a trend report looking at the upcoming eight years, a brand strategy to stand out in the market as the leader in container trading, and a roadmap with services and products that re-shape the value of a container. Additionally, I designed a book for the internal branding and culture of the company.<br/><br/>It is an industry-wide, sociopolitical problem that makes improvements in the container market on efficiency and sustainability difficult and slows down the modernisation of the supply chain and shipping process. For example, most ports still use manual and paper-based processes without access to digital technology, creating a polarised environment (Shrives, 2021). For retail, container trading is a traditional, opaque process still using old practices; prices are not published and depend on how much experience you have in trading. Next to that, many parties are involved, between the moment a container is sold by a shipping line and the final purchase by the end-user. A, not at all, modernised process compared to today’s retail and e-commerce. The inefficient process is caused by the lack of knowledge, lack of trust, difference in interests and expectations in the market, and the nature of the maritime industry (Poh Chua, 2021). Other reasons for inefficiencies in the market are caused by a difference in export and import recourses and needs. The result of this is the congestion at ports, the empty movements of containers (Sanders et al., 2021), and the extreme high pick-up fees for new containers in China (Remes &amp; Saxon, 2021).<br/><br/>In the next ten years, significant trends will change how we look at sustainability, technology and digitalisation. The container as we know it today will be less, or even no longer, relevant. First of all, customers - businesses and consumers - expect more from their products regarding connectivity and the experience of purchasing and using a product or service. Therefore, it is unsurprising that the developed products, services, and strategy look beyond the container as a product. In ten years, container retail will be focused on smart containers and the additional services of data analytics and insights. Besides unique features and functionalities, an exceptionally seamless and smooth user experience will make or break a company. The designed 2030 strategy for Eveon is based on these insights.","Container; Container shipping; Strategic Roadmap; Retail; Container retail; Future logistics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The Building with Nature approach has been gaining ground in hydraulic engineering, increasing the importance of understanding the cross-shore morphodynamic processes. The intertidal zone, where marine and aeolian processes come together, is an important link in the transport of sediment from the sea towards the dunes. The grain size distribution affects the sediment supply in the intertidal zone. This research investigates the effect of marine processes on the cross-shore variations of the grain size distribution in the intertidal zone by using a one-dimensional non linear shallow water XBeach model. <br/>The intertidal zone is subject to shoaling, surf and swash zone processes. The grain size influences the beach slope, the initiation of motion and settling to the bed. The cross-shore sediment transport is the combination of sediment that is stirred up from the bed and subsequently transported. Breaking induced turbulence enhances stirring of sediment from the bed and keeps sediment in suspension. The amount of stirring and the transport direction depends on the wave conditions.<br/>Input and control data for the model study was provided by the Scanex 2020 fieldwork campaign at Noordwijk, the Netherlands. The ADV velocity data combined with a pressure signal has been used for the tidal and incoming wave signal. Cross-shore profiles have been determined in Matlab based on terrestrial laser scans. Soil samples of the intertidal zone were taken with a sand scraper and analyzed with a sieve tower. For the initial grain size distribution is the average distribution of 14 samples on a transect was used. Based on wave, wind and soil sampling data a model period from 29-2-2020 02:00 to 10-3-2020 13:00 was selected.<br/>The XBeach model used is as described by Reniers et al. (2013), but with a time-averaged turbulent kinetic energy and a different implementation of the Riemann boundary. The model consisted of a 176 x 3 grid with a grid size of dx=1 m and dy=5 m. For the initial bathymetry the laser scan of 29-2-2020 02:00 was used. The initial grain size was imposed on all the model grid cells. Additional to the standard run, runs have been performed to research the effect of a storm, the model sensitivity and the effect of aeolian transport.<br/>The model shows a pattern of cross-shore grain size variations with coarser sediment from x=20 to x=56 m, finer sediment from x=57 to x=105 m and fluctuating grain size from x=106 to x=136 m compared to the initial grainsize. After 24 h a grain size pattern establishes with a clear deposition of fine sediment on the upper beach. The pattern remained stable for nearly the full model period. After 200 hours the fines become less prominent and move onshore. On the intratidal scale sediment becomes coarser when submerged and finer when emerged, except near the high water line where fine sediment is deposited.<br/>The model reproduced the same pattern of grain size variations over the cross-shore as was found in the soil samples of 10-3-2020. As the cross-shore grain size pattern remained stable during the model period, processes on the spring-neap time scale or storm time scale seem to govern the cross-shore variations of the grain size. For the aeolian transport this would imply that for this model period the fine sediment supply is controlled on the same time scales. Nevertheless, considering that aeolian transport could have resulted in coarsening of the fines in the upper intertidal zone, processes over a single tide, could be more important than was visible in the model result. <br/><br","XBeach NLSW; Intertidal zone; Grain size distribution","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","52.242109, 4.424901"

In line with these developments, the number of electric vehicles requiring access to the electric power grid has exploded putting increased pressure on the grid. One way to decrease the congestion in the grid is to make use of smart charging schedules for electric vehicles, with the objective of reducing peak demand and preventing the overloading of cables and transformers while reducing the cost of charging for electric vehicle owners.<br/><br/>The recent increase in the availability of real-life data has allowed the in-depth study of smart charging dynamics on a large scale through modeling and simulation. Mathematical optimization is a method that is often used to generate smart charging plans in state-of-the-art smart charging applications. However, while mathematical optimization can be very effective, as the objective function expands and more parameters are taken into account, the optimization becomes more complex and therefore require faster and smarter optimization algorithms. In addition, the recent availability of a vast amount of real-life data sets has made efficient data handling more important.<br/><br/>Machine learning is known to be an effective way of introducing Artificial Intelligence to smart charging algorithms. The use of reinforcement learning algorithms, a subset of machine learning could help overcome the disadvantages of mathematical optimization as trained algorithms are generally fast when predicting outcomes and have the potential to be accurate at the same time. <br/><br/>Therefore, the purpose of this work is to research the feasibility and additional benefit of machine learning to mathematical optimization-based smart charging algorithms.

Recently various LiDAR sensors have been developed based on Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) technology. These LiDARs are very low cost and considerably smaller than conventional LiDARs. They also often incorporate other sensors such as Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)s and cameras into the same device. <br/>Performing LiDAR SLAM with MEMS based LiDAR is challenging due to the short range, the smaller Field of View (FOV) and the sensitivity to ambient light of MEMS based LiDAR. In this thesis the objective is to reduce the effect of these factors when doing LiDAR SLAM by incorporating IMU measurements into the position estimation of the sensor.<br/>A graph based positioning approach is proposed to achieve tight coupling of the IMU sensor and LiDAR position estimates. The method is made more robust by incorporating an outlier detection mechanism that reduces the influence of wrong LiDAR position estimates caused by insufficient points in the LiDAR FOV or by ambient light disturbance.<br/>The method was built in ROS and implemented on the Intel ® L515 sensor. The performance is evaluated in indoor situations with varying presence of ambient sunlight and where room size approaches the maximum limit of the sensor range. The algorithm achieves lower drift than the current state of the art for the Intel ® L515. The algorithm especially achieves altitude drift reduction and increases robustness to outliers in the LiDAR positioning.","SLAM; LiDAR; Real time; Solid State LiDAR; Graph Based Estimation; IMU Sensor Fusion; IMU; 3D Modelling; Laser scanning; ROS; Indoor Positioning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Given that blockchain is still in its infancy, there is a current lack of academic literature addressing its governance edge.

In 2014, 46\% of the population of the OECD countries lived in urban areas. Whereas the growth of cities was previously mainly an expansion, the growing population is now increasingly leading to densification. Since 2007, more than half of the constructed houses in the Netherlands has been placed within the existing built area. In the most recent period (2016 to 2018), the share even was 56 per cent. There is a controversy between the individual desire to have a car and the contrasting desire to remove cars from the outdoor space in inner cities. Moreover, land-use policies positively contribute to the environment by managing car use and improving accessibility. Identifying success and failure factors regarding the used strategy and implementation provides feedback to evaluate the strategy. The hub can combine different aspects of mobility, help remove cars from the streets, promote car-sharing and electric vehicles and therefore be an important part of the solution. However, the set-up and implementation of a mobility hub is a complex endeavour where many stakeholders are involved, and sound policy is crucial. In the structured search performed to identify success and failure factors of mobility hubs, an important finding was that the literature is heterogeneous. The gaps found between theory and practice concern the financial feasibility, the incentives for alternative transport, good relationships and clear responsibilities of stakeholders and attention for increasing the utilisation rates of transport modes.

Since then, there has been a quest for alternatives that can be used as corrosion inhibitors for AA2024-T3. <br/><br/>This thesis is aimed at studying these compounds by testing their inhibitive properties. Selecting an inhibitor from a set of compounds and recommending the best one is a crucial process. The research focuses on the screening of these inhibitors through various electrochemical techniques such as Potentiodynamic Polarisation(PDP), Linear Polarisation Resistance(LPR), and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy(EIS). <br/><br/>The electrochemical experiments during the first 24-hour exposure of AA2024-T3 to inhibitors exhibited that 2,5-Dimercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole acts as a corrosion accelerator, while Na-Mercaptoacetate and Mercaptobenzimidazole showed the most inhibitive performance among the tested organic compounds. On monitoring their nature during 24 hours, it was observed that they show stable polarisation resistance values after 6 hours. Among the inorganics, Cerium compounds were seen to have better inhibitive properties than the Lithiumcompounds. Additionally, surface studies such as Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) revealed the presence of thiol/mercaptan and carboxyl groups on samples exposed toNa-Mercaptoacetate. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) showed oxides of Cerium on samples exposed to Cerium Nitrate. Finally, the correlations between the inhibition efficiencies calculated from different electrochemical testing methods were illustrated using Pearson’s correlation method.","corrosion inhibitor; Aerospace aluminium alloy; organic compounds; inorganic compounds; Electrochemistry; surface analysis; Linear polarisation resistance;; Potentiodynamic polarisation;; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; fourier transform infrared spectoscopy; xray photoelectron spectroscopy; inhibitor efficiency; correlation; Time dependency","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-03-29","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Pecnik, R. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The spaceplane vehicle is a promising concept for the future of spaceflight. What makes the spaceplane attractive is the possibility to reuse the transport system for multiple missions. This will lower the costs and satisfies the demands for more frequent transportation to space. For such a vehicle it is necessary to fulfil the flying qualities for a safe, stable and controlled flight. But, this is easier said than done, because the spaceplane vehicle has to endure many different flight conditions. While re-entering the atmosphere, the speeds and therefore the temperatures become so high that the vehicle design has to be devoted to this hypersonic flight phase. This phase results in the distinctive spaceplane design that contains a blunt nosecone and blunt wing leading edges, which detaches the shockwaves and therefore lowers the wall temperatures for materials to withstand. The downside of these design features is that when the operating speeds are lower, the reduced streamlined shape creates instability in the flow, which results in flight instability. This especially occurs in the range of Mach 2.5 until 0.8, what is called the terminal area energy management (TAEM) phase of the re-entry. Improving the flying qualities in this flight phase is important to make sure that the spaceplane is operating safely. This subject is leading to the main research question:<br/><br/>Which HORUS-2B shape modifications can improve the flying qualities in the supersonic till subsonic flow regime of the re-entry trajectory, without exceeding the thermo-mechanical loads of higher flow regimes?<br/><br/>To investigate the flying qualities of a spaceplane, the equations of motion are derived and linearized. These equations contain many input variables including the aerodynamic characteristics of the spaceplane. The linearized equations are converted to a state-space form, which creates the opportunity to derive the eigenmotions of the spaceplane. These eigenmotions are showing the dynamic stability of the spaceplane for certain manoeuvres, among of which the longitudinal short period oscillation, the phugoid and the lateral short period oscillation. For these eigenmodes there are military requirements to make sure that the flight is safe and controllable.<br/><br/>To optimise the shape for these eigenmodes a model is created which is able to generate shapes depending on input parameters which are dimensions of the spaceplane. The generated shape is used in an aerodynamic simulation, that requires a mesh grid around the spaceplane which defines points representing the air, where the flow properties can be determined. To reduce computational time there is looked into the efficiency and accuracy performance of the mesh and computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations. The fluid model and mesh quality combination is optimised to stay within 60 seconds of simulation time for one simulation and resulted into an average deviation of approximately 20\%. The aerodynamic characteristics of each spaceplane are determined by adjusting the attitude or velocity with flow conditions along the reference trajectory. The whole process is automated and driven by the program Matlab which determines the eigenmodes and visualizes the results.<br/><br/>The most unstable eigenmotion is the phugoid manoeuvre, which can be improved by: lowering the fuselage height, increasing the fuselage width, increasing the wing span, enlarging the winglets upwards and make the wingspan larger. Hereby the phugoid motion becomes less unstable with the downside that the longitudinal short period oscillation becomes a little less stable. Overall, the phugoid eigenmode is difficult to make stable with the available parameters and there scopes. The lateral short period oscillation is within the level 3 military requirement and is slightly improved in the supersonic regime as well as in the hypersonic regime. With a more advanced optimising method it is likely that a level 2 requirement will be achieved. The other eigenmodes are negligible small and are mostly stable. The static stability of the yaw moment affected of the side-slip-angle, which is also unstable for the original spaceplane shape, is improved (but still unstable) by the same shape modifications used for improving the eigenmodes. Other smaller modifications such as: the wing thickness or changing the corner of the wing did not influence the results much. <br/><br/>For further research a better optimisation algorithm would increase the performance capabilities of each modification parameter. And more computational capacity would likely increase the accuracy of the aerodynamic characteristics. For a full investigation of the flying qualities, the controllability performance should be investigated, to show the capability to artificially stabilize the spaceplane for a safe and controllable flight back from space. <br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","Double degree in Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering","","2022-02-25","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy, Flow and Process Technology","",""

Stress, tiredness and the perceived pressure of other duties like taking the children to bed were the most common reasons for people to not engage in sexual activity with their partner anymore. Therefore the following design goal was formulated: <br/> “To come up with a viable concept that is meant to allow long-term couples get intimate in a way that does not cause the feeling of pressure that any kind of sexual activity should be a follow up step. The concept focuses on helping couples to relax together mentally as well as physically, to inspire them to explore a new way of intimacy. This should be done by means of a physical product which fits the brand portfolio.”<br/>A context mapping study was conducted with six heterosexual couples in long-term relationships to explore the solution space by answering the question: “What product or activity or a combination thereof can help couples get in the mood for intimate activity, when they are typically not aroused?” The results of the study showed that body massage, in combination with creating an ambience were for a multitude of reasons the most effective elements to achieve this goal. Therefore making and taking time together, creating an ambience and physical touch through massage are the fundaments for the concept: the Ignite. <br/>The Ignite is categorized as a “sense toy” instead of a sex toy. It is a metal couples massager which is able to warm up and vibrate, in combination with a mood light which is integrated in the charging station. Because it is a mood light, the Ignite is continuously visible in the bedroom, in either its discrete (when the massager is hidden inside) or its non-discrete (where the massager is displayed) state. It is meant to inspire couples to take time for explorative physical intimacy, without the pressure of having to have genital focused sex.<br/>The Ignite has been evaluated in multiple ways in terms of desirability, viability and feasibility.<br/>Concluded is that the design goal has been achieved, for as far as the research done within the time frame of this project can tell. Further research should be conducted in order to optimize the concept technically. Mainly the context mapping study, in combination with the participants’ evaluation of the Ignite showed how promising the concept is. Five out of five were positive towards the concept, and all also believed that the Ignite would cause them to integrate massage more in their intimate life because of its constant presence in the bedroom. Therefore the overall conclusion is that the Ignite has a positive influence on the intimate life of people in long-term relationships.<br","long-term relationship; sexual arousal discrepancy; sensual massage; sense toy; sex; Intimacy; couples; intimate exploration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

These food-evoked emotions are predominantly measured by explicit self-reports. Yet in certain situations such as social desirability, explicit measures might not reflect one’s true emotional experience. The additional use of implicit measures can be beneficial.<br/>The present study investigated whether social pressure truly changes food experience by means of explicit and implicit measures of food liking. Explicit ratings were EmojiGrid valence and arousal ratings in response to familiar and unfamiliar food images and soups. Implicit measures consisted of frontal alpha asymmetry during pre-selected scenes of a movie about Japanese soy sauce as well as sip size of the soup. Explicit and implicit measures were compared to assess the effect of social pressure on Japanese and Dutch food liking.<br/>No differences between the social pressure (n = 19) and control group (n = 23) emerged in any of the measures. Explicit ratings and the implicit measure sip size, but not frontal alpha asymmetry during watching the movie, showed differences between participants with high and low food neophobia. The insensitivity of frontal alpha asymmetry to food neophobia groups could be explained by the movie scenes showing rather familiar foods. BMI grouping similarly showed no effect on frontal alpha asymmetry during watching the movie, but also explicit measures were unaffected.<br/>It was concluded that the social pressure intervention itself was not effective in inducing increased liking of Japanese food, since there was no increase in neither reported liking nor ‘true’ liking. Additional ways to induce social pressure, e.g., observation during rating, are advisable if the study was repeated. Furthermore, the use of stronger stimuli to induce approach or avoidance motivation as measured by frontal alpha asymmetry, is recommended. It cannot be concluded whether social pressure truly affects food experience.","frontal alpha asymmetry; social pressure; food experience; EEG; implicit measures; explicit measures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

The NanoCET is a research tool used in hospital and university laboratories, for which the following problem was stated: researchers and technicians working in labs have difficulty setting up and using the NanoCET device and software when conducting a measurement on the size distribution and concentration of nanoparticles. This leads to failed measurements and therefore a waste of time, materials, and samples. As a result of these issues, it is difficult for researchers to trust Dispertech and their NanoCET. The NanoCET faced challenges with its workflow, which is disrupted by going back and forth between the software and the device, with its underdeveloped analysis and measurement software, and missing feedforward and feedback in physical configuration elements like the ‘arena’, the clamp, and the cartridge. These usage issues have been traced during interviews and observations in the context, a competitor analysis, a functional analysis, a usability inspection, and a streamlined walkthrough.<br/><br/>The final design is developed through explorative prototyping, associative sketching using methods like SCAMPER and morphological charts, and creative sessions with peer students and with Dispertech. The final design is focused on a guided and efficient workflow, facilitated by the device but mainly by the measurement software. (Inter)actions in the workflow of the final design are clustered as well as the process allows. Consequently, the workflow is split up into three phases: 1) Insert cartridge, 2) Prepare device, and 3) Measurement. The physical device shows multiple differences compared to the current NanoCET: the ON/OFF button is visible and easily reachable at the front, the finger indentation of the knob is coloured to emphasize this use cue, there are use cues for (opening) the clamp and the packaging of a cartridge facilitates carrying information. The cartridge itself is redesigned to protect the coverslip and to provide more feedforward and feedback by making use of colours (and shapes) resembling the corresponding phase. The ‘arena’ is designed to provide use cues and fit the new cartridge. Moreover, the LEDs on the physical device are placed so they are always visible, whether the interaction is performed seated, or standing up. Each LED has a different colour to track the three phases and their colours in the software. In the software, the user sees an overview of the whole process. Information is hierarchically layered, using hover-information buttons to provide extra input when it is required during the process. The least amount of input is required to set up a measurement, supported by automatically filling fields based on the information given earlier. In this way, users experience careful guidance through each step of the workflow.<br","Usability; Nanoparticles; Interaction design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

By simulating trading behavior of a market participant the change of prices for a market with flexibility can be quantified. It is shown that passive control does not represent realistic trading behavior, so optimal control is used. To this end, an Economic Model Predictive Controller (EMPC) is designed to simulate how market prices change when a trader maximizes his profits through energy arbitrage.

Thule, Cybex and UPPABaby are the direct competitors for Bugaboo on the runner market. The Bugaboo Runner, a three-wheel runner stroller, was a good product and people who bought it were satisfied. However, the Runner was a relative expensive accessory, given the fact that a ‘regular’ Bugaboo stroller already costs around €1000. <br/><br/>Within Sprint 2 the consumer and their lifestyle were researched and afterwards a design vision and focus were created. Consumers in the USA like three-wheel strollers, while consumers in Europe prefer four-wheel, more compact, multi-stage (suitable for different ages) strollers. Based on fifteen interviews with parents, the target group of this project can be identified as the Young Urban Fit Parents.<br/>The design vision of this project is: ‘I want to design a regular stroller that activates and creates the possibility to work out with your child as a busy young fit parent who lives a healthy, active &amp; sporty life in an urban area.’ with the design focus: ‘How can you run/sport with a regular stroller?’. <br/><br/>Within Sprint 3 and 4 ideas were generated, by organising creative sessions. Four concepts were selected from these ideas. The final concept that was chosen is the stroller with an expandable frame since this concept scores best on all requirements. This concept is called the Fox Active.<br/><br/>Within Sprint 5 the Fox Active is validated by a test with the prototype and parent validation sessions.<br/>The tests proved that the configuration of the final concept with 16” rear wheels and the elongated frame is close to the ideal running situation and performs better than running with a regular stroller. The second test also proved that walking with 16” rear wheels and the normal frame is sufficient and preferred over walking with the elongated frame. All participants of the validation session would consider the regular stroller with sport function if it does not cost too much extra and if it is clear what the benefits over the regular version are. <br/><br/>Within Sprint 6 the implementation of the Fox Active is discussed, which consists of the styling, fit in the Bugaboo Portfolio and costs. The base colour of the styling is black, with bright orange accents. <br/>The ‘sport buttons’ will be coloured bright orange as well, to make clear that these buttons have a special function. The estimated retail price for the Fox Active is €1299-€1499, based on the comparison of the prices of the Bugaboo Fox 3, the price of a Bugaboo Fox 3 and a runner stroller together and the price of the Bugaboo Donkey 5. <br/>Finally, some recommendations were made by the Bugaboo designers. They recommend that the joint of the stroller needs to be tested to be strong enough to run with and that it needs to be tested if the stroller is not too heavy.<br","Stroller; Runner; Bugaboo","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-03-25","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); de Jager, C.S. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The current food system stimulates unhealthy food choices and is a major contributor to environmental pressures. To improve this situation, an integrated approach is necessary, where we take into account the different actors in the food environment and how each of these can contribute to a more healthy and sustainable society. Although change needs to happen on a world-wide scale, this project contributes by case studying a small piece of it: Hillesluis, a low SES neighbourhood in Rotterdam. <br/><br/>Rotterdam is one of the most unhealthy cities in the Netherlands, and low socioeconomic status (SES) neighbourhoods have the highest priority for change as these low-income groups are more often exposed to and vulnerable to the conditions that are associated with poorer dietary outcomes. With more than 55% of the adults, and more than one in three kids being overweight, we can also see this trend in Hillesluis. <br/><br/>The poor dietary intake of low-income groups can be presented as an outcome of a complex adaptive system that sustains a food environment that increases accessibility, availability, affordability and acceptability of unhealthy foods. In order to reshape system dynamics, simultaneous, diverse and innovative strategies are needed to facilitate improvement of availability, affordability, accessibility and acceptability of healthier food (Sawyer et al., 2021). <br/><br/>To determine a suitable strategy, I studied the local food system in Hillesluis and discovered opportunities and barriers for progress. I did this through literature as well as field research. In the field, I met residents, food retailers and other stakeholders who were eager to contribute to a healthier neighbourhood. The design goal I derived from analysing the gained insights is as follows: “Design an experience that introduces families in Hillesluis to healthier cooking”.<br/><br/>To pursue this design goal, I designed a combination of two interventions that together contribute to a healthier food environment in Hillesluis. The core of the concept is ‘De Familiekeuken’, a workshop series where parents and their children learn to cook healthier meals in a social setting, guided by a specialised chef. The goal is that acquired knowledge and skills are eventually implemented in their daily life and their cooking activities at home, so that a healthier diet is established. Besides the workshops, I also propose to increase the amount of physical stimuli of healthy food in the neighbourhood. Through the application of street art, people passing by can get inspired to open up the conversation about healthy food or to make a healthier choice today. Together, these interventions touch upon the different layers of the food environment and in that way increase the availability, accessibility, affordability and acceptability of healthy food. <br/><br/>A first validation of the concept confirmed a positive intention towards implementation on the stakeholders’ side as well as enthusiasm for participation on the residents’ side. It is expected that this project and implementation of the concept will inspire actions towards a healthier food environment in Hillesluis. With the gained insights and solution I hope to inspire action in other low SES neighbourhoods as well.<br","Strategic design; Systemic design; Low SES; Food Industry; Rotterdam; Transition Design; Health","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","","51.8991439, 4.5102535"

To alleviate this, we propose to dispense sign(.), replacing it with a learnable activation binarizer (LAB), allowing the network to learn a fine-grained binarization kernel per layer - as opposed to global thresholding. LAB is a novel universal module that can seamlessly be integrated into existing architectures. To confirm this, we plug it into four seminal BNNs and show a considerable performance boost at the cost of tolerable increase in delay and complexity.

These so-called relational project delivery models are supposed to deal with the current challenges of regular cost and time overruns, the growing demand and the adverse relationship between contractor and client in traditional projects, leading to an unfair risk allocation, lack of collaboration and lots of conflicts. One of these measures proposed by RWS is the introduction of the two-phase model. For specifically the first phase it is unclear how the collaboration can be improved and how a collaborative identity might contribute. The research question therefore is:<br/>How could the first phase of the two-phase model in infrastructure projects in the Netherlands be organized to improve collaboration and how does the formation of a collaborative identity contribute to this?<br/>A further operationalization of collaborative identity resulted in a definition: An identity within the project that distinguishes the organization and contributes to a collaborative mindset in the project organization. Improved collaboration can be achieved by implementing certain principles in the project by the organization of specific working practices. These working practices and principles were gathered from different streams of literature such as the alliance, early contractor involvement and bouwteam models. The principles are scored on their importance to collaboration in the first phase of the two phase model and the working practices were scored on their contribution to achieving the principles. This resulted in a framework identifying the most important principles and working practices. This framework was then discussed with two separate focus groups from the contractor and the client. The comments and discussion was used to update and improve the framework. The framework is found in figure A.<br/>The most important conclusions were to apply the framework in a so called project start up. Furthermore a shared vision and objectives related to the project are important for the two-phase model, as two organizations should collaborate intensively in the first phase, while the price is not yet set. Involving the right people who can work in this ‘new’ way in the project is vital, and the price should be constructed using open book, and avoiding fixed price elements in the tender phase. Finally it is concluded that the collaboration in any project should be an active project goal. This means that effort should be made to evaluate, discuss and reward behaviour resulting in good collaboration. The conclusions indicate the importance of a collaborative identity to the collaboration in the first phase of the two phase model and this was also specifically confirmed by the participants of the focus group. For future research it is recommended to perform more research on collaborative identity. Secondly more research should be performed on the two-phase model, when the projects have been finished, also relating to the success of the overall project. Finally research on the collaboration in the second phase and the transition from the first to the second phase should be performed.","Collaboration; Two-phase model; Infrastructure; Collaborative Identity; Working practices; Collaborative Principles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

One of the biggest challenges that the research community expects from this introduction is the possible problems or critical situations caused by the lack of interpersonal communication between drivers and vulnerable road users in the form of eye contact or hand gestures. To solve this problem, external Human-Machine Interfaces seem to be a suitable solutions to enable AV-VRU communication. This project reviews relevant literature on eHMI design and Human-Robot interaction to identify current knowledge gaps. Moreover, generative user research was used to identify needs and wants from vulnerable road users when interacting with motorized vehicles in traffic. Predictability, perception of vehicle’s awareness, and knowing how to act around automated vehicles were found to be key elements for smooth interactions in scenarios that were considered critical by research participants, namely crossings without traffic lights and being passed by vehicles that share the road with cyclists.<br/>In order to approach the problem, an iterative design process was followed to identify the best communication modalities and modes to be included in a final flexible and multimodal eHMI design, showing the potential of abstract light patterns and dynamic projections to enable AV transparency. The final design was evaluated through a video-based experiment in which participants were exposed to a baseline condition and the same scenario with the addition of the eHMI. This evaluation showed an improvement in the experience qualities evaluated in the presence of the eHMI designed, showing overall desirability and pointing out simplicity and flexibility as crucial qualities to design external communication systems.","vehicle automation; communication design; road safety; interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Such a routing structure allows for direct routing by optimizing trajectories on the individual level. Implementing a tactical conflict detection and resolution method eliminates the capacity limits imposed by air traffic control by shifting control to the flight deck. The benefits in terms of safety, capacity, and efficiency are assessed by comparing this routing structure to the current routing structure by simulating a year of real flight data. Furthermore, it is researched if such a routing structure remains viable for forecasted traffic levels by creating a future direct routing scenario with the use of dummy flights. Trajectory optimization is performed for the part of the trajectory above 10,000 ft in a decoupled manner with the ordered upwind algorithm for the horizontal domain and the base of aircraft data performance model for the vertical domain. Conflicts are solved on the tactical level with the modified voltage potential method in the horizontal domain. On average, a 5.1% fuel reduction, or 1.9% time reduction, is established for the new routing structure. A total of 18 loss of separations with an intrusion severity above 1% occur, of which the most severe intrusion still assures 734 ft vertical and/or 3.67 NM horizontal separation. The routing structure appears to be robust for future traffic levels as the airspace density scales linearly with the amount of aircraft and the conflict to loss of separation ratio remains constant with only three loss of separations slightly exceeding the 1% limit.","Air Traffic Control; Airspace Structure; Decentralized Airspace; Direct Routing; Free Flight; Modified Voltage Potential; North Atlantic Airspace; Wind-Optimal Routing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

To improve and compare virtual simulations of new grabs, accurate real life kinematic data of grabs is required. Moreover kinematic data can potentially provide insight in current use of grabs, which can be interesting information for both manufacturer and customer of the grab. The possibilities towards implementation of a sensor system on bulk handling grabs are investigated by selecting a suitable sensor and measuring kinematics and operations of imitated grab movements. This research focuses on investigating kinematics of multi rope grabs with dual scoops. A sensor selection procedure is followed resulting in the selection of an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor with Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver. In several experiments the sensor data is compared with reference data of imitated grab movements assumed as ground truth. When using multiple IMU’s (one on each grab scoop) providing orientation data, the opening angle can be determined. The results of the experiments indicate that the position data provided by the sensor can be used for classification of activities, but less for high precision movement trajectory reconstruction. Position and orientation data of imitated grab movements can be interpreted to generate performance indicators that describe grab operations.

This quality makes mixing services interesting for money laundering, and they are therefore often used by criminals. As such, there is an urgent need to systematically understand how to restore the relationship between deposits and payouts of centralized mixing services. Unfortunately, there is minimal knowledge of how mixing processes of centralized mixing services work, and few attempts exist to create these demixing methods. This research aimed to develop a demixing method for centralized mixers with knowledge gained from ground-truth data. The ground-truth data contains information on orders and the transaction history of mixing service BestMixer. Demixing consists of collecting all addresses that are part of the mixer (attribution) and finding the correct payout to a deposit (reconstruction). Multiple statistical analysis techniques were applied to this data to verify existing attribution heuristics and find new characteristics of mixing services. Also, filtering techniques to reconstruct the relation between deposits and payouts were tested on the order data. This research verifies that BestMixer likely did not reuse addresses in the mixing process. It also showed that the lifespan of most addresses was shorter than 24 hours. In addition, many BestMixer addresses received or sent a transaction to another BestMixer address, which created sequences of BestMixer transactions. The sequences show that the mixer used a peeling chain pattern in combination with multi-input transactions. These characteristics can be used to attribute other centralized mixing services. The results also show that the mixer increased in popularity throughout time.<br/>Overall, the reconstruction attempt with filtering techniques did not perform well on BestMixer orders, as it returned an impracticable amount of possible payout combinations. The mixer showed less activity in the beginning days of the service, and there are signs that the reconstruction works better in this earlier stage of the mixer. This means that when a mixer becomes more popular, it could become more difficult to demix the orders correctly.<br/>From this research can be concluded that the ground-truth data of BestMixer does help in developing attribution heuristics for centralized mixers, but not in developing a general reconstruction method that correctly restores the relation between deposits and payouts, thus not suffice in demixing centralized mixers.","Cybercrime; Mixing services; Bitcoins; Money laundering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

This thesis researches the role of data monitoring as a persuasion strategy in monitoring a user’s progress in their journey to becoming more physically active and how it can be leveraged to decrease the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Specifically, the focus of the thesis is to determine the effectiveness of expert-generated tailored messages to motivate a user in their physical activity behaviour. We designed the content of the messages by adapting an existing ontology for tailoring motivational messages in the context of physical activity. Messages were then generated by experts through a scenario-based feedback generation process, where the scenarios were tailored to a user’s mood, self-efficacy and progress. The design of these tailored messages was tested against generic messages to determine which type of message was more motivating to the user. An experiment was conducted by recruiting crowd workers who were asked to rate the motivational levels of the two message types with respect to a given scenario. The results of the experiment supported the initial hypothesis that messages tailored to mood, self-efficacy and progress are more motivating than generic messages. Additionally, we have shown a systematic and reproducible way to obtain motivating messages. We have also provided a dataset of motivational messages that can be used during various stages of a user’s physical activity intervention, along with a set of scenarios representing different levels of a user’s state (mood, self-efficacy and progress).","Persuasion; Motivational Messages; Tailoring; Physical Activity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Schreuder, Marco (mentor); Sun, D. (graduation committee); Taale, Henk (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Urban areas with many daily commuters often experience a reduction in traffic flow during rush hours. In some urban areas where this reduction in traffic flow occurs, there are popular destinations for leisure that have multiple large parking facilities. Vehicles searching for vacant parking spots drive at a lower vehicle speed, reducing the traffic flow even further. Traffic flow can be improved by using a traffic signal control strategy and a smart parking solution to increase the speed of vehicles searching for vacant parking spots. This thesis combines the use of Model Predictive Control (MPC) in traffic signal control, with a Parking Resource Allocation Model (PRAM) to further improve the traffic flow on the traffic network. The PRAM considers the travel time of all travel routes to the parking areas, as well as the distribution of vehicles toward the parking areas. <br/>The performance of the combined MPC and PRAM control strategy is compared using two case studies. In both case studies, the traffic network is a simplified representation of the mall of the Netherlands, located near Leidschendam. The first case study simulates traffic based on the morning rush hours, and the second case study simulates traffic based on the evening rush hours. In both case studies, multiple traffic demands are simulated, based on historical traffic data provided by Rijkswaterstaat. No historical data is provided by the mall of the Netherlands so fictive data is used. The performance of an MPC control strategy, an MPC control strategy with the first PRAM, and an MPC control strategy with the second PRAM is compared with a fixed-time control strategy for these traffic demands. The results show that the MPC control strategy reduces the total time spent and vehicle time loss of all the vehicles for the morning rush hours, but not for the evening rush hours. For one traffic demand, the added PRAMs further reduce the total time spent and vehicle time loss of all the vehicles, in both case studies. For the other traffic demands, the added PRAMs increased the total time spent and vehicle time loss. There is no significant difference between the two PRAMs in terms of the total time spent and vehicle time loss. Furthermore, the distribution of vehicles to the parking areas is more evenly for the second PRAM. Since the parking demand is fictive, future research is necessary with accurate parking demand to ensure that the combined MPC and PRAM further improves the traffic flow on the traffic network of the mall of the Netherlands. Moreover, future research is needed to more accurately predict the travel time of travel routes. <br","Model Predictive Control; Resource Allocation; Traffic Signal Control; Urban Traffic Network","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

These sites in the body are exposed to high forces, which makes them prone to failure. To improve the repair strategies, a better understanding of the mechanical property-structure relationship of osteochondral interface is crucial. The aim of this study was to observe the structure and map the stiffness of the equine osteochondral interface during maturation and detect a possible mechanical property-structure relationship. <br/>Osteochondral samples from the metacarpo- and metatarsophalangeal joint of 9 days, 12 days, 7 weeks, 13 months old and three mature horses were investigated in this study. Histology was performed to observe the structure. The local elastic modulus was determined using nanoindentation and the strain distribution with compression tests combined with digital image correlation (DIC). <br/>The cartilage thickness decreased with age and an emerging tidemark was detected in the 13 months old joint, indicating calcification of the cartilage starts at this age. The local elastic modulus showed a clear transitional region between low and high values for the mature interface, indicating the articular cartilage and subchondral bone region was indented, respectively. For the immature samples, a less clear transition was found and in the 9 days and 12 days old interface the entire matrix consisted of low elastic modulus values. The strain distribution from the compression tests over the interface confirmed the decreasing cartilage thickness with age. The transition location from high to low strain decreased with age. <br/>The mechanical transition from cartilage to bone showed significant changes within the interface and during maturation for the local elastic modulus and the strain distribution. These changes can be compared to the structural changes demonstrated in the histology images. The data obtained in this research provides new insights into the maturing osteochondral interface and the mechanical and structural changes within this complex biological tissue.","Osteochondral Interface; Maturation; Nanoindentation; Digital Image Correlation; Elastic Modulus","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-05-01","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Their monthly income averaged below €2.110 for a family of four (SCP, 2019). Many poor citizens struggle to improve their situation, with almost half of them remaining in poverty for more than four years on-end (CPB, 2019).<br/><br/>Luckily, Dutch national- and local governments and their supporting organizations are continuously trying to support citizens in poverty. These parties offer financial and qualitative aid, coming together in “the poverty reduction system”.<br/><br/>However, the municipality of Utrecht has identified that this system does not always sufficiently support citizens. The system can be complex and bureaucratic, making it inaccessible for some citizens. Cognitively challenged women with a non-Western migration background are extra vulnerable to the complexities of the poverty reduction system. They struggle with low-literacy, communicative skills, and cultural barriers. The Municipality of Utrecht, Stichting Al Amal, and Buurtteams Utrecht want to improve accessibility of the system for this group. This project is the result of that collaboration.<br/><br/>In this project, I aim to design an intervention that makes Utrecht’s poverty reduction system more accessible for cognitively challenged women in poverty with a non-western migration background. Throughout my research, the experiences of citizens and the social workers supporting them have been the focal point. I explored the cause of the target group’s non-participation in the system through multiple creative sessions, interviews, and context explorations.<br/><br/>From my research, I learned that the issues already start before these women come in contact with the system. The target group refrains from requesting help altogether because they feel overwhelmed by the many available options, lack clear information about their options and rights, mistrust the authorities, do not feel that their situation is urgent, or feel ashamed. They let their financial struggles go untreated because of these factors, often making their situation progressively worse with time.<br/><br/>I focused my design activities on this early stage, looking for ways to improve accessibility early on. This was a co-evolutionary process, where learnings from design explorations inspired new directions to chase after. In this search, two themes arose. First, the theme of ‘motivating growth’ allowed me to explore alternative ways<br/>of making the target group rediscover their own aspirations to improve their situation. How can we make people believe in their own potential again? Through this exploration, a new theme arose: “Opening up”. I found how the target group pushes the topic of poverty away. However, the network of people around them could probably be of great help. All this knowledge and support could be unlocked if people just opened up towards each other. I challenged myself to find<br/>a way to let these people open up about their experiences, in a way that felt comfortable to them.<br/><br/>The concept that came fort is “a tea box full of stories” (figure 1). This concept is a low-threshold conversation starter that motivates citizens to open up about poverty-related experiences during tea time. The tea packets have questions and quotes printed on them, inviting the users<br/>to start a conversation about these topics over a pot of tea. The quotes, which are written by other Utrechters, show them that these problems are universal, and that being vulnerable is okay.<br/><br/>The tea box unlocks and activates an informal network of knowledge and care, where friends, neighbors, and family together explore how they can support one another. It shows citizens that they do not have to carry the burden of their troubles alone. The tea box also offers multiple different links to U-Centraal; an organization that can help citizens find the right professional support once they are ready for it.<br/><br/>Al in all, the tea box offers a first low-threshold stepping stone towards a more accessible system. Firstly through an activated community that shares knowledge and support, and secondly by offering professional support in a pro-active yet unforced manner.","poverty; social design; Design for Interaction; conversation starter; municipality of Utrecht","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Schott, D.L. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The potential for the production of green energy in the Netherlands is insufficiently utilized. The cause for this problem is the insufficient bearing capacity of industrial roofs for the installation of solar panels using ballast. This required ballast exceeds the bearing capacity of the roof structure, or exceeds the bearing capacity of the weak sections. To solve this problem, a new self-supporting and foldable solar panel system has been designed.<br/>Research into roofs with insufficient bearing capacity, gained an insight in the different spans required for the system. Several existing foldable solar panel systems were found, together with lightweight solutions for roofs with low bearing capacity. Finally, a patent research revealed no patents causing infringements with the current support system design.<br/>The solar panel support system has been designed with two functionalities. The first functionality of the system, is that it has been designed as a lattice structure. In this way, the system becomes a self-supporting structure, capable of spanning the weak sections of the roof. Another advantage of the lattice structure is, the required ballast is eliminated. The second functionality of the system is that it is foldable. In this way the installation time, and the required space for transportation, is reduced.<br/>To determine the behaviour of the support system, a prototype test is executed. This prototype test will subsequently be used for the validation of the Finite Element Model. For the test, four A-frames have been assembled, after which several loads were applied. After applying each load, the deflection, reaction forces and tension forces in the steel cables were measured.<br/>Validation of the simplified Finite Element Model is required, to determine if the model accurately shows the behaviour of the system. Validation is executed by comparing the measured quantities during the prototype test, with the model in the same conditions. After adjustments to the model, the model accurately represents the behaviour of the support system, and is therefore validated.<br/>The validated model is used to analyse the support system according to snow and wind loads. For these analyses, a case study is executed based on an example from industry of a roof with insufficient bearing capacity. Several problem areas became apparent during the analysis of this case study. To solve these problems, design adjustments to the current design are proposed.<br/>In this research, a method for the validation of a Finite Element Model using an experimental test for a self-supporting and foldable solar panel system is executed. It became also apparent that a test was required to adjust the model and accurately represent the behaviour of the system. This approach can also be used for different type of loadings, or can be beneficial or applicable to other systems.<br/>With this model, future analyses for different cases can be executed and a contribution towards the production of renewable energy has been made. Re-analyses of the support system with the proposed design adjustments is required to determine if these adjustments are sufficient. Further optimization of the design can be executed using the suggested optimization techniques. For the application of the support system outside the Netherlands, recalculation of the system according to the applicable standards for snow and wind loads is required.","FEA; Validation; Solar panel; Support; System; Self-supporting; Lattice; Foldable","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-04-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Multi-Machine Engineering","",""

Being so essential means that it is important to avoid failures, 98% of 300 researched companies by ITIC reported a cost of 100.000 USD every hour of downtime. To detect failures a technology called fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) is used, which is a method to foresee failures or faults in a system that deteriorates over time through evaluating the state of the system. It is an extensively academically research subject, however, has hardly been adopted in industrial settings where electric gearmotor systems are applied. Thus, a FDD model was developed to provide insight, knowledge, and a practical example into the necessities of an industrial FDD model. This was achieved through conducting an analysis on the state-of-the-art of FDD in industrial settings and conducting a literature review on FDD. Based on an analysis of the conclusions a hybrid diagnostics model was developed. For the fault detection a model-based solution was used, it compared the predicted torque to the measured torque of a motor to create a health indication value. If this value crosses a pre-determined threshold an alarm would go off. For fault identification a decision tree machine learning algorithm is used to identify: blockage, bearing, gear or random failure in a system. To verify and validate the hybrid diagnostics model it was applied to a client of SEW Eurodrive where data was available of a known system. The system had a fault detection accuracy as high as 94% and could classify failures with an accuracy of 93%.","predictive maintenance; gear motor; fault detection and diagnosis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Multi-Machine Engineering","",""

Cross-laminated timber is an upcoming material in the building industry. But there are also problems arising when building with this relatively new material. CLT is a lightweight building material, which means that the mass itself is insufficient for meeting the acoustical requirements. The total sound transmission depends on the amount of direct sound and flanking sound transmission. The ISO 12354 standard used to determine the amount of sound transmission between rooms does not include frequencies below 100 Hz. Even though these low-frequency sounds are the main cause of annoyance in lightweight construction buildings. The low-frequency sound transmission is hard to measure because of the long wavelength. In this research, a numerical model was developed and used to determine the low-frequency sound transmission in CLT apartment buildings. <br/><br/><br/>The effect of the following sound-reducing measures are studied: the material properties of the material CLT, additional linings on the room separating elements, use of elastic interlayers between CLT panels and the type and number of connectors connecting the CLT panels. These are all common sound-reducing measures for lightweight constructions. The effect of the material properties of the CLT and the effect of additional linings are computed by a numerical direct sound transmission model. The effects of elastic interlayer and connectors between the CLT panels are computed with a numerical vibration reduction index model. The results of the numerical models are compared to measurements found in literature and the sound transmission according to the ISO standard. <br/><br/>The results showed the importance of Young’s modulus in the y and z-direction, these influence the location of the resonance induced dips in the sound insulation. The internal loss factor of the CLT panels influenced the height of the dips. A loss factor of 20 % resulted in results most similar to the measurements. The direct sound transmission through a bare CLT panel can be predicted within a range of 3 dB difference with measurements. The prediction of the ISO standard is within a range of 5 dB with the measured values. <br/><br/>The vibration reduction index between panels without interlayers is modelled with frictional contact regions between the panels. The numerical results showed similarities with the measurement results for the vibration reduction index of panels with screwed connectors. The ISO standard significantly overpredicts the vibration reduction index of CLT junctions. The effect of the elastic interlayer showed insignificant improvements in the frequency range 50-500 Hz, the additional reduction stays below 3 dB. The ISO standard does not include a method to determine the effect of elastic interlayers or connectors between CLT panels.<br/><br/><br/>The numerical models prove that is possible to predict the low-frequency sound transmission in CLT apartments. Important notes are that the CLT lamellas need to be modelled separately. Only in this way the model is able to capture the sound that goes through a structure within a range of 3 dB. In order to test the effect of additional lining, the material properties need to be known. <br/>The vibration transmission between panels in the junctions is more complex, as it depends on more design parameters. A frictionally bonded contact region between the panels results in vibration reduction indices that are in line with measurement results of panels with several connectors. The effect of the elastic interlayer is minimal in the low-frequency range, but the results are similar to measurement results. Both the direct sound transmission model and the vibration reduction model were influenced by the boundary conditions. <br/><br","Cross laminated Timber; CLT; Numerical model; Sound transmission; Acoustic; Flanking sound; ANSYS; Sensitivity Analysis; ISO 12354","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering - Structural Design","",""

A subgroup of these vegetarian products consists of meat analogs, which are products that resemble meat in its functionality and are prepared in a similar fashion. One of the companies producing these meat analogs is Rival Foods. Rival Foods has been working on a production process based on a Couette cell, in which the dough is sheared in an annular region between two concentric cylinders. This allows them to create highly fibrous products with a thickness of roughly 3cm. Other production processes such as extrusion cooking are unable to achieve this combination of structure and thickness. In upscaling the production process, preferably a larger gap width between the cylindrical surfaces of the cell is preferred, because the thickness of the product is a unique selling point. Larger gap widths lead to greater temperature inhomogeneity and gradients, which negatively impacts product quality. It is currently not possible to accurately measure the temperature profile throughout the cell. Therefore, in this thesis a model has been developed in OpenFOAM which calculates the temperature profile with a small number of material parameters and process conditions as input. The model assumes the ingredient mixture behaves as a temperature dependent power law fluid. Rheological measurements have been performed to quantify these temperature dependent power law parameters. To study the influence of the viscous dissipation, preheat temperature, mixture density, and product thickness on the temperature field during processing, multiple simulations have been performed. The simulations used a time step of 0.0001s, for which the temperature, velocity, viscosity, and viscous dissipation were not yet fully converged. The principal flow in the Couette cell geometry was in the direction of rotation of the inner cylinder as expected and had a velocity with order of magnitude e-01 m/s. Besides the principal flow a secondary flow pattern has been found as well, consisting of vortices which had a velocity with order of magnitude e-03 m/s. These secondary velocity components were responsible for additional advection of heat in the simulation which resulted in a different temperature profile than expected. Since the Taylor number was well below the critical Taylor number, the existence of Taylor vortices could be excluded. After a further refinement of the time step the vortices disappeared. Running the full simulations with this time step would take months per simulation and was therefore not an option. It was concluded OpenFOAM had trouble simulating power law fluids with high viscosities.","Fluid dynamics; Heat transfer; CFD; Food industry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Khatri, Indu (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Transformers have dominated the field of natural language processing due to their competency in learning complex relationships within a sequence. Reusing a pre-trained transformer for a downstream task is known as Trans-fer learning. Transfer learning restricts the transformer to a fixed vocabulary; modification in transformer implementation will extend the utility of the transformer. Implementing transformers for complex biological problems can be beneficial in addressing the complexities in the biological sequences. One such biological problem is to capture the specificity of diverse T-cell repertoire to the unique antigens (i.e., immunogenic pathogenic elements). Using transformers to assess the relationship between T-cell receptors and antigen at the sequence level can provide us with better insights into the processes involved in these precise and complex immune responses in humans and murine. In this work, we determined the specificity of multiple TCR to unique antigens by classifying the CDR3 re-gions of TCR sequences to a particular antigen. For this problem, we used three pre-trained auto-encoder (ProtBERT, ProtALBERT, ProtELECTRA) and one pre-trained auto-regressive (ProtXLNet) transformer model wherein, to adapt to the challenges of the complex biological problem at hand, we implemented modifications in the transformers chosen here. We used the VDJdb to obtain the biological data for training and testing the selected transformers. After pre-processing data, we predicted the TCR specificity for 25 antigens (classes) in a multi-class setting. Transformers could predict the specificity of TCRs to an antigen with just the CDR3 sequences from the TCRB chain (weighted F1 score 0.48), the data that was unseen by the transformers. With additional features incorpo-rated, i.e., gene names for TCRs, the weighted F1 improved to 0.55 in the best performing transformer. We demon-strated that different modifications in transformers recognized out-of-vocabulary features with these results. When com-paring the AUC from the transformer model to other previously developed methods for the same biological problem such as TCRGP, TCRDist and DeepTCR, we observed that the transformers outperformed the previously available methods. To exemplify, the MCMV epitope family that suffered from restricted performance in TCRGP due to fewer training samples (~100 samples) showed 10% improvement in AUC with transformers under similar training samples. Transformer's proficiency in learning from fewer data combined with holistic modifications in transformers implementations proves that we can extend its capabilities to explore other biological settings. Further ingenuity in utiliz-ing the full potential of transformers either through attention head visualization or introducing additional features can fur-ther extend T-cell research avenues.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Data Science and Technology","",""

(mentor); Lantsoght, E.O.L. (graduation committee); Hendriks, M.A.N. (graduation committee); Dieteren, G.G.A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","To calculate the flexural-shear resistance of prestressed concrete members without shear reinforcement, a method based on Critical Shear Crack Theory (CSCT) has been presented for the new Eurocode (prEN1992). Two alternatives provided in draft 7/2020 (prEN1, prEN2) are the starting point given, and two other alternatives are proposed for analysis by this thesis (prEN3, prEN4). These alternatives and other design codes were evaluated based on the concepts involved, assumptions made, and the results obtained compared with experimental results.<br/><br/>The research started by compiling basic concepts handled by empirical (ACI318-19 or EC2), MCFT-based (AASHTO-LRFD), and CSCT-based (prEN1992) approaches for the calculation of the flexural-shear resistance of members without shear reinforcement. Experimental results of slender prestressed concrete beams without shear reinforcement were collected from the ACI-DAfStb-PC/2015 database, and these tests were classified into subsets according to the relevant criteria used in the different design codes such as type of shear failure or cross-section shape. Subset 1 groups rectangular and I/T shaped beams with flexural-shear failure. Subset 2 retains the rectangular beams from subset 1, and subset 3 filters the tests from subset 2, applying conditions checking for anchorage or flexural failures. In addition, different critical locations were assumed, some according to design code suggestions (x_r=d or x_r=a-d), and others according to an assumption based on test results (x_r=0.65a).<br/><br/>The comparative evaluation results of the flexural-shear strength estimated by the different design codes with the experimental results were made for the 3 subsets and 3 critical locations defined. From this data set, the critical location x_r=a-d was chosen as the appropriate based on a general evaluation of the precision acquired by the approaches and the higher flexural stresses present. Then the data for the 3 subsets at this location are captured and presented in a range from lowest to highest from here on.<br/><br/>Based on the results, it was concluded that AASHTO-LRFD and prEN1 are the most precise approaches with COV less than 0.25. However, AASHTO-LRFD tends to obtain very conservative results. ACI318-19M has the worst performance in terms of precision with COV in the range of 0.29 to 0.45, its approximate method tends to get results below the desired level of safety, and its detailed method tends to be more conservative. EC2 achieves a regular precision with COV between 0.28 and 0.31, the linearized alternative for the new Eurocode (prEN2) obtains similar COV values ending up with a regular precision as well, and both approaches have a good level of safety.<br/><br/>To improve prEN2, new alternatives (prEN3 and prEN4) were derived based on the linearization of the main failure criterion of the CSCT. Of the alternatives, prEN4 was the most precise (COV=0.25-0.26) with a good level of safety, recognizing that this alternative correctly applies the concept of prestressing as preload and incorporates the effect of the normal loads on the shear strength with a direct relationship dependent on the ratio d/a_cs, where a_cs=|M_Ed/V_Ed |. Finally, all approaches were tested in terms of usability in design cases for simply supported and continuous slab decks, concluding that prEN4 has a significant advantage in usability since it is an expression similar to the one used in the current EC2, and also obtains results that are on the safe side compared with a more precise approach like prEN1.<br/>Alternative 4 (prEN4) is an approach with good accuracy and safety level, and can incorporate the effect of prestress on shear resistance straightforwardly and consistently, complying with the main assumptions of the CSCT and the assumption of prestressing as a preload indicated for the Eurocodes, thus incorporating only the influence of normal loads applied to the neutral axis to contribute to the shear resistance. prEN4 is also an approach that has been shown to capture the influence of all parameters considered to obtain a reliable estimation of the flexural-shear resistance; therefore, it is recommended to consider it as a potential alternative for a handy and reliable calculation of the flexural-shear resistance of beams without shear reinforcement.","Flexural-shear failure; Shear capacity; Prestressed concrete; Critical Shear Crack","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

A mission-based strategy is proposed with the aim to elongate battery lifetime. With this strategy, the battery is charged to the estimated State of Charge (SOC) level required to complete the next flight. The mission-based strategy is compared to two other strategies: the SOC 100% strategy that always fully charges the battery before flight, and, the SOC 80% strategy that charges that battery to 80% before flying. The three strategies are tested for a variety of flight distances. The battery model is simulated using Python Battery Mathematical Modelling (PyBaMM). A Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is run to review the response to uncertainties in initial battery compositions and operating conditions. Ultimately, the strategies are evaluated on environmental impact, financial costs and flying efficiency. The results show that the mission-based strategy outperforms the SOC 100%, yielding lower emissions and costs and higher flying efficiency performance. However, depending on the range flown, the SOC 80% shows environmental, cost and flying efficiency benefits that challenge the relevance of implementing a mission-based battery health management strategy.","Unmanned Aerial Vehicle; Electric; Lithium; Battery; Monte Carlo; Health management; sustainability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Aerodynamic research in the automotive industry is an essential part of the reduction in resistance during driving, as it leads to an increased fuel efficiency and higher top speed. State-of-the-art aerodynamic research is conducted in wind tunnels, through numerical simulations (Computational Fluid Dynamics) and on-site coast down techniques. In recent year, a novel quantitative flow measurement technique for full-scale, on-site transiting objects has emerged: the Ring of Fire. This system is a non-intrusive, large-scale, stereoscopic particle image velocimetry measurement technique, which provides insight in the on-site flow topology around transiting objects and simultaneously determine their drag. <br/><br/>In this project, the Ring of Fire measurement system is implemented for the automotive industry in collaboration with Volkswagen. The Volkswagen Tiguan and Up are tested, where for the Tiguan a configuration with the radiator front open and with the radiator front closed are tested at a speed of 120 km/h. The objective of this research is to assess the applicability and feasibility of the Ring of Fire system for full-scale cars, comparing the flow visualisation in the wake of a car between different models and configurations, and additionally determining the drag and its uncertainty through the control volume approach. <br/><br/>A 3x3 meter field of view is used to obtained flow fields up to 5 meters in the wake. Up to 1 meter in the near wake the flow shows a clear upwash due to a vortex pair for both cars. After 1 meter, the wake of the Up transitions into a downwash, lowering the overall wake contour and causing a lateral expansion. In contrast, the wake of the Tiguan shows four vortices, of which the upper pair consists of two strong vortices maintaining upwash up to the far wake. A 'mushroom' kind of shape is the consequence, which is in accordance with the typical wake structures found in literature for estate cars. The Up however, shows a wake structure comparable to a notchback type car. <br/><br/>The control volume approach shows that the drag up to 2 meter is highly underestimated, which can be attributed to the incorrect reconstruction of the near wake pressure using the 2D Poisson equation. After 3 meter, the wake starts to diffuse in small scale structures which cannot be resolved by the window sizes. Therefore, the drag followed from the measurements between 2 and 3 meter, resulting in a mean value comparable to those found in wind tunnel tests and with an uncertainty of the mean at a 95\% confidence level below 3\%. <br/><br/>The Ring of Fire system setup in this project is capable of showing the differences between the Up and Tiguan, in terms of flow topology as well as drag values. However, a statistical distinction between the two Tiguan configurations was not established, likely due to the limited number of runs that were of sufficient quality for the Tiguan open configuration. Nonetheless, this first research towards the implementation of the Ring of Fire system for the automotive industry showed that its a promising technique, capable of defining on-site aerodynamic characteristics of cars and potentially serve as a validation tool for numerical simulations. Moreover, future research could investigate its applicability to accelerating, drafting or cornering cars, which cannot be investigated using the state-of-the-art techniques.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-03-11","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Aerodynamics","",""

During this growth, the relevance and convenience of online training programmes have been noticed by Bopinc, an innovation agency based in Utrecht which focuses on innovation in low-income countries. Firstly, Bopinc wants to keep up with the rising need for online training in low-income countries by providing online training programmes and the tools so clients can develop it independently by themselves as well. Here the problem is that Bopinc misses the in-house knowledge and tools to provide that. Secondly, Bopinc needs to design an online training programme for a client, Innovectives, in Nigeria. This training programme tackles the lack of vocational skills in agent banking among young Nigerian women. <br/>The thesis uses the design case in Nigeria as design research input for a development guide for online training in low-income countries. From that development guide, a part of the online training programme for the client in Nigeria is designed. The main design approaches to design these deliverables are remote design research and iterative creative problem-solving. Literature research is done from home, succeeded by remote empirical design research with a local partner in Nigeria. This empirical design research consists of collecting observations from practice, formulating design opportunities, creating digital prototyping and testing these by pilot experiments. Concluding from that a selection of promising training methods for the development guide and the online training programme in agent banking is made. <br/>Since the training methods are tested with positive outcomes in the context of Nigeria, which is a low-income country, these are defined as promising. This leads to a basis for the development guide which can be used in future projects by Bopinc’s employees and clients. That means that Bopinc now can design more qualitative online training programmes in less time, with the result that they can help more clients and so impact more low-income consumers’ lives positively, like the design case in Nigeria illustrates. <br/><br","Online training; Low-income countries; Mobile learning; Woman empowerment; Agent banking; Nigeria","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Bendor, R. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Micro mobility services aim to offer people new and more convenient modes of transport, usually across urban areas. In order to achieve this they make use of public space to implement their infrastructure on, for example by allowing people to freely park a vehicle almost anywhere in the city. One can imagine that this has a major impact on how people use and live in public space, as micro mobility services influence the design of a street. Since this industry is growing every year, the society-wide impact it makes grows along. Therefore this project focuses on the role of micro mobility in public space, and the relationship these services and operators have with people.<br/>This is done by making use of the ViP (Vision in Product Design) approach, where the present context is analysed and researched in order to distill trends and developments concerning the future of this context. This context consists of not just the different micro mobility services, but also other stakeholders such as citizens (both the micro mobility users and ‘non-users’), local governments, and of course public space. Eventually, a future world is envisioned for the year 2030. As this project also falls under the Critical Speculative Design-umbrella, this future world can be seen as a form of social critique on the current state of micro mobility, as well as the direction it is heading towards. Based on this critique, a new version of this future is composed that describes what is desirable. <br/>The final design represents the shift from the ‘undesirable’ world to the ‘desirable’ world. It aims to first and foremost communicate a certain moral standpoint to the client Springtime Design, and should not be seen as a problem-solving proposal. This speculative design should rather be seen as a prop to facilitate discussion on the topic of micro mobility in public space, and what is important in its future. <br/>Amby, as the final design is called, is an ownerless ambiguous vehicle that drives around autonomously in the city. As its features are ambiguous in their nature, it does not force people into a predefined system that determines their use behaviour. People can interpret Amby’s features, and assign meaning to the vehicle on their own. This enables them to control their own mobility in public space, as they can use Amby for anything they like. In its core, Amby represents a future of micro mobility that is more human-centered and democratic in the way it organises and designs itself. After all, public space is meant to be shared by everyone. It should not be compromised by corporates and local governments that exploit and capitalise on public space, as a consequence of striving for maximum profit and convenience.","Micro-mobility; Speculative Design; ViP approach; public space; Design for Ambiguity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Four years prior to its release, the psychologist Abraham Maslow published his book “A Theory of Human Motivation” in which the hierarchy of needs is explored (Clark, 2010). Above our physical needs and below the esoteric lies our need for love and belonging- the need to love and be loved in return (Robinson, 2021).<br/><br/>The search and devotion for romance is an agonizingly difficult experience from which a few of us have been spared. Online dating services aim to address the excruciatingly tedious process of finding a mate by offering a space-less platform in which a date can be planned in a matter of minutes (and from the comfort of one’s toilet seat if one wishes). In such services, however, drastic differences in activities between their cisgendered male and female users have been identified. In fact, the female demographic has a relatively high dislike-rate of profiles, often leading to the question: why are women so picky?<br/><br/>Mate selection is a gender-specific decision making process, where males and females showcase different parameters for assessing and selecting a potential partner. Instead of questioning the level of selectivity of female users, this research acted as a probe for exploring the extent to which online dating services address the female mate selection needs online through their digital translations of offline mate assessment factors. With this said, the following research question was formulated: How can needs for an offline interaction be met online to encourage Breeze’s young urban professional female users to like profiles? <br/><br/>A culturally-sensitive approach was used to uncover the archeological state of the female scope and their relationship to this modern mode of love pursuit. Breeze, an online dating app, was used as a case for the investigation as the service similarly faces the aforementioned problem of gender-imbalanced like-rate activity. The goal of the research was therefore to propose a design that would enhance the female online dating experience on Breeze, ultimately increasing their like-rate.<br/><br/>As Breeze offers an online mate assessment experience for an offline interaction, the research revealed that the content of the gap between the current and the desired female online activity consisted of behavioral factors as mate selection needs that were best digested through a visual language. As a result, four concepts for Breeze were created and positioned on a scale of present to future implementation. Each prototype provided behavioral information through different degrees of visual-orientation, exemplified by the proposed visual languages. The concepts are a response to the internal and external research, allowing for Breeze to stay future-proof and congruent with behavioral change in both the online and offline domains. The concepts were assessed and evaluated by the female scope and the Breeze company, leading to suggestions for design iterations and recommendations for future research.","Love; Mate Selection; Online Dating; Mate Criteria; Strategic Product Design; User Experience; Culture Sensitive Design; Young Urban Professionals; Female-Specificity; Inclusivity; Intersectionality","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

With the air space already operating near maximum capacity, innovations are needed to increase airspace efficiency. This research aims to design and test a debunching concept for inbound air traffic to increase the efficiency of the arrival traffic stream. A probabilistic debunching concept is created for the Initial Approach Fix using Probability Density Functions fitted on the errors in predicted arrival times provided by the EUROCONTROL Enhanced Tactical Flow Management System Flight Data messages (EFD). A bunching probability is detected when two or more aircraft have a probability of arriving at the Initial Approach fix simultaneously or within the required Wake Category Separation. A debuncher is created using a Constrained Genetic Algorithm that decreases the bunching probability by imposing en-route delay on arriving air traffic. The results show that the bunching probability increases with shorter prediction horizons as the uncertainty in the arrival estimates decreases. It is shown that with the probabilistic debunching method, it is possible to decrease the delay in the Arrival Manager by imposing delay en-route. However, at prediction ranges before 40 minutes before arrival at the IAF, the decrease in the AMAN delay is not consistent, indicating that the trajectory prediction uncertainty at this range is too high. Furthermore, the decrease in the AMAN delay is often lower than the imposed delay by the debuncher, showing that the decrease in AMAN delay comes at the cost of extra delay en-route. It is concluded that when the uncertainty in the trajectory predictions is decreased, the effectiveness of the debuncher increases and the effect on the Arrival Manager is improved, indicating improved arrival efficiency.","Arrival Manager; Debunching; delay absorption; Air traffic; Air Traffic Control; Debuncher; Arrival Management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The employed workflow for the investigation is a five step process, starting with the implementation of the deterministic climate impact model and carrying out of the design optimization for minimal climate impact. The second step involves the characterisation of uncertainties, where the uncertainties within the climate impact model are identified and quantified. The third step involves the uncertainty analysis, where Monte Carlo simulations are performed to estimate the variability in the average temperature reduction potential of the climate-optimized aircraft with respect to the cost-optimized aircraft. In the fourth step, a robust design optimization is carried out using a non-sorted genetic algorithm to minimize both the average temperature response and variability in average temperature response potential. The sensitivity analysis is carried as the last step using the Morris and variance-based Sobol methods, to identify what the key uncertain parameters are towards the uncertainty in climate impact of the aircraft designs. Scientific uncertainty is identified within the linear climate impact model for the carbon impulse response function parameters, species radiative efficiencies, the NOx and contrail altitude forcing factors, methane lifetime, species efficacies, and are all assigned a probabilistic description. Scenario uncertainty is identified in the future average global CO2 atmospheric concentration projection, for which different realistic future scenarios are characterised. Carrying out the uncertainty analysis has shown that the average temperature response reduction potential of the climate-optimized aircraft is highly uncertain, having a 90% likelihood ranging between 17 and 98 % of the average temperature response of the cost optimized aircraft. This is primarily due to large variability in the estimation of contrail average temperature response. Although the robustness-based optimization did not allow to find any significant improvement in robustness for the climate-optimized aircraft, it did allow to identify an array of robust climate-optimized design solutions. From the sensitivity analysis, it was found that the uncertain parameters showing predominant influence on the output variability are the contrail-related radiaitive efficiency and forcing factors. Additionally, a variability of ±50% in average temperature response apportioned to CO2 emissions was identified due to uncertainty related to future average global CO2 concentration projections.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Murray-Rust, D.S. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Tessa is a social, assistive robot from the company Tinybots, designed to support people with early- to moderate stage dementia and other mild cognitive impairments.<br/>By giving verbal reminders and instructions, programmed by their formal and informal caregivers, Tessa gives people back their self-management and autonomy, enabling them to live independently for a longer period of time. Next to this, Tessa can be used by home care organisations to save physical minutes of care, up to 132 minutes per week (Onderzoek En Ervaringen, n.d.). With the staff shortages in the health care sector and the expected rise of people with dementia from 290,000 in 2021 to 620,000 people in 2050 (Alzheimer Nederland, 2021), the use of e-health solutions like Tessa will become increasingly important.<br/><br/>This master thesis consists of two parts. In the first part, a distribution scenario is designed to implement Tessa through GPs, a potential market for Tinybots to target. Currently, Tessa is implemented through home care organisations with the support of their health insurance. From interviews with GPs and their supporting caregivers like POHs and casemanagers, the appropriate scenario was chosen. In this scenario, the general practitioner gives Tessa as an option to their patient and refers them to a home care organisation that implements Tessa. This scenario gives GPs the opportunity to support their dementia patients while maintaining their current role in which they assess the situation and then refer. Due to a limited time per patient, more involvement than that is not feasible. With dementia especially, most care is immediately taken over by the casemanager. Another important factor is the lack of financial support the GP receives. Without this support, affording Tessa is impossible. In home care, there is a higher chance of financial support which is therefore incorporated in the scenario.<br/><br/>In the second part, the focus is on acceptance. Acceptance of help and therefore, acceptance of Tessa is hard. To increase acceptance by this group of people, the perceived usefulness of the product needs to be increased, which is what the second part of this thesis focuses on. To do this, multiple solutions were proposed surrounding themes like increasing autonomy, independence, compatibility, social connectedness, and trialability. Adding the functions of listening to audiobooks and receiving personal voice messages will give Tessa a relative advantage over the current products elderly use and increase perceived usefulness and social connectedness.<br/><br/>In addition, a light version of Tessa in the form of an app to be used on<br/>people’s own devices is proposed as a solution to lower the barrier to accepting Tessa. An app is more subtle, is better compatible with the elderly who use their phone or tablet and who are still living an active life. When dementia progresses and home care is needed, the app evolves into an app that can be used by home care to provide care.<br/>Since material and logistical costs are saved with an app, a free trial can be offered to potential users. With this, the attribute of trialability is used, which can lead to easier adoption of a new product.<br/>In preparation for the launch of the Tessa app version and the new functions, Tinybots needs to prepare a website and information aimed at people with dementia and their informal caregivers instead of care organisations.<br/>By implementing these design changes, Tinybots can implement Tessa through the GP with the proposed distribution scenario. This means they can use Tessa to support people with dementia and their informal caregivers from very early on and for a longer period of time.","care robot; technology acceptance; General practitioner","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design | Medisign","",""

This extreme price volatility has forced market participants to hedge volumes as well as price risks. Naturally, electricity price forecast models are of great interest to portfolio managers.<br/>Current data-driven models are combined with expertise of traders due to the considerable uncertainty of these models. We aim to subject trader expertise to a transparent methodology using structured expert judgement.

The second elicitation uses assessments regarding data on past, current and future developments in the Dutch electricity markets to forecast forecast the variables of interest. The second elicitation results in a decision maker with a higher price forecast than the decision maker of the first elicitation.

(graduation committee); Uijttewaal, W.S.J. (graduation committee); Bakker, W. (mentor); Duinmeijer, S.P.A. (graduation committee); Clemens, F.H.L.R. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The added drag on a buoyant body traveling in a solid-body rotation flow has been rigorously studied over the last century with G.I. Taylor being the first one to describe it in 1922, a hundred years ago. A recent publication by Duinmeijer (2021) investigated the capacity of free-surface vortices to transport solids as a practical application to avoid solids accumulation in wastewater pump sumps. In that research, the assumption was made that a Taylor column exists upstream and downstream of the solids body, aiding the downward motion in the vortex core. This has however never been experimentally confirmed for free-surface vortex flows. The goal of this research is to experimentally check whether or not the Taylor-column induced drag force is the main mechanism for the downward motion of buoyant particles in a free surface vortex core. An experimental set-up consisting of a 600 x 1000mm (diameter x height) Perspex tank is used, in which controlled vortices can be generated. A novel combination of Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) and Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) is deployed simultaneously to obtain synchronised data of both the flow velocities and particle motion. The LDV device measures the tangential and axial flow components in a small measurement volume. Many point-measurements along a horizontal line through the vortex enable us to create the tangential and axial velocity profiles. A deconvolution process is applied on the LDV data to account for the spatial averaging effect of the LDV measurement volume and the wandering of the vortex core. The PTV system is used to determine the particle location over time, from which the velocity is obtained. For simplicity, only one type of particle - a buoyant sphere of 25 mm in diameter - is considered in this study. To obtain repeatability of the experiments, a particle dropping device is introduced to insert the sphere in the vortex core without entrapping air. A PID control system is added to the set-up to keep the discharge through the system constant. The first part of this research focusses on the performance of the measurement system, where the measurements of the flow characteristics of the free-surface vortex in the absence of a buoyant particle are compared to the results obtained by Duinmeijer (2020), repeating one of the experiments from that thesis without a buoyant particle. The tangential velocities measured with LDV, coincide well with the tangential velocity profiles found during PIV measurements by Duinmeijer. The axial velocity profiles however do not agree. Duinmeijer measured maximum axial velocities around the vortex core radius where in this thesis an axial velocity profile with two maxima is found; one in the vortex centre and one at 60-70% of the vortex core radius. Several additional experiments were performed to rule out possible causes for this difference, from which it is concluded that the axial velocity is non-zero in the vortex centre. The second part of the thesis focusses on the characteristics of the flow in the vortex core in the presence of a buoyant sphere. With the synchronized deployment of the LDV and PTV-system, the flow mechanics and the motion of the buoyant sphere can be simultaneously characterized. Such that the influence of the sphere's presence on the tangential and axial velocity components is quantified. New findings were obtained from these measurements, with the most striking one being a significant difference that is observed in the tangential velocities of the flow just above and below the buoyant sphere. Although this effect is described in theory e.g. by Moore and Saffman and Maxworthy (1970; 1968), it has not been measured before in any lab experiment before and therefore it was not expected to be observed so clearly during the experiments. The clear tangential velocity discrepancy experimentally confirms the presence of the Taylor column above and below the sphere.<br/>The last part of the thesis is dedicated to quantifying the Taylor column induced drag force, derived from the tangential velocity difference of the flow above and below the particle. This difference in tangential velocities induces a pressure difference over the particle leading to a downward pointing force. The magnitude of this force is shown to be 75±17% of the total drag on the particle, making the Taylor column induced drag the main downward transport mechanism for the buoyant sphere in the free-surface vortex core given the conditions used in this experimental set-up.<br/>It is recommended to investigate further the effect of the vortex core radius/particle characteristic length ratio on the Taylor column induced drag. The axial free-surface vortex flow is not radially uniform, with a region of high axial flow around the core radius. This axial flow being pushed into a Ekman layer on the sphere surface is generating the pressure difference over the particle and thus the downward force. It is therefore suspected that vortex core/particle size ratio strongly influences the Taylor column induced drag magnitude and thus be researched further.","Vortex; free-surface; Particle Tracking Velocimetry; PTV; Laser Doppler Velocimetry; LDV; LDA; Buoyant particle transport; Taylor-Column; Rotating flows; vortex flows; fluid mechanics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Because of its versatility, hydrogen is a promising energy carrier for decarbonization of various sectors. However, to realize the promising sustainable characteristics of hydrogen as a carbon-free energy carrier, hydrogen production through zero-carbon means is a prerequisite. The current rate of diffusion of green hydrogen is sluggish, caused by a number of impeding barriers. To enable green hydrogen to play a role in a sustainable future, acceleration of diffusion through the implementation of policy instruments is required. This research applies a System Dynamics modeling approach to simulate the diffusion of green hydrogen over time and assess the impact of policy levers from 2010 to 2050 in Germany. For two scenarios, the impact of a diverse range of individual policies and policy combinations has been examined, with policy settings varying in strength and timing. In the reference scenario without policies, the incumbent situation was corroborated, with green hydrogen diffusion initiating very late with a marginal rate, leaving the green hydrogen targets of the German government out of sight. From the policy exploration, is has become apparent that discounting electricity levies and carbon contracts for difference are the most effective policies for supporting green hydrogen production and hydrogen demand. Nevertheless, the policy analysis showed that the implementation of unconventional policies such as a ban on carbon capture and storage, is required to reach a sufficient rate of diffusion and achieve national targets. It was also demonstrated that the simultaneous implementation of supply- and demand side policies is a primary condition for the diffusion of green hydrogen. Finally, it was found that the timing of policies might have a counter-intuitive influence on the policy effectiveness. These results confirm the urgency and necessity of policy implementation to stimulate green hydrogen diffusion and provide preliminary insights in the complex dynamics of diffusion. From the modeling outcomes, several policy recommendations about the type, timing, and strength of policy measures have been formulated.","Green hydrogen; System Dynamics; Diffusion of innovation; Policy analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

Due to exponential losses, using optical fibres alone is unfeasible. Quantum repeaters extend the range of quantum networks, but intercontinental links are still unfeasible. Because of this, research has gone towards exploring space based segments, where a satellite can be used to make long-distance links by making use of the lower losses of free space transmission compared to fibre transmission. Here, we develop a general analytical model to compute the rate and fidelity of setups consisting of two ground stations connected by a satellite in orbit. We consider three different schemes: a direct downlink and two memory assisted schemes where the satellite is used as a quantum repeater, in an uplink and a downlink. Combining orbital mechanics for the satellite with a detailed model for transmission probability, allows us to track what happens to the rate and fidelity at any point in time. The generality of the model allows for a broad applicability, fitting to many different setups. We apply our model to different setups by tuning the different parameters and identify that the rate of the protocol will benefit most from increasing the multimode capacity of our assisting quantum memory and that the fidelity is most benefited by a good entanglement swap in the memory assisted schemes. If we have small links, bad memories or a bad entanglement swap, the direct downlink protocol will be the best choice, but for an intercontinental link we will need our memory assisted schemes.","quantum communications; satellite; Analytical modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","",""

These stakeholders have come to expect reliable operation and high quality of service, yet demand low cost, high scalability, and corporate (environmental) responsibility. Datacenter operators are confronted frequently with highly complex decisions that involve numerous aspects of risk. The consequence of bad decisions can be financial penalties or even loss of customers on the one hand, or a competitive disadvantage or unsustainable environmental impact on the other hand. Despite risk analysis being an integral part of the design and operation of cloud infrastructure, relatively few comprehensive approaches and tools exist, leaving many datacenter operators ill-equipped to make informed decisions with confidence.<br/><br/>We propose Radice, an instrument for data-driven analysis of IT-related operational risks in sustainable cloud datacenters. Unlike most state-of-the-art approaches used by the industry, Radice automates the process of risk analysis in datacenters and utilizes the large and diverse volume of data reported by the monitoring systems in datacenters, including environmental data. Underpinning this system is the trace-based, discrete-event simulator OpenDC, which enables the exploration of many risk scenarios through its support for diverse workloads, datacenter topologies, and operational phenomena. Radice’s interactive and explorative user interface assists datacenter operators in addressing complex decisions involving risks, providing them with actionable insights, automated visualizations, and suggestions to reduce risk.<br/><br/>We implement Radice and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the system to demonstrate how it can aid datacenter operators when confronted with fundamental risk trade-offs. Although Radice is designed to work across many kinds of datacenters, in this work, we focus on private-cloud, business-critical workloads, and on public-cloud operations, representing the majority of workloads in Dutch datacenters. Our experiments show many interesting findings, supporting our claim for a need for data-driven risk analysis in datacenters. We highlight the increasing risk faced by datacenter operators due to price surges in the electricity and CO2 bond markets, and demonstrate how Radice can be used to control such risks. We further show that Radice can automatically optimize topology and operational settings in datacenters for risk, revealing configurations that reduce the overall risk by 10%–30%. Following extensive performance engineering, Radice is able to evaluate risk scenarios by a factor 70x–330x faster than others, opening possibilities for interactive risk exploration. We release Radice as free and open-source software for the community to inspect and re-use.","Risk analysis; cloud; datacenter; sustainability; simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

In recent years, experiments have been conducted to determine the Just-Noticeable Difference (JND) in mass-spring-damper dynamics using a hydraulic admittance display in the form of a side-stick. These experiments have resulted in a model of JNDs when interacting with linear second-order dynamics. In real-world applications, however, control force dynamics also commonly include nonlinearities like friction. This research extends the current understanding of JNDs in linear systems by including the nonlinear case, where friction is also present. Experiments were conducted to determine JNDs in friction when combined with second-order system dynamics. Initial results suggest that friction JND can be independent of linear system dynamics as long as its value compared to the linear system’s impedance is sufficiently large. This means, friction JND follows Weber’s law, also when it is combined with mass-spring-damper dynamics, unless the level of friction approaches the detection threshold, which in turn can be influenced by the linear system dynamics. Based on the findings presented, it is possible to conduct more focused experiments to confirm and add to these initial results.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Accurate and robust vehicle state estimation is important for proper operation of vehicle control systems. For lateral stability control accurate estimation of the Vehicle Sideslip Angle (VSA) is of utmost importance. This thesis aims to develop an accurate and highly robust model to estimate the VSA. Common vehicle sensors such as the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), Global Positioning System (GPS) and steering angle sensor are used to provide measurements of vehicle states that are relatively easy to directly measure. Additionally, wheel bearing strains measurements are collected by the Load-­Sensing Bearing (LSB), which can be mapped to the tire forces that are measured by wheel force transducers. Insight regarding the tire forces could be beneficial to VSA estimation. The focus lies upon neural network estimators and hybrid structures, which combine the neural network estimator with an observer model.<br/>A large-­scale experimental dataset composed of standardised vehicle manoeuvres is used to develop and evaluate different estimation architectures. The dataset consists of 216 manoeuvres, which corresponds to approximately two hours of driving time.<br/><br/>Neural network estimators are data-­driven and therefore rely on high quality data. Various neural network architectures exist for the purpose of time series estimation. In this thesis the Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Transformer are examined in detail. The FFNN<br/>and RNN yield similar performance in terms of Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Maximum Error (ME) on the test set. The Transformer is unable to match this performance level due to the absence of a proper positional encoding of the measurements. Due to the simpler structure and lower data requirement, the FFNN is selected for application in the hybrid structures.<br/>To create a hybrid estimator, the uncertainty level of the VSA estimate from the neural network is required. To obtain the uncertainty using a neural network, various methods exist such as Monte Carlo Dropout (MCDO), Monte Carlo Batch Normalisation (MCBN) and the Uncertainty Deep Ensemble (UDE). These methods are compared using three metrics, the RMSE, Predictive Loglikelihood (PLL) and Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS). A combination of these metrics does not only evaluate the estimation accuracy, but also the quality of the corresponding estimated uncertainty level. The UDE consisting of<br/>FFNNs provides the best performance and even outperforms the single FFNN in terms of RMSE by a decrease of 8.6%. Therefore, the UDE is used to develop the different hybrid structures.<br/><br/>The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) are built on a nonlinear bicycle model. Different sets of inputs for the observers, as well as constant or adaptive covariance matrices create different variations. These observer variations are combined with the UDE to form hybrid estimation<br/>models. The different variations show equal performance due to the high accuracy of the UDE on the test set. The high performance of the UDE causes the measurement noise to be tuned to a very low level, which results in the observer ’trusting’ the UDE estimations. Therefore, the performance of the different<br/>hybrid structures is almost equal to that of the original UDE.<br/><br/>To investigate if the observer is actually able to correct neural network estimations, a suboptimal neural network is created. This network is trained only on measurements with an absolute lateral acceleration lower than 5 m/s2. This mimics sparse data of high sideslip angles, a common problem for data­-driven<br/>approaches in this setting. This causes the uncertainty of the neural network estimations to be higher in these operating regions. A linear scaling of the uncertainty level to match the variance of the noise on the other measurements does not yield satisfactory results. However, an exponential scaling of the<br/>uncertainty level causes a higher differentiation between low and high confidence levels. This exponential scaling decreases the RMSE of the hybrid structure with 11.4 %. Furthermore, a method for adapting the process noise based on the quality of the observer model estimation is implemented. This equates to<br/>similar performance in terms of RMSE, but introduces a number of additional parameters to tune.","Sideslip angle estimation; Neural network; Hybrid models","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-03-16","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering | Cognitive Robotics","",""

(mentor); Schaub, Hanspeter (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Spacecraft are under constant threat from hypervelocity impacts by micrometeoroids and space debris. Due to their large surface area and hence increased probability of being impacted by debris, solar arrays are of particular concern. For larger, trackable debris objects, collision avoidance manoeuvres can be performed so as the minimise the damage caused to the spacecraft structure. However, for untrackable debris, particularly among the 1-3mm size range, strikes can occur at any stage and without any prior warning. During these collisions, momentum transfer takes place whereby the initial projectile momentum is imparted to the target. Due to the Momentum Enhancement Factor (MEF) caused by ejecta being expelled from the target, the actual value of transferred momentum can vary greatly depending on the product of initial projectile momentum and this factor. In this thesis, MEF values for a range of different impact conditions and scenarios are obtained. Hypervelocity impact simulations using smoothed particle hydrodynamics discretisation form the basis of these studies, enabling high impact velocities to be simulated which would otherwise be impossible using existing test equipment. <br/><br/>Simplified models of Hubble Space Telescope solar arrays are implemented in order to gather large amounts of data and analyse the general trends and parameters which influence the MEF. On the whole it is shown that when the projectile momentum is corrected with the MEF to yield the actual momentum transferred, it can map to a whole range of potential projectile mass/velocity/shape combinations. This data alone is not enough to distinguish between impact types, but by reducing the very coarse MEF assumptions used in prior work, the uncertainties surrounding in situ perturbation data to validate debris environment models can begin to be reduced. <br","Hypervelocity impact; Smooothed particle hydrodynamics; Space debris; Orbital debris; MMOD; MEF; Momentum transfer; Momentum Enhancement Factor; Autodyn; Collision; HVI; SPH; Solar array; Solar panel; Projectile; Target","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Europe-Colorado Mobility Program",""

Often, experiments with UGVs use semantic segmentation networks for visual scene understanding. Based on the pixel-wise classification of a semantic segmentation network, the UGV can distinguish traversable from non-traversable terrain. However, it is still an open challenge to design a model which is able to accurately estimate traversability in a variety of environments. Variation in terrain characteristics and different levels of structuredness requires a model with a high level of generalisability. Limited generalisability will result in inaccurate traversability estimation, which in the worst-case scenario can cause the UGV to crash. <br/><br/>In order to overcome limited generalisability, a hybrid semantic segmentation framework is presented that can switch between different operation modes. The hybrid framework contains multiple environment-specific segmenters. For each input frame, the hybrid framework selects an environment-specific segmenter, based on a decision parameter. In this work, two hybrid frameworks containing different decision parameters are designed. The first hybrid framework contains multiple Bayesian segmenters, which quantifies prediction uncertainty in addition to the pixel-wise classification. This uncertainty quantification is obtained by Monte Carlo sampling to generate a posterior distribution of pixel class labels. The second hybrid framework consists of multiple environment-specific segmenters and autoencoders. Every segmenter has a corresponding autoencoder trained on the same environmental dataset. The output of the environment-specific autoencoder is a reconstructed image of the input image. The error between the original input image and the reconstructed image is used as a decision parameter for selecting the best performing segmenter.<br/><br/>We experimented with a hybrid segmentation framework and observed that it could outperform a single semantic segmentation network with a 2.6% Intersection over Union increase. The hybrid framework with the autoencoder approach resulted in a model selection precision of 99.3% on all the test images. Therefore, we can conclude that UGV navigation can benefit from a hybrid semantic segmentation framework.","Deep Learning; Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs); Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs); Semantic Segmentation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(mentor); van den Bos, J.P. (graduation committee); Kuiper, C. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The Eurocodes are design codes, widely accepted throughout Europe, that provide guidelines on how to deal with loads, resistance, and uncertainty. For most type of structures, loads and materials, the Eurocode has been well developed. However, for the loads on coastal structures, caused by wave, water level and current actions, no such Eurocode exists. Therefore, a new Eurocode is in progress. The preliminary version of this Eurocode is titled prEN1991-1-8, and will describe how to deal with hydraulic loads on coastal structures. <br/>The Eurocode has a safety philosophy based upon partial factors and consequence classes, but the extension of this method to hydraulic engineering is not so straightforward. A premature introduction of the new Eurocode could mean that important design aspects related to sea condition parameters, such as extreme value analysis, dependence and wave transformation, are underexposed. In turn, this might give way to unsafe structures. Because of this, it is important to investigate how the semi-probabilistic approach (proposed by prEN1991-1-8) compares to existing design methods, both in terms of safety and in terms of ease of application. The goal of this thesis is to acquire knowledge on how the introduction of the new Eurocode influences the design of coastal structures, and address any inconsistencies and issues in prEN1991-1-8 before the preliminary version is adopted as the definitive version.<br/><br/>The main focus of the research is the re-design of a coastal structure following the instructions in prEN1991-1-8. The breakwaters of IJmuiden are used as a case study for this. Three different approaches are adopted for the design: a deterministic approach, a semi-probabilistic approach and a full probabilistic approach. The breakwater elements that have been extensively examined in this thesis are the armour layer, consisting of either rock or artificial units, the crest height and the crown wall.<br/>Conclusions have been drawn based on any unclarities that are encountered in the design process, and based on comparisons between the semi-probabilistic approach and the two existing design methods, respectively.<br/><br/>The introduction of the new document prEN1991-1-8 should result in more conformity regarding the treatment of sea condition parameters and their accompanying uncertainties in design calculations. However, the new (draft) Eurocode in its current form does not seem to achieve this objective. This conclusion has been drawn based on the practical issues (i.e. room for interpretation in the document and poor descriptions of key concepts) that were encountered in the case study, and because the breakwater design that was arrived at by following the semi-probabilistic approach described in prEN1991-1-8, did not resemble the design outcome obtained with the deterministic and full probabilistic approach.<br/><br/>In addition, the semi-probabilistic approach is still a time-consuming method when applied to breakwater elements, while it is relatively easy to set up a full probabilistic calculation. It is recommended to shift (at least part of) the attention towards the full probabilistic approach, and explore the possibilities of making it the default approach for coastal structures, as it raises fewer questions than the semi-probabilistic approach and deals with uncertainties more extensively.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it can be viewed as a positive development that there will be one general document to consult for the design of coastal structures. Most importantly, standardised levels of safety and return periods are now available with the introduction of prEN1991-1-8, even though their interpretations are not always straightforward. It is of course also still possible to improve the semi-probabilistic approach as it is currently proposed by prEN1991-1-8. When this is preferred, it is recommended to include a more systematic explanation of the DA-1 format in EN1991-1-8, describing the characteristic values, partial factors and safety margins to be adopted in design without any ambiguity.<br","coastal structures; semi-probabilistic design; Eurocode; wave and current actions; IJmuiden breakwaters","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

One of the most common and wasteful ICU procedures is intubation. Intubation is needed when patients cannot breathe by themselves. Can we design a circular intubation procedure as a catalyser for systemic change towards circular ICUs? This project aims to design a pilot system to initiate the transition towards circular intubations.<br/><br/>Research was done to understand better the current waste created by the ICU. A set of challenges derived from the research were used to ideate on different systems which could improve the ICU sustainability. It was decided to further detail a system that allows reuse of intubation devices, articulating the first pilot around a specific product, the video laryngoscope. This video laryngoscope is used to intubate patients. It is composed of various plastics and electronics and has a relatively high procurement cost. Nevertheless, it is a single-use device, disposed of and incinerated after a few minutes of use.<br/><br/>Ideation on a system enabling a safe and hassle-free reuse of the video laryngoscope at the ICU with a lower environmental impact was done. Two pilot systems were proposed: <br/><br/>The first proposal, reduce, enables Erasmus MC to reuse the current video laryngoscope in use at the ICU. Adding a removable plastic cover to the device enables reuse of the device. By not binging the device in direct contact with the patient, fewer reprocessing steps will be required since fewer microorganisms will get in contact with the video laryngoscope. The second proposal, reuse, offers the complete reuse of a modular video laryngoscope. The main body would be, likewise the first proposal, reprocessed after not having been in contact with the patient. A hardcover would surround the product and would be redesigned to allow reuse and traceability of the number of reprocessing cycles it has gone through. Reprocessing in both proposals could be done at the ICU. Not relying on the sterilization department allows the ICU to be resilient and to increase devices availability.The use of a novel reprocessing technique, UVC radiations, is proposed. Compared to current reprocessing techniques, it consumes less water, electricity, and space. In addition, UVC reprocessing allows a high level of automation of the process, increasing its safety and reducing the hassle for ICU workers. <br/><b>Outcomes</b><b><br/></b><br/>A better understanding of the healthcare complexity and impact has been achieved. An action plan towards a pilot system is proposed, with which CO2 emissions, amount of waste and costs for the hospital would be reduced compared to the current single-use system. Future scale-up of the reuse system to other devices is envisioned, as well as replicating it into other Erasmus MC departments. Next to this pilot focusing on reuse, a set of complementary opportunities areas to introduce circularity to the ICU are summarized in a booklet.","Sustainability; Circular Design; Healthcare","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

As an alternative to the traditional take-make-use-dispose production model, Circular Economy (CE), which focuses on recovering and regenerating products and materials, has been gathering interest. In particular, its application to the construction industry, which is responsible for a high percentage of global carbon emissions and resource consumption, is of both need and significance.<br/><br/>In Taiwan, the construction industry has been highlighted for the government-initiated CE transition. However, as elsewhere in the world, the construction industry has been slow in embracing circular principles and strategies. Among the challenges is the lack of an assessment metrics for gauging CE performance. Existing schemes for assessing building circularity are few. In 2018, the Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) from the United Kingdom proposed a framework of circular indicators (BREEAM-C) on the basis of its original green building certification scheme (BREEAM-G).<br/><br/>This thesis is an in-depth analysis of BREEAM-C on its applicability and potential for adoption in Taiwan to assess building circularity and to promote circular construction. Methods applied include literature review, cross-case analysis and collecting expert opinions using semi-structured interviews.<br/><br/>The analysis involves scrutinising whether the indicators are rooted in CE principles, are realizable through circular strategies, cover well different impact areas, structural layers and life-cycle stages of buildings, and can recognise circular building practices implemented. The applicability of BREEAM-C in real-life contexts is further examined using two circular building projects, Venlo City Hall of the Netherlands and TaiSugar’s Circular Village of Taiwan. The cross-case analysis also serves to identify BREEAM-C’s strengths, inadequacies as well as room for improvement.<br/><br/>Results showed that BREEAM-C is applicable, practical and can be adopted for building circularity assessment in Taiwan though not without adaptation or localisation considering different concerns with respect to climate and safety. Green building rating schemes, which have been widely adopted in the past decades offer an excellent platform for developing equivalent assessment schemes for circular buildings. In particular, for practitioners and stakeholders in Taiwan, using its own green building certification system, Ecology, Energy saving, Waste reduction and Health, as the basis would make new building circularity assessment scheme to be introduced, accepted and followed easier, which in turn would facilitate the promotion of circular construction.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","Dominique Hiu Long Wong is a Master student in Industrial Ecology at Leiden University, graduated in March 2022.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Reaction wheels are often the main contributor to microvibrations on satellites. These vibrations are a source of pointing errors and therefore need to be limited as much as possible. The miniaturization trend in the space industry and universities fostered the production of very small reaction wheels, suited to Cubesat and PocketQube scales. A novel method to measure microvibrations for these kinds of wheels is proposed in this thesis. Due to budget and resolution constraints, a standardized method is indeed not available for this<br/>scale yet. The main idea behind this method is to amplify vibrations through a flexible mounting bracket on which the wheels are fixed and later calculate the source disturbance via a transmissibility function. This measurement method will be studied for validation against some initial requirements. Two types of tests are proposed for this purpose: In the first, a MEMS accelerometer is attached to the mounting bracket to measure accelerations, while in the second a laser is pointed to a mirror on the mounting bracket to measure displacement. The tests will be compared with two models: the empirical model, which is a parameter estimation model with test results as input; and the unified model, which combines the empirical model and an analytical model, simulating the equations of motion of the system with input parameters from a CAD model. The main results will include microvibration waterfall plots and static and dynamic imbalance values. Although it was not possible to entirely validate the test bench prototype within the scope of this thesis, room for improvement is left, with some hints for possible future work.","Microvibrations; Reaction Wheels; Test bench; Vibrations; Accelerometer; Laser; Small satellites; Cubesat; Fans; Empirical; Analytical; Gyroscope; Hall-sensor; Low-cost; Imbalance; Models; PocketQube; CAD; CATIA; Bracket; Eigenfrequencies; Jitter; Validation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Space Systems Engineering","",""

The framework also includes possible governmental and economic influences that could affect the decision-making of Chinese VC firms. Subsequently, nine in-depth interviews have been held with three different perspectives: Chinese VC firms, European start-ups, and Specialists with an external view on Chinese VC investments in Europe. By conducting interviews, it was possible to get in-depth information on Chinese investments in the past. With this, valuable information on essential criteria for Chinese VC firms when investing in Europe is obtained. After data gathering, transcripts were made, and data were grouped into themes using open coding. Finally, a within-case- and cross-case analysis have been executed to trace possible causal relationships regarding selection criteria of Chinese VC firms on one side and governmental and economic aspects on the other side. Based on the findings of this research, European start-ups can better assess the risks and understand the decision-making of Chinese VC firms investing in Europe. It appears that mainly governmental decisions from China and Europe influence the decision making of Chinese VC firms investing in Europe. Especially Chinese governmental capital requirements need to be considered before investments in European start-ups; however, VC firms try to circumvent the Chinese regulations as far as possible. The influence of the Chinese government comes forward in the fact that: 1. The investment needs to contribute to the Chinese economy 2. The European start-up should not compete with investments in start-ups funded by the Chinese government. In addition, European rules restrict Chinese investors from investing in sensitive technologies, making it increasingly challenging for Chinese investors to invest in specific European sectors. This happens mainly due to the negative coverage of US politics on China. Furthermore, this study has identified criteria Chinese VC firms particularly use when investing in European Tech start-ups. It was found that Chinese VC firms mainly focus on the following categories: 1. experience, personality, and capabilities of entrepreneur and team 2. characteristics of the market 3. characteristics of product 4. financial considerations. More specifically, based on the interviews, a list of 21 selection criteria is found that European start-ups could consider when attracting Chinese VC investments. To conclude, since every investment is unique, and the strategy of VC firms differs, it is good to consider all criteria found in this study, including the criteria found in previous literature of other countries' VC firms to get a better overview on the requirements Chinese VC firms set when investing in European High-Tech start-ups.","China; Venture Capial; Europe; High-Tech; Start-up","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","On May 22, 2018, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow On (GRACE-FO) mission was launched with the goal to map the spatiotemporal variations in the Earth's gravity field and to extend the 15-year monthly mass change observations of its predecessor, the GRACE mission. Similarly to GRACE, the measurement principle of GRACE-FO is based on three different key elements, namely inter-satellite ranging, precise orbit determination and accelerometry. The accurate estimation of the satellites’ attitude has an influence on all three of them. Therefore, any unmodeled errors in the attitude dataset product can propagate to the gravity field solutions and degrade the results. The objectives of this thesis are twofold. Firstly, to analyse the in-flight performance of the GRACE-FO star cameras, fiber-optic gyroscopes, accelerometers and steering mirrors. Secondly, to propose a method that accounts for the instruments' noise and errors and fuses the data, giving an improved attitude solution.<br/><br/>The noise and error characteristics of each instrument are determined by examining their measurements in the time and frequency domain, as well as investigating their differences in geographic plots. These analyses are performed for May 2020, when all instruments could provide nominal data. Motivated by the improved attitude quaternions and gravity field results that were obtained from the latest GOCE gradiometer data calibration process, the proposed on-ground attitude reconstruction for GRACE-FO is composed of three elements. The first one is the optimal combination of star camera and steering mirror quaternions by minimizing the weighted residual sum of squares of the elements of the noise quaternions. Within this combination, a set of constant parameters are also estimated that describe the relative alignment of these sensors. The second element is the reconstruction of the satellite angular rates in the frequency domain by applying respectively a highpass and a lowpass filter to the IMU and to the combined star camera and steering mirror derived angular rates. Lastly, the third element is the attitude reconstruction, for which attitude quaternions, resulting from the smooth reconstructed angular rates, are fitted to the optimally combined quaternions by means of a generalised least-squares adjustment.<br/><br/>The proposed attitude data fusion method produces an improved attitude solution that incorporates more accurately the noise and error characteristics of the star camera, the steering mirror and the IMU measurements. At the level of quaternions, it performs better than the official method, which is based on Kalman filtering, with noticeable improvements at frequencies above 10 mHz. However, based on a comparison of the corresponding derived antenna offset correction for range rate, very minor improvements are expected at the level of the gravity field. This is due to the K/Ka-band ranging system noise being the dominant source at the higher frequencies. The findings of this thesis work are valuable for the design of future gravity missions such as the Next Generation Gravity Mission proposed by ESA, for which a redundant accelerometer design is considered. Given the estimated noise characteristics of the above instruments and the proposed angular rate reconstruction method, the most favorable placement of the accelerometers is found to be in the along-track direction. If an accelerometer fails in this configuration, the noise in the required centrifugal and Euler acceleration corrections will be less than that of the laser ranging system.","GRACE-FO; Attitude reconstruction; Attitude sensors; Star sensor; Gyroscope; Steering mirrors; Data fusion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Space Exploration","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The SARS-CoV-2 virus, more commonly known as the coronavirus, is arguably responsible for the biggest global crisis in recent history. In an attempt to effectively deal with this crisis, politicians around the globe have been using simulation models in their policy development. There are multiple types of modelling techniques used for epidemiological transmission modelling (Alsharhan, 2021; Anastassopoulou, Russo, Tsakris, &amp; Siettos, 2020). Each different method used has different advantages and disadvantages related to them. One of the used simulation methods for transmission modelling is the Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) technique. The technique is a bottom-up approach, meaning it focusses on the behaviour of individuals to gather knowledge about the resulting emergent overall system behaviour. This technique specifically excels at developing early epidemic growth profiles, however, to gain this feature it needs to process a large amount of data. This data is not always readily available. Even if it is available, the amount of data that needs to be processed combined with the focus on individual behaviour, requires a lot of computational power for simulations making a robust uncertainty analysis very time consuming. An alternative technique is equation-based modelling, with System Dynamics (SD) being an instance of it with additional benefits regarding communication. This is more of a top-down approach, focussing on the overall mechanics of the systems instead of the behaviour of the individuals in the system. Working with aggregate values for most if not all variables to create increased understanding in the system behaviour under different circumstances. Because this technique works with these aggregate values, there is a less of a computational strain when simulating the model. However, this comes at the costs of being able to generate accurate early epidemic growth profiles, as this technique is not capable of fully incorporating key concepts for transmission models, such as heterogeneity of agents, spatial effects, and stochasticity. These two aforementioned modelling techniques, ABM and SD, have characteristic that lean themselves well to cover for each other’s weaknesses. Utilising a technique that dynamically switches between the two modelling methods depending on the state of the model, could incorporate the strengths both models have, this is called dynamic coarse-graining. These strengths are the accuracy and incorporation of key concepts for the ABM side of the model, combined with the simulation speed of the SD side of the model. This dynamic coarse-graining is still in its infancy, as research related to it is very limited. The goal of this research is to examine what dynamically coarse-graining an ABM model to a SD model would mean for the simulation speed of the model, and whether the results will stay consistent with the more accurate ABM method. The current research that has been performed on this topic has been on behaviourally stable models (Bobashev et al., 2007; Gray and Wotherspoon, 2012), meaning there are no changes to the behavioural mode of the model during the dynamic coarse-graining process. In this research two epidemiological transmission models are analysed. The first model will be a relatively simple model that is similarly incapable of exhibiting behavioural changes during the switching process. This Simple model is used as a test-case, for a more extensive SARS-CoV-2 specific model. This Extensive model will include the option of behavioural change during the switching process itself, meaning both the dynamic switching condition and agents’ behaviour is dependent on disease state. As an added benefit, by comparing the results of the two different models, the gained insights are more generalisable...","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(mentor); Tempelman, E.

Riding on the wrong type of saddle can cause various irritations and can even result in erectile dysfunction (Goldstein, 2007) and may in the end spoil the fun of cycling.<br/><br/>A direction in the design of female saddles was chosen because all of the female questionnaire respondents experienced discomfort while cycling (appendix 7). The project was done with saddle brand PRO, which doesn’t have a female saddle shape yet in their product portfolio and most saddles on the market are based on male research. Male cyclists have various male based saddle shapes to choose from, females only a few. <br/><br/>Female cyclists have a larger sit bone angle and a greater sit bone width. They also prefer a different pressure division on the saddle compared to male cyclists. Next to these anatomical differences, chaffing of the saddle nose, during the leg movement, is a problem that often occurs for females. <br/><br/>Increasing the lifespan of the saddle, being able to repair or upgrade the saddle and adjusting the comfort level are things respondents seek in a new saddle (appendix 6) and are in my opinion the best way to be more sustainable. With a modular saddle structure, the durable use of carbon fibre can be extended over a longer time frame and be standardized.<br/><br/>Additive manufacturing has the potential to be a manufacturing method for PRO saddles. Advantages are that forces can be locally absorbed by geometry and ductility can be modified. It is essential for PRO to get acquainted with the technique now to keep up with competitors. Next to that, this process allows customization and local production and could bring longevity by upgrades over the lifespan of the product. Being able to adjust the ductility and form is especially desirable for female cyclists, who have more sensitive pudendal nerves in their pelvises (Bicyclelab 2012). <br/><br/>The availability of new additive manufacturing methods and the clear focus of Shimano to produce saddles with low environmental impact, make room for this new approach. Therefore, the goal of this project is to design a solution that captures females’ requirements and transform these into a road/gravel saddle.

It is required for the construction industry to move from a linear towards a circular economy (CE) by circular construction (CC). The unfamiliarity in actions that need to be taken for CC is still new terrain for many companies since the whole life cycle of a project needs to be considered and is plagued with technical, legal and cost issues that obstruct CC. <br/>Contract forms such as Early Contractor Involvement (ECI) involve contractors in the design phase of a project, such as suppliers, builders, and demolition contractors, to engender a better design by sharing and creating new knowledge. There are, however, no sources directly indicating that the benefits of ECI also regard circularity. At the same time, issues that emerge with CC remain an obstacle for fully transitioning to a CE.<br/><br/>This research aims to understand better the issues regarding CC and if ECI would be beneficial in solving them due to the knowledge contribution of contractors and their collaboration with other parties in the design process. Therefore the research question is framed as follows: “How is contractor’s knowledge contribution improving circular construction in ECI context?”<br/><br/>The research consists of a literature study and an empirical study. First, the literature study was conducted to define the relevant concepts such as ECI, CC and knowledge processes. Next, to understand the knowledge contribution of contractors to CC in the design process, interviews with practitioners involved in CC projects were conducted according to the Critical Incident Technique (CIT). In CIT, research participants are asked to recall and describe a time when a behaviour, action, or occurrence impacted a specified outcome positively or negatively. <br/><br/>From the empirical study, there can be concluded that contractors' knowledge contribution plays an essential role in the feasibility of a circular design solution. However, the dynamics in collaboration between multiple parties can lead to better circular results. Since the collaboration can result in knowledge creation and sharing, developing a good work relationship between contractor and client and problems can be jointly solved when there is mutual support. This, however, also requires trust and transparency between the parties, and if lacking, it can obstruct CC.<br","Early Contractor Involvement; knowledge contribution; Circular Construction; SECI; Critical Incident Technique","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

It results in deterioration of potable and irrigation water quality and degradation of ecosystems. The problem is exacerbated by fresh groundwater abstraction, drying climates and a rising seawater level.<br/>Esperance is a small town situated on the south coast of Western Australia. The drinking water is supplied by a borefield located on the coastal plain in between the Southern Ocean and the saline lakes: Lake Warden and the terminal Pink Lake. Saltwater intrusion has been monitored for over two decades in this aquifer. <br/>Managing Saltwater intrusion has been a priority for the local water company and the regulator for decades yet a numerical model of the aquifer capable of quantifying flows and salinity distributions does not exist.<br/>In this study, a numerical flow model was developed as a first step towards a model that also includes saltwater movement, i.e. density-dependent flow. A site-specific literature review is documented in this report, as well as relevant saltwater intrusion studies.<br/>A 3-dimensional hydrogeological model was created with a kriging geostatistical algorithm with data from Airborne Electromagnetic (AEM) surveys and borehole logs. A database including climatological fluxes, abstraction rates, groundwater heads, lake stages and lithographic data was created. The salinity distribution in the catchment was analysed using borehole observations and AEM data. Groundwater salinity is more prevalent in the east and northeast of the domain. Salts from inland sources are transported to the coastal lakes by a combination of groundwater and surface water.<br/>The flow model was calibrated with PEST++ and a linear parameter error and sensitivity reduction was carried out with GENLINPRED from the PEST++ suite. The result of the study is a groundwater flow model that is able to quantify the approximate fluxes and heads within the catchment. However, it must be noted that the calibration can be improved. The relative error reduction for some parameters is large, for example groundwater recharge in areas with sparse and dense vegetation (0.91, 0.84 respectively), the runoff/quickflow factors towards the lakes (0.87, 0.95 and 0.88 for the Pink Lake, Lake Warden and Windabout/Woody lakes respectively) and reasonable for some of the hydraulic conductivities. The identifiability for other parameters (such as specific yields and vertical hydraulic conductivity) is low.<br/>Zone budget calculations show that groundwater annual recharge and evaporation are the largest fluxes in the catchment and are equal in magnitude. The annual average evaporation rate over the entire catchment is 0.74 mm/d. The annual average groundwater abstraction is the same order of magnitude of the flow that enters the ocean, 5,656 m3/d vs. 8,169 m3/d respectively.<br/>Modelling indicates that abstraction has a large effect on groundwater levels. The decline is the largest (&gt; 1 m) a couple of kilometres west from the town area where abstraction decreases the water table. The effect is less south of the Pink Lake (~0.40 m).<br/>(Hyper) salinity is the result of the net transport of saline groundwater entering into the lakes in combination with net evaporation. Water budget calculations show that the groundwater inflow in the hypersaline lakes exceeds groundwater outflow by a factor 8.1 for the Pink Lake and 1.7 for Lake Warden. Freshwater entering the lakes originates from direct precipitation and a calibrated runoff/quickflow component. This results in an effective lake area for precipitation of 1.6 times for the Pink Lake and 2 times for Lake Warden. In the lakes the evaporation exceeds the freshwater inflow by a factor of 1.5 and 1.1 for the terminal Pink Lake and Lake Warden respectively.<br/>The low flow velocities towards the ocean in the eastern part of the catchment underline the risk of saltwater intrusion in this area. Flow field modelling suggests that groundwater abstracted in areas directly south of the Pink Lake is saline.<br/>Finally, the current model is able to support recommendations for expansion of the borefield towards the area in the west of the catchment.","groundwater modelling; MODFLOW; PEST++; groundwater abstraction; coastal wetland system; saltwater intrusion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

The concept of mobility hubs was introduced to improve the accessibility of the different available transport modes. At a mobility hub, all sorts of mobility come together, and additional facilities such as pick-up points and restaurants are added to increase the attractiveness of the hub. Based on stated-preference surveys and expert interview reports, it was identified that mobility hubs could change people's travel behaviour in the region where it is located. However, these studies only provided insights and were insufficient to assess the mobility hub’s impact on the transport network. The parking demand in residential areas is also increasing pressure on residents to switch to different modes, and these hubs could play a key role in providing alternate transport options. As a result, this research aims to study the impact of mobility hubs in a residential area on the transport network in which it is placed. This study identifies the typology of mobility hub suitable for a residential area and the components required at the hub. This study also proposes a generalized methodology for introducing mobility hubs with shared modes in aggregate transport models. A case study is performed on the Delft transport network in OmniTRANS based on the proposed methodology to understand the impacts the mobility hubs can cause. In this case study, only the shared modes are assumed to be available at the hubs, and the additional facilities are not considered. Based on the simulation results, it was found that the travel behaviour changes majorly in the residential regions where the mobility hubs have been modelled. The private car trips were found to decrease marginally, but the total number of car trips, including both private and shared cars, increased. This research recommends further research on people's behaviour in the region in the form of pilot studies before modelling for simulation as people’s behaviour varies from region to region.  ","Mobility Hubs; Transport modelling; Multimodal trips; Shared Mobility; Residential Areas","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","",""

The race to develop the first full “self-driving” vehicle has started a decade ago and will continue in the future. From the traditional automotive industry and other technological companies that mingled in the race, which further intensified the research. One of the main concerns when implement autonomous vehicles is to guarantee the safety of road users, therefore ethical issues arise that have not been solved. For the safe implementation of AVs, validation of the new Automated Driving (AD) functions should be fully covered and tested to their limits. While the traditional test experiments are not suitable anymore to cover all the traffic scenarios and corner cases. The demand for alternative assessments that fill the existing gaps is increasing, the virtual assessment might be a solution. In this report, we will propose a holistic methodology that can validate Traffic Quantification Metrics (TQM) to measure the effect of AVs on the traffic space in a virtual assessment. We will implement the methodology on a set of TQM that are used in literature. The goal is to validate the effectiveness of TQM that can be used within the virtual assessment and then quantify the impact AVs have on the traffic. For verification of the methodology, a real-world human driven data set has been collected and aligned with the implemented simulation model. While in general, quantifying traffic with a data-driven approach, looses the qualitative prop- erties. The methodology has proven to successfully validate the TQM and shows significant change in the traffic space when AVs are implemented. While there are many more challenges ahead, this holistic framework is a step for quantification and acceptance of virtual test as- sessments. Hence, it is a recurring topic and essential for the implementation of “self-driving” vehicles.","Automated Driving; Simulation; Validation; Microscopic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-04-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering","Automated driving and validation of simulations",""

Two of the four climate scenarios predict that summers will become drier and extreme weather such as drought will occur longer and more often. Drought is a serious problem for multiple reasons. First of all it concerns large areas. Secondly it can take long before the effects are noticeable. Finally, the longer it lasts, the longer the soil and water system needs to recover.<br/><br/>In the Netherlands the high sandy grounds are the most vulnerable to drought. In comparison with the low-lying peat and clay grounds, it is not possible to supplement water from the rivers. Because supply from external sources is not an option, the sandy grounds are completely dependent on rainfall which makes them more vulnerable. <br/><br/>Humans strengthen the water shortage during drought as a result of spatial planning and water use. The current spatial planning of the landscape and water system ensures a fast discharge during wet periods in order to prevent water nuisance or flooding. So despite the fact that the Netherlands has become averagely wetter over the years, it still faces water shortages because the water is no longer available during dry periods. Furthermore the extraction of surface and groundwater for agriculture, industries and drinkwater companies increase the water shortage further during drought.<br/><br/>Furthermore humans cause desiccation. Desiccation is a consistent damage to nature as a result of structural diminishing of the groundwater level in combination with a reduction of the amount of seepage in groundwater dependent nature. Desiccation is mainly the impact of the modification of the water system to fit the land use requirements’: drainage for agriculture (60%), groundwater extraction for drinking water, industry and irrigation (30%) and other factors such as the amount of pavement (10%). So for nature the effects of drought come on top of the desiccation it endures consistently, whereas the quality of nature is already declining rapidly. <br/><br/>The graduation thesis answers the following research question:<br/>In what way can the landscape be used and adjusted to achieve a climate adaptive landscape for the moraine of Nijmegen and provide enrichment of the local ecosystem?<br/><br/>This is done on the basis of literature research, site visits, mapping, reference analyzes and designs.

This is mainly caused by a strong reduction of the approach and running time. However, to assess the capacity gains track occupation data, such as blocking times are needed. ETCS L3 Moving Block is still in development, so gathering data out of daily operations is not possible. Also gathering moving block data out of simulation isn’t always a convenient solution. For example, in simulation software FRISO, used at ProRail, ETCS L3 Moving Block is not (yet) implemented. <br/>With infrastructure data, rolling stock parameters and planned time-distance data, blocking times for a moving block signalling system can be estimated. The model presented in this thesis has an average error of 0.87s to the blocking time. In 95% of the cases the error is within a range of (-3,3) seconds. Given that ProRail plans with a precision of 6 seconds, it can be concluded that the model both precise as accurate. With the blocking times of all trains, bottlenecks in both railway corridors and complex nodes can be identified. One could sum all blocking times per block and consider blocks with the highest summed blocking times as bottleneck. However, this can only be applied for homogeneous traffic situations. Another approach is identifying bottlenecks by the shortest buffer time between two trains, also called a critical block. This can be applied for both homogeneous as heterogeneous traffic situations. An advantage is that it is not needed to split corridors into line sections. One could analyse a whole network at once and identify bottleneck at a microscopic level. By keeping the same timetable, the buffer time between two trains increases on average by 75 seconds (60%) using moving block over NS’54.<br","Blocking times; Railway Capacity; ERTMS/ETCS; moving block signalling; microscopic simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","",""

(graduation committee); Pasterkamp, S. (graduation committee); Janssen, C.J. (graduation committee); Klaverveld, W.H. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","For centuries timber has been the most commonly used material for constructions. All over the world examples of timber structures that date back from a few centuries are still standing today. The Netherlands feature about 60,000 national monuments with internally timber structures. These timber structures often need strengthening due to increasing loads that are applied. The strengthening techniques are narrowed down to a few options whenever historical ceiling designs, such as ceiling paintings, plaster works or timber beams need to remain intact.<br/><br/>Timber floors encounter two major challenges: low stiffness which leads to limited load-bearing capacity and low surface mass which leads to poor acoustic sound insulation. This research seeks to provide structural engineers to make a factual choice in an early design stage for using a reversible strengthening technique on a monumental timber floor preserving original appearance. This strengthening technique is verified for strength, stiffness and acoustics, both airborne and structure-borne sound transmission. To this end, the following research question was formulated: ""What is the influence on the strength, stiffness and acoustic properties of monumental timber floors by strengthening them with multiple layers of plates fastened on top of the existing floor?""<br/><br/>To answer the research question, a case study was performed on two monumental floors of the Prinsenhof Museum in Delft. These floors were investigated for their current strength, stiffness and acoustic properties. Then, equations were derived which considered the separate timber plates in the reinforcement technique as an equivalent layer. This equivalent layer is used to determine the effective stiffness for mechanically connected girders by the gamma-method. These equations were validated using software for 2D frameworks. Subsequently, a parameter study was used to determine the influence of the parameters on the strength, stiffness and acoustic properties. Finally, by applying the reinforcement technique to the case study based on the results of the parameter study, the strengthening technique was assessed more in detail by taking into account the influence of the non-cooperating intermediate layer.<br/><br/>The results of the parameter study and the case study demonstrated that the strengthening technique increase the strength and stiffness of the floor considerably. However, by increasing the stiffness, the connections between the additional timber plates and the reinforced component becomes governing. Furthermore, the increase in stiffness does not significantly improve the acoustic sound insulation, as this is mainly governed by the surface mass of the timber floor.<br/><br/>It is therefore concluded that strengthening of monumental timber floors, by means of several layers of separate timber plates fastened on top of the floor, is an effective way to achieve the desired strength and stiffness. Thick plates, small spacing between fasteners and inclined fasteners are a requirement to achieve higher strength and stiffness. However, additional measures must be taken to meet the sound transmission requirements. For the original perseverance of the monumental timber floor and reversibility, these measures would be dry floating floors. A significant fact is that dry floating floors only add mass and do not increase stiffness, which lowers the maximum allowable load on the floor.<br/><br/>A major limitation of this thesis is the consideration of the non-cooperating intermediate layer between the additional timber layers and the reinforced component. This intermediate layer results in multiple shear planes between the reinforced component and the additional timber plates. This thesis suggested to use a factor, determined from Roensmaens et al.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In the mission to slow down global warming, the replacement of fossil fuels by renewable energy resources is key. A tipping point in the adoption of renewable energy resources is notable, as they are becoming economically more viable. Offshore wind energy is considered essential in realizing the greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. However, high construction, installation, and maintenance costs cause offshore wind to remain in competition with fossil fuel-based energy. Therefore, further reduction of offshore wind energy costs is crucial.<br/><br/>The most common method of wind energy cost reduction is the upscaling of nominal power ratings by increasing the size of the rotor. However, an alternative way for attaining cost reductions might be the employment of a radically different hydraulic drivetrain concept. Hydraulic-drivetrain wind turbines have the potential of lowering the construction and maintenance cost of wind farms by using a shared hydraulic network. Hydrostatic power, generated by individual wind turbines, is transmitted to a central location where electrical power is collectively generated. However, challenges arise in the control of hydraulic-drivetrain wind farms, e.g., limited pump torque controllability and increasingly complex coupled dynamics for a rising amount of employed wind turbines. <br/><br/>Current control strategies for hydraulic-drivetrain wind farms are developed based on classical control methods. These methods become less suitable for maximizing the collective power of larger wind farms. Therefore, this thesis presents a modification of the existing convex economic model predictive control (CEMPC) framework for conventional wind turbines, such that it becomes compliant to the domain of single-turbine and multi-turbine hydraulic-drivetrain wind farms. The CEMPC method provides computational tractability by circumventing the nonlinear nature of the dynamics. A novelty in this work is that the CEMPC framework is scalable for the control of multiple wind turbines. Moreover, an additional algorithm is proposed to extend the applicability of this framework to control wind turbines containing digital displacement pumps. <br/><br/>In a simulation study, the performances of the developed CEMPC framework applied to a single-turbine and two-turbine hydraulic-drivetrain wind farm are compared for different wind speed scenarios. In all scenarios, the proposed CEMPC framework shows its ability to adequately control the employed wind turbines. When comparing the obtained power production efficiencies with a conventional wind farm employing NREL 5-MW reference turbines, the efficiency of the hydraulic-drivetrain wind farm is 10%-17% lower compared to the reference wind farm. To reduce the levelized costs of offshore wind energy, the hydraulic-drivetrain wind farm concept has to provide at least an equivalent cost reduction over the lifetime of the wind farm. The scalability in the number of controlled turbines makes the proposed CEMPC framework for hydraulic-drivetrain wind farms a promising candidate for realizing the necessary cost reduction.<br","convex economic model predictive ontrol; control; model predictive ontrol; wind farms; wind turbines; hydraulic wind turbine; renewable energy; hydraulics; optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Stresses on ecosystems can cause a decline in biodiversity, a loss of habitat and a deterioration in ecosystem services. To avoid further pressure on ecosystems caused by advancing economic development, new infrastructure projects should be integrated into the ecosystem. Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) are now mandatory for projects that are likely to have significant environmental effects. EIAs have primarily focused on mitigating negative impacts. However, recently new design philosophies have emerged such as ‘Engineering with Nature’, ‘Working with Nature’ and ‘Building with Nature’ which also focus on promoting positive impacts.<br/>Constructively realizing nature-inclusive projects is complicated due to involving stakeholders with dif-fering perspectives. Therefore, in an integrated approach towards new marine infrastructure devel-opment, the next step is to promote constructive collaboration between stakeholders to systematically investigate the nature-inclusive potential of infrastructure. This thesis describes a proposed strategy for doing so, within the context of nearshore infrastructure development located in or nearby coral ecosys¬tems. The focus is on how nature-inclusive potential of new marine infrastructure might be maximised, taking into account the local ecosystem.<br/>The aim of this research is to find an optimal approach to develop coral-inclusive infrastructure. This is done by structuring the required discussions between stakeholders considering socio-economic, ecolo¬gical and engineering perspectives regarding the nature-inclusive design potential of new marine infra¬structure. For this purpose, a method was developed that proposes a step-by-step strategy to promote constructive collaboration between relevant stakeholders, consisting of the following five steps:<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm; margin-left:25.2pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:-10.8pt;line-height:12.1pt; mso-line-height-rule:exactly;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:25.2pt; vertical-align:baseline"">1. project description, outlining the basic challenge at hand</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-top:1.75pt;margin-right:3.6pt;margin-bottom: 0cm;margin-left:25.2pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-justify: inter-ideograph;text-indent:-10.8pt;line-height:12.1pt;mso-line-height-rule: exactly;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:25.2pt;vertical-align:baseline"">2. project location analysis, involving a systematic assessment of the relevant ’natural system’ as well as the ’anthropogenic system’</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-top:1.7pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm; margin-left:25.2pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph; text-indent:-10.8pt;line-height:12.1pt;mso-line-height-rule:exactly;mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:25.2pt;vertical-align:baseline"">3.

Sint Eustatius was chosen because Rijkswaterstaat offered research opportunities on location. In an ideal case, the use of long-term consistent data maps the nat¬ural factors over a longer period of time. This provides greater certainty of results and recommended actions. However, the values that were reported for the Sint Eustatius case were not derived from long term systematic data collection. Furthermore, the substrate from the existing breakwater looks to be promising for coral recruitment. However, there is not a lot of coral development evident on the existing breakwater. Possible negative factors hindering coral development on the existing breakwater are: 1) poor water quality; 2) high hydrodynamic circumstances with high wave action in shallow waters which limits the type of coral species; 3) inconsistent larval supply through ocean currents.<br/>Coral reef connectivity seems sufficient and potential substrate is already present in the existing break¬water. Extension of the breakwater will lead to substrate increase which could improve the chance for coral recruitment in a hurricane-risk area as Sint Eustatius. A valid next step that could be proposed to aid a better understanding of this habitat is to invest in an extensive and dedicated data gathering campaign.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the main improvements derived from the application of the systematic approach for nature-inclusive potential for infrastructure projects are: <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-top:9.6pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm; margin-left:25.2pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:-7.2pt;line-height:12.2pt; mso-line-height-rule:exactly;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:25.2pt; vertical-align:baseline"">·  providing an overview of the steps required to create coral-inclusive infrastructure,</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-top:1.75pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom: 0cm;margin-left:25.2pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:-7.2pt;line-height: 12.2pt;mso-line-height-rule:exactly;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:25.2pt; vertical-align:baseline"">·  instigating the investigation of the status or the possibilities for coral development,</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-top:1.7pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm; margin-left:25.2pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:-7.2pt;line-height:12.2pt; mso-line-height-rule:exactly;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:25.2pt; vertical-align:baseline"">·  assisting ecologists and engineers to structure the discussion on coral-inclusiveness,</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-top:1.75pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom: 0cm;margin-left:25.2pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:-7.2pt;line-height: 12.2pt;mso-line-height-rule:exactly;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:25.2pt; vertical-align:baseline"">·  lowering the barrier to use (new) design philosophies,</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-top:1.9pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:0cm; margin-left:25.2pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph; text-indent:-7.2pt;line-height:12.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:exactly;mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:25.2pt;vertical-align:baseline"">·  and stimulating coral development and decreasing negative effects by providing design recom­mendations.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-top:10.15pt;text-align:justify;text-justify: inter-ideograph;line-height:11.95pt;mso-line-height-rule:exactly;vertical-align: baseline"">Bringing stakeholders with different perspectives together in one nature-inclusive project plan remains challenging.

Before designing, it is important to understand the context and create anthropometric guidelines for the target group. <br/><br/>The seat will be used for sit-kitesurfing, which originates from the sport kitesurfing. Its target group focuses on people with a physical disability such as SCI, amputees or spina bifida. The difference with kitesurfing is that the setup exists of a seat mounted on an aluminium frame. This frame goes onto a specially designed board for this purpose.<br/><br/>The project has been set up in cooperation with the Willem Hooft Foundation. This is an organisation aimed at improving the accessibility of adapted watersports, with a focus on kitesurfing. Research shows that accessibility to sports in general is lower for people with a physical disability. However, this is expected to be even lower for sit-kitesurfing. Currently, the availability of adapted courses is limited and people are left to themselves. This means buying all the gear before even trying the sport and learning the sport without qualified instructors. Improving the accessibility is done in cooperation with kiteschools offering adapted courses, where beginners can try out the sport in a safe environment.<br/><br/>What stops most kiteschools from offering these courses is the relatively high cost of the specialised gear. Currently, the biggest part of the costs consists of the kite seats. At least four out of seven different seat sizes are necessary to organise kite courses. Replacing those four to seven seats by a single, adaptable seat will greatly reduce the cost for kiteschools. Next to the financial aspect, there are practical and ergonomical benefits. An example is the time-consuming and difficult task of changing the right seat size to the frame. Ergonomically, the fit of these seats is often not optimised for the beginning kitesurfer of the target group.<br/><br/>The context, literature and desktop research resulted in key insights and points of improvement. Where information was still lacking, additional user or expert interviews were performed. Anthropometric data has been gathered through existing datasets on DINED. However, this information was not specific for the target group. Additional manual measurements and 3D-scans are performed with 9 people fitting the target group. This pointed out the differences between the target group and the existing datasets, but also provided lacking anthropometric data such as thigh width and location of the trochanter. Next to that the difficulties became clear, as everybody is different. The main design goals gathered from the research are improving pressure distribution through an optimal and tight fit. Challenges are the varying location of the trochanter, shape of the buttocks and the thighs. <br/><br/>The final design is an adjustable seat, reducing the amount of needed kite seats from at least four to one. This will greatly decrease investment costs, effort, time and storage. The project’s outcome includes anthropometric design guidelines for a kite seat and a 1:1 prototype to test the concept.","Ergonomics; Industrial Design Engineering; adaptive sports; kitesurfing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

The bending characteristics of a drop-stitch floater are more complex than common offshore structures due to different non-linearities: wrinkling, hyperelastic material behaviour and internal pressure-volume work. Getting a better understanding in the bending response is important to eventually determine the response and limit states in offshore conditions. A finite element and experimental analysis has been performed of the response in a three point bending load case. Also, an experimental uniaxial tensile test has been performed to evaluate the hyperelastic anisotropic material behaviour. Different yarns spacings, internal air pressures and face sheet thicknesses are evaluated.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Floods and droughts, also known as hydro-hazards, are phenomena that generally involve detrimental consequences to society and environment. Traditional practices for risk assessment consider flood and drought independently. However, they are two opposite extremes of the same hydrological cycle. Omitting their interaction might lead to an under- or overestimation of the current and future risks associated with such natural hazards. In history, a number of drought-flood interactions have been observed in various parts of the world. Research to these drought to flood interactions is still in its infancy. Therefore, this research explores the concept of consecutive dry and wet (CDW) events in the Netherlands. The aim of this research is two sided. First, the Consecutive Events Graph (CEG) is introduced. This is a radar chart type of graph used to quantify spatial and temporal changes in dry and wet indicators in consecutive seasons. These can be used to identify hot-spots prone to opposite extremes. Second, a fully probabilistic framework based on Non-parametric Bayesian Network is developed to model the dependence between dry and wet indicators. Such model can be used to infer expected wet conditions in a given region when dry conditions are known.<br/>For the CEG and probabilistic model a number of settings were introduced to quantify meteorological dry and wet extremes and to couple them spatial-temporally. First, a number of indicators were selected to quantify both type of extremes. Second, the dry period is defined in summer (June, July and August) and consecutive wet period in fall (September, October and November). Third, the Netherlands was subdivided in five homogeneous regions such that both wet and dry indicators were characterized on a regional scale. Maximum values of the indicators in its corresponding period were calculated for each single region and for every single year between 1965 to 2020.<br/>This resulted in a dataset consisting of quantities for dry extremes in summer and wet extremes in fall for 5 unique regions over 56 years. Application to the CEG shows potential to identify and quantify CDW extremes. Region-to-region and year-to-year comparison is possible to quantify changes between years or regions. Application to the NPBNs disclosed limited interdependencies across the dry and wet indicators. Using the NPBNs for precise forecasting of expected wet conditions is deemed unsuitable as of low precision. Making inference of wet indicators based on hypothetical mild to extremely dry indicators revealed multiple trends of those wet indicators. These trends are increasing for short term precipitation indicators (R1D, R3D, and R5D) and simple precipitation intensity index (SDII) and are mildly decreasing for the total precipitation (Ptot).<br/>Extreme dry events, extreme wet events and consecutive occurrences of these events are inevitable. It is expected that these phenomena will occur more frequently and become more severe due to a changing climate. A number of recommendations for future research is proposed. Findings from this thesis will help to smooth the path towards better understanding of the identification, quantification and interaction of CDW events or multi-hazard events in general.<br","Consecutive events; Dry extremes; Wet extremes; NPBN; CEG; Multi-Hazard","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-03-11","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

The aim of this research is to include evaporative cooling modelling and enhance the surface temperature model SURF-TEMP, which is in development at the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), to predict the optimal use of water resources towards mitigating urban heat. In order to test various evaporation models found in literature, we first developed a simple Python model to evaluate ten evaporation models. Differences among the simulated evaporative heat fluxes and surface temperature reduction can be around two folds under the same simulation condition for different evaporative cooling models. Besides the evaporation models, three equations to obtain the convective heat transfer coefficient were tested. We tested their uncertainties and determined the equation that provides the most neutral estimation on convective heat transfer coefficient. We proceeded to conduct various simulations to understand the sensitivity of these evaporation models with respect to four factors (wind speed, relative humidity of air, initial surface temperature, and initial water height). These factors influence the evaporative cooling efficiency and therefore the optimal watering rate. Two evaporative models that represent the higher and lower limit of the simulated evaporative heat flux are incorporated into SURF-TEMP. Results show that the model that estimates the highest evaporative heat flux is in good agreement with the lab measurement published by (Parison et al.,2020) when watering rate is equal or above 1 mm per hour. When watering rate falls below 0.75 mm per hour, the models studied underestimate the evaporative heat flux and surface temperature reduction. Discrepancies during low watering rate are caused by the absence of modelling of water conduction and infiltration with the pavement, non-linear relation of evaporation rate with vapor pressure difference, and the inherent error between simulation and experimental results even under dry condition.","Heatwave; Evaporative Cooling; Pavement; modelling","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","",""

Companies need to transition towards a more sustainable business model. One of the ways to do this is to become more circular. <br/><br/>The circular economy is an economic system aimed at eliminating waste and on the continuous reuse of resources. The end goal is to get rid of all the waste and, in this way, get lower carbon emissions. <br/><br/>With the production of built-in products for recreational vehicles, like motorhomes and caravans, Thetford creates much waste together with the rest of the market, such as packaging and recyclable parts. During their operations, they are not conscious of the effect which their operations have. <br/><br/>With the growing interest in sustainability, new laws are coming. The government will levy more taxes for carbon emissions and non-circular business operations. Waste, transportation and raw materials will become more expensive due to these new legislations and other external influences. <br/><br/>Besides this, there is a shifting interest from the end-user to more sustainable options. This creates a pull towards sustainability for Thetford, their customers and their suppliers. If Thetford does not change, this will already affect their business operations in the short term. <br/><br/>This project includes a design approach for a five-year strategy to make Thetford’s cassette toilets circular. The process is done in collaboration with as many Thetford employees as possible and with other designers. From this, I derived as a designer multiple relevant ideas. These ideas are tested within qualitative research with Thetford’s current and future target audience. <br/><br/>Another validation is done based on the direct customer’s interests in sustainability. The last validation is done for the interests of Thetford themselves. This validation is based on the investment costs of Thetford, the effect on the carbon emissions which the ideas have, and the extra revenue for the first five years that Thetford can make. <br/><br/>Based on these three types of validation, a hierarchy is created for all the ideas. To derive a logical strategy from this. Within the strategy, essential and desirable activities are distinguished. To get a better overview for Thetford on which activities it is most important to focus. A timing framework is created based on the mentioned information to create a clear five-year plan for Thetford.<br/><br/>The strategy shows that Thetford needs to start by being more transparent towards its consumers. This transparency is crucial for the trust their consumers have in Thetford. To become more transparent, Thetford needs to be more conscious about its sustainable choices. The second phase of the strategy is about closing the loop. The two main activities for this are switching to recycled plastic and setting up a recycling system. The strategy will be concluded with a refurbishing system to slow the loop in the third phase. <br/><br/>The project concludes with a design evaluation, conclusion, discussion and a personal reflection. <br","Circular economy (CE); Recreational Vehicles; Strategy Map; Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Pesch, U. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Farming has been essential for thousands of years, but recently climate change and environmental concerns began to arise, putting pressure on the agricultural industry since they are a significant contributor of nitrogen emissions, especially from livestock manure. Fortunately, there are start-ups that try to overcome the nitrogen problem by developing, producing and implementing technology that processes, recycles and extracts nutrients from livestock manure. However, although government subsidies exist to entice these firms, many still fail since they do not have a good business model and cannot capture the market. This then leads to the main research question: How is the manure processing and recycling niche in the Netherlands currently developing and how can business models help innovators in the niche succeed?<br/><br/>In order to answer the research question, a literature review on analytical frameworks was made, from which a framework was developed using the Multi-Level Perspective (MLP), Strategic Niche Management (SNM) and business models. The research question is then answered using this framework, desk research and semi-structured interviews. As part of the desk research, a list was made with over 100 firms in the Dutch manure processing industry, which formed the basis to select 8 interview participants from. Using data from these 8 participants, the MLP and SNM was analysed, from which patterns and links were identified. Commonalities between firms and many insights into the industry were found. Also, 5 main business models were identified over 2 general classifications: manure processors and equipment producers. Furthermore, barriers and opportunities of the niche were identified and an alternative framework and alternative business model canvas was presented for this specific niche.<br/><br/>The results were generally logical and clear, but it was not without its flaws. These mainly stem from this being the first paper to analyse business models for the manure processing niche, and due it being exploratory and broad in nature, meaning that sometimes the 'why' was not always fully justified. There were also relatively few interviews, further limiting how certain some of the findings are, but fortunately bias should not be significantly present. As one of the outcomes, there were quite a few recommendations for newly starting firms in the industry. The main ones being that newly starting firms should focus on a medium-large size installation capable of processing manure in a 15-20 km radius, offering a good quality product and/or service that works well, even if it may not be the newest, cheapest or most innovative method, and they should share their knowledge, collaborate and learn from each other. However, some potential areas for further research were also proposed, including investigating other types of firms in the industry, the lesser successful firms to see what not to do, markets outside the Netherlands, and also interviewing government personnel due to there being a fairly evident conflict between them and the agricultural industry. In any case, the manure processing niche looks like a promising solution to the nitrogen problem, but only time will tell where the industry will head in the future.","Manure; Processing; Niche; Business; Model; Recommendations; MLP; SNM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

However, the available computational power is still incapable of dealing with more realistic events involving complex structural dynamics and flow regimes. For this reason, experimental wind tunnel campaigns are still required to characterize relevant fluid-structure interaction events and to assist in the development of more accurate computational models. Nevertheless, conventional measurement systems present several constraints that limit the complete description of the phenomena being analyzed. This thesis is part of the research effort to define alternatives capable of providing full-field and simultaneous information of both flow and structural quantities in a non-intrusive way. <br/><br/>A wind tunnel experimental campaign has been developed in the Open Jet Facility to evaluate the ability of Lagrangian Particle Tracking (LPT) to characterize aerodynamic loads acting on large-scale flexible bodies. Three different load reconstruction approaches have been considered for this purpose: integral momentum conservation equation in its classical formulation, integral momentum conservation equation with an alternative formulation based on vorticity, and Kutta-Joukowski theorem. The accuracy and precision of each of the forenamed procedures have been assessed in both steady and unsteady inflow conditions taking force balance measurements as a reference.<br/><br/>The results of this thesis have proven the capabilities of LPT to determine the aerodynamic loads in aeroelastic wind tunnel investigations with acceptable accuracy and precision. Finally, it has also been demonstrated that the range of information provided by these techniques is superior to that achievable with conventional measurement devices, which improves the overall characterization of the fluid-structure interaction phenomena.","Aeroelasticity; PIV; LPT; Aerodynamics; Wind Tunnel Experiment; Loads; Gust Response","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","HOMER",""

An example of a case where reinforcement learning could be useful is the synthesis of near-optimal sampling strategies for self-triggered control. Self-triggered control is an aperiodic control method that aims to reduce the number of communications between the controller and sensors in a control loop, by predicting when some triggering condition is met and only transmitting a sample accordingly. Recent research has shown that greedily following the proposed sampling times can result in sub-optimal long-term average inter-sample times. Abstraction-based methods have been able to synthesise sampling strategies that result in better long-term average inter-sample times, by allowing for early sampling and considering the proposed sampling times as deadlines. However, these abstraction-based methods suffer greatly from the curse of dimensionality in the form of combinatorial explosion, which limits their practicality for more complex systems. This thesis proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning tool for finding near-optimal sampling strategies for self-triggered control of LTI systems. The proposed tool is evaluated and compared to a state-of-the-art abstraction-based method. The proposed tool is shown to match the performance of the abstraction-based method for smaller systems, while still achieving good results on more complex systems that prohibit the use of abstraction-based methods.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(graduation committee); Lieftinck, Adriaan (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Nitrogen emissions contribute significantly to climate change, especially in the Netherlands around Natura-2000 areas, and one of the main contributors is manure. However, not only does manure usually have high nitrogen emissions, a lot of it is in the form of ammonia, which in itself is very energy-intensive to create. Therefore MEZT developed a solution to extract ammonia from manure, reducing both nitrogen emissions and emissions from ammonia production. However, what to do with this ammonia after it is extracted was still unknown. Thus, the research question was as follows: Within the context of farms and MEZT's BPMED process, what is the best ammonia recycling process and usage, and is it financially feasible?<br/><br/>To answer this, first, all major potential uses for ammonia were identified, after which many uses were discarded immediately due to logical and fairly obvious reasons. Then, the remaining ammonia uses, consisting of mostly fertilizers, fuel cells, and selling it as a wholesale substance, were investigated further. For this, a scoring matrix was made based on a farmer's needs, and all technologies were scored on nine criteria (maturity/feasibility, process profitability, initial costs, reliability/maintenance, ease of use, environmental impact, safety, scalability/compactness).<br/><br/>From this scoring matrix, there were three clear top choices: selling as wholesale, ammonium sulphate, and enriched biochar. Since the stream to sell ammonia as a wholesale can be taken from either of the two other processes, a clear choice still had to be made between ammonium sulphate and biochar. After also investigating the effect of manure disposal costs, upcoming RENURE regulations, grant and subsidy differences, the legality of using both substances, and the combination of using it with other streams of the MEZT process, ammonium sulphate came out as the best solution.<br/><br/>With this in mind, the final process was designed. Here the potassium stream was also considered and included as it was part of the ammonia stream. The final process is a flexible solution of making ammonium sulphate, potassium sulphate, their (raw) mineral concentrates and aqueous ammonia. This allows for the most flexibility depending on a farmer's needs, while having minimal additional costs and the ability to 'cut out' unwanted parts/processes.<br/><br/>Afterwards, an economic evaluation was made. First, precise equipment and operational costs and revenues were estimated, after which it was combined with the overall MEZT solution train to form the final costing and revenues. From this it was determined that the additional parts to process ammonia was relatively cheap compared to the BPMED unit, but nonetheless the entire process was shown to be at least cost-neutral for reducing manure emissions and in many cases even lucrative for a farmer to implement. <br/><br/>In the end, due to the new and broad nature of this topic, it was at times difficult to make very accurate estimations (especially for the costing as data is not always available), but multiple sources/methods were always checked and the final choice and financial evaluation was deemed reliable. With this, the conclusion and recommendation was given to proceed with the development of the MEZT solution train to work towards a greener and sustainable future.","Ammonia; Recycling; Manure; Processing; Evaluation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Process and Energy Technology","",""

This thesis presents a comparative, qualitative analysis of these barriers for three European countries (Germany, Hungary and The Netherlands). Through Energy statistics analysis, document analysis and interviews with experts in the field, these barriers are identified, decomposed, and their impact is analysed. It was found that barriers causing economic non-viability of geothermal district heating, poor insulation of buildings, and various regulatory and legal barriers are significant factors that prevent further upscaling. Finally, a set of policy recommendations is presented with the ambition to achieve a ten per cent share of geothermal district heating in the household, public and commercial services heat sector of these countries by 2030. To that end, European countries' governments are recommended: to restructure heat price regulation schemes; to reduce subsidies for conventional heating systems; to increase and reserve subsidies for geothermal district heating specifically; to provide attractive incentives for energy efficiency improvements in buildings; and to establish clear legal and regulatory arrangements for geothermal district heating systems.","Geothermal energy; Energy transition; District heating","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Unfortunately, due to the lack of diagnostic tools, many children are poorly treated and not diagnosed. <br/>Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI) is the most preferred medical diagnostic technology for diagnosing and treating diseases such as hydrocephalus. Yet, it is currently out of reach for 70 per cent of the world's population due to its high price and complexity in functioning. Moreover, in Low-middle income countries such as Uganda, MRI scanners are not available due to the financial, infrastructural and maintenance barriers. <br/>Therefore the research team of Penn state university, Leiden University Medical Centre and the Delft University of Technology has joint forces to develop a low-cost, sustainable and portable MRI scanner operating at a lower field (50mT).<br/>Such technology can meet clinical needs at the point of care or in low and middle-income countries.<br/><br/>For a successful and safe implementation of the low field MRI scanner in LMICs, the device must conform to safety quality norms and adequately address the contextual challenges within sub-Saharan Africa. This requires the low field MRI scanner to be equipped with all necessary functionalities to function and sustain for the brain imaging of infants with hydrocephalus.<br/>Additional complexity arises during the brain imaging besides the functionality of the technology, the fit with the context, which is the human factors.<br/>Accurate brain imaging relies on a settled child lying in the MRI scanner to acquire the necessary sequences for qualitative images. Unfortunately, infants in low resource settings are not sedated and prone to move due to discomfort. This may lead to an incomplete or unsuccessful scan; costly follow-up rescheduled scans with the additional inconvenience of an anxious caretaker. In addition, significant motion during the scanning can mislead or inhibit interpretation, leading to diagnostic errors.<br/>Therefore, this project aims to develop a human-centred bed system of the low field MRI scanner that allows immobilization of the patient by designing a comfortable bed system that is inexpensive, safe and of sufficient quality to diagnose hydrocephalus. <br/>I designed a concept for the comfortable MRI system through an iterative design process based on the double diamond method. Stakeholder involvement, prototyping, and validation through experimenting lead as the main design inputs for further improvements of the concept's functionality, comfort, and usability. <br/><br/>This resulted in a complete MRI system that integrates the comfortable bed system in a sustainable MRI system while addressing the contextual challenges. In addition, this MRI system enables an ergonomic and safe operation, facilitates secure and comfortable insertion and removal of the patient from the machine, and allows mothers and operators to remain close and in visual contact with the patient. <br/><br/>A functional system, divided into the mattress, head immobilizer, mattress holder, double mirror and swaddle blanket, has been developed and optimized for local production and assembly. With the combination of these systems in an integrated design, MR imaging can be provided by MRI technicians with limited knowledge and reduction of human workload. In addition, by introducing the low field MRI scanner, the accessibility of MR Imaging in scarce resource settings will increase clinical outcomes and support the treatment of hydrocephalus.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","Double Master’s Degree in BioMedical Engineering and Integrated Product Design","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

For years, those sports and their communities were dominated by a white athletic male culture and were far from diverse. This homogeneous environment was, and sometimes still is, reflected within the outdoor industry. Thus, for years, outdoor brands, including Patagonia, represented this one-sided image of outdoor sports throughout their products, marketing, and workplace. This image has excluded various people and has caused minorities to experience barriers to participating in outdoor sports. Over the last few years, Patagonia has been contributing to inclusion and diversity in outdoor sports. As such, Patagonia strives to represent different minorities within outdoor sports. In this way, Patagonia attempts to convey that these people are also part of the outdoors.<br/><br/>Additionally, the brand provides minority communities financial support to participate in outdoor sports and to realize their community projects. Yet, the brand lacks internal diversity and understanding of minorities and their outdoor concerns and interests. In the endeavour for outdoor sports inclusion, Patagonia seeks new ways to understand these people better to support them to engage in outdoor sports. Therefore, this graduation project explores further possibilities for Patagonia to support minorities to enjoy outdoor sports. <br/><br/>Based on insights from literature, interviews with multiple people within the outdoor industry and an analysis of Patagonia, a list of key takeaways is formulated. According to these takeaways, the outdoor sports culture is slowly becoming more diverse, yet outdoor brands internally lack the expertise to represent and appeal to this diverse audience. Besides, outdoor brands need to portray outdoor sports in a way that appeals to people outside the traditional demographic. Lastly, this research dominantly shows that to understand marginalized individuals and to help them engage in outdoor sports, Patagonia needs to collaborate with minority outdoor communities. These communities understand marginalized individuals and know how to get them engaged.<br/><br/>A project vision called ""Outdoor Stories"" was established based on the key takeaways and Holt's Cultural Brand model (Beverland, 2018). This vision encourages everyone to create outdoor stories together with Patagonia. The underlying thought of this vision is to look for project directions to connect Patagonia with minorities. Thus, creating a solution for collaborative support enabling minorities to participate in outdoor sports. This vision to connect Patagonia with minorities is turned into Designing Outdoor Inclusion, the co-creation tool designed for this graduation project. <br/><br/>Designing Outdoor Inclusion is to be used as a tool for a co-creation session between Patagonia, marginalized young adults and minority community leaders. The tool consists of obstacle and context cards. With the help of these cards, participants brainstorm solutions in groups to solve exclusivity issues in outdoor sports. <br/><br/>Additionally, participants explore applying these solutions within different contexts on which Patagonia has influence. The use of the tool ultimately leads to concepts to enable marginalized young adults to participate in outdoor sports. In cooperation with minorities, Patagonia can then turn these concepts into products, services, and campaigns. Furthermore, the tool enables Patagonia to acquire more knowledge about minorities and provides Patagonia with a means to connect with minorities in a new way.","co-creation; outdoor sports; outdoor marketing; JEDI; inclusion; diversity; exclusion; design tool; branding; cultural brand positioning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

These small bodies were visited by multiple spacecrafts made by different space organizations through time. The asteroids give us information about the history of the solar system, due to their unchanged state since the early beginning of the Solar System. In the future, these rocky bodies could provide resources for use on Earth or during human spaceflight. Besides these benefits, so-called near-Earth asteroids can be of danger by the possibility of collision. In the history of Earth, asteroid impacts had large consequences for life on Earth.<br/><br/>During missions towards asteroids, navigation is challenged by the gravity field of the asteroid. Asteroids are relatively small and often have a very irregular shape. The relatively small and irregular gravity field of the asteroid on the spacecraft, makes the acceleration difficult to predict. Therefore, gaining knowledge about this gravity field during the mission improves the safety of the spacecraft. <br/><br/>Gravity fields of celestial bodies often modeled and estimated using the spherical harmonics model. This model has the disadvantaged that its convergence is limited to the body's circumscribing sphere, called the Brillouin sphere. Because of their often irregular shape, this model is not suitable for orbits close to the asteroid, reaching inside this reference sphere. <br/>To eliminate this problem, the alternative mascon (mass concentration) gravity model is implemented in an extended Kalman filter (EKF). This model distributes point-masses along the asteroid's body. The gravitational parameters of each defined mascon are estimated by the EKF using noisy position measurements. <br/><br/>To test the performance of the EKF, a spacecraft is simulated in an asteroid environment. For this simulator, the polyhedron gravity model using the 433 Eros shape model is defined as the real-world gravity field. This high-precision and non-diverging gravity field model assumes a constant density in the asteroid. The model is adjusted such that it also can include density differences inside the asteroid shape by dividing the surface shape model into numerous volume elements. Each element is assigned a density according to the smoothing Mátern Covariance function, which depends on the Euclidean distance between the elements. <br/><br/>The EKF is capable of handling asteroids with a heterogeneous density distribution with the same accuracy as for homogeneous asteroids. Its performance depended highly on the chosen mascon positions, as point masses can be highly correlated.

(mentor); van de Kaa, G. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries have one of the highest annual energy consumption per capita and rank within the top 10 countries with highest CO¬2 emissions. All of the countries have low levels of renewable energy share in the total energy consumption. Among these countries, UAE has been relatively proactive in promoting the use of renewable energy. The UAE’s Energy Strategy 2050 aims at achieving 50% of clean energy share in the total energy consumption by 2050. However, this strategy published by the government does not mention anything about the development of green hydrogen. On the other hand, several articles and reports have highlighted the large potential for the development of green hydrogen in UAE along with other GCC countries. However, these studies do not address the potential barriers that UAE might face in the development of a green hydrogen supply chain. Therefore, this thesis aims to identify the barriers to the development of green hydrogen in UAE and provide suggestions to overcome them based on the interrelationships and priorities explored in this research. The following research questions are asked: “What are the barriers for large-scale development of green hydrogen in UAE?” and “What are the most influential barriers to the development and what interrelationships exist between them?”<br/>In order to identify the barriers to the growth of green hydrogen in UAE, a combination of literature study and expert interviews was implemented. A total of 20 barriers are identified categorised in technical, economic, institutional and social barrier groups. Next, a methodology is chosen which helps us map the interrelationships between the barriers and identify the most important barriers to be tackled first. A combination of two methods is used in tandem to achieve the desired results. A combination of DEMATEL and BWM, two multi-criteria decision methods is used. This methodology is implemented to obtain two vital pieces of information; firstly, DEMATEL provides information on the interrelationships of barriers and identifies the best and worst criteria for implementing BWM. Secondly, the barriers are ranked on their influence on the system through BWM which provides us the order of priority the barriers should be tackled. Another novelty of this research is that the information derived from DEMATEL helps in filtering out the criteria and takes into consideration the cause-and-effect groups while choosing the best and worst criteria for implementing BWM, thus making the process convenient and reliable.<br/>After the application of this methodology to the identified 20 barriers, we are able to highlight the interrelationships that exist between the barriers and the order of priority they should be tackled in for successful development of green hydrogen in UAE. “Lack of legislature for hydrogen”, “Preference towards fossil fuels”, “High initial costs” and “Lack of incentives, tax breaks and subsidies” are found to be most critical barriers that need immediate attention. “High storage, transmission and distribution”, “Lack of privatization in energy sector”, “Lack of awareness in society” and “Safety issues of hydrogen” are other important problems that need to be tackled. Next, recommendations are provided for overcoming these barriers considering the interrelationships established.<br/>Solutions are proposed to solve these barriers in the form of policy requirements, pilot project schemes, addition of courses on the subjects of renewable energy in curriculums and other methods which best tackle the specific barrier in question. For example, to overcome the lack of legislature for hydrogen, suggestions for addressing all the barriers it affects; these would include promoting installation of renewable energy, provision of grants/funds for installation of green hydrogen production facilities, establishing subsidy schemes or incentives and promote adoption of alternative sources of energy and move away from fossil fuels. Preference towards fossil fuels can be tackled by promoting the applications of hydrogen alongside subsidies for using them, phasing out subsidies for use of fossil fuels and implementation of carbon taxes to encourage the use of hydrogen and implementing small scale demonstration of hydrogen technology in applications like public transport. Similarly, solutions are provided for all barriers. Due to the complex interrelated nature of the barriers, some solutions alleviate other barriers automatically.<br/>This study identifies the barriers to green hydrogen development in UAE, provides the order of priority to tackle the barriers and provides recommendations on overcoming the barriers. The outcomes of this study can aid the policymakers in UAE in formulation of a hydrogen strategy. Additionally, the methodology of DEMATEL-BWM used in this research can be implemented to other topics of energy transition. This study also provides a foundation for analysing further analysing the hydrogen economy in UAE. Finally, the limitations of this study are highlighted and recommendations for future research are provided.","Barrier analysis; DEMATEL; BWM; UAE; Green hydrogen economy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

This research first identifies what differentiates problem-solving risk analysis from risk analysis in other regulatory paradigms and proceeds to apply agent-based modelling to a case of the regulation of plant protection products in the Netherlands to evaluate agent-based modelling on its suitability for problem-solving risk analysis. It is found that agent-based modelling can well be used to explore a regulatory problem for which few data is available with domain experts to create a first understanding of how the system works. Furthermore, it is found that agent-based modelling lends itself to disaggregation of a regulatory problem in terms of agents, interactions and context and that this type of analysis can offer new insights to regulators to inspire regulatory interventions. The current research thus establishes the potential of agent-based modelling as a problem-solving risk analysis tool.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The recent decade has seen exponential growth in technology and information processing. This has enabled a paradigm shift in several logistical operations such as the introduction of on-demand same-day delivery of groceries.<br/><br/>One of the most relevant challenges in dynamic same-day pickup &amp; delivery systems is related to uncertainty about future orders. Lack of knowledge about emerging orders results in the selection of routes that are optimal till such time additional information is not available and sub-optimal thereafter. This induces a mismatch between the routes of the vehicles in the future and the origins of the emerging orders. In our thesis, we introduce simple anticipatory techniques that solve this problem and can scale to large problem instances of thousands of orders. In particular, our techniques utilize endogenous properties of the problem to affect both how vehicles are assigned to orders, and how to route vehicles to serve those orders. One of our techniques introduces rewards that reduce the cost of assignment between a vehicle and a group of orders if the vehicle is routed towards a favorable zone. A favorable<br/>zone can be a region with more number of orders that can be picked up at its nearest depots, or a region whose distance to the nearest depots is lower than others, etc. Another technique penalizes assignment between a vehicle and a group of orders if the vehicle is routed away from a high-demand zone and vice versa. We propose, formally discuss and experimentally evaluate several formulations of both rewards adjustment and adjustment with penalty + rewards.<br/><br/>We test our techniques in combination with the state-of-the-art Vehicle Group Analysis (VGA) framework in Amsterdam for a fleet of 10 vehicles and up to 3600 grocery orders. We further conduct extensive computation tests with varying hours of service under different conditions and compare the performance of our methods with the original VGA method. We identify that our most promising anticipatory technique can reduce the number of rejections in the busiest of demand scenarios by up to 1% of total demand. The increase in orders served comes at a cost of marginally increased distance traveled by<br/>the fleet of vehicles. Additionally, we note that the value of rejections saved increases by up to 5% when the system is not working up to its maximum capacity and allowing for greater scope for anticipation. Furthermore, our results underpin the strength and weaknesses of each anticipatory technique<br/>and highlight the importance of studying anticipation under a wide range of demand scenarios.","Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem; Same day delivery; On-demand logistics; Anticipation; Multi-depot VRP; Flash deliveries; Pre-empty depot returns; Grocery delivery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Biomechanical Design - BioRobotics","","52.3676,4.9041"

The thin-film solar cell which is a part of second-generation photovoltaic technology is faster and easier to manufacture. What makes them even more desirable is that they are lightweight, cost-effective, and can be manufactured by roll-to-roll production. The transparent conductive oxide layer acts as a front contact for a solar cell and thus plays a major role in guiding the incident light towards the active layer.

Aluminium foil is used by HyET solar as a substrate for TCO deposition. The bare aluminium foil has high roughness values and imperfections due to the presence of milling tracks and pinholes. The objective of the thesis is to do structural and optoelectrical characterization on this substrate foil and TCO using different process methods. <br/>Bare aluminium foil received by HyET solar which was pre-treated showed a higher roughness value when compared with the untreated samples.

Knowledge of these small members of the Solar system not only helps in defending Earth from asteroid impacts; study of the population might also provide valuable scientific insights, and open economic possibilities through developments such as asteroid mining. Surveys from Earth currently face challenges in detecting the smallest NEA's: day- and night cycles, weather patterns, and atmospheric distortion have encouraged several recent studies into the possibility of NEA surveys from deep space.<br/><br/>In this thesis, an extension to these proposals is studied: using multiple spacecraft co-operating on the survey. Next to the immediate increase in the data gathering capabilities, such systems offer synergistic benefits: Firstly, spacecraft can be placed in such a way as to cover each others blind spots caused by e.g. Solar glare. Secondly, imaging from multiple directions allows for triangulation to more quickly determine the orbit. Lastly, such a system could feature implementation of advanced search strategies, for example utilizing a part of the system as follow-up telescopes.<br/><br/>As one of the first works on predicting and optimizing the performance of such a multi-spacecraft NEA survey system, the work aims to provide a foundation on how to compose such a system, and what orbital configurations to select for its operation. A simulation tool was developed which explicitly models a NEA survey, and this model was validated against other research works and surveys. Using this tool, the behavior of the system is studied under changing of various parameters such as the number of spacecraft, thermal infrared or visual light telescopes, and various orbital elements. Following this, numerical optimization was performed to obtain conclusions with regards to the optimal composition and position of the system. The findings are supported by an investigation into the underlying principles driving the performance of the survey. Ultimately, results are obtained which can be used for more detailed studies into design of future NEA survey missions, or trade-offs against other concepts.","asteroid; near-earth asteroid; identification; asteroid survey; space system; distributed space system; simulation; optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","class=""MsoNormal"">Impacts on offshore installations and ships can cause strains at high rates. It is known that mild steel lower yield stress and hardening are strain rate dependent. Measuring this material behavior is not easy, as test results from many researchers, show heavy vibration. Vibration is normally referred to as ringing. This thesis aims at measuring stress-strain behavior of mild steel at intermediate strain rates between 100 &#x1d460; −1 and 500 &#x1d460; −1 with minimal vibration. Two major characteristics from stress-strain behavior in this research, are the lower yield stress and plastic tangent modulus. A comparison of public test results, showed a steel characteristic for transferring quasi-static stresses, to stresses at a desired strain rate. This characteristic has been used to transfer a quasi-static stressstrain curve to stress-strain curves at intermediate strain rates. This strain rate dependent material model is used in calculations. The test is modelled by means of an explicit finite element analysis. The analysis showed that adding a plastic hinge in the specimen, can reduce bending and vibration. The test setup is a drop tower, where the drop weight falls into a U-shaped specimen. Strains are measured in an elastically and plastically deforming area on the specimen. Stresses in the plastic area can be obtained from strains in the elastically deforming area. Strains are measured by means of digital image correlation. Stresses are compared with loads obtained from drop weight positions and consequent accelerations. Measured plastic strains compare well to predicted plastic strains. However, stresses from first tests show vibration in a range of 20 percent of the average stress or more. If such bending occurs, it is not exactly known where the average stress is. However, the amount and direction of bending can be obtained from the 3D position measurements. The bending investigation is only used to identify causes of ringing. With insight in bending and loads from two separate measurements, this test is considered to produce results that represent the material behavior of mild steel. A raw test result with a vibration range of 20 percent of the average stress, in the first test setup, shows the potential for obtaining raw measurements from a U-shaped specimen in a drop test.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-03-07","","","","Marine Technology","",""

To ensure the safety of these railway bridges, the propagation of the fatigue crack needs to be analysed by performing regular inspection on the bridges. The frequency of these is required by the defined inspection intervals, which are based on the critical crack length and the number of loading cycles leading to this crack length. Laboratory tests and measurements on the bridges have been performed in the past to define inspection intervals, but had given only an approximation of the real situation. By creating a finite element model of a coped beam, a crack initiation and propagation analysis can be performed. This analysis provides an indication after how many loading cycles the crack will reach a critical length and guides towards revised inspection intervals.<br/><br/>In this thesis, the objective is to take the first steps towards the revised inspection interval by performing a finite element analysis of the crack propagation of steel railway bridges. More specifically, this means an finite element analysis of the coped beam with extended finite element method.<br/><br/>To achieve this goal, first, the location of the fatigue crack initiation has been investigated to understand where exactly in the cope the crack starts. This was performed by creating a local 3D linear elastic FE-model of the coped beam based on the boundary conditions, geometry, and loading from laboratory tests performed by Michael C.H. Yam and J.J. Roger Cheng. The the longitudinal stresses of the model were compared with stresses measured during the laboratory test to validate the crack initiation model. After the model was validated, the location of crack initiation was determined by identifying the location of the peak stresses.<br/><br/>After completion of the crack initiation analysis, the crack propagation analysis can commence. For this, the FE-model was transformed from the crack initiation to the crack propagation model. In the same manner as with the crack initiation model, the propagation model has been based on the boundary conditions, geometry, and loading from the laboratory test. Since no path of the crack was registered during these laboratory tests, and thus could not be implemented in the model, a method for crack propagation analysis called extended finite element method (XFEM) has been used. The accuracy of this method has been confirmed by validating the stress intensity factor (SIF) values obtained for stationary cracks with three different mesh topologies and comparing the results with results from two established methods; J-integral and VCCT. <br/><br/>After the validation of the crack propagation model, a sensitivity study was performed to understand the potential influence of modelling decisions on the number of load cycles versus crack length relation. With the mesh sensitivity analysis, a linear trend has been obtained for models with matching number of elements through the thickness. For the initial crack size sensitivity analysis, the effect of the number of elements through the thickness and the effect of mesh topology have been investigated. One element through the thickness and parallel mesh topology led to lower variation in the results. <br/><br/>Additionally, a new value for the previously assumed Paris law coefficient C has been obtained by calibrating the number of cycles versus the crack length curve from FE-model to match the laboratory test results.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this research provides recommendations for modelling crack propagation in a coped beam. The results are more reliable when keeping at least five finely meshed elements around the crack tip, using a parallel mesh topology, and using one element through the thickness. New value for the C coefficient from the Paris law has been suggested based on this research.<br/><br/>The next step in this research is a continuation of the crack propagation model analysis to reduce the variation in the results. Furthermore, different loading positions and expansion from a simply supported beam model to a model with multiple spans should be analysed to bring us one step closer to the ultimate goal of redefining the inspection interval for coped beam steel bridges based on the models.","Fatigue; Coped beams; XFEM; Crack growth; Crack propagation; LEFM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Accurate estimates of muscle tendon unit lengths (MTU) and elongation velocities could give insight into the risk of injury during field hockey specific movements. For accurate measurements the hockey field would be best suited. Inertial measurement technology allows for such measurements; however, a method of applying this technology to hockey must first be developed and applied to athletes. The goal of this study is to develop this method and indicate what field hockey-related activities might be accompanied with a higher risk for hamstring injuries. Three elite female field hockey athletes participated in this study, performing ten field hockey-specific exercises. The results obtained with inertial measurement technology were compared to the results obtained with the commonly used optoelectric motion capture system. This method showed very good (0.850 - 0.950) to excellent (0.960 - 1.000) coefficients of multiple correlation values. Furthermore, absolute peak values for MTU lengths and elongation velocities were obtained. The results showed that the MTU length and elongation velocity were higher during running while dragging the ball on the hockey stick than during running without ball. The MTU length was also higher during various types of hits than during running. Additionally, the MTU length and elongation velocity were higher on the left leg compared to the right leg. Excessive stretch and high elongation velocities could indicate a greater chance of muscle injuries. This study shows that MTU lengths and elongation velocities can be obtained with inertial measurements and could in part, explain the relatively high hamstring injury rate among female field hockey athletes.","Field Hockey; Inertial Measurement Unit; Muscle Tendon Unit length; Elongation velocity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Biomechanical Design | Haptic Interfaces","",""

In the Netherlands, sand nourishments are executed every few years in order to maintain the country’s sandy beaches for purposes of safety, recreation, and ecology. In order to determine where to carry out these nourishments, the whole sandy coastline of the Netherlands is measured annually by Rijkswaterstaat. This annual survey, called JAarlijkse KUStmetingen (JARKUS), monitors where (increasing) erosive trends appear or persist and, due to its timespan (dating back to 1843), is a valuable dataset to understand the evolution of the Dutch coast. However, this measurement survey is restricted to its annual frequency and is costly. The use of optical satellite imagery for measuring land cover types and geographic features is rapidly becoming more popular due to their high temporal frequency and relatively low costs (due to the public availability of some satellite missions, such as NASA’s Landsat and ESA’s Sentinel-2 missions). This research studied the possibilities of using optical satellite imagery for measuring beach width dynamics in addition to the existing measurement campaigns. <br/><br/>In this study, we derived the Satellite-Derived Beach Width (SDBW) as the cross-shore distance between the Satellite-Derived Shoreline (SDS) and the Satellite-Derived Vegetation line (SDV). We adopted a widely used and validated method for SDS detection and adapted this method to establish the SDV detection method. The SDS and SDV are derived from optical satellites by deriving vectors from the border between two contrasting land cover types that are identified by differences in (sun)light reflectance values. The SDS and is derived from the contrast between water and land, the SDV from the contrast between and sand/sediment and vegetation. The SDBW data was measured from both composite and individual satellite images. The different techniques are suited for different applications, and both have their advantages and disadvantages. A composite image is an image that is composed of a sequence of individual satellite images available within a set window. E.g., a composite is the average image of all those images. Recent research showed that, at the cost of temporal resolution, composite images are suited for analysis of long-term (structural) shoreline trends since they mitigate certain factors influencing image quality (such as clouds and cloud shadows, waves and tides, and satellite instrument errors). Individual images are better suited for analyses of short-term dynamics since they provide instantaneous measurement data. However, they are hampered more by the factors mentioned above, and hence need to be screened before use...<br","Beach Width Dynamics; Remote Sensing; Optical Satellite Imagery; Coastal Dynamics; Ameland; Python programming; Google Earth Engine; Satellite-Derived Beach Width","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","53.46375592768744, 5.670982761098642"

Erasmus MC is a leading hospital in health care innovation and thrives on pioneering this shift towards value-based care. Value-based care is a philosophy of delivering optimal care for the patient while reducing costs. <br/><br/>To reach this, Erasmus MC has implemented a five-year strategy focused on dedication and technology. Dedication emphasizes the importance of providing a patient with the right treatments and supporting them in the process. Technology is seen as an enabler in both the procedures as well as improving patient experience. The question now is how to create the perfect balance between dedication and technology to optimize the patient experience while streamlining the journey for Erasmus MC staff. This project focuses on the specific case of the Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) procedure. This procedure involves the implantation of valve prostheses in the native aortic valve of the patient’s heart by percutaneous puncture via their transfemoral artery. It is a minimally invasive procedure under local anesthesia, meaning they are vividly awake during the procedure. TAVI patients are, on average, 80 years old. <br/><br/>This project evolved from a problem identified by an interventional cardiologist at the Erasmus MC. He noticed that technological advancements were improving the procedure; however, the patient experience was not progressing. <br/>The majority of the patients were anxious and uninformed prior to the procedure. This is a problem because pre-operative anxiety affects the interaction between cardiologist and patient, it hinders the person from processing information (Cammen, 2021), affects the post-operative recovery process (Yuzkat et al., 2020), and decreases overall patient satisfaction (Herrera et al.,2009). Therefore, the challenge was: Design a tool to improve the patient experience by reducing pre-operative anxiety of patients who undergo a TAVI.<br/><br/>To tackle this, extensive user research was conducted on the journey of TAVI patients. This led to a reliable patient experience curve identifying the pain and success points as well as the reasons for these peaks. Concurrently, the enablers of positive patient experience are defined through a literature review. This led to the concept proposal, an improved TAVI patient journey. The new patient journey consists of (1) several new touchpoints throughout the continuum of care that ensures the patient feels recognized and improves the continuity, (2) a physical care package (Zorgpakket) delivered to the patient's doorstep, supporting the patient by providing them with the right tools to prepare themselves for the procedure, and (3) a 3D animation of the TAVI procedure, creating an accessible manner for elderly patients to use technology which has an added value for the patient journey. <br/>An extensive validation study has proven that the new patient journey, specifically the Zorgpakket, helps the patient feel at ease by providing the tools to form the right expectations and increase trust through empathy and professionalism. The aimed long-term effect is to eliminate the pain points in the experience curve. <br/>The proposal is a desirable solution that fits the patient's needs while streamlining the workflow of the healthcare professionals. The different aspects of the project are applicable in other areas within the healthcare sector and will serve as inspiration within Erasmus MC to reach the goal of value-based care. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br","Patient Experience; Communication; Healthcare Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

These criteria have directly resulted in the proposal of a lattice that is able to compete with the Kagome lattice, which in the literature is identified as a lattice material with optimal in-plane stiffness and shape-morphing capabilities. The selection of suitable lattice materials is mostly related to the properties of the lattice before shape-morphing. Naturally the question 'What is the effect of morphing on the macroscopic properties of the lattice material?' arises. <br/><br/>This research investigates the relationship between kinematic properties of the pin-jointed Kagome truss and elastic macroscopic properties of the welded-jointed Kagome lattice during deformation. The kinematic properties of the Kagome truss are explored at all possible collapse configurations. The same collapse configurations of the pin-jointed truss are then used to determine the elastic response of the welded-jointed twisted lattice with the use of the commercial finite element program ABAQUS. <br/><br/>The results show that only the pin-jointed initial configuration of the Kagome truss can support all macroscopic loads without inducing a collapse of the truss, no other pin-jointed configuration shares this property. Indicating different elastic responses of the initial welded-jointed lattice and the twisted lattices. The results of the finite element analysis support this finding, as it can be shown that the type of deformation of the initial configuration of a welded-jointed lattice differs from the deformation of any other twisted configuration. A stark difference between Young's modulus is observed between the initial configuration and the twisted configurations. The deformation induced by single member actuation creates a weak layer in the lattice. Therefore the attractive properties of the Kagome lattice are not preserved during shape-morphing.","Lattice Material; geometric nonlinear; elastic properties","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Precision and Microsystems Engineering","",""

The developments and deployment of these satellites increased rapidly in the last decade. CubeSats and more recently PocketQubes are an interesting opportunity for lower budget organizations or universities. The ability to control the motion of these satellites becomes more important and hence a propulsion system is required. <br/><br/>This thesis presents the first steps in the development process of a dedicated control system for the vaporizing liquid micro-resistojet (VLM) of the Delft University of Technology. The produced thrust of the micropropulsion system is regulated by two main control parameters: temperature and pressure. The report proposes a different control mechanism for each control parameter and three different operational envelopes. The first two operational envelopes are solely designed for the experimental phase of the project, to examine the behavior of the control system on the separate control parameters. The final operational envelope could be used to control the propulsive operation of the VLM concept. An analysis of the measurement delay is made, to decrease the sampling time of the control loop. Two controllers, namely proportional-integral-derivative (PID) for the temperature and sliding mode control (SMC) for the pressure have been proposed. <br/><br/>The designed hardware is based on the requirements of the operational envelopes and control strategies. The control system can be divided into three main parts: microcontroller, temperature controller and pressure controller. The Arduino Uno is selected to be used during this phase of the development process. The temperature controller is combination of an adjustable power supply and a measurement setup. The adjustable power supply is a buck-boost converter that is controlled with two digital potentiometers connected to its feedback pin. The digital potentiometer combination has 2806 different output steps, resulting in an output resolution of 0.89 mV. The chamber temperature is determined with resistance measurements of the heater chip using voltage and current sensors. The current measurement results are unfortunately not sufficient for accurate temperature measurement, the sensor should be replaced in future projects. The chamber pressure is regulated by a ON/OFF valve at the inlet. The controller hardware is based on the requirements of the selected solenoid valve. It contains a boost converter and switching circuit to create the desired spike voltage at the solenoid valve. The energy requirements of the solenoid valve exceed the energy level of the propulsion subsystem. <br/><br/>The designed control system did not meet all the expectations. The temperature measurement system needs to be improved and an additional storage devices should be added to fulfil the requirements of the propulsion system. The biggest challenge that followed from this thesis project is the complex trade-off between sampling time, measurement accuracy, system dynamics and power usage. An optimal balance between these parameters is essential to make it suitable for missions in miniaturized spacecraft like the Delfi-PQ.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-03-02","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

However, this comes with the cost of inaccuracy, one of which is that it assumes<br/>all dose is deposited locally along the beam path.

Thereafter the relevant<br/>particle’s are then utilised as a source to emulate their production in a primary proton beam at different depths to obtain the relevant 3D dose distributions. The analysis concluded that secondary protons are the most relevant secondary particle as they contribute to 88% of the secondary dose and have a significant range to deposit their dose non locally. By utilising the secondary protons as a source, it was found that the relative error between the integrated depth dose (IDD) of the scored protons and the IDD obtained directly from Monte Carlo simulations is equal to 5.1% in the z-direction and 3.4% in the x and y-direction. The absolute difference was found to be 1.54 × 10−5 Gy which is equal to 0.096% of the total dose and 2.75% of the dose contributed by all secondary particles.

This research is an exploratory study on which barriers slow down and which drivers accelerate the transition towards zero-emission construction sites in the Dutch infrastructure sector. The goal of this study was to gain insight into the transition process from a government, contractor and technological perspective. Eventually, actions for acceleration were established to answer the main research question: How can the transition towards zero-emission construction sites be accelerated?<br/><br/>Technologically, the most important barrier is the limited availability of zero-emission construction equipment. Also the costs of zero-emission alternatives are currently too high to be profitable compared to the existing machines functioning on fossil fuels. For motivating contractors, the interviewees indicated the need for incentivizing emission reduction at construction sites by rewarding frontrunners and creating competitive advantage through award criteria in infrastructure projects. The research shows that corporate drivers, e.g. competitive advantage are key internal drivers for contractors. Contractors can accelerate the transition by tendering these emission reduction projects to enhance their competitive advantage. Winning these projects finances the zero-emission equipment and leads to an increased competitive advantage. Contractors could start to increase their experience with available small and medium size electric equipment. The respondents also indicated that the government could play a greater stimulating role than it does at present. As main client it is important that the government challenges the market to operate in a zero-emission way as much as possible. As legislator/policy maker it is important to create boundary conditions for contractors to enable them to invest in zero-emission equipment. More clarity and continuity of future policy plays a significant role for motivating contractors. <br/><br/>When the actions for acceleration are taken, the first step towards an accelerated transition can be made, by slowly changing some of the underlying problems how the construction industry is organised. These are mainly changing the competing market dynamics, the enabling policy environment and increasing the attractiveness of alternative technologies. The government can use policy instruments to incentivize, communicate and cooperate with and enforce the private sector to enhance private emission reduction efforts. Moreover, contractors could also take social responsibility, and not consider emission reduction at construction sites only as a governmental matter. The combination of more intrinsic motivation of contractors and an active use of policy instruments by the government can pave the way for creating more resilient and future-proof ways of construction.<br","zero-emission construction sites; contractors; government; accelerate; transition; technology; innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","During the calibration of SWAN for shallow water lakes in the Netherlands, problems have been encountered. Especially the emergence of an unnatural, secondary peak in the low frequency part of the energy density spectrum poses problems. Therefore, this investigation aims to address the nonlinear shallow water source terms in SWAN that may introduce this artefact.<br/><br/>Firstly, the basics of linear wave theory and spectral modelling are introduced. Hereafter, these basics are extended to the modelling on nonlinear wave behaviour, as these phenomena form the basis of the relevant shallow water source terms.<br/><br/>The shallow water lake problem is reduced to a stationary, one dimensional problem, for which several model results are produced using varying parameters. Three main subjects can be identified: 1) the influence of depth-induced wave breaking using the BJ78-model or the $\beta-kd$-model, 2) the proportionality factor of the triad source term using the CCA-formulation, and 3) numerical properties such as frequency resolution and the magnitude of the flux limiter.<br/><br/>The results demonstrate that, for strong winds ($U_{10} = 40$ m/s) in shallow water ($d = 2.5$ m), source term interactions become complex as they are all of similar order of magnitude. Especially the interactions between triad wave-wave interactions and depth-induced wave breaking, and triads and quadruplets are important for determining the resulting wave spectrum. Increased wave breaking reduces the secondary peak but underestimates significant wave heights and dampens the spectrum. A more elaborate wave breaking formulation (the $\beta-kd$-model) showed improved performance, especially when it was set to allow younger wind waves (high $kd$) to develop.<br/><br/>Lowering the effect of the triad source term also removes the secondary peak, but may not be desirable as it is by definition a relevant shallow water source term. Reducing source term interactions by means of a stricter action limiter resulted in instabilities for the quadruplet source term and thus no convergence of the results.<br/><br/>A possible solution may be to investigate the possibility of reducing the effect of quadruplets for shallow water, as this term (together with the triad source term) contributes to the formation of the secondary peak. However, this has not been included in the scope of this investigation. Furthermore, improving the frequency resolution resulted in smoother spectra and less wiggles in the sum of the triad and quadruplet source terms. However, this may affect the performance of the quadruplet source term as this term has been calibrated for a fixed relative frequency resolution.","SWAN; nonlinear wave-wave interactions; Shallow water; nonlinear wave breaking","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""
