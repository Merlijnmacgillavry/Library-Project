(mentor); Van Bussel, G.J.W. (mentor)","2009","The Diffuser Augmented Wind Turbine (DAWT) has been studied periodically over the last five decades. It has already been established by the scientific community that the DAWT is superior to conventional bare wind turbines. In spite of this, the DAWT has not gained popularity worldwide due to high manufacturing cost of the diffuser. There are two possibilities to make a DAWT more lucrative; lowering the manufacturing cost or increasing the performance. The present thesis is concerned with the second approach and considers the hypothesis that the generating power of a DAWT can be increased by turbulent mixing of the wake and free stream flow. This mechanism should decrease the diffuser’s exit pressure and consequently increase the mass flow and power. In the present investigation this turbulent mixing is established by placing vortex generators on the diffuser trailing edge. The hypothesis was tested through a series of full scale wind tunnel experiments. The experiments were conducted in the open jet facility of Delft University of Technology in collaboration with Donqi Urban Windmills. It was found that the application of vortex generators on the diffuser trailing edge lead to an increase in power of 9%. Furthermore, in the pursuit of a better understanding of the flow behavior, an inviscid singularity model was formulated. The model uses a surface vorticity technique to simulate the behavior of the diffuser, supplemented with a lifting line approach to model the rotor. It was found that the inviscid model did capture the behavior of the DAWT reasonably well, although when compared to the measurement results it was observed tobe overly optimistic.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","AEWE - Windenergy","","","",""

Niels Pörtzgen[15] showed that this technique can also be used for inspection of welds. This thesis describes two domains in which the IWEX algorithm can be calculated. The time domain which has a quantization problem and the frequency domain which is computation intensive. The computation requirements run up to 5.5 TFLOPS(typical) for the frequency domain. To decrease the execution time of the frequency domain algorithm three platforms are explored: GPUs, the Cell processor and FPGAs. GPUs are originally designed for the game market to render 3D images, but over the last couple of years the GPU has become much more usable for general purpose computing. One of the latest GPUs has 240 scalar processors and has a theoretical 933 GFLOPS[14]. The Cell processor has eight light weight cores and one power processor on one chip. With a theoretical 204.8 GFLOPS also a powerful device[5]. The third platform is the FPGA. The floating point performance of the FPGA is lower than the other two platforms but if fix-point computations are used the FPGA is expected to execute the IWEX algorithm the quickest(4.9 s) of the three platforms. The GPU is expected to execute the algorithm in 14.5 seconds, and the Cell processor in 26.8 seconds. We implemented the algorithm on the GPU platform with the result that one image takes 15.1 seconds which indicates 184 GFLOPS. This implies an efficiency of 19.7%. But the implementation has a speedup of 20 compared to a quad-core CPU based implementation.","GPU; FPGA; cell; performance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2009","Successful search and exploitation for hydrocarbons form the subsurface demands the acquisition of a thorough understanding of the basin’s geology, attainable by analyzing critically the stratigraphic framework and facies architecture of analog outcrops and mature fields with a dense network of wells. In this study Petrel was used to construct such a conceptual facies model for the Breathitt Group in the Central Appalachian Basin, with the aim of investigating the pattern of depositional environments and how they influenced the vertical and lateral distribution of facies in the foreland basin. The model provides excellent guidelines to the distribution of depositional energies in analogous subsurface progradational coastal-plain and fluvial-deltaic reservoir sequences. The study area is an appropriate analogue used by many oil and gas companies to understand and solve stratigraphic problems in subsurface coal mines and coal-bearing hydrocarbon reservoirs. Cored borehole data from 12 quadrangles in Eastern Kentucky was loaded into Petrel to generate vertical sedimentological logs. The logs were correlated using extensive coal seams and marine flooding surfaces to obtain stratigraphic columns of the strike and dip sections of the basin. 3D stratigraphic surfaces and isochore maps, embedded with pie-charts, were generated to quantify the proportions of lithofacies along every well that wholly penetrates any given isochore, including the determination, prediction and interpretation of lateral and vertical distribution of facies, depositional energies and paleo-environments. Basic principles of sequence stratigraphy were applied to explain the role and interactions of tectonics, subsidence and eustasy in the evolution of the delta system in the foreland basin. Results show that differential subsidence, including active tectonics (orogenesis) and quiescence gave rise to two broad depositional systems. The upper system, which is predominantly composed of immature sediments, was deposited by braided and meandering streams from the tectonically active thrust-front in the southeast toward the northwest in a fluvial-deltaic environment, whilst the lower system is composed of mature sediments whose deposition was mainly influenced by waves/storms and tides from the sea in the northwest that frequently transgressed the subsiding basin during the long periods of tectonic quiescence. The stratigraphy further shows a tendency to increase slope inclination and a series of anticlinal and synclinal structures, mainly in the upper system, which may provide reservoir traps or control the dynamics of fluid flow in the basin. The analysis shows that the fluvial-deltaic system has better reservoirs with a good vertical and lateral connectivity than reservoirs in the lower coastal-plain system, where vertical connectivity and permeability, is hindered by the thin laterally extensive shales between units. Nevertheless, this system could provide a good source region for the generation of hydrocarbons, due to its high content of organic matter and depth of burial, offering optimal pressures and kitchen (enough heat energy) for the generation of hydrocarbons. Facies analysis using isochores and pie-charts may be applied during both frontier exploration and exploitation phase to provide a simple and quick method of reserves estimates based on the predicted geometrical dimensions of reservoirs and non reservoirs. The method yields important petrophyical parameters that can assist reservoir engineers to design simulation models required for optimal well spacing and positioning, well numbers and better enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods.","breathitt group; Appalachian basin; Eastern Kentucky; Foreland basin; fluvial-deltaic deposits; four corners formation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geotechnology","","","",""

(mentor); Niemegeers, I.G.M.M. (mentor)","2009","Cognitive Radios (CRs) address the problems of spectrum scarcity and under-utilization of the spectrum. However, realizing a CR network is neither easy nor straight-forward. The link layer in CR Ad hoc Networks is responsible for allocating suitable channels, out of the currently available channels. It is also responsible for setting up communication between nodes. Further, the spectrum efficiency should be maximized in a fair way. The problem of spectrum allocation can be modeled as a graph-theoretic problem. The selection of channels amongst the CR nodes in the network is an NP class problem. We prove this is, in fact, an NP complete problem. We propose a time-slotted system. In such a system, the schedule length needs to be kept to a minimum for higher spectrum utilization. We analyze the problem to determine conditions for an optimal allocation. We use edge coloring as a tool to analyze and propose heuristics. In ad hoc networks, distributed solutions are preferred due to the lack of infrastructure. We propose two distributed algorithms: (i) clique based, and (ii) localized heuristic algorithms. We compare the results of these heuristics with the algorithm proposed in literature. We also find the worst case bounds for these algorithms. For efficiency purposes, it is required to have a constant number of slots per frame. In such cases, producing a valid schedule is not enough since unfairness of allocation will eventually arise. To address this issue, we modify the edge coloring and clique based heuristics to produce valid fair schedules. Finally, we briefly consider the advantages of having a joint spectrum sensing-allocation scheme at the link layer. When the spectrum sensing scheme at the PHY layer is not completely reliable, a link layer scheme can help in reducing the false alarms and miss-detections. We, further constrain the system by limiting the number of channels that can be sensed within a frame. We present the spectrum utilization with this joint sensing-allocation policy.","cognitive radio; graph theory; allocation problem; ad hoc networks; opportunistic spectrum access; fairness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-11-25","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","Wireless and Mobile Communications","",""

(mentor); Beukers, A. (mentor); Schmehl, R. (mentor); de Wachter, A. (mentor)","2009","Motivation: Speed sailing can be seen as the ultimate challenge for a sailing craft. Kiteboarders have recently shown to be capable of extremely high sailing speeds using a relatively cheap and simple combination of a kite and a board. They proved to be the world’s fastest sailing crafts during a record attempt in October 2008, in September 2009 the record was broken again by a large hydrofoil trimaran. Only little is known about the performance characteristics of a kiteboarder. Research is required to investigate the possibilities to further increase the sailing speed and reach the maximum speed potential of a kiteboarder. Problem statement: This thesis aims to obtain a general understanding of what properties are of importance to obtain a high kiteboarding velocity and to understand how each component contributes to the finally obtained velocity. Approach: A kiteboarder can be seen as a sailing system. It is first explained how to calculate the sailing velocity when wind velocity and both the aerodynamic and hydrodynamic efficiency is known. The kiteboarder is divided into four components; the board, the rider, the lines and the kite. Each component is separately analyzed. The aerodynamic forces on the rider and the lines are estimated using available theory. A special effort is made to investigate the kite’s lift and drag coefficients. A new kite testing method is proposed. The test is based on steering the kite in a horizontal path from one side to the other while constantly monitoring kite velocity, line tension and wind velocity. The hydrodynamic properties of the board are analyzed using available empirical results and by analyzing measured data from a kiteboarding session. Two steady state models are built to combine all the obtained knowledge. In the first model the sailing velocity is one of the input parameters. This model serves to provide an overview of all forces involved in a realistic sailing situation. Variations of wind velocity over height are taken into account. Two cases are described and worked out to obtain an overview of the drag distribution over the kiteboarder. The second model serves to predict the improvement in velocity after improving one of the components and is used to optimize line length and sailing direction. Results: It is found that during record sailing conditions 20 to 21 percent of the total drag is created by the kite, 13 to 18 percent by the rider, 3 to 6 percent by the lines and 56 to 63 percent by the interaction of the board with the water. Research focused on the board could thus lead to a large velocity increment. It is also found that optimizing line length and sailing direction could result in substantial velocity increments.","Kiteboard drag; High altitude wind power; Kiteboarding; Speed Sailing; Kite testing methods","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy, Flight Performance and Propulsion","","","",""

The method is geared toward the early phase of product development, which is the generation of insights and design ideas. Looking at daily behavior, one can observe clear differences between different cultures. From this observation, the study takes the assumption that “Looking at cultural diversity of daily practice can increase the variety of insights, which will be a source of inspiration for designers.” An approach based on this assumption was named ‘Culture-inspired approach’ and explored as an add-on feature of the practice-oriented co-design approach for designing less resource-intensive everyday life. Aims: The aims of this study are:  Build up knowledge about the use of information on cultural diversity of everyday practice as a source of insight and idea generation for designing less resource-intensive practices  Explore a method for collecting information on resource-consuming everyday practices from multiple cultures and communicating the collected information to designers Approach: This study took a two-step approach:  In Phase 1, an experimental culture survey addressing a topic of the practice ‘bathing’ was conducted in the three countries, the Netherlands, Japan and India  In Phase 2, an experimental creative session for designing less resource-intensive bathing practices was conducted with participation of product designers Research questions and conclusions: 1. What kinds of information about cultural diversity of daily practice can play a role in generating insights and design ideas for less resource-intensive practice? The kinds of information play a role in the design process can be divided into two types. First type is the information used for understanding daily pracitce in different cultures. This type of information is for example, ‘local context’, ‘facilities and products’ and ‘procedure of the practice.’ The other type is the information that can help insight and idea generation. ‘variety of styles and their respective resource consumption’, ’expectations of actions with resource use’ and ‘feelings and emotions during the action’ are cited as examples of the type of this information. These findings were reflected in the specification of recording units for a survey on the everyday practice. 2. What kinds of insights and ideas are developed from information about cultural diversity of daily practice? By utilizing these types of information, three kinds of insights were generated, they were: 1) keys of reducing resource utilization, 2) points of concern in reducing resource utilization and 3) keys of exploring new possible styles of the practice. Meanwhile, using the same information, designers successfully developed a number of ideas for new bathing practice. Their ideas were likely to be ‘practice-oriented’ ideas, which go beyond their current bathing practice, such as ‘sponge bed bathing’ and ‘bathing suit.’ 3. How to collect the information about daily practice from multiple cultures? The self-observation probe with a feature of recording the practice by a set of elements was successful in collecting information on the everyday practice from people in three countries. The recording format ‘Action cards’ increased the precision of data on use of the water during bath time. On the other hand, conducting an experimental survey brought knowledge of the issues in the process and methods for collecting information on the everyday practice from multiple cultures. The challenges in the survey process were for example, ‘need for contact person in unfamiliar countries’ and ‘handling of the difference in communication means between the cultures.’ The challenges in the survey methods were for example, ‘definition of single action’ and ‘handling of the difference in means for recording resource use between the cultures.'","cross-cultural research; eco-design; design methods; household routines; product development; sustainability; user-centered design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2010-10-28","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor); De Hoog, M. (mentor)","2009","According to the latest predictions, the average sea level will rise with about 1.2 meters in the coming century. The 60 kilometers of sandy coast along the Dutch city agglomeration Randstad is not prepared for such a threat. The coast needs to be enforced. In the meantime, the coastal zone, with all its charming seaside resorts, is one of the strengths of the Randstad area. Therefore the goal of this graduation project is to design a new coastal defense that enhances the strength of the Randstad Coastline. Firstly, a new Structure Plan for the coastal zone is made. In this plan, the Randstad is envisioned as a Coastal Metropolis, with the coast as a major strength. The plan proposes to intensify the built area along the coast an create better east-west connections towards the coast. For the coastal defense itself, the plan opposes to the current and future policy, which is fortifying the coast by the suppletion of extra sand. Apart from this conventional method, there are numerous other techniques for coastal defense. The ‘soft’ techniques are most optimal for the Randstad Coast because they are flexible and respect the natural coastal morphology. The new proposed technique is a Breakwater Barrier. This strip of new land made of sand, protects the existing coastline. It is 8 km long and is located 800 seawards from the coast. The barrier-concept is designed in more detail for the seaside resort of Katwijk aan Zee. The traditional seaside resort of Katwijk aan Zee experiences a lot of pressure from the continuously expanding hinterland. Also, its low geographic position causes pressure from the sea. The barrier will discharge the town of Katwijk of this pressure. New connections towards the beach barrier will redirect the traffic flows in the area. The village will be protected from storm surge waves and the relation of the charming seafront with the sea will be enhanced. The new boulevard will be improved and in the meantime new ‘coast capacity’ is created on the reef. The barrier will have a marina, vacation homes and a hotel/conference center. By assigning different safety levels to the barrier, the most efficient dimension for the reef is chosen. This way the required amount of sand for the construction is comparable to the amount of sand needed for plans for coastal defense made by the authorities. Although the costs for the construction of this reef are higher than the costs of conventional methods of coastal defense, the reef offers many benefits: the reef can be exploited to gain income, the character of the current coastline won’t be affected, the intervention is flexible and subtle. And most importantly, the beach barrier will create a new exiting coastal landscape that is unique in the world.","Coastal Defense; Randstad","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-10-28","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","Urban Landscapes","",""

This method was used to grow µc-Si:H p- and i-layers. The effect of p– layer deposition parameters on the short– wavelength response of µc-Si:H solar cells is investigated. We also investigated the influence of deposition parameters on the properties of the µc-Si:H absorber layer deposited at the a-Si:H/ µc-Si:H transition. Parameters such as RF power, silane concentration, and deposition pressure were studied. The effect of these parameters on the material properties of intrinsic µc-Si:H layers and the device performance of single junction µc-Si:H solar cells is presented. The results show that p-layer deposited at 300 seconds with 0.2 sccm diborane flow has the optimum value with respect to transparent and conductive nature. It gave a high FF and Voc when applied in a single junction p-i-n type µc-Si:H solar cells with efficiency of 5.4%. Significant gain in quantum efficiency of the solar cell was observed especially in the short-wavelength region. With the optimized p-layer and at 80 W deposition power, the quantum efficiency increased to about 65% at 400 nm when compared to the obtained value of about 35% with the same optimized p-layer deposited at 60 W. The overall results show that the spectral response is highly sensitive to diborane flow at short wavelength. The result of i-layer sensitivity study reveals µc-Si:H i-layer deposited at a low power but higher pressure has high photoresponse. The structural properties of these layers shows defects which may be related to the grain boundries and material contamination due to stress. This was evident as the film oxidizes immediately it is brought out of the deposition system for FTIR analysis, leaving the substrate with little or no films.","microcrystalline silicon solar cell","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Microelectronics","",""

The evolving question has been 'how interventions in social systems guide and shape a course of development'. How complete is design research in responding to context? How can context be conceived, what dimensions and levels of context should be measured, how does context change and what does it mean that the same context can result in differing individual experiences? What aspects of context will be foregrounded and which aspects dissolve to the background? That is, since choice situations tend to be a selection which is accompanied by a non-selection, how de we know what to focus on and when the most important (or least important) aspects of context are the subject of consideration? Hence, a key issue in this research has become the evolution of normative frameworks which guide the selection and interpretation of context. In this, a sociological approach is followed to the understanding and development of conceptualized norms which tend to guide development processes (Habermas, 1984, Freire, 1970, Healey, 2006).

(mentor); Stappers, P.J. (mentor)","2009","Next to a great physical experience with the world famous blocks, there is a push to explore new ways of integrate a virtual play experience with LEGO building activity. Tangible Interaction for Playing (TiP) explores possibilities for a search initiated by LEGO Concept Lab. The project aims to find a new play experience able to integrate seamlessly: the traditional LEGO play with virtual elements. To assess the play value – the worth of a play experience in the opinion of the child – the designer approaches the assignment with a Human-Centred Design mind-set, sustaining close contact with children from start to end. At first, the designer builds an emphatic understanding of children’s play and context by means a Contextmapping done with parents as co-researchers. The research resulted on a set of Personal Cards, reporting children’s play, their family and their social contexts. In a second moment, the designer involved children to play with prototypes, in a sequence of short iterative cycles. By receiving children in regular basis, the designer could adjust key ingredients of the experience until the toy was considered to offer a coherent set of tools that facilitates a worthy play. At last, an experiential prototype simulating the complete experience was introduced to children in a final iteration. An evaluation on this last session led to considerations and recommendations regarding the play experience created for LEGO. RESULTS: AugmentedCity is a concept that brings augmented reality technology into the LEGO play. By using augmented realty, the designer was able to create a new layer of meaning and interactions without loosing the original qualities of the building blocks. By adjusting the scale and iconicity of the models, and by offering a viewer as tool for playing, the concept brings a small interactive world to the children’s hand. All ingredients together prove to support children to move seamlessly between physical and virtual play. Above all, the play felicitated by those ingredients offered a respectful interaction – respect towards children’s as the one in control of the play. AugmentedCity offers a play experience that kept spatial reasoning and all qualities present in the traditionally LEGO building system, while integrating it with a new virtual layer. The final experiential prototype confirmed the value of the experience that is now been taken further by other designers in LEGO Concept Lab.","toys; human-centred design; contextmapping; informant-based design; children & technology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2010-10-27","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

In this paper the effectiveness of training on an accelerated simulated process is investigated. Four groups of subjects were trained on the Waterspot Simulator, three groups (of various experience) trained at 60x accelerated simulation speed, and one group trained at real-time simulation speed. The results showed that the Waterspot Simulator could distinguish between experienced operators and laymen and that the groups that trained with 60x accelerated simulation speed outperformed the group that trained at real-time, when they were compared ona real-time quasi transfer of training task.","simulator; training; drinking water; operator; automation; man machine system; acceleration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","","",""

The possibilities for such transformation are explored through the experimentation of designing small-scale, self-sufficient, sustainable, architectural interventions that can be constructed within and in-between the existing buildings. The methodology proposes these “literal” interventions on the basis of an analysis of the diverse informal collective practices and initiatives that emerged within the physical context of the Spanish Colonial architecture in Centro Habana, during the years following the Socialist revolution of 1959. The thesis suggests that these practices are evident manifestations of how space can influence the transformation of a society beyond the desires, or control, of an effective authority, and aims to explore the potential of them with respect to architectural practice.","in between critical implant nexus transformation catalyst","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-01-01","Architecture","Architecture","","Border Conditions","",""

With the population of 23 million, Jakarta and the surrounding area is the 4th largest urban area in the world. As the result, Jakarta suffers from inadequate facility such as severe traffic jams caused by too much commuting from areas around Jakarta, and air pollution caused by the traffic. The newly proposed Jakarta Mass Transit System has created an opportunity to the city’s mobility. The system has just been implemented, not completed yet, but is already working. The system will be finished in 2015 completing the whole Jakarta Mass Rapid Transit System. There is an opportunity to reintegrate the unconnected area in the city center. Since 2004, the TransJakarta Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), part of the Jakarta MRT, has been implemented in Jakarta. However, there is no in-depth research on how the Mass Transit System’s affect the vitality of the city. Currently, the BRT only solves the problem of infrastructure, that is the congestion problem. There is no integration between the BRT network and the urban fabric. There is an opportunity to implement a more sustainable transport mode but there is no guideline to direct the system to this direction. Around the world, large cities started to implement sustainable mobility in their city’s building project. Transit-oriented Development in the United States and cities such as Bogota, Zurich, Singapore are one of the many examples of an integrated transport mode or transit-oriented development. Jakarta is late on the idea of integration between the urban fabric and a transportation network and hasn’t consider the possibility of implementing a TOD on the existing MRT/BRT. With this vision of sustainable mobility kept in mind, and with the author’s concern on the environment and the ever increasing use of private automobiles, the author tries to research on the possibility of integrating the BRT system with the urban fabric to create a more sustainable transport mode by implementing a concept of TOD. Unique in this research is that the author is using space syntax as a method of approach to investigate the level of integration of an area next to a BRT system and the use of research by design to investigate improved urban design in the areas surrounding the stops of the BRT system. For this reason, the author decided to choose this topic for the thesis project.","infrastructure; bus rapid transit; transit oriented development; Jakarta","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Urbanism","","","",""

This thesis focused especially on investigating on the possibility of balancing “togetherness” and “privacy” through computer-mediated communication. A new design approach was explored in the project to guide the strategic product planning process from expressing user’s latent experience by combining semantic differential scaling (SDS) experiment into user research. A context model was generated, providing the possibility of balancing “togetherness” and “privacy” through three factors in seven different usage contexts. A design part followed the exploratory phase. A strategic design guideline on control scheme, namely how to use ambient awareness system to trigger people to communicate was generated. The concept of “smart awareness assistant” was developed and a renewed “Connected Lobby” interface was designed and tested. The “smart awareness assistant” could trigger the family members to share the meaningful moment with each other at the right time, and filter the unwanted information exchange when the user is not available to communicate, which could enhance family “togetherness” through balancing “awareness” and “privacy”.","ambient intelligence; human factor; user experience; semantic differential scaling; context; strategic design; interface; family; computer mediated communication","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

It is very hard to measure how powerful the detergent product is or how clean the clothes really become. We make all the judgment through the information we receive from our senses. ‘Simplest way, best result’ as the core claim of ‘Dirt is good’ detergent brand platform has been intensively communicated to the customer through the product functional performance and the marketing effort. However there was limited work has been done on how to align the product sensory attributes with this claim. This challenge fits perfectly with the mission of Multi-sensory design, which is materializing abstract ideas into concrete products that optimally communicate these ideas through all the senses (Schifferstein & Desmet, 2008). So in this project a Multi-sensory Design perspective was adopted to tackle the challenge. Indian hand-wash market is one of the largest hand-wash markets with 96% laundry done by hand. And the characteristics of hand-wash show that, people interact intensively with the product sensory attributes during the hand-wash laundry. Therefore, this project further focuses on Indian detergent powder hand wash market. The design approach is based on the Model proposed by Desmet (2009) and Multisensory Design method proposed by Sonneveld, Ludden and Schifferstein (2008). In this design approach, ‘Simplest way, best result’ brand claim was put in to the target laundry context to study what this claim means to the product effect (Effect Vision), the product interaction (Interaction) with target user. Then based on the product effect vision and the interaction vision, the product qualities as well as sensory qualities were explored in order to see how the target product effect and product-user interaction can be achieved. Then based on the Product Vision and the Multisensory Vision, the product concepts (detergent, package and their combination) were developed. In the last phase, product concepts were evaluated by the target customer and the feedback from the target customer was gathered for future product development. At last, several important insights on Multisensory Design application in new product (detergent powder) development were shown and discussed.","Multi-sensory Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2010-10-26","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

The original assignment received from Philips is to design a new monitoring solution for the Chinese market. This is too broad for designing a product and as a result, need to be concretized obviously. Researches must be done to the healthcare status of Chinese people in order to define the design direction. The target group and the application environment must be decided after the analysis to the target market as well. Researches to the Life style of the anticipated target group was considered to be vital for this assignment since one main design aim is to improve the life quality of the patients. Designing of a new solution started after most the questions had been answered during the phase of analysis. A household monitoring solution for the urban patients with heart failure (stage III) was designed as the final product. This is a system composed of a garment and a glove which enables the doctors to monitor the development of the disease and the health status of the patients in distance and helps the users to find the boundaries of life with regard to their health condition. It also provides protections to the users with its alarming system which connects the users together with their families and the medical institutions in case of emergency.","design; research","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor); Geraedts, J.M.P. (mentor)","2009","The project “Design of a smart safety device for dangerous traffic situations” focused on vulnerable road users under the age of 18 years. When participating in traffic as pedestrians, bicyclists or as the drivers of motorized 2-wheelers children are vulnerable, especially towards heavier motorized traffic (i.e. cars, busses and trucks). In the analysis the target group was specified as children, age 12–15 years, who go to secondary school by bicycle in The Netherlands. Motorized traffic and distractions (e.g. peers, music, cell phones) are threatening. Furthermore, children at the age of 12 are easily distracted and they do not always pay attention. The children most fear cars, especially when crossing an intersection or when cars pass. The safety device is a pair of earphones that warns the child for a vehicle that approaches from behind. These are outside the visual field and cannot be heard while listening to music. The device warns the child using sound. The design has a similar appearance and size as the popular type of earphones. The user is warned by a beep with an increasing repetition frequency mixed in with the music. The detection of motorized vehicles is done using sound. This detection was tested in experiments where different car types, velocities and road types are used. Also the effect of wind on the recording was tested and optimized. The final design consists of earplugs and an in-wire control unit which houses the electronics and one AAA battery for powering. There is an on/off and sensitivity switch. The earphones are made of injection molded plastic and silicon rubber which shields the microphones and gives comfort to the ear tips. The potential target group gave feedback on the functionality and aesthetics of the final design. This group recognized the usefulness of the earphones. The warning signal is distinguishable from music, although this largely depends on the type of music. The signal is clear in terms of approach of vehicles. The children saw no problems for using this product on a bicycle. Regarding the aesthetics different colors were favored to match the MP3-player. Opinions about the size of the earphones differed. In general, the children would spend between 15 and 35 Euro for it.","smart safety device; earphones; traffic; music; bicycle; teenagers; headphones","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2010-10-26","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

The obstacle position is estimated by stereo vision. Actuation is realized by a constant torque per step on the hip and a push-off collinear to the trailing leg. Stepping over the obstacle must be accomplished with the obstacle position exactly on a predefined position in between the legs with the final state right after push-off being equal to the initial state. Thus, at least two steps must be taken to perform this task, such that the first step is used to make sure the relative position of the obstacle is correct. In the best case scenario, the obstacle is exactly in between the legs during a nominal walk. In that case, actuation does not have to be adjusted with respect to the nominal actuation. In the worst case scenario the obstacle is exactly at a stepping position. In that case, a translation of the step positions is needed. For stepping over in two steps this is not possible; this is only possible for a small range around the best case scenario. For stepping over in three steps this is possible when actuation is applied according to the optimization results presented.","limit cycle walker","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BMechE","","BMD","",""

Mud is expected to be deposited in the channel because of the persistent swell climate which mobilizes mud on the seabed. In order to assess operational costs and dredging requirements predictions of the infill rates are required which realistically include possible uncertainties. An extensive study on the sediment characteristics in the OKLNG area was conducted. Indications were found that the sediment in the water column at OKLNG is unflocculated or poorly flocculated. If confirmed, this would be very unusual and in fact unknown to the best knowledge of the consulted experts for this thesis and in the studied literature. Cohesive sediment in the marine environment is typically flocculated. In terms of identifying and reducing uncertainties, the sediment state in the water column was found to be the most important uncertainty for the prediction of the mud infill; it has a large influence on the sedimentation mechanism and quantities. Because of this large uncertainty, and in the absence of definitive data, it was decided to investigate the implications of both unflocculated (scenario 1) and flocculated (scenario 2) sediment. If the sediment is found to be unflocculated, the infill rate is a factor 10 higher than when it is flocculated. Next the sediment concentrations near the bottom are not precisely known, while this information is required to properly predict the mud infill of the channel. All other uncertainties are of minor importance in comparison to the mentioned two.","mud; uncertainty; infill prediction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2009","This work is based on the idea that an acid mixture of hydrochloride and sulpheric acid react with the calcite in a chalk oilfield to create anhydrite which has a larger molecular size. This will clog the present fractures to prohibit that these fractures sometimes shortcut the injected water from the injector well to the producing oil well which otherwise would result in artificial thieve zones. In this work mass balance calculations and experimental lab work has been done to see how the acidic reaction works. It is concluded that during the conversion of calcite to anhydrite 60% of the resulting CO2 is dissolved in the present liquid; the rest is in the gaseous phase. The samples of fractured chalk are approximately 30 cm long and have a diameter of 10 cm. The fracture is situated in the flow direction. The samples are tested under reservoir conditions, and the flow rate of the acids is 2 ml/min. The resulting permeability change indicates that the fracture is sealed after half an hour of acid injection, but this seal in the fracture is only a pasty substance clogging the flow. After approximately six hours of injection the first wormholes appear and the fracture is totally sealed. Mass change is calculated based on the amount of anhydrite created during acid injection. The mass changes are equivalent to the mass change measured during the experiment. CT-scans are made before, during and after many experiments and each scan series of approximately 300 images. These images are used in a specially written program to divide all present volume components in the chalk: fracture, calcite, anhydrite, wormholes and fossils. They are also used to calculate volume percentages, and coincide with the calculated weight percentages. Fracture experiments under reservoir temperature and pressure conditions and Brazilian tests under atmospheric are done on the sealed samples to see if the fractures can be reopened. The samples were tested with an annular pressure of 310 bar, 80oC and injection pressure of 270 bar. The production pressure was released, even with a pressure difference over the core of 160 bar and did not fracture. The tensile strength of the sealed samples proved to be as strong as original chalk samples without fractures.","acidic flow experiments; highly permeable thief zones; chalk formations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-12-31","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geotechnology","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

(mentor); Cunningham, S. (mentor); Bruin, A.C.N. (mentor); Fransen, M. (mentor); Weijnen, M.P.C. (mentor)","2009","Electricity is an essential service that can be seen as a utility necessary for modern life. It is typically generated in large scale power plants, and must then be transported through a capital intensive infrastructure known as the transmission grid. It can not be easily stored for later use, which implies that supply and demand of it must be balanced at all times. The capacity of the grid to transport electricity is limited. If it is overburdened, costly loss of property and the failure of the network can result. Electricity transport is special, because the marginal costs for transport from one place to another often depend on what is happening elsewhere in the system. This is a consequence of the fact that flows through a network depend on physical properties rather than exclusively following from economic transactions. The term ‘congestion’ applies when the capacity of the transmission network is not sufficient in order to meet our transport needs for electricity. Such congestion is currently an issue in the Netherlands, where investment in generation capacity is expected to outpace the construction of stronger transmission networks during the coming years. Congestion can be managed through the allocation of scarce capacity beforehand, using methods such as explicit or implicit auctions. This is presently the situation on the transmission links on the borders between the Netherlands and neighbouring countries. It can also be managed while maintaining a single price within the country, using methods such as counter trade that correct infeasible electricity flows closer to the real time of power plant dispatch while maintaining a single price for electricity in an area. This costs money, as the power which would have been dispatched is less expensive than that which is constrained on instead. A model was built which can determine both the economic outcomes of electricity trade within the markets (quantities produced and prices paid at each location ) and the resulting flows of electricity through the networks. This model was used to compare methods for managing congestion for a set of plausible scenarios for 2014, involving potential additions to the available generation capacity and incidental conditions which may contribute to congestion. The results suggest that the additional costs to society in the form of the increased expense resulting from counter trade are quite modest compared to the total magnitude of power costs. The most significant congestion costs were found given large amounts of wind power in the north of the Netherlands and Germany, around 70 000 Euros per hour. Those costs were roughly estimated to imply annual costs of up to 80 million Euros. The difference between the optimal dispatch achievable using locational prices and the counter trade is around 5% of congestion cost. If the scenario with wind energy occurs, the model predicts most of the additional costs of congestion related to counter trade could be avoided by implementing price zones within Germany. Increased interconnection on the borders between the Netherlands and Germany was investigated. This would reduce some but not all congestion, as national networks would remain congested. The research also identified the fact that decreasing tradable interconnection capacity on the borders could allow TSOs to avoid some of the expense of counter trade within their networks. This could potentially cost society at least as much as managing the congestion. Based on this research, policymakers are advised to consider counter trade as a feasible option if developments in new electricity plants in the CWE region remain close to the expectations forming the input for the reference scenario described in this thesis. However, they should note that the cost estimates for using this method were based on conservative assumptions relating to perfect competition and available transmission capacity. If developments such as the rapid realization of wind power occur, which could lead to greater congestion than in the reference scenario, policymakers are advised to closely monitor whether market performance conforms to these conservative assumptions. If significant congestion is caused due to rapid wind power development in the north of the Netherlands and Germany, policymakers are advised to consider the feasibility of implementing two price zones within Germany. Doing so would allow congestion to be managed at lower cost to society than by using counter trade. If and when that situation occurs, regulators would also be advised to monitor the possibilities for abuse of market power by market participants who take on the role of pivotal suppliers for the purpose of relieving congestion.","electricity transmission; congestion; networks; linear programming; electricity; markets","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Infrastructure Systems & Services","","","",""

The hydraulic efficiency of the river Araranguá will be increased by the construction of jetties at the mouth of the river. The river tends to migrate from south to north which decreases the hydraulic efficiency and causes flooding upstream during events of high discharge. To stop the migration the construction of jetties at the mouth of river Araranguá is proposed. A design for a jetty system is available (INHP, 1993), but should be updated. Due to the construction of a jetty system longshore sediment transport will be interrupted and this will cause morphological changes. At Araranguá river a large and highly varying longshore sediment transport is present with a high energy wave climate and micro tidal range. These conditions cause increased morphological changes when constructing a jetty system. The objective of this research is to design a jetty system that prevents flooding upstream and induces as less morphological changes as possible. The jetty should be designed at the specified location, using available datasets from previous research and according to modern design standards. Also navigation through the channel should be possible. The channel width and depth are determined by navigational and morphological purposes and are 120 m and 6 m respectively. A weir jetty, which has been implemented in the SW arm of the design, was considered the best sediment bypass system after a multi criteria analysis. Because of the placing of the deposition basin waves could penetrate much further in the jetty channel and lengthening the NE arm to 630 m and a depth of 6,6 m was necessary. The length of the SW arm of the jetty from the previous is kept at 650 meter to a depth of 7,2 meter. The final result of the structural design is a statically stable rubble mound breakwater with granite as construction material. Rock has been applied in the range of 0,4 m (170 kg) to 1,0 m (2,7 tons) in diameter, with a core of quarry run material. In sections where the required rock mass exceeded the threshold value for economical construction (2,7 t), tetrapods have been applied to stabilize the slope. Tetrapods have been applied of 6,6 and 9,7 tons. The total use of material is about 42.000 tons of tetrapods and 490.000 tons of granite rocks. Overtopping requirements determine the crest freeboard and 0,3 meter is added for post construction settlement. The crest width depends on construction considerations. All other dimensions are directly related to the stone size and weight, which are dependent on the design wave heights.","Brazil; tidal inlet; coastal morphology; sand bypass","en","student report","TU Delft, Section Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Pasman, G.J. (mentor)","2009","This master thesis shows how to assitant users to create music playlist collaboratively on a Multi-touch surface in an interface design. The project is sponsored by Philips Applied technology. As Philips gains profound knowledge while manufacturing and selling large display products, the large display technology itself tends to increase in size and decrease in cost. For the future development of it, people in Philips had observed enormous potential with developing applications on large displays by using Multi-touch technology. In order to address suitable use cases to apply to this expanding technology, Philips started this project to explore multiple user interactions with music browsing. The project mainly concerns itself with exploring how multiple users can collaboratively build music playlists. I first conducted research into user context about how people search music, and found out that people tend to mainly search music through performer and title of the song. More importantly, user’s music searching turns out to be a social interaction with others. Later I performed a user study to investigate this aspect. This resulted in a few key findings. When users start to search, they would like to receive recommendations based upon top songs and artists, with the songs that are most popular at the time, the mainstream music, being selected as the primary ones. In addition, they want to build a playlist which best suits the atmosphere, and they also want to achieve a balance between personal taste, and the preferences from others. From the results of the user study, the Sharestream application was designed and built on a multi-touch table, and then tested for the final demonstration. It helps multiple people to build a music party, while browsing music collections spontaneously. Users are able to construct their playlist together in a social way: they can perceive others’ search results and are able interact with them, as well as evoking intensive social discussion during searching. In addition, Sharestream can also enable users to change the playlist they build to suit their mood. For the future development of Sharestream, integration with Philips Ambient lighting technology will play a critical role to create a better atmosphere for users. Developing concepts like Sharestream into Philips’ product portfolio, which evoke social interaction of multiple users, will be significantly beneficial in the future business market.","interface; multi-touch; music; social interaction; collaborative","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor); Quist, J.N. (mentor); Enserink, B. (mentor); Kwakkel, J. (mentor); Rop, P.S. (mentor); Mulder, K. (mentor)","2009","There has been an ever growing concern over addressing the issue of climate change and reducing the green house gas emissions (GHG) in the whole world and especially in the U.S. Many measurements are being taken into account for reducing the adverse effects of the GHG emissions as well as making equilibrium between climate security and energy security which further paves the way for moving forward to a more green economy. Also energy independence is playing an increasing role in the political landscape. Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) technology as one kind of solar renewable energy technology has gained significant momentum in recent years. CSP is gaining acknowledgement for its potential to produce large volumes of power where it can be considered as an alternative source of energy which competes with the conventional fossil fuels. The main advantage of CSP is that its required energy is abundant and free, i.e. solar radiation. Characteristic for a CSP power plant is its industrial size based on heat transfer. Since NEM is a company active in the power business with expertise in the heat transfer equipment, it wants to pursue the new business opportunities in the CSP market. There exist different CSP market potential locations around the globe which can be considered for development of CSP project. The U.S. is perceived to be one of the main competitors-along with Spain-in the close future which is expected to gain a lion share of this solar energy market. However, the U.S. electricity market is subject to many uncertainties and thus investors in the electricity sector may be reluctant to take up technologies which involve higher risks. In essence, this research pursued to study the associated uncertainties that are embedded in the U.S. CSP energy market and investigated the directions in which this market can grow in the future term. In this research at first, the CSP technology assessment has been carried out. This includes elaboration on the basic characteristics and functionalities of three types of CSP technology which includes Parabolic Trough, Power Tower (or central receiver) and Liner Fresnel technology. Further, major key components which are of great importance both from the perspective of the market viability as well as shaping the U.S. CSP energy market are introduced. Next, the research builds on its methodological grounds for studying and analyzing the concept of uncertainty which is the focal point of this thesis. In essence, literature review on the concept of uncertainty and its background is performed. In order to profoundly come up with a valid and comprehensive framework for uncertainty analysis, it was crucial to study and discuss the most two important dimensions of uncertainty, that is the typology of sources and types of uncertainty. According to this sort of classification, an uncertainty-analysis framework was ultimately developed which encompassed all the aforementioned concepts. Furthermore, the methods and tools that can be used in dealing with uncertainty are presented. In fact, numerous methods can be found in the scientific literature, both qualitatively and quantitatively for reducing the issue of uncertainty. However in the framework of this research, scenarios -mainly from the policy analysis perspectivewas chosen to deal with the associated uncertainties in projection of the U.S. solar CSP market. Finally in the last phase of the research, the developed “uncertainty-scenario” framework is applied. The results from this step of the research indicate that the U.S. CSP energy market is highly reliant and impacted by couple of major uncertain forces which can be categorized as economic and financial, legal and political and finally social and behavioral forces. Further amid these identified forces and system changes, the research underlined three highly uncertain factors which have high impact on the renewable energy system namely as governmental regulatory regimes and supporting schemes, project financing (or the availability of money) and energy consumption. On the other hand, the current credit crisis has also been identified as a major force and cause of system change which affects almost all of these forces which has rippled through almost all renewable energy market sectors including CSP. Nevertheless, according to these identified highly uncertain forces which can cause great deals of impact on the system, scenarios for depicting plausible futures of the U.S CSP market are explored. These qualitative scenarios are created in a way to encompass different extremes on how the CSP future market can unfold namely as the base-case scenario, the low-case scenario and the high-growth case scenario. In the last step of this research, according to each of the derived scenarios relevant recommendation to NEM is provided. These recommendations are presented from two perspectives. In first place, recommendations for per-case developed scenario are provided. Next, recommendations in a more general perspective are presented. These mainly include acknowledging the kinds of decisions that should be taken where insufficient knowledge exists in connection to the development of technologies, such as CSP.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-10-09","Technology, Policy and Management","Values and Technology Department","","","",""

Salzgewinnungs Geselschaft Westfalen (SGW) leaches the caverns. This company has produced brine from this area since the 1972. The wells are drilled as cluster wells.

In the wells exists temperature fluctuations; the temperature has to be monitored to prevent gas hydrates. The behavior of caverns and mines can only be understood and predicted by taking into account the creep and other aspects of salt. But the mechanical behaviour of salt is of a very hard complexity, and several aspects of it are still open to discussion. Eneco expects the project to contribute to an increased security of supply and liquidity of the northwest European gas market.

(mentor); Jongert, M.W.A. (mentor); Hekkert, P.P.M. (mentor)","2009","Introduction You only have to read the paper or watch the evening news to understand the problems local hang-out youth is causing recently. Last year, Mayor Mr. Cohen called youth-molestation one of the biggest problems of the city of Amsterdam. Humiliation of the youth, safety cameras, the Mosquito1 and gathering restriction orders; in recent discussions, nothing is too much to control youth which is hanging out on the streets. This graduation assignment will give a positive solution for the Youth Meeting Point of the Future. Context To understand the meeting adolescents in the public space, the first step of the process, was to build up the current context by a questionnaire (left behind at youth forums), observation (of meeting points), generative techniques (with more structural hangout youth) and literature research. It seemed that the adolescence phase of life is very important in the process of creating an own identity. Part of this process is belonging to different groups of cliques and seeking for sensation (risky behaviour). The youth’s transition from dependence to independence happens in different adolescence arenas. Home and school are the most common arenas. Some adolescents have to cope with a lot of stress in these scenes, because the internal structure of schools cannot stimulate them and the financial situation of their parents is not sufficient. A relatively new arena is the virtual world, which is, especially during adolescence, important to get and maintain social contacts. The fourth arena is the public space, which is for 80 percent of the (Dutch) youth a place the meet friends and escape from supervision. Future Context In a world that is becoming more stressful (by an economic recession), more crowded (bigger cities) and more individual (lack of religion, leisure planning), youth will be pushed towards the Boy’s Room Culture (having all the technical and social possibilities, which is being conducted behind closed doors) or the Street Culture (being excessive assertive/ aggressive, driven by the lack of success experiences, financial pressure and low self-esteem). In both situations, youth does experience an individuality, which does not work for all adolescents. Either way, youth has to self-explore their values, education, leisure time and social interactions. Vision In order to provide the adolescents and others in the neighbourhood of the social interactions they need for creating their own identity, the statement I would like to make is: I want to enable adolescents to express their social and explorative behaviour, in such a way, that it stimulates the participation of strangers. Product The product that fulfills this statement consists of LED-tiles integrated with pressure censors. The configuration of the tiles is, that it provides the adolescents of a place to meet their friends (see figure). While meeting, users will be challenged to hit tiles, that spontaneous light up. When users doing extremely good, they will be rewarded by, for example, an entire floor that starts blinking. To find out what really happened, or to achieve the same result, youngsters will become active. The exploring, searching, doubting and trying, create an interaction that can be called vulnerable, which makes the situation more approachable for strangers. Since the configuration has a boundless character, it also invites by-passers to hit a certain tile. The result is a social interaction between the different users of the public space. Test To find out if the concept worked out as described, a prototype has been built to execute a usability test. The prototype consisted of seven interactive tiles (tiles with a lighting heart and four switches) and one remote control, which was necessary to tune in certain programs. The usability test was nothing more than the placement of the prototype in an environment that was suitable for youth meeting each other (place of retreat and interaction). In total three groups of youth were observed during their exploration with the prototype. The interaction with the product could be described as active and vulnerable. According to the youth itself, the concept was inviting and challenging. Some by-passers stopped to look at the action that was going on.","Vision in Product Design; contextmapping; youth/ adolescence; public space","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

Thus when introducing a new working method in an organisation, organisations have to deal with organisational and technical changes. This thesis describes a roadmap which describes the process for transiting from paper to digital records in a youth care organisation where the organisational and technical issues will be taken into account. The DEMO methodology is used to model the organisation undergoing the change. The organisational model produced using this methodology, gives the management a good overview of how the care taking process takes place at the moment and can be used to improve this process if necessary. This model also helps to identify the roles and responsibilities of the actors involved in the organisation. Furthermore this model gives additional contribution to the concept of the Alares ‘knowledge environment’ which is also used the organisation according to its four components.","DEMO; paper records; digital records; digital signature; digital archiving; organisational change; organisation analysis; transition roadmap; transition process","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-10-12","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","","",""

The original purpose of groins was to reduce local erosion, that is, to hold the width of beach in their vicinities. Despite the simplicity of groins, their interaction with the beach is complex, and existing functional design guidance is limited. On the other hand, over the past decade there have been significant advances in understanding of coastal sediment processes, predictive modeling capability, and field measurements. Therefore, with the existing numerical tools the current study will be conducted in order to achieve better insight into this specific topic, to find some design criteria for normal groins and T-shape groins. The first step in this research is to do a wide literature review to find some reliable data regarding wave height and current velocities in a groin field. An irregular wave field must be studied, since regular wave fields concentrate energy around a single frequency, so they produce exaggerated offshore bar and strong rip currents (Hulsbergen et al 1978). On the other hand, the abilities of Delft3D numerical model must be validated for modeling currents and morphological interaction of littoral zone and structures for the case. Once we comprehend the current models are capable of modeling different phenomena, a sensitivity analysis will be carried out to find some design rules for these structures.","groin; erosion; numerical simulation; coastal protection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

In this thesis we describe an algorithm that iteratively applies landmark detection in perpendicular planes of the 3D dataset. The landmark detection exploits a large database of expert annotated images, using an extensive set of Haar wavelet-like features for classification, resulting in fast detection times suitable for real-time applications. The detection is performed using two cascades of Adaboost classifiers, that work in different 2D planes, in a coarse to fine scheme. The method is evaluated by measuring the total detection error for the landmark points between the detected positions and the manual ones.","classification; pattern recognition; ultrasound","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-02-18","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Information and Communication Theory Group","","Media and Knowledge Engineering","",""

De uitkomst van het onderzoek is dat een kalibratie van OpenTrack op basis van realisatiedata mogelijk is. Bij korte trajecten is de minimale rijtijd volgens OpenTrack te hoog ten opzichte van de minimale rijtijd uit de realisatiegegevens. Hierdoor zijn de kalibraties op korte trajecten van lagere kwaliteit. Een oorzaak kan zijn dat de matericelkarakteristieken te conservatief in het model zijn opgenomen, hier is verder onderzoek naar noodzakelijk. De instelling van de performance parameter loopt per traject zeer uiteen. Zeer waarschijnlijk is dit afhankelijk van de lengte van het traject en/of van het ingezette materieel.

(mentor); Goossens, R. (mentor)","2009","This report aims in one hand to demonstrate the carried out iterative process of product development including the chosen framework, decision validation, tests and conclusions. On the other hand it intends to be a contribution for the creation of specific standards for surgical illumination. The premise of this project was the insufficient visualization in the deep pelvis during open surgery. The deep pelvis has a complex anatomy because it includes a great number of organs in a particularly small and curved cavity. Shadows, blood obstruction and procedure limitations are permanent challenges a surgeon must face when operating in this region. The available lighting options do not solve the problem since they provide no adequate light focus and are not designer to manoeuvre within space limitations. Other solutions in the market as specific small illuminators are considered to expensive or uncomfortable to use. Chapter 1 introduces the approach undertaken to the claimed problem. This analysis is structured in four main aspects that surround the field of design concerns in order to create a framework around which to work. The context topic is related to the experience of getting in touch with the medical subject for the first time. It is a complex field of specific scientific knowledge and strict rules which are fundamental to understand and be familiar with, in order to properly locate the designed product. Light is the particular domain of this assignment. A study of basic knowledge about light is introduced followed by the characterization of medical lighting. This study revealed its importance not only for the choice of an adequate light technology but also for the fact that the lessons learned in this chapter’s topic were decisive for the development of the final design solution. The understanding of the behaviour of light and the working principle of optical fibres allowed a creative move towards a new product, based in a simple theory. In addition the light requirements for medical purpose were found to have few specialized standards. This project started up an inventory of important measurements to contribute for the surgical lighting knowledge necessary to develop good products. An overview of the existing products available in market made possible to understand that mostly optical fibre and LED light sources have potential for lighting a surgical scene. This is basically due to their size, minimal heat emission and light quality. Both technology and associated products have advantages and drawbacks that were considered for the development of this product. The topic about environment makes a call of attention to the problems related with the lifecycle of current products, such as plastic disposables, and their respective waste streams in particular the demanding biomedical waste management. An overview of the available options for the today’s products disposal is made with the respective characterization. Solutions can and must be found in strategies of shared responsibility and contribution that start with designers, in collaboration with a network of professional, and end in the final user. The design of a new product must take in account this prior knowledge in order to perform better in the future. Throughout the complete chapter 1 several cross references are made to the appendix report. This document is, especially for the initial approach, an essential complement since it contains all the support information for the learning process in an extensive guide of in depth information. In chapter 2 the previous topics are synthesized in three different design opportunities which are related with the scope of the project. These were important in order to establish and communicate a stepwise decision process with the participation of the user. Additional ideas concerning the functionality of different products are reported, demonstrating that the operating room has space for several design improvements, from the logistic point of view to a technical product level. Chapter 3 reports the idea phase where the chosen design direction was further explored with an additional study of patents and idea generation. The sketch results lead to the development of the two more promising concepts that have integrative functions and don’t imply the replacement of surgical tools but rather function together with them. The user is once again involved for a discussion of values for each solution. The choices made in this chapter are based in the main interest of the user. Performance/usability, commercial interest and light adequacy are the three main product characteristics that allow a good comparison between the presented options. Since there are no specific standards to compare the final choice with, a list of requirements of qualitative character is formulated. This list introduces for first time the most relevant evaluation factors used in both, development decisions and later assessment of the product. The factors are: (1) functionality - from ergonomics point of view: efficiency, safety and comfort, - (2) cost and (3) environment. The Extender add on is a concept dedicated to the perineal incision made in a Abdomino-Perineal approach where a rectal self retaining retractor is permanently used. The concept consists of a cordless, user independent device that integrates the illuminating feature with the elongation of the retractor’s performance. Chapter 4 initiates the product development in detail. From the previous list of requirements a quantitative criteria is created that relates each qualitative requirement to specific knowledge gathered all through the analysis phase. In this way the product development finds fundament in required tangible features that allow the progress from a rough concept proposal to a final design. Choices are made relative to material, light and power sources and in the end, construction considerations are made defining the final product. This phase required the construction of small models to exemplify the Total Internal Reflection principle, measurements of light and force in context. The main challenges faced during this stage were the dimensioning of the product, the choice of a power source and its sterile use. A battery solution is suggested for current application but an advice is kept for the future application of better solutions, not yet available in market, as the free form Lithium polymer batteries. The product, Indirect, is designed according to manufacturing and to use limitations and is later modelled in Solid Works. Chapter 5 is dedicated to the evaluation of the designed product. This phase is meant firstly to verify that the intended use is accepted by the user. A product prototype is also built for tests related with the involved electronics addressing in particular the heat management of the light source. Finally chapter 6 makes the overview of the project with the most relevant conclusions and recommendations of different nature. The further development of the product is advised, namely with more accurate, perhaps official, tests and also additional research, as the lifecycle analysis of the device for a proper performance evaluation. This report encloses the complete undertaken process, from a first approach to the comprehensive results of a design project. The results are considered fruitful. This project was always faced as a part of a larger project that includes a complete inventory of ideas to improve the OR and the surgeon’s profession. At times where high technology is given the highlights it is most important not to forget the backstage design which still moves the people and the world with well designed usable products.","Light; Open surgery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2010-10-12","Industrial Design Engineering","Applied Ergonomics and Design","","","",""

(mentor); Brezet, J.C. (mentor)","2009","On the initiative of Michael Weber, a cooperation has started between the Delft University of Technology (Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering, department Design of Sustainability), the Rotterdam Climate Initiative and Creditz (Michael Weber). Together they have set the goal to reduce the energy needs of fitness clubs by utilizing human power. This graduation report describes how human power in fitness clubs can be harvested and utilized. Therefore a strategy has been defined in the first part of the report that explains how human power can be introduced in fitness clubs and what the stakeholders (the initiator, fitness equipment producers, fitness clubs and customers) require to commit to their part. An estimation is made on the human power potential in fitness clubs. It is investigated which fitness equipment is most suitable for generating electricity, the intensity but also the frequency of use. Existing equipment can be categorized in: electrically braked equipment, mechanically braked equipment and equipment that requires electricity to function. Based on these outcomes and the insights from research to the market opportunities and the users two strategic product directions have been determined: 1. Retrofitting existing cardio equipment, especially cross trainers and cardio bicycles. 2. The selected direction, the development of a new framework design that is a best-in-class in utilizing human power from fitness equipment. This fitness bicycle combines the advantages of a cardio and a spinning bicycle with which both scalability and communicative value play an important role. The spinning bicycle offers a much leaner platform and the cardio bicycle a higher potential energy output, combining to increased environmental advantages. Because an important difference between these bicycles is taken out, the hybrid platform offers advantages in production costs (both financial and environmental). This new platform can become an important competitor for existing fitness equipment. The second part of the report focuses on the technological and environmental aspect of the development of this fitness bicycle. Central in the design of the bicycle is the optimization of the efficiency. This is an outcome of the comparison between a cardio and spinning bicycle with which comfort and performance should unite in the new design. The second part also focuses on the human product interaction, in the area of physical ergonomics, the development of a new interface and aesthetics. To enlarge the effectiveness of the “green” communicative value of the fitness bicycle, attention has been paid to two topics react on the experience of fitnessers in fitness clubs. A research has been conducted to determine if the awareness of the user as an energy producers can be stimulated by the fitness bicycle, by means of direct (numeric) and indirect feedback, creating a stronger connection between the sports activity and electricity. Also it has been investigated how the fitness bicycle would fit in a customer loyalty program (rewarding the user for their energy production) and how the technological infrastructure would look like. The application of RFID/NFC and low power wireless communication has proven essential for this. The result of the design process is a fitness bicycle that can compete with existing equipment in terms of the environmental impact for production, but that can produce electricity and supply this to the power grid with an efficiency of 65%. To enable this, the design uses components as an Magnetic Innovations outer rotor PM generator and a Swea inverter that converts the current for the power grid, but that can as well control the current with specially designed software; this ensures the user a natural bicycling experience. Until now, this has been an insufficiently acknowledged aspect – generating electricity is interesting for the user, but it is never the main goal of the sports activity. The fitness bicycling experience of the fitness club customers and owners should be changed for the good but not obtrusive, while providing the possibility to produce electricity. Because the utilized electricity is not converted into heat – as it is with normal equipment, requiring additional air conditioning – the returns of the fitness bicycle are increased by a factor 1:1,45. The research shows that the introduction of human power in fitness clubs can provide a contribution to reducing the environmental impact of fitness clubs.","human power; fitness clubs; awareness; environmental analysis; customer loyalty; fitness bicycle","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2009","Two dimensional physical model tests are executed with Xbloc armour units on low crested structures to answer the objective. On the basis of findings in the literature study it can be expected that the stability of the Xbloc elements on low-crested breakwaters is a function of crest freeboard and crest width. The crest freeboard (Rc/Dn) varied from -0.8 to 0.8 in steps of 0.4 and the tested crest widths (Wc) are 3 and 9 armour units wide. Additionally all tests series are executed with a wave steepness of 2 and 4%. All test series are executed once except the reference test series (Rc/Dn = 0, Wc = 3) which are repeated four times to acquire insight into the reliability of the test results. The number of rocking and displaced armour units is registered for the total breakwater, seaside slope and crest (also termed breakwaters sections). Settlements at both the sea- and leeward slope leads to openings in the armour layer at the transition from the seaside slope to the crest. As a consequence the interlocking properties of the upper part of the seaside slope and crest decreases and the area of the Xbloc crest elements normal to the wave induced flow increases. Moreover due to settlement the distance between two succeeding rows at the upper part of the slope increases whereas for the lower part of the slope it decreases. This together with the already decreased interlocking properties of the upper rows at the slopes and crest rocking results at both the upper part of the seaside slope and the outer seaward rows of the crest.","Xbloc; armour unit; breakwater","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2009","The game industry is one of the quickly advancing areas of software industry. Other areas of industry have things in common with the game industry, but are way behind. This is especially the case for the rendering done for simulations. The graphical quality of what is shown in simulation packages is about 10 years behind compared to the game industry. Because simulations in which the positions of objects play important roles, like logistics simulations, have a lot of things in common with computer games, they can use game technology. This research attempts to bridge the gap between the two industries, by creating a library that can be used to visualize the simulations, and that itself is based on a game rendering engine. In this way, the simulations can be visualized with a better quality, making use of the latest game technology. In this research, a proof of concept of such a visualization library is created, which utilizes the Ogre3D rendering engine. The working of the library and its general usefulness are demonstrated by using it to visualize two simulations. One of them is a simple DEVS simulation, the other is a complex container terminal simulation based on the DEVS formalism. It is found that the new visualization gives a huge increase in the realism of the graphics. By hiding implementation details and providing a configuration system, the solution is easier to use than the current visualizations of these simulations. Choices however need to be made in the trade-off between realism and rendering speed. As the solution is geared towards the future, it has been designed in a multi-threaded way. That has the drawback that it slows down the simulation on single-core processors.","Simulation; Visualization; Game; Graphics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Graphics","","","",""

Relatively simple gene networks have been engineered, but the design process is limited. Many papers advocate the use of engineering concepts like standardization and modular design to simplify the design process and enable the design of more complex systems. Currently, there are no tools available that implement both concepts in a practical way. Results: We have developed a software tool to show how standardization and modular design can be used for the design of logic gene networks. We introduce gene network templates to be able to use modular design in a practical way and use a standard model to simplify the design process and enable reuse of parameters. We have designed three logic gate templates and used them to build two logic gene networks: a demultiplexer and a D-latch. Our software tool was used to turn the templates into devices and to evaluate the performance of the devices. The results show that the devices are evaluated correctly. Furthermore, the results show that for the design of a gene network our method can be used to indicate which biological parts are preferred at what location in the network.","synthetic biology; gene network design; gene network; logic gene network; CAD tool; modularity; standardization; bioinformatics; biological systems; design process; modular design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Mediamatics","","","",""

If traditionally, parameters like porosity and absolute permeability have been most often included in such applications, this study focuses on researching the possibility of estimating the relative permeability curves in an assisted procedure by means of the Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). Stand alone estimation of the relative permeability parameters, as given by the Corey parametrization, as well as combined absolute permeability - relative permeability estimation experiments were performed on a synthetic study case and the ability of the EnKF to recover the true values of the parameters, given bottom-hole injector pressure and oil/water producer rates measurements, was tested. The influence of the initial distribution of the relative permeability parameters on the value of the estimates and the reduction of uncertainty, as well as that of the number of the measurements and the length of the assimilation period, in terms of covering or not the water breakthrough moment, were also investigated. Results show that some of the relative permeability parameters (the Corey oil coe±cient) can be recovered from the measurements, while others (the relative permeability end points) are not very sensitive to data assimilation and that estimating relative permeability has a positive e®ect on the estimation of absolute permeability, at the loss of accuracy of the relative permeability parameters estimations.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-10-05","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied mathematics","","","",""

(mentor)","2009","Bus based interconnects are commonly used to connect Intellectual Properties (IPs) on System-on-Chip (SoC). However, as the number of high performance IPs with large communication requirements in a Multi Processor SoC (MPSoC) increases, the bus interconnects become a communication bottleneck. To overcome this limitation, the bus based interconnects are replaced by Networks-on-Chip (NoC) as the interconnect for IPs in an MPSoC. The ability to support multiple protocols, both legacy and newer, is essential for leveraging the advantages of the NoC. This thesis describes the protocol conversions, or shells, we design for the aethereal NoC, to provide a unified message format for the PLB, OPB and FSL protocols. Furthermore, to tolerate the latencies when accessing memory and to increase the throughput when possible, we add support for posted write and prefetch read in the shells and we design a mechanism to coalesce multiple single transactions into burst transaction when possible. To validate our design, we prototype it on a Virtex-II PRO FPGA. We use both synthetic applications as well as real life applications to benchmark and analyze the effect of factors, like computation-to-communication ratio, various link bandwidths and compiler loop unrolling on the performance of the system. The results show that reducing the link bandwidth up to a certain point does not affect the performance anymore, as the latency associated with NoC internals becomes dominant. Also the burst transaction can sustain the performance of the system up to a certain point, when the link bandwidth is reduced. The best result is obtained using a shell with posted write and prefetch read.","Networks-on-Chip; FPGA; protocol conversion; System-on-Chip; IBM CoreConnect; Xilinx","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","","",""

The aspects of sustainability, fashion and last but not least usability were combined in this project. First of all, sustainable methodologies and textiles were investigated. Then, an internal and external analysis was conducted, after which the method of cultural probes was used to map the context of the lifestyle. A collage showing the style of the target group can be seen at the right. A list of criteria was set up as a result of the analysis phase. Next, ideas were generated. Three concepts were developed: the concept of a modular but simple bag, the concept of a bag that can be transformed in size and finally the concept of a book that contains guidelines to make your own bag from waste materials. These concepts were evaluated and the modular bag has been chosen to elaborate further. The design result is a bag that be split in two bags of different sizes by means of zippers. The bag, which can be used as a backpack or shoulderbag, is made of naturally tanned leather because that is a durable, beautiful and classic material. The price positioning has been determined by comparing the new bag to bags in the same segment (Claudio Ferrici, Fred de la Bretoniére and Cowboy Bags) and bags with the same target group (Freitag, Gravis and Crumpler). Finally, a protoype was made and a user test was conducted to get insight in optimization points of the design. Together with the assessment to the criteria, the conclusions from the user test are summarized in a recommendation to the company. This recommendation includes ways to realize series expansion, increasing the brand familiarity of GoTo and marketing concepts. Furthermore, a photoshoot is held with a photographer to make product- and lifestyle photos.","context mapping; cultural probe; lifestyle; sustainability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor); Jacobs, J.J. (mentor)","2009","Since 1990 a smoke free working environment is compulsory at institutions, since 2004 on the work floor in general and since 2008 in the catering industry. This graduation project describes the development of a smoke solution to be used at companies, events and in the catering industry. The project is executed for Neptunus structures, a company that develops, manufactures and rents out temporary structures of superior quality for the event and business market. Neptunus is first in the development of new technologies, which makes them market leader in the top segment, where many competitors are active. In this market many trends can be noticed. A growing need for flexible housing, more restrictions for semi-permanent solutions, a stagnating event market and growing market for semi-permanent structures are most important for Neptunus. In the market of smoke solutions small tents and permanent smoke cabins are the biggest competition, but most of these solutions are not very comfortable. Only few bars offer a smoke solution. Bar owners state that this solution increases their income. Often bars and restaurants without smoke solutions do not offer these solutions out of a lack of space, money and sometimes interests. Although customers say their choice of bar does not depend on an available smoke solution, they do tend to end up in a bar where a smoke solution is present or smoking is still allowed. For this situation a half open shelter or a closed smoke solution can be developed. People will walk in and out all night or permanently stay in the smoke solution during their visit. With alcohol consumption unintended usage will be an important problem, therefore some kind of openness has to make it easier for bar owners to keep an eye on the customers using the solution. Smoke solutions can be found at institutions and companies, but there are still many employees without that luxury. Reasons are similar to those in the catering industry, but sometimes it is a question of principle. At events an additional tent to function as smoke solution can be placed almost effortless. However, this is not seen very often. For companies and events the smoke solution will be mostly used for short periods in time and rush hours during brakes. At companies there will be more peer pressure, thus less unintended usage. Depending on what kind of event, a music festival or a polo game, the usage will be similar as in the catering industry and at companies. Managers are willing to pay approximately 1500,- for a possible smoke solution. In the concept generation phase a brainstorm session has led to several product categories, for instance material, storage & assembly and existing shelters. These categories are used as guidelines to search images which serve as inspiration to start the idea sketching. Furthermore a process tree of the total life cycle, from production to dismissal of the smoke solution is drawn up. From this process tree a list of demands and wishes for the smoke solution in the catering industry and at companies and events has been concluded. The smoke solution has to fulfill all demands and as much wishes as possible for both the catering industry and companies and events since the final smoke solution has to be applicable in all environments. Design criteria are formulated to evaluate all concepts, for instance does it fit the Neptunus’ portfolio and is it better than current smoke solutions. Finally this analysis has led to 3 concepts of which one, The Smoke Dome, is chosen and elaborated in the detailing phase.","tent; smoking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor); Van Kuijk, J.I. (mentor); Den Ouden, P.H. (mentor)","2009","Usability, simplicity and ease of use are still ‘hot topics’ in product design. To illustrate how important the user became in product design, Philips introduced Sense and Simplicity as their brand promise in 2004. However, in the early nineties, Philips had already launched a product line that aimed to be specifically easy to use. The line was named the Easy Line and consisted of four audio products: an analogue clock radio, a portable radio, a radio cassette recorder and a HiFi set. Although, the line was intended to be THE solution to difficult to operate audio equipment, it didn’t sell well. The question arose: why? The desire to find the answer to this question formed the basis for this study. The study into the Easy Line was approached as a retrospective case study. The main research question was: ‘Why and how was the Easy Line developed and how come it was (not) a success?’ During the study, multiple sources of evidence were used. A large and important part of the information was obtained by interviewing people who played a role in the Easy Line project. When data were collected, mind-maps were made that formed the basis for ‘The story of the Easy Line’ which is told chronologically: The Easy Line Fierce competition in the consumer electronics market from Japan (Sony particularly) made it necessary for Philips to react and innovate to maintain a profitable market share. The combination of the growing dislike of complex products, the graying of the population and the then recent successful segmentation of the audio market into target groups was seen as an opportunity for Philips to develop easy to use products. Philips’ Business Group Audio thought that easy products would fulfil an unsatisfied need for uncomplicated products and would therefore result in sales and sustainable profit for Philips. The initial target group Philips chose for the Easy Line were the elderly, however, this has been adjusted at the start of the project to (almost) everyone. The Easy Line project was initiated by Philips’ Business Group Audio. The development of the portable Easy Line products (i.e. the analogue clock radio, the portable radio and the radio cassette recorder) started first. The design was done by Philips Corporate Design. The design phase of the portable range was relatively short: it took the designer about three weeks to finish the concepts. The development and design of the HiFi set was done by an external company: Cambridge Consultants Ltd. During the process there was little communication between the two project teams which resulted in a HiFi set that had little in common with the portable Easy Line products. During the development, especially of the portable Easy Line, no real user tests were done: the step to see if people really needed or wanted ‘easy’ products and what they expected of them was skipped. The Easy Line products were positioned in the ‘high-end’ segment. The high price was justified by emphasizing that the products were of high quality and had a special design. In the sales situation it wasn’t specifically emphasized that the Easy Line was a coherent line and that its products were easy to use. Besides, when compared to similar products, the Easy Line products were expensive, but had a short feature lists. The Easy Line was mainly sold in mass market stores which meant that products with similar functionality and much lower prices were displayed next to the Easy Line and consumers didn’t have the opportunity to try the products. Although the idea for an Easy Line seemed, and still seems, promising, the Easy Line itself cannot be labelled successful due to low sales numbers. Various reasons can be given for the fact that not many Easy Line products were sold, for example: the high prices in combination with the small feature lists, little marketing, the focus on a combination of selling points and the therefore diluted message to consumers. Besides, the project suffered from organizational changes in Philips’ management, shifting priorities and pressure on time to market. To support and strengthen the conclusions of the Easy Line case study, three short studies were done that were used to draw parallels with the Easy Line. The first topic was Braun (a German consumer electronics firm) to illustrate that the desire to simplify people’s lives by creating easy to use products was not new when Philips introduced the Easy Line. In addition Braun’s approach to product design showed similarities with simplicity as defined in this report. The second topic was Philips current approach to simplicity in products and the third is a short study to a selection of other products that somehow use ‘easiness’ in their development process and/or as selling point. The studies in this report indicate that: - Naming a product or product line ‘easy’ or having ‘sense and simplicity’ as a brand promise, influences consumers expectations about the easiness of a product. Fulfilling expectations of easiness requires (much) time and effort and is therefore (more) expensive. - Developing ‘easy’ products (might) require concessions on functionalities and price and the goal to make easy products therefore has to be set early in the process; - ‘Easiness’ doesn’t seem to be a useful (unique) selling proposition. Adding or focussing on other selling points like sustainability, design or a low price (next to easiness) seems beneficial to sales; - A product or product line needs to have a consistent and clear message to the consumer. A ‘message’ should preferably communicate the advantage(s) the product has for the consumer (i.e. makes the advantage observable). - Having easiness as selling point implies investing in the ‘triability’ of the product(s) in the sales situation, as ‘triability’ contributes to the ‘observability’ of the advantage(s) of ease of use and is therefore likely to contribute to sales. Exhibition An exhibition was designed to communicate the results of the Easy Line case study. The exposition is divided into four areas where the first forms an introduction; the last three together answer the research question: 1. An introduction to the Easy Line, 2. Why Philips developed the Easy Line, 3. How Philips developed the Easy Line, 4. And the results of the Easy Line project. The reasons why the Easy Line wasn’t successful should become clear while visiting the exhibition. The exhibition is flexible, so that it can be transported and set up in different locations. The exposition means include large panels with posters, rectangular blocks to put the products on with small signs and standards for magazines and information.","case study; exhibition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor)","2009","The first assignment of this bachelorproject was to enhance the user experience of the Test Zone on www.gmat-zone.com. This web application helps users practice tests before taking the GMAT. This project required that research was done about the usability of the system using several techniques. First, an online questionnaire was sent to students of the Rotterdam School of Management asking them to participate. They were asked to look at the Test Zone and share their thoughts by answering the questions in the questionnaire. Only one person filled in half of the questionnaire. A paper-based version was handed out to people who attended the GMAT training courses at Collins Kumarasinghe Associates and who had worked with the application before. Hardly anyone had used the application because they had just started studying for the GMAT. Most people started practicing with the application after they had finished the courses. The paper-based questionnaire was not a success either. Since most people attending the courses would be using the application later, they were perfect users for the think-aloud protocol. This technique is used to identify any usability problems by letting users, who have never used the application before, play around with the system and talk about what they are thinking. This makes it possible to identify what people do not understand and what parts of the application are unclear. This technique proved very effective and a lot of data was gathered from multiple sessions with different users. Most problems found using the think-aloud protocol were easily fixed. Most functionality was already available in the application but users had trouble finding it. Some pages were renamed and some bugs were fixed. Some new functionality was proposed during the second research phase. This involved adding a progress bar to show users how much time they were spending on each question, the possibility to rate and flag questions while taking the tests and being able to send questions to the trainers through the website. Users were also asked about the new functionality and they thought that each extra function was a good idea. These functions were also implemented and tested, and did not show any other major problems with the application. The second assignment was to gather the requirements for a car parts website, www.parts.sg, and implementing a part of the website. This assignment was not the project described in the Orientation Report. At first the assignment was to create an environment in which the web developer at Collins Kumarasinghe Associates could program websites easily and quickly. Research was done to see if another framework could support the company in a more efficient way. Collins Kumarasinghe Associates use Joomla to create websites. The project changed when the car parts website was ordered by the new clients. This was during the research phase and the idea became to pick a framework that would fit this project. This framework ended up being Drupal. Drupal is a good framework to help create community based websites. It is possible to create many different types of users with different permissions. This was exactly what was needed for the car parts website. Normal users are allowed to view and edit content such as parts or car brand descriptions and these users can also offer used parts for sell. Workshops are allowed to sell new parts and offer services. Workshops are run by other types of users, namely Workshop Moderators and Mechanics. They have other permissions than users who are not part of a Workshop. To gather the requirements for the website, multiple meetings were held with the clients. First, use cases and UML diagrams were created after meeting the clients for the first time. This highlighted what parts of the system were still unclear. After the second meeting, a PowerPoint presentation was made. This functioned as the prototype of the website and it contained almost all the functionality that would be found in the final version of the car parts website. This prototype proved to be very useful. The clients were happy to see the project taking shape and the prototype made it easy to discuss the different functions and to find missing functions. The prototype was also used to explain the website to the other developer. After the prototype was revised a couple of times, it was approved by the clients. After that the UML class diagram was finished and a functionality matrix was created. A Gantt chart was made to plan the implementation phase of the website. To implement the website, it was decided to use custom and existing modules. Modules add certain functionality to the web application. Many useful existing modules were found but the other programmer had a preference for his own modules. This meant that he decided to code a lot of modules himself even though existing modules could create the same functionality. One existing module called Modr8 contained some useful features for the Moderator function. Code was added to this module to adhere to the specifications of the Moderator. A rating system and personal messaging system were both implemented using existing modules. Other functionality was built using a combination of different modules or custom modules.","Userfriendly; Drupal; PowerPoint prototype","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","","",""

(mentor)","2009","The Dutch population is growing grey and staying mobile is becoming an essential need for an increasing amount of people. Scoot-mobiles are an important solution to stay mobile and are provided more and more. The higher market segment for scoot-mobiles is growing simultaneously. It’s a market segment in which its clients are used to buying products they like and are used to have the possibility to choose, simply because they want to live with quality and can afford it. Currently, there’s not so much too choose. Also current scoot-mobiles have functional shortcomings like a lack of baggage space, humidity problems in the control panels, and a limited freedom to charge them where you want. Next to that they’re big while manoeuvring, and people don’t always feel to be in control with the scoot-mobile. The aim of the project is to design a new scoot-mobile that has improved perceived aesthetics to its users, that offers possibilities to express the users lifestyle, and that has an improved usability. The scoot-mobile has to be technically, functionally and aesthetically outstanding. The result is the Stilo scoot-mobile that’s been designed from the ideas of current users. The form has been determined by the meaning of the product to it’s users: freedom, independance. The form refers to an icon of freedom and independance: the Vespa scooter. Next to that the Stilo scoot-mobile is innovative on a usability level, which also lead to technical innovation.","Design; Human Factors; Mobility; Ergonomics; Aesthetics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor); Fraaij, A.L.A. (mentor); Van den Ham, E.R. (mentor); Verheus, A. (mentor)","2009","Het doel van dit afstudeeronderzoek is het verkrijgen van inzicht in het ontwerpen van isolatie aan de binnenzijde van verschillende bestaande woningen, rekening houdend met de eisen aan het isolatiepakket en de veranderingen in temperatuurverloop en vochthuishouding die het aanbrengen van het isolatiepakket met zich meebrengen. Woningbouwcorporatie Stadgenoot heeft op dit moment veel woningen die een energielabel E zouden krijgen. Het doel van de corporatie is om de woningvoorraad binnen een beperkt aantal jaren ingrijpend te verbeteren. Dit heeft zowel een gunstig effect op de energieprestatie van de woning als de verhuurbaarheid en levensduur. Het na-isoleren van de woningen is in dit opzicht een goede mogelijkheid, echter brengt dit problemen met zich mee. De twee belangrijkste problemen zijn dat de ruimte die nodig is voor de isolatie van het woningoppervlak af zal gaan en dat door de veranderingen in warmte- en vochtverloop vochtproblemen, waaronder schimmelvorming, kunnen plaats vinden. Om de gevolgen van de binnengevelisolatie te onderzoeken is een computermodel in COMSOL ontwikkeld waarbij delen van verschillende gebouwen onderzocht kunnen worden. Verschillende isolatiematerialen zijn daarbij toegepast om zodoende een goede vergelijking te kunnen maken en om de keuze voor een bepaald isolatiemateriaal te onderbouwen. Door het analyseren van de resultaten van dit drie dimensionale model kunnen oplossingen met een klein en groot risico op vochtproblemen worden uitgelicht. Van de resultaten uit het model is een aantal tabellen gemaakt waarin verschillende oplossingen worden vergeleken. Omdat het materiaal en de isolatiewaarde niet de enige punten zijn die tot een beslissing voor een bepaalde oplossing leiden zijn ook de kosten, de werkelijke energiebesparing, de kosten en moeilijkheden bij aanbrengen en de kosten voor het milieu in de tabellen verwerkt.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Consrtuction","","","",""

(mentor); van Bussel, G.J.W. (mentor)","2009","A design tool has been developed with the aim of helping in the wind farm design process. The tool is able to handle rectangular layouts with any number of turbines. Wind farm power, as well as wind and site conditions can be specified by the user. The main tool models are described and the developing steps have been detailed. Results of tool functionality are presented and compared with other tools or real case studies. The two modes of operation are explained: the separation distance sweep mode and the optimization function mode. Besides, the advantage and limitations of the optimization mode are indicated. The main lessons learnt during the developing of this tool are described for each developing stage. The most relevant is that the optimum layout dimensions should be found using the separation distance sweep mode rather than the optimization function. As a main conclusion, the implemented design tool can be helpful for the design process of offshore wind farms. The tool allows the user to define turbine, wind and site conditions and wind farm layout properties. Based on these properties, the tool delivers the optimum layout dimensions considering the effects of wake losses and electrical cable losses and costs. Additional conclusions and recommendations are summarized together with some future work possibilities.","Windenergy; wind farm optimization; levelized production cost optimization; wake models; design tool","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""
