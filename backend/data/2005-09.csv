(mentor); Baptist, M.J. (mentor); Rijsdorp, A. (mentor); Visser, P.J. (mentor)","2005","Framework Within the framework of the 'Room for the River' policy in the Netherlands several river bypasses are studied. One of these projects is the Noordwaard, which is a special project, because a large polder (about 20km2) will change into a tidal influenced area. The primary water defences in the North of the polder (Nieuwe Merwede) are to be lowered to a treshold. The water defences in the South (Biesbosch) will even be removed completely. In this way water can be bypassed from the Nieuwe Merwede to the Biesbosch, this will result in a substantial decrease of normative water levels on the Nieuwe Merwede. The hydraulic and morphologic consequences for the Noordwaard will however be severe. Focus In this thesis the relation between creek design and morphology of the 'new' Noordwaard is studied. This is achieved by researching the morphologic and hydraulic consequences of the 'new' Noordwaard. After which the (possibly alleviating) morphological effects of a couple of design features are studied. Modelling In order to do this several 1D models are used. Model runs were performed with a 'small' model, for the Biesbosch, and with a 'large' model, including the whole of the Dutch delta basin (Noordelijk deltabekken). For which two types of boundary conditions were applied: - Historical 1998 (survey data for a representative year); - Probabilistic (discharge fractions of the Rhine). Morphology From the results of both calculations a couple of conclusions could be drawn. The major conclusion is that there will be predominantly moderate sedimentation, up to 6 mm/year for the creeks and up to 2 mm/year for the floodplains. Some aspects with a strong effect on morphology are: - Yearly river discharge variations; - The height of the threshold (small dyke) at the Nieuwe Merwede; - Local geometry; It also showed that the historical boundary conditions offer a more realistic approach to the morphology of estuarine river bypasses, then the probabilistic boundary conditions. The probabilistic approach was unable to deal with some essential aspects for modelling estuarine river bypasses, like time dependent processes (i.e. flood waves) and realistic sea water levels. Alleviating measures A detailed analysis on possible measures to reduce the sedimentation in the Noordwaard, showed that a simple meandering creek system best suites the morphological demands. Other alternatives, like divers under the threshold, even increased the sedimentation in the polder. This is caused by local circumstances, i.e. relatively large sediment concentrations in the discharge of the Nieuwe Merwede.","","nl","master thesis","TU Delft, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor); Baptist, M.J. (mentor); de Vries, M.B. (mentor)","2005","Salt marshes are transitional areas between soil and water. Until recently these areas were usually diked and drained in order to create new agricultural land, but nowadays fortunately more awareness exists about the importance of these inter tidal areas as nature reserves and as natural coastal protections. Although awareness on the coastal protection value of salt marshes has increased in recent years, it is still uncertain how and to what extent waves are reduced by these vegetated intertidal areas. In order to get more insight into the wave damping skills of salt marsh vegetation, it was decided to make SWAN suitable for modelling situations with vegetated foreshores. The numerical description of the effect of vegetation on waves that was used, is based on representing the vegetation by vertical, ridged cylinders and was derived by Dalrymple et al.(1984). The physical vegetation properties that are considered in this formulation are the relative vegetation height, vegetation diameter and density, and the drag coefficient. The calibration parameter in the Dalrymple et al.(1984) formulation, which is of significant importance for determining the wave dissipation due to vegetation, is the drag coefficient (Cd). By varying the drag coefficient different types of vegetation (both stiff and flexible) can be modelled. The value of the drag coefficient is dependent on the Reynolds number and on the shape and orientation of the object. A more severe study of the drag coefficient, first for a single cylinder in flow, subsequently for a multi cylinder array, gave insight in the relation with both wave and vegetation characteristics. A number of processes that are not accounted for in the Dalrymple formulation are also discounted in the drag coefficient. The model was made suitable to model homogeneous, horizontally varying (zoned vegetation) and vertically varying (f.i. Mangroves) vegetation fields. As a final validation the model was applied on field measurement results from the Paulina Marsh in the Westerschelde. In this case all parameters were known except for the drag coefficient, which was calibrated. The results were satisfactory, the value for the drag coefficient ranged between 0.5 and 3.0 and the relation with the vegetation height was as expected. The implementation of vegetation in SWAN was found successful for all types of vegetation. However, due to the dependency of the drag coefficient on wave and vegetation characteristics, the model can only be applied on specific situations where wave and vegetation measurements have been taken. In order to make the model generally applicable, more research needs to be done on the dependency of the drag coefficient on wave and vegetation characteristics. When more is known about these relations, a first prediction can be made on the value of the drag coefficient in a specific situation. This can be accomplished by doing more physical modelling tests and by taking wave measurements over vegetated foreshores.","","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor); Baptist, M.J. (mentor); Sloff, C.J. (mentor); Middelkoop, H. (mentor)","2005","A research concerning the most important bottlenecks in the computational modelling of a free meandering river. With the software package Delft3D of WL|Delft Hydraulics a meandering part of the French river Allier is modelled. The Allier is an important tributary of the river Loire. The modelled part is located near Moulins in a beautiful nature reservation. In this reservation it is prohibited to protect the riverbanks. Because of this the river can freely migrate. In the modelled year (2003) a cliff erosion of up to 60 m was measured. The point-bars of the river Allier are densely vegetated in many areas. To simulate the impact of the vegetation on the morphodynamics, two different methods are used: the increased Nikuradse roughness height approach and a method by dr. ir. M.J. Baptist proposed in his PhD. study, 'Modelling floodplain biogeomorphology'. In his approach the vegetation is schematized as stiff vertical rods with a certain diameter, density and height. Concerning the next three aspects the model showed significant errors: the cliff erosion, the typical sedimentation processes in the inside bends due to secondary flow and the spreading of different sediment fractions over the area. Because of the model errors it was not possible to say which one of the tested vegetation models performed best. But the bed shear stresses simulated with the approach by Baptist are much more physically reliable than the bed shear stresses by the Nikuradse approach. Also the physical representation of vegetation by rods instead of huge grains speaks in favour of the method proposed by Baptist. The assumption, however, that the Nikuradse approach leads to too large transport capacities in comparison with the approach by Baptist showed to be untrue. The simulation results showed that, whether the Nikuradse or the Baptist approach simulates the largest sediment transport capacity, depends mostly on the water depth, flow velocity, sediment diameter and especially the used transport formula. Both of the vegetation methods showed that the impact of vegetation on the simulated behaviour is very strong. Even a single tree, simulated as a very rough grid cell, showed to have a strong influence on the local morphodynamics.","","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor)","2005","Mangrove forests cover large parts of the tropical and subtropical shorelines and grow in the inter-tidal zone. Mangrove forests act as a natural coastal protection. The most important features of this protection are the prevention of erosion by the collecting of sediment and the reduction of the wave climate. There is a need to quantify and model hydraulic and morphologic processes, wave attenuation in particular, in order to predict and simulate the natural hydraulic behaviour and evaluate the consequences of any artificial measure in mangrove forests. In this study it is found, that the best numerical approximation to model wave attenuation in vegetation with SWAN (spectral wave model), was a formulation described by Dalrymple (1984). The formulation expresses the amount of dissipated wave energy in terms of vegetation characteristics and wave parameters. It has been implemented in SWAN, resulting in an adapted SWAN model in which wave attenuation can be modelled due to homogenous, horizontally variable or vertically variable vegetation. Subsequently the implementation for homogenous vegetation was validated on the results of physical model tests from Mendez and Losada (2004). This validation was successful and gave evidence the implementation was done correctly. The drag coefficient (Cd) is the only calibration parameter in the Dalrymple (1984) formulation and depends on the vegetation characteristics and wave parameters. For the vegetation characteristics it turned out that the drag coefficient depends mainly on the relative spacing. The dependency of the drag coefficient on the wave parameters is determined by the horizontal orbital velocity and the peak period, and could be best described by the relation between the drag coefficient and the Keulegan-Carpenter number. Next a sensitivity analysis was performed which resulted in the expected relations between the wave attenuation and the vegetation characteristics, respectively the hydraulic conditions. In a test simulation with patchy vegetation it was found to be possible to model wave induced setup causes by the energy dissipation in the vegetation, however the potential flow itself can not be modelled by SWAN, because the model cannot simulate flow. Two measurement campaigns in Vietnam on wave attenuation in mangrove forests were modelled as test cases in the adapted SWAN model. In these cases hydraulic conditions and vegetation characteristics were known from measurements and thus the drag coefficient could be calibrated. Finally it is concluded that the implementation in SWAN was successful for different types of vegetation. Nevertheless the dependency of the drag coefficient on both wave parameters and vegetation characteristics implies that the model can only be used when vegetation characteristics and wave parameters have been measured and related to the drag coefficient.","","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

As time passes systems loose their ability to fulfil their function and maintenance, corrective and preventive, becomes necessary. Decisions on design as well as on maintenance are often taken based on previous experiences, as there may be a lot of uncertainties. To cope with decision making under uncertainties risk management is introduced. In the first part of this report a risk management approach is introduced. This approach is a cyclic process consisting of the following phases: risk analysis, risk evaluation and prioritisation, risk control, and evaluation of risk control measures. Performance and costs are two key concepts in asset management. The level of performance can be divided in the level of delivery of water and the level of customers’ services. The quantitative and qualitative aspects of the level of delivery are the main focus in the second part of this report. The term SSM was introduced to make the level of performance of delivery towards customers measurable. SSM is a Dutch term that stands for minutes of insufficient delivery per customer per year. Activities, which could lead to SSM incidents, were registered. These activities were divided into activities, which lead to disruption of supply (in transport, distribution and connection mains), and activities leading to pressure and quality incidents. In a pilot study, of which the results are discussed, it became clear that the average SSM value for 2005 was about 36:20min. After this a case study was conducted looking more in depth at the SSM data of 2 companies who participated in the pilot. The objective of this case study was to look more in depth at the main activities causing SSM and possible ways to reduce SSM. For both companies a list of top 3 causes, as well as suggestions for reducing SSM are included in the conclusions. The general conclusion was that the main causes of SSM were activities leading to disruptions in distribution mains. Recommended was that improved maintenance reducing the occurrence of leakages could decrease SSM. In the last chapter SSM is looked at in the broader perspective of risk management, in which decisions are based upon uncertainties. Something is first said about larger production incidents, such as calamities and disasters. These incidents lead in certain situations to high values of SSM, which hold some ground for including these incidents in the future when talking about the SSM approach. Another factor decisions are often based on is an economic optimum. A start is made to find an appropriate economic optimum for a single main. The economic optimum was between corrective maintenance and costs for replacement and renovation. Based on the outcome of this calculation some recommendations are done.","risk management; water; SSM","en","master thesis","Technische Universiteit Delft, Faculteit der Civiele Techniek en Geowetenschappen, Sectie Watermanagement","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

In design stages classical formulae are used to predict the wave transmission coefficient Kt [-], but these formulae still show a considerable scatter, probably due to a limited number of parameters included. Neural networks are mathematical devices that have proven to be powerful tools in many fields of technology and can be used as prediction method for complex cases. During this study, neural networks have been used to find relations for parameters influencing wave transmission. Finally, a prediction model is made with an ensemble of neural networks, based on a database consisting of 3,934 transmission tests from test facilities from all over the world for various types of low-crested structures. An extensive database is composed, describing all specific hydraulic and structural parameters for each single test in a homogeneous way. In total 9 governing parameters have found to be important for obtaining a reliable prediction of the wave transmission coefficient. The present prediction model shows significantly improved predictions of the wave transmission coefficient compared to the existing empirical formulae. The prediction model has proven to be capable of handling both mound (rough) and smooth structures within one model, although these structures are found to behave completely different on wave trans-mission.","","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""
