(mentor)","2013","Similar to thousands other Special Economic Zone (SEZ) cities around the world, Batam, an Indonesian city-island at the border with Singapore, was developed by the central government to attract foreign investors and develop its industrial basis. Its strategic position made it an excellent location for the Singaporean manufacturing companies, in general light industry and electronics, which were looking for more space and cheaper production costs. But the present economic context, these companies, will leave these cities if the production conditions worsen. This is also the case of Batam, which began losing competitiveness in favor of other similar but cheaper cities in the SE Asian region, such as Vietnam or Bangladesh. Companies started to leave the city, this fact being confirmed both by the official economic data from the city and by the local media and businessmen. In the frame of the dual master track of real estate and urbanism, the project hereby is dealing both with the economic and the spatial problems that Batam is currently experiencing. The project addresses the poor housing conditions, reduced public mobility, degrading ecological balance of the island, the loss of competitiveness and the inefficient administration. The main tool for the planning strategy is a Transit Oriented Development (TOD) plan that uses a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system as main public transportation means. In tackling the problems the project uses the transfer stations to create destination activities (such as social and commercial services) and more and better quality affordable housing. The new public transportation system also creates new investment opportunities, along the main BRT lines and around the transfer stations. In dealing particularly with the loss of competitiveness the project proposes a cluster development based on the shipbuilding and oil & gas industry in the island. Through this intervention the living conditions in the city will improve and new opportunities will be created for larger private investments to take place in order to recover the competitiveness of the city. In this way Batam can better achieve its vision and continue developing on the long –term. Given the strategic importance of Batam at the national level as one of the main gates of foreign direct investment in Indonesia, it is likely that the central government would welcome such a proposal that addresses both the economic prospects and the overall living quality in one integrated spatial strategy.","Special Economic Zones; Transport Oriented Development; BRT; Batam; industrial cities; competitive advantage; industrial clusters","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-11-01","Architecture and The Built Environment","Real Estate & Housing","","Double graduation track Real Estate and Housing + Urbanism","",""

The approach links educational development projects to overall improvement of infrastructure by structuring resilient and sustainable interventions as principal objectives.

Adjacent it argues for a reflexive attitude in planning. These configure situated projects following the social landscape, evolving towards an operational, heuristic, landscape, and finally improving the overall public domain. It corresponds more efficiently to the local (cultural) situation. The prioritization of incentives indicate that this paper reflects on the complexity of intervening in an urban context heavily influenced and depending on informal economic activity, a political attitude which rejects the status quo, and the desperate need for (low-threshold) accessible facilities and services. The arguments are built upon literature studies, empirical findings, and follow a method drawn upon a (pedagogic) approach which connects a situated educational paradigm to a syncretized development discourse. As a critique to the current practice, it enables local identity to be incorporated and integrated in the process of building, planning, and learning.?","post-disaster re-development; development; education-orientated development; resilience; urban resilience; sustainability; informality; cultural resilience; capacity building; social capital","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-11-15","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","Explore Lab","",""

This will increase the container traffic intensity through the Caribbean. China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) wants to anticipate on this expansion of the Panama Canal by investing in a US$1.5 billion transshipment port in the Caribbean. Jamaica is an interesting location to realize this port, because of its ideal central position in the Caribbean and its location lies in the doorway of the Panama Canal. CHEC aims for the Goat Islands in Jamaica as their location for the new port. Normally the Jamaican government welcomes foreign investments of CHEC with open arms, but the Goat Islands are an environmentally protected area. Recently, this led to many complains by environmentalists. The new port can only be successful if it has a good competitive position with respect to other ports. The new port in Jamaica is a location with high potency to accommodate the container vessels which have ports at the East Coast of North America as destination. To attract shipping companies to the new transshipment port in Jamaica the price and efficiency of the new port must be competitive with other ports. As the new port of Jamaica doesn’t have a large hinterland and focusses mainly on transshipment, shipping companies are not bounded to Jamaica and can switch easily to other ports. The most competitive ports are Mariel (Cuba) and Freeport (the Bahamas). This report proposes designs and alternative locations for the new port. To find the ideal location for a new port in Jamaica different potential areas are selected and studied. The first steps resulted in sixteen possible locations for the port. Two Multi Criteria Analyses (MCA’s) resulted in a selection of four locations. Those possible locations for the new port are: the Goat Islands, Jackson Bay, Maccary Bay, and Little Bay. The best location is not found, because all the four locations are well-matched for their designed level of detail. Therefore the recommendation is made that all the four locations should be designed in a higher level of detail, so the decision makers can make well informed choices for the people of Jamaica. Because the media attention, the Jamaican government, and CHEC are more focusing on the Goat Islands than on the other locations, the location Goat Islands is designed further into detail. For designing the port the total surface of the port of 12 km2 is divided into port area for transshipment (4 km2) and area for the use of industry (8 km2). The transshipment area has a quay length of 3 kilometer, which provides enough berthing space to handle seven Post Panamax ships and one Panamax ship simultaneously. The maximum expected throughput of 7 million TEU per year is found. The transshipment area is also designed into further detail. Super Post Panamax ship-to-shore cranes, multi trailer systems and rail mounted gantry cranes are most suitable for the port. The hinterland connection is also designed. A road connection is needed and a railway connection is designed as an option. The industrial surface can be used for many different facilities. These facilities are the assembling of gantry cranes for the Americas and creating cement and steel for export purposes. These activities need quay length which is included in the design of the total layout. Also space is reserved for a manufacturing facility, a logistics center, a LNG power plant, and a major IT facility. The extreme wave conditions for the new port are investigated to come up with the design loads. Extreme waves with a return period of 1/200 years give a surge level of 2.0 meter and wave heights of 4.0 meters at the port entrance. Behind the port is found a higher surge level of 2.5 meters. Next to the extreme conditions the downtime of the port due to waves is established. Tropical storms are not strong enough to cause downtime, because of the sheltered area of Portland Bight. Only during hurricanes the port is not operational. The economical, social, and environmental impacts of the new port are described. For the new port the most favorable port model and a finance scheme are found. A private service port model with full concession in combination with a Build, Operate, and Transfer contract (BOT) is advised. The land will still be owned by the Jamaican government, but CHEC will fulfill both the functions of port authority and port operator. An environmental impact assessment has to be performed, because there are more issues besides the destruction of Little Goat Island, harming the fish sanctuary, and the impact on the total Portland Bight. Also these three issues should be investigated in detail. A SWOT analysis is carried out to find the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. The main opportunity and threat is the change in expected throughput. To deal with this uncertainty an adaptive port planning is designed.","Jamaica; port planning; container port; master project report","en","student report","TU Delft, Department Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering - Transport and Planning","","","",""

(mentor); Konings, J.W. (mentor); Behdani, B. (mentor)","2013","Container transport is currently growing fast and will continue to develop in the near future. However, some problems such as the road congestion, and negative environmental impacts due to container trucking, and the low utilization of container capacity are making the container transport less efficient. To deal with these problems, several new concepts regarding hinterland transport operations are presented and implemented by many seaports. The majority of these concepts aim to reduce the transport by roads and shift the cargo flows away from the congested roads to other transport modes including the waterways and railways. One promising new concept for improving hinterland accessibility is cargo-driven intermodal transport, which focuses on the consolidation of cargo flows. This concept may contribute to aforementioned problems by, e.g. improving the container weight capacity utilization and reducing the semi-loaded containers going the hinterland from the sea port. Applying cargo consolidation in cargo-driven intermodal transport is expected to be beneficial for the society, but it remains unknown whether it will also provide benefits to the logistic service providers. In order to answer this question, an analytical optimization cost model is created to investigate the cost performance of cargo consolidation in this thesis. Further, a numerical case of container shipment between Port of Rotterdam and Tilburg is presented to experiment with the model. Based on the outcomes of the model, several conclusions are drawn in this work. As one important conclusion, applying cargo consolidation for container shipment between Port of Rotterdam and its hinterland is economically viable for a specific shipping distance. Furthermore, with a sensitivity analysis, the load factor of incoming containers and the unit truck cost are identified as most influential factors with overall largest positive impact on the total cost. Finally, with a Monte-Carlo simulation the impact of parameter variations on overall conclusions of this work have been found negligible.","cargo consolidation; container; transport","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-11-05","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","Transport, Infrastructure & Logistics","",""

(mentor); Van der Spoel, W.H. (mentor)","2013","This report describes the development of energy storage strategies for short term Thermal Energy Storage in residential buildings with an air-source heat pump. Short term TES allows advanced integration of renewables because the associated mismatch between demand and availability is solved. The aim of the research was to develop control strategies which define a control sequence of heat pump operations with the purpose of minimization of primary energy input for space heating. This is achieved by more frequent utilization of free, low quality energy input. Exergy principles were used to assess the quality of energy. More free input will minimize the amount of work (high quality input) that is additionally required for the heat pump to generate the heating energy. In a conventional heat pump energy system, the installation is controlled without notion of exergetic optimal operation. This reference control strategy was compared to three optimization control strategies that were developed in this research, in combination with different storage capacities. The most advanced optimization strategy involves Greedy Optimal Control. This strategy defines optimal control of the installation based on estimates of future heat loads and future conditions for generation. First, a numerical MATLAB model was constructed in order to explore and compare the energetic potential of the strategies. This model showed that the optimization strategies result in significant primary energy saving when applied to large storage volumes that can only be realized within dwellings with latent TES. In latent TES, the high storage density during the phase change allows more compact storage. Secondly, the most potential storage configurations were translated into six use cases. The performance in terms of energy and exergy of these uses cases in combination with the most optimal control strategy was further simulated in a detailed TRNSYS model, and compared with the conventional control strategy. The aim of this model was to assess the influence of dynamic behavior of the heating emission system and temperature control on the performance of both strategies. It includes transient simulation of latent storage (macroencapsulated hydrated salt modules in a TES tank). This study has shown that the control strategy that optimizes operation and storage according to exergy principles, results in maximum 10% reduction of primary energy consumption for space heating compared to the reference situation.","short term thermal energy storage; predictive control strategies; exergy approach; phase change material; heat pump; variability renewable energy resources","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-10-27","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architectural Engineering and Technology","","Green Building Innovation","",""

This thesis builds upon previous work in which a crawler has been created that crawls a web application and generates its state-flow graph. We have pro- posed several concepts for the visualization of this state-flow graph to make it more comprehensible, such as choosing a dynamic graph drawing algorithm and applying clustering. We also integrated a visualization of test results into the state-flow graph to facilitate the locating of errors. These proposals have been implemented in a proof of concept tool called Graphicrawl.

(mentor); Thissen, W. (mentor); Jagtman, E. (mentor)","2013","According to the European Commission (2012), RPAS constitute a very promising new sector in the aerospace field in Europe. The emerging technology of RPAS and the variety of their civil applications (corporate, governmental, commercial, non-military) that make them useful for the military as well as the civil sector are related to monitoring tasks for a long period or flights with high risk through which RPAS can be beneficial for the citizens. However, there are some barriers that prevent the smooth and fast implementation of the wide civil utilization of RPAS. The dilemmas are among others the extent to which the European citizens accept the civil use of RPAS. Privacy issues and safety for example, are considered to be a constraint for the social acceptance of RPAS operations in civilian airspace and may influence the public perception regarding the development of the civil RPAS market. In this research the complex challenges related to SA of RPAS are studied through the identification of shared beliefs and perceptions among the citizens and through the understanding of their characteristics. A literature review as well as a critical reflection on it provides a definition of social acceptance of technological project that scientifically supports this research. Further literature review is used to address the problem, presenting the two polarized opinions; the supporters of the development of the civil RPAS market and the opponents. Moreover, a theoretical study of subjectivity related to risk perception merges the safety characteristics of RPAS with the issue of social acceptance. Q methodology is the quantitative and qualitative tool that is used in this research to study human subjectivity and answer how and why people have a specific opinion about RPAS. Through focus groups, the participants provided a list with statements regarding civil RPAS and their applications, which give a first indication on the issues at stake regarding this emerging market according to the public. These statements are ranked by the participants in this study in order to identify the underlying values that drive their perception. The quantitative analysis showed three factors that share common perspectives, attributing high significance to the possibility of an infringement of privacy as well as improving the current technical safety level of RPAS. Other conditions under which the public is willing to accept the wide utilization of civil RPAS are identified and interpreted combined with the theoretical underlying values that may influence human subjectivity. The analysis provides RPAS community insights on the shared perspectives of the public as well as a first comparison between the experts’ and laypeople viewpoints and areas of consensus and disagreement among them. A constructive dialogue among the policy makers, RPAS managers and the public can be structured having certain reference or starting points. The outcome of the research can be utilized while developing the regulation regime of the civil RPAS market in Europe, during which opposing public opinions may appear. The results that this research has provided can be utilized as a basis for further studies in the field of SA of civil RPAS in order to further identify the market characteristics, their interrelations and the influence they have on social acceptance of civil RPAS.","remotely piloted aircraft systems; risk perception; Q methodology; social acceptance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-10-30","Technology, Policy and Management","Policy Analysis","","","",""

As the most popular microblogging platform, Twitter has a vast amount of information available in the form of tweets shared by millions of users. Since this data stream is constantly growing, it is difficult to extract relevant information for users. More and more people want to benefit from these data and get a personalized service from Twitter. Extracting the semantic meaning of Twitter and modeling the interests of users allows people to enjoy a personalized service on Twitter. Meanwhile, research shows that people tend to express their emotions on Twitter. These emotional tweets usually clearly express the users’ preferences compared with other normal tweets. Therefore, our goal is to design some emotion-based user modeling strategies which exploit these emotional data. In this thesis, we introduce and analyze the approaches for detecting emotion on Twitter. First we evaluate and compare the performance of our approaches of emotion detection. Then we use these approaches of emotion detection to analyze our Twitter sample dataset for the purpose of user modeling. We also propose a set of emotion-based user modeling strategies on the Twitter platform based on these detected emotional data. Furthermore, we evaluate our emotion-based user modeling strategies and investigate their impacts on normal user profiles in the context of recommendation systems. Our results show that our emotion-based user profiles enhance the quality of user profiles and have a better performance in terms of recommendation accuracy.","user modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-10-31","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer science","","Information architecture","",""

An architecture of engagement aims to be affected and affect. It establishes new relations with other affiliated disciplines, the city and in a broader scale with individuals and institutions beyond the university in spatial, social and functional terms, so that a deeper sense of appropriateness in its practice evolves. Seeking for as much interaction with the environment as possible, the Architecture School is proposed to be located in the Hofbogen project in Rotterdam, valorizing the existing, abandoned though monumental infrastructure of the old railway, north to the central station. The complexity of the environment asks for a synchronicity of answers on different levels or degrees of resolution from the urban to the architectural scale. This architecture cannot be rigid – no stable configuration can response to the incessant modifications provoked in situ. Then, it cannot be completely flexible either – no restrictions leave space for no reactions. Instead, a variety of spatial conditions allows adjustability to the manifold needs. Thus, the School unfolds linear along the Hofpleinlijn in a multifactorial way, exposing the architectural education to the public. Institutional clusters, exhibitions expanded to public space, workshops and lecture halls that invite the citizens to participate are integrally correlated with the present activities. At the same time, the project gives back to the city a public promenade on the roof of the railway. These affordances enhance the qualities of the ready-made construction in its context without competing with the city. They revitalize the historical Hofpleinlijn, paying respect to the monument and supporting its integrity.","architectural education","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-11-03","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","DSD Explore Lab","",""

(mentor); Huib Plomp, H.P. (mentor); Marc Boumeester, M.B. (mentor)","2013","This project takes as a hypothesis that the future of architectural education is going to change dramatically in the following years, mainly due to constant rise of technology in the field. As a result it argues that architectural education may not need to be confined by the limits suggested by a building. Thus, it proposes to ‘split’ the school into its departments and comprise a system for the whole via a point by point approach. In order to do so however, it focuses on the reuse of existing structures and design of new semi-permanent ones. For that reason the project moves towards an inceptive architecture; one that returns to basics, embryonic. This proposal was lead by the observation of the intensity of movement in the city; one which this project has engaged to facilitate in the design. The intervention itself requires a focus on several scales, from the urban, to the landscape and the building scale. Therefore, in order to re-think the structure in the different scales the strategy works with a grid system. As a result it aims to a have a space that promotes constant dialogue between the building, the landscape, and the people; a relationship that inevitably will promote the growth of the learning environment. For that purpose the research was based on the notion of the ambient space-or in-between space- relative to the organization analysis of the city of delft. Probably the case for all the cities in the Netherlands, but particularly in delft, it seems that the city follows its urban infrastructure in all scales: urban scale, the city scale and the block scale. In all three one can infer a certain directionality and movement that evolves through that system. The centre of delft has always initiated certain movement, such as the pedestrian move in a five phase plan that started in the early 2000’s and aimed to pedestrianize certain areas of the city. Relative to that on the other side of the campus was the relocation of the TU faculty, while in between there are botanical gardens, a museum, student housing, and a what it seems to be a potential site for the architecture department of this project. At first close-up one can see the importance of that spot due to the fact that lies between the city centre, the urban infrastructure and the rest of the tudelft campus. So the urban strategy for this site was formulated through the notion of urban acupuncture. For that purpose three main aspects acted as the focus in which the ‘split’ could be made possible. First, was determining the size of the existing program, second was the distance between them, and third was their relation to their immediate surrounding areas. The investigation started through a study of solid vs void, the main urban infrastructural elements such as the river, the public squares and courtyards, and all that relative to the immediate location of the site. As I mentioned before the opportunity rose at this point due to the point’s connection to the campus & the city centre. In addition the intersection of main traffic arteries becomes crucial to the its future development as an architecture school. So the first point is now placed. A department that is in shared program to the architecture department, one that requires a certain degree of landscape relation, one that is at the heart of the city center, and one that relates to its urban conditions. Together they form a two bind system of a building and a ‘open space’ in which action may or may not be required. Through the intervention one can see that movement between them but more importantly the identity that starts to evolve.","architecture school; architectural education","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-11-03","Architecture and The Built Environment","Explore Lab","","DSD","",""

It is based on the Vision in Product Design (ViP)-design methodology. At the end of this project, a proposal was made to the client for Urban India 2020. From the initial design brief, a suitable planning was put in place by combining research methodologies parallel to the design methodology. Based on the design brief, it was key to first define the domain of Users - who are we designing for in this project? Hence, to define the domain, a mix of primary and secondary (Desk) research was undertaken. The present Indian Urban context and its mobility scenarios gave us the preliminary understanding of how different the context is. Based on these desk findings, further research questions were framed for field research. The findings from this research not only changed the orientation of the initial design brief but also provided the required insights to define the Domain. To gain strategic advantage with these insights, Brand research was undertaken. An internal research (Brand Identity) and external field research (Brand image) was carried out to understand the Brand Identity and Image of the company in India. With the understanding of the Brand Identity, the Domain was defined in the project. In the next step, the future context of Urban India was designed. As designing is always a future driven activity, desk research in the areas of DEPEST-demographics, economics, politics, environment, socio-cultural, technology and additionally leisure and ethical aspects were undertaken for India 2020 - which is relevant to the domain and others which are inspiring. Based on the factors identified, future context was framed which resulted in 4 unique behaviors. From this context framed, a direction- a behavior was chosen where the designer aimed to contribute with this project, a decision which was influenced by the Identity and vision of the client. This led to the formation of the Mission statement (re-brief) for the project. Once the mission statement was framed, through the right interaction analogy and product character, an appropriate concept was proposed.","Vision in Product Design; India; Automotive","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-10-30","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

The energy demand of reverse osmosis systems can be significantly reduced by using energy recovery. Autonomous renewable-driven reverse osmosis desalination systems set additional constraints on the required energy recovery device. This thesis aims design an efficient energy recovery concept for a small-scale autonomous renewable-driven reverse osmosis desalination system. In this context, the energy recovery technologies currently available are analyzed based on their characteristics. The constraints defined by the examined renewable-driven reverse osmosis desalination system are described and the energy recovery technologies that meet these requirements are listed. Five energy recovery concepts that rely on these technologies and apply for the examined RO system are designed. Based on the criteria set, the energy recovery concepts are evaluated. Their evaluation revealed the most applicable energy recovery concept for the examined desalination system.","reverse osmosis; renewable-driven desalination; energy recovery device; energy efficiency","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-10-30","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Bayen, S. (mentor)","2013","Modelling contaminants in the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve using Delft3D-WAQ results in useful data on residence times. Since measurements in the field are often not possible due to either safety hazards or ecological implications, the water quality model provides comprehensive data to analyse the behaviour of flow and contaminants and with that the residence time of these contaminants. The goal of this research was to define a workable definition of the residence time for contaminants in Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve and to use Delft3D to identify several situations in which concentration would become dangerously high or remain high for an extended period of time, to start with a simple conservative substance. The residence time is the time it takes for 95% of the mass input to leave the control region without returning at a later phase of the tide. The control region is defined as the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, covering the wetland areas and channels and leaving out the sea. In order to identify critical situations, several scenarios were set up and assessed for their influence on the flow of the contaminants. A conservative contaminant was modelled. The scenarios comprised several possible important tidal factors – release during high or lower water, spring or neap tide – and the importance of the entrance location of the contamination. In addition, the model representation of the vegetation was changed from the use of a higher Manning roughness value to the use of a directional point model. The results show that in general, the residence time of contaminants is lower when the discharge happens with high water and during spring tide, while a discharge of contamination with low water and during neap tide increases the residence time. The use of the directional point model instead of an adapted Manning’s roughness representation generally decreases the residence times. Although only a conservative tracer was modelled, it is possible to say something about other tracers by superposition of properties; interest in detailed behaviour of specific substances could demand further exploration of these substances though. The water quality model used in this research can be used for that.","magroves; water quality","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Van Plettenburg, D.H. (mentor)","2013","An important advantage of body-powered prostheses, compared to other types of prostheses, is the presence of proprioceptive feedback. Proprioception makes it easier to perform goal directed movements. Body-powered prostheses (for transradial upper-limb amputees) used nowadays make use of one way control, which means that only the opening or the closing is controlled voluntary. By using one way control, proprioceptive feedback is only available for the movement that is controlled voluntary. To gain a broader feedback, it would be better to use two-way control. This means that the opening and the closing can be controlled voluntary. Two-way control can make the control of the prosthesis more natural and intuitive. To design such a prosthesis in the future, the inputs and the outputs must be known. The goal of this study is to investigate possible movements generating the inputs (operating forces and displacements) for a two-way controlled prosthesis. The selection of suitable movements for control is done in two phases. First, the body parts useful for control in a cosmetically acceptable way are determined. Second, all movements produced by these body parts are analysed by using three criteria: 1. The control movement is no ‘daily movement’, 2. The movement can be performed in every posture needed to function normally in daily life, 3. The movement does not influence the position of the artificial hand. Only the movements fulfilling all criteria were considered suitable for control, resulting in the following movements: elevation of the shoulder, protraction of the shoulder, flexion of the trunk, rotation of the trunk and flexion of the toes. Twenty subjects without arm defects (10 male/10 female, 25±2 years old) were requested to perform the five movements left and right. Per movement the maximum displacement and maximum forces at 0, 25, 50 & 75% of the maximum displacement were measured. Subjective perceptions of the participants regarding easiness, comfort and intuition were recorded in questionnaires. For all movements, the operating force decreased with increasing displacement. The highest forces and displacements were found for shoulder elevation (left: 98.57±29.48N/80.5±22.6mm; right: 103.59±32.11N/85.5±19.9mm), whereas the lowest force and displacement values were found for toe flexion (left: 22.15±6.47N/17.5±5.0mm; right: 22.39±7.26N/17.5±5.0mm). All movements were easy and comfortable to perform. Flexion of the trunk was experienced less intuitive than other movements. Of the five movements investigated, only shoulder protraction and elevation are considered suitable when using a Bowden cable. By designing a two-way system in the future, it is recommended to investigate the use of a wireless system. By using such a system, no hindering cables are necessary, which makes the prosthesis less elaborate and restricting. In the case of a wireless system, all investigated movements are suitable.","arm prosthesis; two-way control; body-powered; operating force; operating displacement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-11-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

Specific examples were visualization of what is detected by the robot, but also a path prediction on where the robot will go to. When the users know what the robot will do, they can predict if they are safe or that they could better step away. With a depth camera, it is possible to detect 3D information of objects in the world. With the decreasing prices and wider availability of modern-day depth cameras, multiple papers have been written with applications for its uses. In this research, a Kinect is used. This device combines the use of a depth camera with a RGB camera. These devices are quite often used in the research field of robotics, because the Kinect is relatively easy to implement in robotic software. The device can be placed on the robot, giving it the ability to `see' the world. This report shows that it is possible to use a projector to show the user which obstacles are detected by the robot. The system needs to be calibrated and the 3D information must be transformed from the Kinect coordinate system to the coordinate system of the projector to project on the obstacles at the correct location. By projecting gathered information, e.g. the positions of obstacles, it can be made clearer to the user what kind of information is known by the robot. Additional information can be added, such as which obstacles block the preferred path of the robot. The use of the projector is limited due to the brightness and area of projection, one should take this into account before implementing it in a system. It can be a promising way to improve safety in several industries.","visualization; projection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-11-27","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

Tideway, as an offshore contractor, is often involved during the construction of an offshore wind farm to carry out cable burial and/or rock placement operations. The process of burying a cable, by means of a trencher, is until now executed by subcontractors. Tideway considers conducting the cable burial proceedings themselves, rather than hire a subcontractor. The goal of this research is to identify whether it is feasible to integrate burial equipment into the fall pipe ROV of the Flintstone, such that Tideway can carry out both burial and rock placement operations, as separate activities, using a single vessel. A literature study is performed in order to produce a qualitative analysis of the existing jet trenching theory, and revealed that both the relationship between jet-production and total momentum flux of a jet system (Vlasblom, 2003) and the mathematical relationships for moving jets (Yeh et al., 2008), can serve as the basis for a computational model. Furthermore, an overview of the main components of an ROV jet trencher is added to the report. A mathematical model is built in order predict the trench performances on the basis of the available hydraulic power. This model contains three different calculations methods, which are based on the collected theory, and provides a range of achievable burial depth versus ROV transit velocity, within which the actual trench performances are expected.","post-trenching; jets; Remotely Operated Vehicle; cable burial","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-10-30","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Dredging and Offshore Engineering","",""

(mentor); Jellema, A.H. (mentor)","2013","This report presents a six-month project executed for Healthy Entrepreneurs (HE) in order to increase the trust in generic medicines supplied by HE, by means of the development of a qualitative packaging and an effective communication strategy. Initially an exploratory research about the context was conducted in order to understand the market condition, constrains and demands of the healthcare environment. Next, the business model and supply chain of HE was analyzed, in order to know the current business performance, the medicine assembly process, and the currently used repacked packaging. To see the basic requirements of a pharmaceutical packaging, research had took place to investigate the functions and features a standard packaging should meet. Adding to these findings, user analysis was conducted to gain insights about factors that influence their trust in medicines, and their perceptions toward a medicine packaging. These analysis results were further used as the design guideline and requirements during the design process. Three challenges were found to be most important to tackle in this project: 1) Develop an affordable and safe packaging to assure the quality of repacked medicine 2) Create two-way communication and patient oriented information to improve patient’s accuracy of medicine use 3) Develop HE brand identity and awareness Based on the insights gained from the analysis, ideas of packaging design and communication strategy were generated through several design methods. Initial ideas were accessed by a field testing with the target user, and based on their feedback, ideas were further evaluated and developed to a complete concept. The final packaging is a flexible zipper lock bag, which offers advanced protection compared to the current used repacked bag, and is much cheaper than blister and strip packaging. In addition, the tamper-evident feature and trace and track function ensure the authentic of the medicine. Other than the new packaging, a visualized patient card and a Medicine Use History booklet that is used to store the patient cards were developed, which function as communication tools to assist pharmacist’s explanation and improve patient’s understanding about drug use. Another purpose of this design is to involve patients in their own treatment by collecting the cards and discussing with health professionals, thereby patient’s awareness of healthcare and rational use of medicine can be increased. All in all, the new packaging, the patient card and the booklet are able to increase the trusted feeling of HE brand from patient’s perspective, and they are touchpoints that represent HE brand identity and raise HE brand awareness in the target market. The concept was evaluated by local pharmacists, pharmaceutical expert and Native Africans in the Netherlands. According to their feedback, final adjustment was made, and recommendations for HE to further optimize the design and strategy were also given.","packaging; BoP; healthcare; communication strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Strategic Product Design","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Koopman, F. (mentor); Vollebregt, A.G. (mentor)","2013","On one hand, São Paulo is in desperate need of popular housing for the lower classes. Real-estate investors are not focusing on the lower classes. On the other hand the city has a lot of abandoned buildings, for several reasons. A large amount of the abandoned buildings are situated in the city center. The unoccupied buildings contribute in the sensation of not feeling safe during the night. During the day the center and its abundant services are being used extensively. During the night the center deflates and there is no sensation of safety. Housing organizations have started to squat abandoned buildings. The organization helps a group of people who want to live in the center but have no means to enter the housing market. They are fighting for housing. However, they are denouncing the real-estate speculation and the discrepancy of compliance. The group normally gets evicted. The abandoned buildings versus the unsafe sensation of the center are two problems which could complement each other. The main involved stakeholders are the inhabitants of housing, the municipality and real-estate investors. The entire situation has been researched and a response has been given. The report starts with a theoretical background. The current situation and the history of the battle for the city center has been taken under a loop. It starts with the description of the development of history and architecture of São Paulo city from 1549 until today. Then the migration within the city is being discussed, with a focus on the allocation of the poorest and their way of living from the “casa própria” to the “corti?os” in the center. Followed by the economic, political & social context for popular housing in São Paulo city. Then a description and the outcomes of the participatory action research that has been done is described. It describes the set-up of the research. Followed by the statements of stakeholders on six different themes: function of the historic city center, local empowerment, responsibility popular housing: government or private investors, buying versus renting, sensation of safety in the city center and communal living. To be able to transcode all the theory into design, a framework has been created. Environmental aspects of the city are being described as well as the new vernacular architecture of the region. The three target groups of the situation are being compared to each other on the capacities and their needs in relation to the city center. A building in the center of the city has been selected as an example for this project. That project is able to fit the capacities and needs of the three main target groups. An integrated strategic (social and political) and spatial design has been created for this project, of which its qualities strengthen each other.

First a quantitative study was carried out to match activities and spaces in the home to human values (Schwartz, 2000). This resulted in a design-tool that consists of the ten values (hedonism, self-direction, universalism, benevolence, conformity, tradition, power, and achievement) associated activities and spaces, and hierarchical graphs based on space syntax. Lastly opposing spatial features were laid over the two dimensions (openness to change vs. conservation and self-transcendence vs. self-enhancement). Subsequently this tool was used to design seven houses which were used to find out whether the values designed in the houses were also recognised as such. Houses with values preferred by the interviewees, were chosen more often than values on the other end of the circle, indicating that the tool is of some help when certain meanings need to be communicated by design.","environmental psychology; values; housing; home; design tool; fractality","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Explorelab","",""

(mentor); Brody, S. (mentor); Labeur, R.J. (mentor); Ledden, M. (mentor); Willems, A. (mentor)","2013","More than five years after Hurricane Ike devastated the Galveston Bay Area, the most critical challenge remains; reducing flood vulnerability. In response to Hurricane Ike’s disastrous impact, several structural flood risk reduction strategies have been proposed. Some advocating local solutions, others advocating system-wide coastal barriers. The relationship between storm surge within Galveston Bay and storm surge at the open coast may profoundly affect the performance of these local or system-wide solutions. Limited understanding of bay behavior under hurricane forcing limits the ability to select the optimal solution. To assess the bay behavior under hurricane forcing, a probabilistic behavior-oriented storm surge model has been developed. The model couples meteorological forcing with hydrodynamic response and provides a first-estimate of storm surge within simplified semi-enclosed bays. A large suite of synthetic parametric hurricane wind fields provides input for the storm surge model. Storm surge at the open coast is obtained by solving the one-dimensional depth integrated shallow water equations. Storm surge within the semi-enclosed bay relies on a parametric relation between wind set-up and storm surge at the open-coast. Hindcasts of historic storms show that the model provides a reasonable estimate of storm surge within the bay, with a typical error of ±0.5 meter. Storm surge within Galveston Bay is a delicate balance between inflow and local wind set-up. Simulations show that local wind set-up contributes up to 50% to the surge within the bay, depending on landfall location and storm intensity. Results indicate that the 1/1,000 yr-1 surge at the northern bay end exceeds the 1/1,000 yr-1 surge at the open coast by about 0.5 meter. The 1/10,000 yr-1 surge at the northern bay end exceeds the 1/10,000 yr-1 surge at the open coast by about 1.0 meter. Although significant, obtained results do not indicate that the difference in surge elevation plays a crucial role in strategy selection. To assess the benefits of a coastal spine, ship channel gate or Texas City levee upgrade, a preliminary flood risk assessment has been performed. For each strategy, the benefits in terms of risk reduction are estimated by relating simulated surge probabilities to residential exposure, industrial exposure and surface elevation. Comparing the estimated investment cost and benefits of each strategy allows an informed monetary comparison of the individual risk reduction strategies. The flood risk assessment confirms that the Galveston Bay Area is highly vulnerable to storm surge. Existing regulations solely require industrial complexes to protect up to the 100-year flood level. Consequently, residential exposure significantly exceeds industrial exposure for return periods of up to once per 100 years. Industrial exposure outweighs residential exposure for less frequent events. Considerable benefits can be achieved by protecting both residential property and industrial assets. Preliminary results indicate that a coastal spine significantly reduces storm surge within the bay and yields the highest benefits in terms of risk reduction. The ship channel gate and the Texas City Levee Upgrade yield a similar rate of return but achieve considerably less benefits.","Galveston Bay; hurricane; Houston; flood risk; storm surge; Ike; Hurricane Ike; flood vulnerability; Galveston; semi-enclosed bay; probabilistic; landfall; flood risk reduction strategies; Ike dike","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

In particular, the discomfort is associated with the current harnessing system, the shoulder harness, which causes pain in the axilla area. The goal of this study is to design a new harnessing system for trans-radial amputees, which improves the comfort of wearing and operating the prosthesis without compromising the users ability to operate the prostheses. A new harnessing system is presented and evaluated in comparison with the standard ‘Figure of 9 harness’.

Knowledge of the cutting mechanism leads to the ability to calculate cutting forces and the specific energy required to excavate material. To find the failure mechanism and answer the research question, a cutting setup was designed and built and cutting experiments were conducted. The setup was designed, based on requirements that result from studied literature on frozen clay and cutting theories. A series of cutting experiments were conducted where a slab of frozen clay was pressed against a transparent wall and the top layer was cut off while filming the process with a high speed camera. The results are measurements of the cutting forces and observations of the failure mechanism.","Arctic; Trenching; dredging; failure mechanism; frozen; clay","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-10-16","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Dredging and Offshore engineering","",""

(mentor); Ursem, W.N.J. (mentor)","2013","Currently a major part of the world protein consumption comes from the industry of livestock (animals: meat). Unfortunately, meat industry produces terrible environmental consequences and it is perhaps among the most polluting human activities. Furthermore due to the growing population it seems inviable to maintain the production rates of animal products in the future. A possible solution to reduce livestock production while ensuring a diet rich in protein could be achieved by eating insects. Insects generally present high amounts of proteins and lower polluting rates than livestock. A key feature is their feed conversion rate. Insects do not need to keep their body warm so they are much more efficient in converting feed into body mass (food). Despite the fact that insects present a very promising proteins source and are consumed in many other countries, they can be easily rejected as food in Western societies. Food rejection is caused by different factors, but among them, disgust was expected to be the driving one. This problem is addressed through a design exploration about ‘Insects for Food’ and consists of ‘A Design Exploration of Changing Western Perception of Eating Insects’. This encloses a primary exploration of how insects can be accepted while trying to address the motivations of people to make insects, if possible, appealing. This process from food acceptance to food choice is here addressed as food selection This exploration started by looking into topics such as food acceptance, disgust, food choice amongst others in order to gain knowledge for a user research process. This consisted on a sensitizing material (through diaries) and immersions (interviews) of twelve participants. In order to obtain a rich variety of insights different tools were selected and created. The collection, analysis and clustering of these insights resulted in a creation of three different groups called ‘Insight Themes’. These describe possible routes towards insect acceptance and are: ‘Food Acceptance Strategies’, ‘My Food Dreams & Motivations’ and ‘Caring for the Environment & Myself’. ‘Food Acceptance Strategies’ focuses and captures the different strategies people (rationally) develop to accept certain foods. Since food acceptance was determined as the core of this project, this Insight Theme is higher in amount of content. The core of this Insights Theme is, as its names states, ‘Acceptance Strategies’ and it is expanded by insights on distaste, irrational disgust and emotional associations. ‘My Food Dreams & Adventures’ represents the daily aspirations as well as the motivations of people to discover and have food experiences. ‘Caring the Environment & Myself’ illustrates the concerns people have about how their decision affect the environment and their own health. However, people often do not want to make big efforts and often they doubt what the right solution is. All Insight Themes were used for used in two different workshops (brainstorm sessions) to generate ideas and develop design concepts. All generated ideas were classified according to a criteria based on ‘insect acceptance’ and ‘fit for Philips’. Out of this selection and together with the creation of a design vision, three concepts were finally developed: Philips Balance, Terra and Philips Egg. Philips Balance is envisioned as the new generation of current balances placed at supermarkets. This concept provides information related to nutrition, sustainability and cooking to help people to make better choices at the supermarket regarding their personal needs. Terra is a food brand which offers different products containing insects amongst its ingredients. Terra starts by addressing products to increase food acceptance and evolves by fulfilling food aspirations and motivations of people. The third concept, Philips Egg is a kitchen appliance to keep any kind of food fresh, including insects. This concept goes into a future scenario in which insects are completely accepted and are part of our current diet. An evaluation of these concepts was carried on through an online questionnaire which was filled by sixty one participants recruited from Philips Research. The evaluation also gathered information about eating insects through a set of questions and its results invite to think that ‘Insects for Food’ scenario is better than what is was initially thought. Regarding the concepts, the results were solidly positive for the concept Terra, acceptable for the Philips Balance and slightly negative for the concept of the Philips Egg. All insights gathered from the user research as well as from the evaluation of the concepts invites to conclude that disgust is not as important as it was initially believed. This drives to think that even when disgust plays an important role, insect’s introduction perhaps lays on the understanding and creation of products which fulfill people motivations and aspirations with respect to food choice.","design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Happee, R. (mentor)","2013","The better understanding of neuromuscular control of the human neck is of critical importance to understand whiplash injury and neurological movement disorders. Isometric experiments using electromyography (EMG) are an appropriate method to study neuromuscular control patterns of neck muscles. As the human head-neck system is highly complex, it often exerts forces and moments simultaneously during isometric testing. However, literature generally shows no clear distinction between force and moment tasks in isometric experiments and no study tested forces and moments tasks separately in one experiment as the tasks given were ambiguous. The goals of this study were to test force and moment tasks separately in one experiment and analyse the differences in muscle control patterns. 12 healthy male subjects had surface electromyography (EMG) placed bilaterally on 4 neck muscles: sternocleidomastoid, splenius capitis, semispinalis capitis, trapezius. Isometric contractions were performed in a constrained helmet rigidly connected to an overhead loadcell. A new intuitive 3D visual feedback was applied in a neck isometric experiment which assisted subjects in separating force from moment tasks. Subjects performed force and moment tasks through submaximal voluntary contractions (sub-MVCs) in the anterior, posterior, and lateral directions. In a conventional 2DOFs task subjects received 2D feedback which only showed a target point while in a 3DOFs task subjects received an additional DOF feedback which showed a coupled moment in force tasks and a coupled force in moment tasks. Force and moment tasks with 2DOFs and 3DOFs visual feedback were compared. A consistent load coupling pattern was shown in 2DOFs task. Subjects performed force tasks coupled with consistent moment load and moment tasks coupled with force load, for instance, protraction force tasks coupled with extension moment; flexion moment tasks coupled with retraction force. With 3DOFs visual feedback, most subjects nullified the coupled load in the direction where the coupling DOF was displayed (P<0.05). The sternocleidomastoid and splenius capitis showed significantly different control patterns between force and moment tasks in the anterior (SCM: P<0.005, SPL: P<0.05) and lateral direction (SCM, SPL: P<0.05). Based on the findings we propose that force and moment tasks should be considered separately when performing neck isometric experiments on sternocleidomastoid and splenius capitis in the future research. The 3D visual feedback was a good method to separate force from moment tasks. The isometric load data along with EMG activity can be used to validate musculoskeletal neck models.","neck muscles; isometric; electromyography; visual feedback; muscle control patterns","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-11-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

Both the Kalman Filter and the Ensemble Kalman Filter are used to perform the resource model updates. Experiments under varying conditions are performed to assess the influence of several parameters. It is observed that both methods lead to an increase in prediction accuracy.

Additionally, empirical and theoretical relationships for estimating the unconfined compressive strength were evaluated. Needle penetration tests gave questionable results, especially when trying to estimate the UCS by using an empirical relationship: estimations differed by a factor of 10 from actually measured UCS. Unconfined compression test results proved to be strongly affected by anisotropy due to sedimentary bedding, ranging from 0.12 MPa (parallel to bedding) to 0.45 MPa (perpendicular to bedding). Shear box tests yielded relatively high cohesions for this particular material, also depending strongly on the orientation of sedimentary bedding, ranging from 42 kPa (parallel) to 128 kPa (perpendicular). The estimation of UCS from cohesions and friction angles obtained by shear box tests, gave fair but not highly accurate approximations within ±25% of the actually measured UCS.","calcarenite; strength; shear box; penetrometer; ucs","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience and Engineering","","Geo-Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2013","The TransAfrican Hydro Meteorological Observatory aims to create a dense weather station network in sub-Sahara Africa in order to obtain accurate climate data for a wide range of applications. Existing high-quality weather stations are very expensive and unaffordable for the African government or private parties. Therefore innovative sensors and ICT are developed by TAHMO which can reduce the costs tremendously. The weather stations will be placed at schools for safety reasons and to improve the science education. Within this project the weather station has been developed using the next problem statement: “Develop a modular weather station for integration in sub-Saharan African Junior High School education with the purpose of both acquiring high qualitative data and adding educational value.” The results of the analysis show that there are a lot of different weather stations on the market in different prices, but they do not meet the requirements of being high qualitative and inexpensive. Furthermore, the existing weather stations have no focus on educational purposes. However, there is quite a lot of experience with weather stations at schools which are all connected to a platform, named GLOBE. It is notable that the success of a weather station integrated in the educational program depends on the effort and enthusiasm of the responsible teacher. Additionally, students and teachers who are experienced with it see the weather station as a fun and effective way to teach science. In the ideation phase, several ideas have been created and discussed. The presented ideas are evaluated in the subsequent field research. Different methods are used to discuss the ideas with the target group and to learn more about the feasibility of the project. The general conclusion of the field research was that all the participants were really enthusiastic about the integration of a weather station at their school. They think it is important that it is accessible for all and that it should attract students, especially the ideas with interaction are therefore preferred. However, most of the teachers also mentioned that they would like to place a fence around the station, which would not do justice to the interaction. Based on these findings, the final design of the weather station has been created, which consists of a modular weather station and an interactive fence. The fence consists of three panels, all with a different theme: read, play and test. The weather station itself is designed in such a way that one can easily add, replace or remove a sensor and that the wires are completely tucked away. In order to convince potential investors a prototype has been made. Another purpose of the prototype was to get new insights about the production process. Making the prototype has eventually led to an optimization of various connection parts. TAHMO had already set up a business plan, in which they describe how western schools will be connected with African schools and how the owner of the weather station can earn money by ‘selling’ the data of the weather station. Since this would encourage the owners to repair the station when it is out of order, it is reviewed as a very feasible idea. The report concludes with an evaluation of the product and the project itself. It is expected that the weather station meets most requirements, but further optimization is recommended in order to reduce costs and to verify some assumptions about the use of the weather station.","weather station; Africa","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Integrated Product Design","","","",""

The aim of this thesis is to develop a reliable and valid three-dimensional biomechanical model that simulates the motion of a speed skater, to gain insight in the skating technique. In order to prove the reliability of the model, the model needs to be verified. Thus, the second goal of this thesis is to accurately measure the 3D kinematics of a speed skater, concerning the 2D positions of the skates and the 3D position of the upper body. An iGPS system (an optoelectronic based indoor GPS system) proved to be most accurate for the static and dynamic position measurements of skates and upper body, with an accuracy of 6mm (maximum absolute error). The iGPS data did suffer from data gaps, which resulted in coverage of about 67% in time. Concerning roll angle measurements of the skate, the Xsens (MTx) measurement system showed to be most accurate, with an accuracy of 50 (mean error); The speed skater was modelled by three point masses, an upper body and two feet, and skate constraints at the feet, based on prior studies. The input of the model were the changing distance between the mass modelled at the upper body and the mass modelled at the skate and the output were the global motion of the skater on the ice and the forces exerted. However exploratory the current study seems to indicate that it is possible to accurately model a speed skater using only one mass at the upper body and two infinitesimal point-masses at the skates.","speed skating; kinematic measuring; recording; LPM; iGPS; GPS; Xsens; ProMove; dynamic model; biomechanical model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-10-27","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

(mentor)","2013","Research in aircraft design is focusing on novel aircraft configurations in search for a step change in terms of overall transport efficiency. Aircraft design relies heavily on empirical methods, so-called Class 2 methods, to evaluate the performance of a design. Since these methods are based on statistical data their validity is limited when these are used for the design of novel aircraft. There is therefore a strong need for methods that are valid for the conceptual aircraft design of these novel aircraft. The method proposed in this thesis is a semi-analytical method for estimating the weight of a fuselage constructed using the oval fuselage concept. The oval fuselage is a concept for a wide unobstructed pressurized cabin specifically useful for Blended Wing Body aircraft. A parameterization of the oval fuselage is presented and it is demonstrated that the oval cross-section can be used for the design of conventional tube-and-wing aircraft with a single-deck or twin-deck layout as well as for blended-wing-body aircraft. It is also shown that the oval cross-section allows for additional design freedom of the fuselage shape without introducing any bending loads in the fuselage skin panels. Using this parameterization, a method is presented for estimating the weight of this fuselage when used in conventional and novel aircraft configurations. The weight estimation of the fuselage is based on the combination of pressurization loads, steady-state maneuver loads, aerodynamic loads and landing loads. Each of the structural members of the inner structure is sized based on two-dimensional structural analysis satisfying requirements on bi-axial strength, global buckling, crippling, dimpling, and wrinkling. The outer structure is sized using a global buckling criteria adapted from cylinders and a local buckling criteria based on buckling of slender plates. Empirical methods are used to calculate the nonstructural weight and additional weight. A verification of the structural analysis method by a finite-element analysis shows that the made assumptions for the analysis of the structure are valid within the application of aircraft fuselage design. The weight estimation method is compared with weight estimation methods from the open literature and with weight data of existing aircraft. The accuracy of the weight estimation is similar to that of empirical methods for circular fuselages. Examples are shown of oval fuselages in aircraft designs and weight estimations are performed on these fuselages to form a basis for future research on this subject.","class 2.5 weight estimation; oval fuselage; novel aircraft; weight estimation; fuselage; circular fuselage; mdo; first principles; aircraft design; structural analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-11-13","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Design, Integration & Operations","","Aerospace Structures and Design Methodologies","",""

With decreasing numbers of political party members, but the growing ability to communicate opinions through the internet, new forms of political participation are becoming increasingly interesting for political actors and citizens alike. The graduation project at hand is a cooperation with Liquid Democracy e.V., a non-profit association offering e-participation to political actors and citizens. The objective of the project was to find a way how to turn the promising developments in the field into a beneficial situation for Liquid Democracy e.V. without losing sight of their core values and mission as a non-profit. This report elaborates on the service platform combination which Liquid Democracy e.V. offers to two diverse user groups: political actors and citizens. The platform is developed in the context of an open source community and can be used for free. Only customized installations create revenue. The emerging market in which Liquid Democracy e.V. shows to have a first mover advantage, a strong value network and an established brand creates a demand that promises to enable sustainable operations. To seize the opportunity, the service and the platform were analysed to uncover limitations and unveil their true value proposition. Furthermore, a customer research was carried out to allow a better understanding of the demand perceived by Liquid Democracy e.V. As a result of the initial analysis, a spin-off in form of a cooperative is proposed offering a modular service that is able to meet customer requirements with flexible but standardized processes. The modular standardized processes allow scalability and enable the company to target different segments without changing the core product. The processes run on the provided e-participation platform, creating a hub to connect any (political) actor and interested citizen. The underlying socialised business model preserves the heritage of the non-profit association while at the same time allowing for sustainable revenue. A subscription model prices the service on the bases of different packages being a result of the selected process and additional functions required by the customer. To validate the proposal a business case is developed that looks at the market potential, defines the cost structure and estimates sales within a time period of five years, resulting in a promising NPVR of 900K EUR and a payback period of two years. To finalise the project, recommendations are given on the market and design strategy as well as on the market introduction. Additionally, an action plan was developed that guides the recommendations given in the context of the market introduction.","design; political participation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Chappin, E.J.L. (mentor); Cunningham, S.W. (mentor); Bollinger, L.A. (mentor)","2013","This research presents a new way to assess the impact of location decisions for new power plants by power producers. It builds on an existing agent-based model that is able to simulate market and investment behavior of power produc- ers in a north western European electricity market (EMlab-generation). This study adds a module that is based on game theory concepts to simulate both the location selection by power producers and the required spatial permit procedure. In the end this model could help to give insights in possible future developments of power plant siting in a specific country (Netherlands in this case). This could help TSOs and policy makers assess their siting regimes and anticipate for po- tential future new generation capacity. The main research question is formulated as: How does the set of factors considered in location decisions for new power plants affect the future development of the technological and spatial distribution of power generation in the Netherlands?. This research starts to investigate what aspects play a role in the location decision for new power plants. From literature and empirical sources it is found that besides the technical requirement of power generating technologies (Cooling water, feedstock connection etc. ), the permit procedure plays a major role in the decision. Permit risk as power producer call it could significantly decrease the profitability of a project by delays and is thus a very important factor. Permit risk is connected with the potential for local activism against the siting of the new power plant. Activism is simplified and conceptualized to three main factors: Population density, wealth and attitude towards a specific power generation technology. The model addition contains two main parts. First the power producer se- lects a technology and finds the best locations according to its own selection method. This could be conceptualized and modelled easily with utility func- tions. The second part of the permit procedure is more difficult as it involves negotiations with the local government and potentially several local parties (ac- tivists). The game theory concept of the nucleolus is used to conceptualize the permit procedure. First the government is payed a monetary environmental compensation fee (based on legal obligation), afterwards the local parties are payed a compensation fee, the unhappiest party first. The compensation is payed to ease the negative attitudes towards the new power plant and to lower the chance parties go to court and potentially delay the project, threatening profitability. This in essence is the model and the data input is based on data of potential power plants sites in the Netherlands (SEVIII) and regional statistics by the bureau of the statistics. The simulation results show that the model is able to produce significantly different results for different location selection methods by power producers, both in geographical distribution of power plants as the technology mix. Addi- tionally the permit procedure and the amount of compensation required by the local parties also significantly influences the spatial and technological distribu- tion of power plants. Finally other location related factors such as the potential for CCS at a location were also incorporated and showed significantly different results. The results are subject to some limitations, these mainly have to do with the choices for simplifications and the data used as model inputs. This is something to always consider when reviewing the results of this study and when reviewing agent-based modelling studies in general. The analysis of the results contain several different types of contributions:  The current EMlab-generation model is extended and is now able to in- corporate location decision and the permit procedure. Additionally the research presents a lot of valuable location data of power plants. The model shows similarities with the described behavior in the literature and empirical data.  This study contains methodological contributions in the area of agent- based modelling and game theory. The concept of the Nucleolus has not been used in an agent-based environment and have not been used to sim- ulate a specific kind of permit procedure. Under specific conditions and assumptions we showed that it is possible to use the nucleolus and this enables new applications in many different research fields that consider social negotiations.  A start has been made to show the potential of the model for real world applications. Scenarios of Tennet for the generation capacity in 2030 have been compared with our model results, showing differences and similari- ties. The amount of data and detail of this research’s model could help improve these scenarios and help Tennet anticipate for future generation capacity developments. Additionally some observations with regards to policies are given and the possibilities of this model to policy analysis is discussed.","Agent-based modelling; Electricity market simulation; Game Theory; Location Aspects; Permit procedure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy & Industry","","System Engineering, Policy Analysis & Management","",""

(mentor); Ye, Q. (mentor); Uittenbogaard, R. (mentor); Li, L. (mentor); Walstra, D.J. (mentor)","2013","This study is aiming to improve the understanding of hydrodynamic circulation in large shallow lakes. The Lake Taihu, the third largest lake in east China, is picked up as the study area for three reasons. The basin of Lake Taihu is considered as the most populated and developed area as a backyard of Shanghai. Lake Taihu is a typical shallow lake with average water depth of 1.9m. The lake is suffering from severe ecological problems during the past 20 years caused by the growing industrial, agricultural and urban waste water. Literature review showed that in the previous researches over the Lake Taihu, more emphasize was put on resulting concentration of contaminants and nutrients in the water while the hydrodynamic circulation are less quantitatively focused. In this study, hydrodynamic circulation indices are applied to quantify hydrodynamic circulation in Lake Taihu. This study has been carried out through various empirical modeling, schematized modeling and complete 3d modeling approach. To quantify the water circulation and water exchange in the lake, hydrodynamic circulation indices, such as water age and residence time, are introduced. To evaluate the hydrodynamic circulation indices, a simple schematized model is first set up and analyzed to demonstrate the functions and characteristics of different circulation indices. Model input data such as water level, inflow/outflow discharge (mass balance), and land reclamation are analyzed. Since the wind is generally regarded as the driving force for shallow lakes, wind input data is emphasized and corrected for land-measured data. The contribution of different conditions, including various wind conditions, to the water exchange between the lake water and water body discharged from the canals, is evaluated. Then a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model for Lake Taihu is set up and has been calibrated with water level data of year 2008. The three-dimensional hydrodynamic model is used to demonstrate the hydrodynamic circulation pattern in Lake Taihu. Sensitivity tests on the input data and physical parameters shows that the discharge is the most important factor if the wind is not driven force under normal wind conditions. Innovative engineering measurements and design scenarios are proposed to enhance the water circulation, which will potentially promote the water quality in certain subzones of the lake. These design scenarios, including recovery of land reclamation, global dredging, local barrier, local trenches and submerged reef, are investigated. It is found that, although the anthropogenic changes on bed don’t provide global improvement in circulation indices, local improvement is generally observed in subzones of the lake. Furthermore, wave effects are assessed via an empirical nomogram model, a schematized model and a wave model for the Lake Taihu. Results and analysis show that wave effects are not significant for Lake Taihu under normal wind conditions. This study applies hydrodynamic circulation indices to quantify the circulation in Lake Taihu, thus to improve the understanding the hydrodynamic circulation pattern in the lake. This approach could be extended to the hydrodynamic studies in similar large, shallow lakes. The modeling tools are essential for further environmental, biological and ecological study. They are also quantitative tools to assess anthropogenic effects on large shallow lakes for researchers, managers and stakeholders.","Lake Taihu; shallow lake; hydrodynamic circulation indices; 3D hydrodynamic and water quality model; anthropogenic engineering solution; wave effects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-11-15","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

(mentor); Bayen, S. (mentor)","2013","Modelling tidal dynamics in mangrove systems is of great use in studying effects of vegetation on flow and may prove to be a useful tool to support the management of mangrove areas. Since there are lots of limitations on obtaining field data inside mangrove forests, numerical models are indispensable to analyse the effects of changes in mangrove forest parameters on hydrodynamics and vice versa.This research is performed to gain insight in the performance of different vegetation model representations and to apply them in a model of a real mangrove area, Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve. Vegetation imposes an extra source term of friction in the momentum equation in the form of a drag force. Different model representations to include the extra friction induced by vegetation on the flow are tested in this research. The first approach is the ‘classical’ way of specifying vegetation: the influence of the increased friction is simply taken into account by increasing the bed friction. The second approach of specifying vegetation is by using the directional point model. This approach models vegetation as a set of rigid cylinders in the flow, where the density and diameter of these cylinders may vary over the depth. Both different model representations have first been tested in highly simplified test-cases to get a first feel on the performance of these model representations and to get familiar with using them. Before including vegetation in the model of Sungei Buloh, first some adaptations to the existing model were made. The existing model inhibited some instabilities in the velocity field, that where caused by some errors in the grid and in the bathymetry. Therefore the grid and bathymetry were adapted to overcome these instabilities, with good results. The vegetation is added in this adapted model in the two different ways described above, and both 2D and 3D modeling is tested for these vegetation inclusions. The added mangrove vegetation results in a significant decrease in horizontal depth averaged flow velocity in the northern part of the model domain, whereas the southern part is barely influenced by the vegetation. An explanation for this is found by looking at the order of magnitude of the different terms in the momentum equation. It turns out that in the northern part of Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve the order of magnitude of the drag force imposed by vegetation is of the same order as the other dominant terms in the momentum equation, while in the southern part of Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve the order of magnitude of the drag force is smaller than the other dominant terms. It is also observed that vegetation does not only alter the depth averaged velocity, but also changes the vertical structure of the horizontal velocity. When looking at the performance of different vegetation representations, the use of increased bed roughness and the use of the directional point model deliver completely different results. Part of that can be assigned to calibration of the Manning’s coefficient (which is done simultaneously while running the 3D model due to time limitations), but that does not cover the whole explanation. Bed roughness and drag force (induced by vegetation) are taken separately in the momentum equation, and it turns out that when the influence of drag is relatively low increasing the bed roughness delivers completely different predictions of the flow velocity than the directional point model. If the influence of the bed roughness is not negligible in the momentum equation, then increasing the bed roughness will influence the flow strongly, as opposed to the directional point model that only exerts a (relatively small) drag force on the water column due to vegetation. From the results also the difference between 2D depth averaged modelling and 3D modelling becomes clear. It is more accurate to run the model in 3D instead of 2D, because in 3D also the effect of vegetation on the turbulence is taken into account, as opposed to only the extra drag force that is taken into account in 2D depth averaged modelling. Furthermore, 2D depth averaged modelling introduces large errors when considering fully submerged vegetation. Therefore, to accurately model the influence of vegetation in a mangrove system, it is recommended to use a three dimensional model with vegetation specified by the directional point model.","mangrove; vegetation","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

First, the behaviour of pathogens under the influence of environmental variables such as sunlight intensity and temperature was investigated. Then, this was incorporated into a hydrological model to simulate the movement of pathogens through a water system. The removal of pathogens from the water column was found to be caused mostly by the sedimentation and not so much by pathogen decay. The effect of this is that in an equilibrium state, the concentration of pathogens in the sediment is much higher than that in the water column. As sedimentation is the largest factor when considering the removal of pathogens from the water column, any measures that decrease the flow velocity decrease pathogen concentrations. However, pathogens are still present in the system, and care should be taken that the water column is not reinfected through resuspension.","urban water quality; pathogens; modelling; Delft3D; Matlab","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-11-07","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water Resources Management","",""

In particular, the sediment transport between the Island of Mussulo and the Island of Luanda. Relevant information will be bundled and used to set-up relevant models which are used to describe the sediment transports. Analysis With the help of old charts an analysis is made of the long scale changes along the Luanda coast. It is shown that the coast undergoes some major changes between 1870 till 1950. The Island of Mussulo is reformed as the inlet existing nowadays was shifted south (or this inlet was filled and the nowadays opening in the Bay of Mussulo happened due to a breach). During the last 60 years no major changes were observed. With the help of the software packages UNIBEST-CL+ and Delft3D multiple model simulations were made to get an insight in the sediment transport rates at the Luanda coastal area. The simulations were validated with the help of observation. To qualitatively increase the insight in the Luanda area conceptual models were made which indicates the range within the real LST has to be in. This was first done for each area separate. By combining these models the sediment transport between the Island of Mussulo and the Island of Luanda via the shoal could be investigated. Conclusions and recommendations The following conclusions were drawn from the research. The sediment transport along the coast is mainly driven to the north by waves approaching from the south-west. The Kwanza River is not seen as a main sediment supplier for the present Luanda area. Sediment supply at the south is mainly expected to be from the coastal area south of the Kwanza River. Part of the sediment transported along the tip of the Island of Mussulo will be transported to the shoal and partly to the tip of the Island of Mussulo where it will settle. The tide has a relatively small influence on the interaction between the shoal and the Bay of Mussulo. The dredged channel in the shoal will act as a sand trap and reduce sediment to be transported to the north. This will not have a large effect and a short time scale but can have a major impact on the long term. The LST by the sandbars via the shoal supplies the Island of Luanda with sediment as well as sediment transport from the coast south of the Island of Luanda. The Island of Luanda suffers from structural erosion as the supplied sediment is not enough in order to keep up with the LST. The erosion is nowadays compensated with beach nourishment and coastal structures such as groynes.","Angola; Luanda; longshore sediment transport; UNIBEST","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

This project searched for widening the product line within a green product cycle. The project worked following the basic steps, like market and product analysis and search field brainstorms. At the end several possibilities were presented, however none of them were innovative enough. Therefor a new project start was made by throwing away all assumptions. From this bottom line the idea was born for Greentom to join the transport branch. In this combination the transport of children was the question to be answered. Therefor the bike could be the green follow up after the stroller. The first stage provided in a line of special bikes to transport children. One of these models was chosen for its luminous simplicity: an existing Cargo bike and Greentom’s stroller. The missing link in this combination was a solid connection. That connection became the projectgoal. A partner for the cargo bike was found in de Fietsfabriek. Via numerous consumertests and interviews with professionals the specifications for the connector were defined. The evaluation of a successful prototype led to a complete redesign. Besides of this great product opportunity, a lifecycle was created by introducing the lease-concept. In this concept several products can be exchanged during a lease period of about 9 years.

(mentor); Van der Grinten, B. (mentor); Elkhuizen, W.S. (mentor)","2013","This graduation project is a research on a new sustainable cartridge solution for Tonerpearls ink. The Tonerpearls cartridge is part of the Colorwave printer, positioned in the market as a ‘green’ flagship. The challenge The report addresses three problem owners: the company; its customers and the environment. The company aims for a cartridge that performs better in terms of sustainability, profit and brand image. Customers demand a more sustainable cartridge solution and understandable information about the disposal phase. In the current disposal situation, customers get confused how to act when the cartridge reaches its end-of-life. Often it remains unclear what to do with the empty cartridge, resulting in unwanted situations, such as high stacks of empty cartridges in the office environment. Moreover, the current end-of-life of the cartridge is far from perfect. The original design contains valuable materials that become less valuable after its intended purpose. The materials end up in common waste management systems to be recycled, incinerated or even landfilled in many scenarios. Also the parts and combination of parts in the original design is not ideal. It contains plastics, metals, electronics and ink residues which are neither convenient to separate nor to recycle. In addition, reusing the cartridge is impossible and there is a lot of transport with unused volume resulting in a high environmental impact. The solution The final design is a redefined cartridge, inspired by nature. Redefined, because it has a different approach from a small material level to a large system level. Inspired by nature, because it is based on the idea of eliminating waste in the total product life cycle. This means that every aspect of the new design can be reclaimed and used for new purposes in circular systems. This is similar to principles in nature and in line with the well-known cradle-to-cradle approach, which summarizes it as a system of nutrient flow and metabolism, in which the concept of waste does not exist. This approach has as a result that the redefined cartridge has a significant environmental impact reduction of 94% in its total life cycle and a user-friendly disposal scenario that is perceived as sustainable. This leads to a better product appreciation and an improved brand image. The redefined cartridge simultaneously enables a significant costs reduction. Furthermore, the report provides insights in how Nature Inspired Design (NID) affects the design practice. (see www.natureinspireddesign.nl for more information). How it works Other than the current design, the new design allows refilling of new Tonerpearls batches and provides new opportunities for reverse logistics, reuse and recycling without value loss of materials. The plastic cartridge design is based on the same reliable mechanism for dispensing Tonerpearls. However, it differs from its volume-reducing feature, its refilling feature and its increased product life time. The main feature of the cartridge is that components are able to slide for decreasing and increasing its volume. This results in a reduction of environmental impact and lower transportation costs. After transportation to customers, the cartridge can increase its volume by 50% to provide room for filling the cartridge with the included first batch of Tonerpearls. These are also delivered separately in a new cardboard packaging design, which is very compact, cheap, environmental-friendly and creates a more convenient disposal scenario. On top, the cartridge has a sliding lid, which is a new solution for refilling the cartridge. The new cardboard ink box can be positioned on top to release the Tonerpearls. After sliding the lid, the ink box is able to release the Tonerpearls. By having cardboard ink boxes and a separate plastic refillable cartridge, the lifetime of the cartridge increases significantly. After more than 10 refills, the plastic cartridge can be cleaned, refurbished and reused as part of a reverse logistics system. The plastic cartridge gets another life over and over again. The cardboard package is able to end up in common paper recycling streams, which is a sustainable solution. Also, the new design replaces the current used chip technology with Near Field Communication (NFC), which is not completely integrated into the cartridge, but reusable and rewritable. This redefined cartridge demonstrates how Océ can become one step closer to a sustainable world.","cartridge; cradle-to-cradle; life cycle analysis; nature inspired design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-10-25","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Kuiper, R.J. (mentor)","2013","Humans learning to control slow dynamic systems (e.g. a large excavator) perceive complex system dynamics in combination with, the less intuitive, rate control method. Earlier research has described that humans control these systems by predicting the slow response on basis of an internal model of the system dynamics. Learning this internal model can be a long and therefore a costly process in practical applications as excavators. This paper presents a training method based on the concept of Haptic Shared Control to support learning of the system dynamics. Literature on learning with Haptic Shared Control has found no consensus if this improves learning performance. However, recent literature have shown that improved learning performance is possible in timing based tasks with guidance-as-needed support. This study hypothesis that providing Haptic Shared Control training trials, used for training the desired control input, will result in lower control activity and higher performance after training. Two groups (n=10 each) had to pursuit a trajectory by controlling the slow dynamic system with a 1-DOF manipulator. The results show that subjects learning with Haptic Shared Control had similar performance, and similar excessive control activity in the frequency domain. On the other hand also a noisier joystick input, which may indicate a less developed model of the system dynamics. It is concluded that the used form of Haptic Shared Control can be used to increase the safety and performance during the slow dynamic system learning process, but is ineffective as training method.","Haptic Shared Control; Slow Dynamic System; Learning; Rate Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

(mentor); Van den Bos, W. (mentor)","2013","With container ships transporting increasingly more containers while simultaneously shorter waiting times are desired, containers have to be handled faster and more efficient. This is noticed among others by the growing application of Long-Twin spreaders in Straddle Carriers (SCs). At the same time environmental impact is becoming increasingly important, raising the interest for highly efficient electrically driven machines. The problem with the current Long-Twin spreaders is that they are (partially) hydraulically driven and too high for SCs to realize their maximum hoisting height. A height reduction is thus required. As SC manufacturers prefer an as low as possible, electrically driven Long-Twin spreader this will be the focus of this thesis. In this thesis a design is presented which is obtained with a methodic design procedure in which various Frame Configurations (FCs) and electro mechanical drive systems have been evaluated. Reducing the spreaders height and replacing the currently used hydraulic drives with electric drives result in an increase in mass. Application of high strength steel (HSS) results in a decrease in mass. Since the allowable mass is also restricted, the final concept design, resulting from a multi criteria analysis, is an assessment between height reduction, mass, price and additional criteria on expected performance during operation. The final concept design realizes a height reduction of 831 mm (60,3%) under the current circumstances compared to the current design, while remaining below a mass of 9 tons. This is not the concept with the lowest mass, nor with the highest height reduction that has been considered, but it is the concept that is expected to perform the best regarding the requirements of SC manufacturers.","Long-Twin spreader; straddle carrier","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2100-10-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Transportation Engineering","","Transportation Engineering and Logistics","",""

(mentor); Van den Berg, K.J. (mentor)","2013","TiO2 has been widely applied as white artistic pigment since 19th century. And the photo-catalytic effect of TiO2 makes it aggressive and causes degradation on painting surface. The damage of binder by TiO2, also known as chalking, has been suggested as the main cause of the painting surface degradation and studied a lot. However, the danger to pigments used with TiO2 together, especially the organic ones, is rarely noticed. In this study, artistic TiO2 and industrial TiO2 were studied: a Titanium white pigment from Kremer, industrial catalyst from Hombikat and Hombikat coated with Al2O3 in an atomic layer deposition process. The titanium dioxides were mixed with five colorant pigments and linseed oil into paints. After drying, the paint films were illuminated under artificial light to reveal the surface change caused by TiO2. After artificial light aging, the color, gloss and roughness of all films have changed. As expected, Hombikat TiO2 is proved to induce most changes. The Hombikat TiO2 degrades the binder and the colorant pigments in combination with light. The coating of Hombikat with Al2O3 shows little effectiveness in preventing the degradation. The Kremer TiO2 mainly degrades the binder to cause surface change. The degradation of the binder contributes to the roughness increase mostly. The color of Green earth is not affected by any of the three titanium dioxides. Vermilion’s blackening phenomenon is largely boosted by TiO2. Prussian blue degrades faster than others. And the organic Indigo and Hansa yellow most likely to have broken molecular bondings caused by TiO2.","titanium dioxide; pigments; photocatalytical","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-01-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Materials Science & Engineering","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

However, it is proved not suitable for the testing of whole artist’s pigment since many limitations of experimental process make the testing results inaccurate. In this case, solid state spectrometer is applied instead of liquid state spectrometer. A new photocatalytic activity test is developed, including the new sample preparation and measuring method.

(mentor)","2013","Enhanced greenhouse gas emisions in the past century contributed to the global average temperature rise. The emission of greenhouse gases, therefore, should be limited in the coming decades. One way to do so is by capturing the greenhouse gasses (like CO2) from industrial flue gases (post-combustion capture). This can be achieved in a chemical absorption process using monoethanolamine as a solvent. In this report, the development of a method has been developed for the real-time liquid analysis of the solvent and absorbed acid gas concentrations in a post-combustion capture process using monoethanolamine as a solvent, capturing CO2. Online monitoring of the dynamic behaviour of these process properties is of major importance from a process control and a scientific perspective. Currently this is only achieved using fourier transfrom infrared spectroscopy, combined with a multivariate calibration method called chemometrics. This is, however, an expensive method and there are limitations with respect to robustness and actual process installation. The developed method is based on cheap and easy measurable properties of the solvent. Inverse Least-Squares models were built at two temperature levels, based on a set of 29 lab-prepared samples with different MEA and CO2 concentrations. Density, conductivity, refractive index and sonic speed measurements were used as input data in model development since this combination of quantities showed the best performance with respect to predictive accuracy and apparatus costs of all assessed analytical techniques. The developed model has been validated during continuous operation of a mini CO2 capture plant. The concentrations of MEA and CO2 were predicted with a mean error of 0.53 and 0.31 [wt%] for MEA and CO2 respectively. Process dynamics, like step-changes in the CO2 flue gas concentration, were covered accurately as well. The model showed good robustness to changes in solvent temperature. Robustness of the model against solvent degradation was assessed using samples from the TNO pilot plant at the Maasvlakte and during a three week experiment at a microplant. First some degraded samples were added to the model calibration set for improved robustness purposes. Both the polluted model and the unpolluted model were able to monitor the MEA and CO2 concentrations of the pilot plant samples and in the microplant accurately. The addition of degraded samples to the calibration set did improve the predictive accuracy of the model if the degradation products in the monitored process were of the same nature as the degradation products that were added to the calibration set. The combination of the model with process data has shortly been assessed, but further study in this direction is required. Combining density, conductivity, refractive index and sonic speed measurements with a multivariate chemometric method enables the real-time and accurate monitoring of the acid gas and monoethanolamine concentrations in CO2 absorption processes, even under degrading process conditions.","CCS; process monitoring","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-10-23","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Coenders, J. (mentor); Rolvink, A. (mentor); Van den Ham, E. (mentor); Den Hollander, J.P. (mentor)","2013","The separation between architect and engineer is a relatively recent event, in comparison to the long history of human constructions. In modern times the separation of the two professions and the involvement of engineers in later design stages has proved problematic, because of the large effort needed to make changes in later design stages. On the other hand, the rising importance of engineering and financial objectives that building projects have to meet, calls for a more integrated design approach since the very early design stages. Contemporary parametric tools give the possibility to enhance multidisciplinary communication by providing the ability to quickly extract needed values from preliminary design geometries (or “massings”) and assess them through properly defined evaluation scripts. This thesis investigated this prospect, focusing on the aspect of energy demand, which emerges as a central design consideration in contemporary architecture. The thesis report identified the main objectives that would serve as fitness values for it’s assessment optimization systems, including in them the main parameters of influence for each of these objectives. These objectives have been the minimization of solar gains, annual heating and cooling demand, annual total energy demand per GFA, annual total energy demand per NFA, and embodied + operational (for 1, 10, 50 years) CO2 emissions. The choice of the optimization objective and thus the optimization system that has to be set to assess it, was proved to have great influence on the optimization process and results. Because of that, this thesis concluded that it this is a point that has to be considered carefully, according to the design’s priorities, to find out which specific objective is set as fitness value, for each design project. That is because an extension of the optimization in unneeded areas, might diminish the accuracy of the results and increase the computational demand needed. To support these assessment and optimization systems, a parametric toolbox has been developed, named MEOtoolbox (MEO derived from the initials of the words Massing Energy Optimization). The components developed mainly aimed to facilitate the calculation of the annual demand for heating and cooling, using the quasi-steady state method for energy demand calculations described in the ISO13790 international standard. The MEOtoolbox will be made available to download after the end of this thesis project, through MEOtoolbox.blogspot.com. Possible design scenarios where the MEOtoolbox could be particularly useful, have been outlined through design dilemmas that also formed the case studies of this thesis. To validate the results of these case studies, results, relevant to the case studies, have been beforehand compared to results of similar studies and software. The design case studies have investigated the effect of tilting the facades of a recreation centre in Paris (France), and the effect of orientation and the effect of self shading in a design of a highrise building for the European Union in Brussels (Belgium). The study showed that: Tilting downwards a south facing facade, in Paris, can reduce the solar load in half during summer, while not greatly reducing solar load in winter. For the climate of Brussels, the maximum effect that orientation could have, for the particular design geometry, was an increase of 5% in the annual cooling demand and 1% in the annual heating demand. The effect of shifting in order to self-shade building geometries proved that it is an effective way of reducing cooling demand, without increasing greatly the heating demand. The two case studies also exemplified some of the additional benefits and shortcomings of the parametric tools. In the advantages, it has been shown how design choices can be visually supported, forming arguments for a specific design decision. On the shortcomings, the unavailability of tools to assess the multiplicity of parameters that a designer might consider and the sensitivity of the results in certain parameters, (which could, if not set properly, lead to invalid feedback) are issues that have to be addressed by parametric design software developers, for example through detailed manuals. For the comparative research, six basic building typologies (“Warehouse”, “Cube”, “Tower”, “Caterpillar”, “Fence”, “Slab”) were compared with regards to their operational energy per area in different climates and with different glass percentages in the facades. The thesis concluded that: For all the typologies studied, with the absence of external shading and for the glass percentages studied, cooling demand seems to be more critical for the determination of optimal energy massing, due to it’s greater fluxuation depending on the typology. As far as the absolute energy demand values are concerned, location seems to be the most largely influencing parameter, followed by glass percentage. Orientation and programmatic function seem to have much less influence on the absolute value of the energy demand of the typologies. As far as the ratio between the typologies is concerned, the switch of the assessment value from Energy per GFA to Energy per NFA, strongly influences the energy demand per area ratio between the typologies, as spaces with less rentable space often seem to be good energy solutions. Minimizing the expected Energy/NFA gives different results than Energy/GFA, taking into account also space efficiency. Since NFA is usually a primary goal for construction and real-estate companies, it is a realistic aim to try to minimize energy costs to cover a specific programmatic NFA demand. Location also influences largely the ratio between typologies, which seems to be similar in locations with similar ratio between the needs in heating and cooling. The typology study showed that the energy per NFA can be reduced in the magnitude of 40% by selecting an optimal typology for the climate of the Netherlands For the climate of Amsterdam, and for the characteristics for facade and structure employed for the analysis, embodied energy seems to correspond, roughly, to 10 years of operational energy for all of the typologies. The fact that this was the result for all the typologies studied, suggests that it could potentially be used as a rule of thumb, when assessing the importance of embodied energy for a specific project, depending on it’s expected functional lifetime.","parametric; optimization; energy performance; built environment; building engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Building Technology & Physics","",""

(mentor)","2013","Shore-parallel submerged breakwaters (SBWs) appear as an attractive form of coastal protection. Compared to their emergent counterpart there is no impact on the beach amenity and aesthetics. In addition, there is a possibility for recreational purposes. However, the actual application of SBWs is often discouraged because the complexity of the hydrodynamics in the vicinity of SBWs makes the shoreline response hard to predict. This complexity further increases in the case of multiple SBWs. Added processes such as the distribution of the return flow and the (hydrodynamic) interaction between the separate SBWs induce a complex wave and flow pattern in the lee of the SBWs. The objective of this thesis is to develop a design criterion predicting the shoreline response to multiple SBWs. Studies showed that the initial mode of the shoreline response can be linked to the flow pattern observed in the lee of the SBW. A 2-cell flow pattern causes a divergent flow at the shoreline and therefore local erosion, whereas a 4-cell flow pattern causes convergent flow at the shoreline with local accretion as a result. These patterns have comparable results in cases with a single SBW and cases with multiple SBWs. There exist multiple methods to predict if a certain SBW system will cause a 2-cell or 4-cell flow pattern. This thesis will look into the existing criteria based on the physical parameters of the system. Because the design parameters can be used directly to predict a shoreline response via this criterion, it is deemed to be better suited for the objective of this thesis. However, in its current form, the criterion is only valid for single SBW systems. The criterion to predict the mode of shoreline response (accretive versus erosive) to a single SBW is made applicable to multiple SBW cases by adding a term accounting for the added processes. The extra term is based on a theoretical analysis and numerical modelling (Delft3D) of the impact of the lateral confinement ratio. This impact is made visible by analysing the availability of sediment and the different degree in wave sheltering with respect to a single SBW system. Although the criterion cannot be used for a quantitative prediction of the shoreline response, it can function as a tool for the first assessment of the mode of shoreline response in cases of designing a coastal protection system based on multiple SBWs. The criterion can be used for preliminary designing advice or as a basis for further research regarding the utilization of SBWs as a form of coastal protection. Further research can include a continuation of the research of the applicability of the criterion outside of idealized models and the necessity of treating certain aspects separately (e.g. a large tidal amplitude). The criterion would benefit from validation with field measurements and physical modelling. Additionally, research is needed on the sensitivity to the barrier width and roughness as these parameters are, as of now, not included in the criterion.","submerged breakwater; numerical modelling; Delft3D; rip current; design criterion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

In some regions, the flow is a combination of both the current and the wave. Thus, it is interesting to understand how the turbine behaves during the operation in this unsteady flow. The current work tries to model the marine turbines by numerical methods. Two branches are then studied separately. The first model is built within a 2D rotor scale in which the turbine is represented as an actuator disk. Case studies are built with different wave and current velocity scales. The second model studies the case of the Vertical Axis Turbine (VAT) by integrating the wave model with a 2D VAT panel code. The simulation results from the actuator disk model suggest that it is more feasible to extract energy from the case when the current is dominant, while in the other cases, the flow is dominated by the unsteady response with large variations of power or even negative power output observed. The results from the VAT model show that for all the wave current combinations, the turbine can reach a regular periodic performance under the operation condition where the blade rotation period equals the wave period. The further study of the load behavior indicates that the turbine’s response can be controlled by tuning the phase difference between the wave flow and the blade rotation.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Thermal modal analysis is expected to be an important tool in creating understanding, and counteracting thermal errors inside high precision systems. By experimentally identifying the thermal modes of a structure, the in uences of the thermal boundary conditions, which are difficult and expensive to simulate, are included in the thermal mode shapes and time constants. This could provide insight into the influence of the thermal boundary conditions, and could enable the application of a novel, thermal modal analysis based, thermal error compensation strategy. A method is developed to experimentally identify the two-dimensional thermal modes of a plate. A simple measurement setup is developed with which the basic behavior of thermal modes in the plate are validated. Based on the gained knowledge, an improved measurement setup, that is more specifically aimed at thermal modal analysis based measurements, is designed and realized. With this improved setup, thermal modal identification measurements are performed to experimentally identify the first 25 two-dimensional thermal mode shapes of a thin plate. A novel, thermal modal analysis based, thermal error compensation strategy is presented, and tested with the use of the measurement setup. It was found that it is possible to experimentally identify the first 25 two-dimensional thermal mode shapes of a thin plate.

(mentor)","2013","Anaerobic wastewater treatment is energy favorable procedure because since useful energy in the form of biogass is produced from the conversion of the organic substances. Anaerobic membrane reactors is a new innovative anaerobic technology, that is has the advantage over other anaerobic methods, that is producing very clean effluent and also can treat high strength wastewater because it achieves almost complete sludge retention therefore high treatment efficiencies. Problem definition The biggest drawback that this technology is presenting, is that the efficiency of the whole procedure is immediately related with the achieved membrane fluxes. These fluxes are strongly affected by the characteristics of the sludge. The influent of the reactors (the kind of substrate that is used) is affecting intensively the sludge characteristics, and the therefore, the cake layer (formed on the membrane surface) and subsequently the attainable fluxes and the system’s efficiency and cost. One of the parameters that is expected to affect the filterability characteristics of the sludge is the microbial population. Different microbial species are expected to have different properties (e.g excreted concentration of extracellular polymeric substances, and soluble microbial products). Particularly, acidogenic microorganisms are expected to decrease the filterability of the sludge due to their smaller particle sizes. Research In order to be able to verify that the presence of acidogens is indeed affecting the sludge filterability characteristics, 4 lab-scale batch reactors were installed. The sludge of these reactors was checked on a weekly basis (both biological characteristics analysis and filterability parameters) Results 1) Fully acidified substrate, will cause the development of a purely methanogenic bacterial population in the reactor. This methanogenic sludge showed indeed a higher particle size than the other reactors, and better filterability. 2) The single stage methanogenesis reactor that contained non acidified whey and therefore acidogenic populations were also present showed lower filterabilities than the 2-stage rectors (pre-acidification tank combined with pure-methanogenic reactor). 3) The increase of Food to Mass ratio (F/M) resulted in an accumulation of soluble proteins in the Reactors. This accumulation led to an impairment of sludge filterability and this effect was much more intense compared to the presence of acidogenic biomass. Conclusions and recommendations It was observed that indeed the acidogenic biomass will affect the sludge characteristics with a negative manner. Therefore, it can be proposed that a two step reactor that will be composed of a pre-acidification tank followed by a methanogenic membrane reactor, can increase the filterability of the sludge, increase the fluxes, and maybe decrease the operational cost. A further research proposal will be to examine, with the same wastewater applied here, the effect of the different acidification degree on an AnMBR to check the real effect on the membrane surface.","anaerobic mbr","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-03-31","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Sanitary Engineering","",""

The problem is explored and an analysis of the brand and identity of TTS is done. Furthermore, an overview of the e-ticketing market in the Netherlands is given, in which the different stakeholders +are discussed. The needs of clients are derived by means of interviews resulting in a discussion on the reasons for outsourcing or in-sourcing of maintenance and operation of the e-ticketing system by PTOs. Additionally, theory behind services and how to communicate services is given; The differences between services and products are discussed, as well as the types of services that can be distinguished and a definition of a ‘service portfolio’ is given. The Service Portfolio designed for TTS is an overview of the services TTS can currently offer to the e-ticketing market. It consists of services that can be acquired by clients, categorized in five categories. Besides these single services clients can acquire a combination of services in a service concept aligned to the needs of typical clients in the market. Base for the service concepts is the division of responsibilities for the system. In this report a vision on services in the e-ticketing market for TTS is proposed: Delivering e-ticketing as a service. A change of the current business model of TTS is needed for TTS to be able to offer the complete functionality of the e-ticketing system to the client and to thereby take away the client’s worries about their e-ticketing system. Finally a game is presented that helps TTS in communicating the services they can offer to the client and to retrieve implicit and explicit client needs. This game will also help the client in understanding how TTS can help in getting their needs fulfilled. During the game responsibilities are assigned and expectations are expressed. The game play of the game is explained. Finally, an infographic is presented which can help TTS in communicating the services they can offer to (potential) clients.

The analytical models of Savenije (1986) and Kuijper & Van Rijn (2011) are quite similar and use a predictive equation for the dispersion in the estuary mouth. The biggest difference between the two models is the Van der Burgh K for which Kuijper and Van Rijn stated that it should be equal to 0.5. The main goal of this research is to improve the applicability of the analytical salt models. The two models were applied to 72 measurements in 27 estuaries. Both models gave reasonable results, but Savenije's model gave in general a slightly better fit. The differences were found in especially the tail of the curve, what indicates that K is probably not equal to 0.5. Linear regressions were carried out in order to derive new possible predictive equations for the dispersion coefficient. Several existing dimensionless ratios were combined in different regressions. Another regression technique, genetic programming, confirmed that a linear combination of the log of the dimensionless ratios is correct. The linear regressions were carried out for both models and for the estuary mouth and the inflection point, where the shape of the estuary changes. Many of the derived equations showed however more or less comparable results. The significance of the different terms was tested to see if each term contributed significantly. In this way it was already possible to reduce the number of possible new predictive equations. The same selection of equations was applied to the salt models. Eventually a choice of a new predictive equation was made based on the regressions, the local applications and the applications in the salt models. The horizontal to vertical tidal range and a friction term should be added to the Richardson number to get an improved predictive equation. The applicability of the analytical models will also increase by starting the calculation from the more clearly defined inflection point. A disadvantage of the new equation is especially the friction term, because friction is often not known a priori. The hydraulic model of Cai et al. (2012) was used to test if friction and depth could be estimated with just a minimum of information. It was possible to use these equations to make a ""quick and dirty"" estimate of these parameters. The new proposed approach is therefore as follows: - Determine the location of the inflection point based on information about the geometry - Estimate hydraulic parameters, also with help of the equations of Cai et al. (2012) - Determine the dispersion coefficient with the new predictive equations - Determine the salt distribution with the model of Savenije (1986) or Kuijper & Van Rijn (2011)","salt intrusion; dispersion; estuary","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Hydrology","",""

(mentor); De Rijk, T. (mentor)","2013","This thesis concerns the design process of a bio-based and biodegradable tent based on the principles of mass production. It proposes a solution for the problem of left-behind tents at music festivals. Each year tens of millions of people camp at music festivals worldwide and about one in four campers leaves their tent behind as waste afterwards. This annually returning phenomenon is a nightmare for both festival organizers and their visitors, as for the environment and society as a whole. Circumstances at music festivals are harsh. People spill mud and beers on their tents, trip over guy wires, stand in endless lines, and carry lots of luggage to and from festivals. Knowing this, festival-goers buy cheap and low-quality camping items that they can leave behind if necessary. We found that this is not so much a behavioral issue, as it is a genuine design flaw. People are using durable products as if they are disposable. This is where the idea of an inexpensive, bio-based, and biodegradable tent becomes relevant. By proposing such a concept, the design is mainly focused on materials, as the product’s core functionalities (a safe 2-person shelter) are more or less equal. As a theoretical framework the shape-material-process trinity (Beukers et al.) is used to understand the implications of using alternative materials to optimize an existing type of product. By choosing film instead of fabric we were able to not only propose a different design, but also a radically different way of tent manufacture. By utilizing blow-extrusion as a technique for making tents, we needed to familiarize ourselves with its possibilities via small scale testing. Via manual experiments and material feedback (‘handmade’) we pursued in a form-finding process. This enabled us to develop a product design that is the link between something that can be made in a fully automated way (‘handless’), and something that expands into a tent structure economically interesting. The concept of a mass produced, bio-based, and biodegradable tent seems viable. So, further developments are recommended. On top of that, it also shows the real value of mass production; it is clever and precise. This is because production at large scale simply needs to be highly efficient. Therefore, it can also be used to solve environmental issues, rather than being its effector.","Festivals; Tent; Bio-based; Biodegradable","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-10-18","Industrial Design Engineering","Strategic Product Design","","","",""

(mentor); Ngan-Tillard, D.M.J. (mentor); Lindenbergh, R.C. (mentor); Wezenberg, U. (mentor); Slob, S. (mentor)","2013","For the construction of breakwaters large amounts of armourstone which are produced in dedicated quarries are needed. The better the in-situ block size distribution (IBSD) of these quarries can be determined, the more accurately the quarry production can be predicted. Currently, the IBSD prediction is based on manually acquired scanline data. This method is accompanied with a lot of disadvantages as it is an unsafe, time consuming and subjective method of data gathering in which the amount of gathered data strongly depends on the reach of the surveyor. To determine the IBSD the resulting data is inserted into Wang’s equation method, which uses the mean discontinuity set properties (orientation and principal mean spacing) as input. Taking the disadvantages of the manual scanlining method into account, 3D terrestrial laser scanning is proposed as a suitable alternative to gather the discontinuity data. This thesis investigates the applicability of laser data for IBSD determination. The research is based on the manual and laser data that was gathered during a fieldwork in the Dan-quarry in Benin. Firstly, it is investigated whether it is possible to replace the manually gathered discontinuity data by laser data by simulating a virtual scanline in the point cloud. Secondly, as the laser scanner allows to gather discontinuity data across the entire rockface, an alternative method which allows to take all the obtained discontinuity data directly into account becomes necessary. It is for this purpose that the voxel method in this thesis is developed. This approach has not been used for geotechnical purposes before and is based on the method that is used in the medical world to determine volume data from CT scans. It requires a bounding box to be subdivided into voxels of a predefined size. The position of the centre of each voxel is evaluated with respect to all discontinuity planes that intersect the bounding box. As voxels with the same position with respect to all discontinuity planes can be considered to belong to the same block, the sum of the volumes of these voxels gives the in-situ block size. When comparing the results of the two developed methods with the manually obtained results, it is found that they can represent at best a lower boundary of the IBSD. The main reason for this is that the laser data results in a lot more planes than the manual data. This decreases the IBSD drastically and allows to the conclude that although the orientation data can be easily obtained from the laser data, more effort is needed to obtain the correct spacing and the persistence of the found discontinuities. The effects caused by this are larger in case of the voxel method as all discontinuities over the full height of the face are taken into account instead of only the ones that intersect the virtual scanline. Therefore it is concluded that the virtual scanline method can be used to determine a lower boundary for the IBSD whereas the voxel method, although it has great potential to become an alternative method for IBSD determination from laser scan data, needs more research.","IBSD; laser scanning; in-situ block size estimation; quarry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Resource Engineering","",""

(mentor); Mahmud, A.A. (mentor)","2013","This graduation project is a practical-based research project. Because it is a fact that residential energy consumption has been increasing year by year in China due to the rapid urbanization, increasing urban population and demanding of higher quality living, with the help of HEMS, people can monitor real-time energy usage, immediately reflect on their actions and have a big picture of the energy consumption over time, which in turn develop a mental model of how they should use energy in a more efficient way for both sustainable and economical purposes. Since some studies and experiments of implementing HEMS into people’s life have been/are going to be conducted in western countries and that several Chinese companies have already stepped into this field. However, there is no sufficient literature and similar surveys available in China. It is not known that how HEMS can be applied to existing Chinese families, which arouses great curiosity for exploration and it served as a starting point for this project. Since HEMS is a novel concept, the target group was defined as prospective users from upper-middle class in China, for they can afford and also more open to embrace new technology. Later, the target group has been narrowed down to people from a small size of family and are familiar with using a smart phone. The research included a study of current global market of HEMS and DEPEST ayalysis method was used to gain a better understanding of Chinese context, along with a user-centered approach to investigate the context of the target users’ homes, their household routines and their energy consumption. From the study, it indicated that the target group in general do not have enough interest in HEMS alone and they showed more interest in remote control of household appliances. So it is more promising to combine HEMS with smart home control system to be accepted by Chinese people, which was a turning point of this project. Consequently, another analysis phase was conducted to investigate Chinese smart home system market and the needs from users, a similar approach was applied in this phase. Safety issue is the fundamental and primary demands from the majority of users, then for upper-middle and higher class, people pay an increasing attention to quality in order to promote comfort and control of one’s life. But in this project, focuses will be put on the energy management level which is an inevitable trend and also a potential selling point for the smart home system to stand out in the Chinese market in the near future. Therefore, a design goal was refined to fit the Chinese market. It is to integrate HEMS into smart home control system and to higher the acceptance of the target group by designing a smart phone application. In the conceptualization phase, three concepts were generated based on the idea of applying metaphors into interface interaction, focussing on engaging users with an simple, intuitive and structured interface and making they more aware of energy consumption. User tests indicated that users have a clear preference to simple interaction and appealing interface. Given all insights got from user studies and concept evaluation, a final design is an application named E-smart that is running on Android system for prospective Chinese residents. The new interface provides a new structure which expects to adapt to people’s behavioural habits easily and in the meanwhile, improve user experience by strengthening the engaging quality when people interact with the system. To evaluate this idea, the E-smart was made partially interactive by flash. A comparable interface was made based on an existing smart home interface and a HEMS interface. The results show that the E-smart scored higher on pragmatic, hedonic and attractive qualities than the comparable interface. However, the pragmatic aspect is not distinct from the current design, which is also reasonable because this design wanted to highlight hedonic aspect. But hedonic aspect is not, at least at this moment, necessary for the prospective target group to use this kind of “tool” application. Therefore, further research is required to improve the interface to keep a balance on both aspects in order to make the interface more attractive to Chinese users.","home energy management; smart home control; Chinese Market","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Mooi, H.G. (mentor); Baggen, J.H. (mentor); Bauling, M. (mentor)","2013","Many projects executed within organizations fail due to budget and time overruns. The goals for time and budget are often related to the planning of a project. However, due to unforeseen factors the execution often deviates from the initial project planning. These unforeseen factors can be led back to the extent to which a project is susceptible to uncertainties and risks. This thesis research has investigated to what extent it is possible to improve the front-end project planning on basis of theories on project risk and uncertainty. For this purpose a framework for assessing this risk and uncertainty is developed. This framework consists of four dimensions: novelty, technology, pace and complexity. The latter is divided into three sub-dimensions: technical, organizational and environmental complexity. The research tests this framework for a specific group of companies. These are project-based organizations (PBO) that produce complex product systems (CoPS). One such company was used in this research in a multiple case study approach in which 23 cases were selected. These individual case studies included a document analysis in which the resource hours of the project administration were studied and a semi-structured interview with the project manager. After the individual case studies were performed a cross case analysis was done for the entire group of cases. The results have shown that each of the individual dimensions influences the execution of the project and thus should influence the planning in a different way. 1) Novelty influences the clarity of internal tasks and processes and therefore the planning of these relies more on estimations than calculations. The level of novelty therefore gives an indication of the required buffers in hours and timespan that will be required throughout the project. 2) Technology uncertainty influences the amount of technical iterations (design, build, and test). This uncertainty of the technical development phase should be incorporated in the planning in the form of buffers for the technical resources. 3) A higher degree of pace requires more priority from the project team. Also, teams should be smaller to work more efficient and to reduce bureaucracy and formalization. 4) The three dimensions of complexity were studied by collecting all factors mentioned in the interviews that have led to complexity in the studied cases. The complexity of a project can therefore be assessed by the factors that are applicable to that project. Even though specific factors have specific impact on the project, in general terms it has been found that technical complexity relates to the amount of technical development and coordination hours as well as time delays in the latter phase of the project. Organizational complexity relates to the efficiency of the work of the project team and the amount of internal coordination. Finally Environmental complexity has been found to have a severe impact on external coordination of the stakeholders by the project manager and possible time delays due to dependencies on stakeholders. All the empirical data and results of the cross case analysis are incorporated in a planning tool. This tool enables a project manager to assess a project front-end on the level of risk and uncertainty this project is susceptible to. It also indicates in which dimension the risk and uncertainty is situated and it gives qualitative advice on how to incorporate buffers in timespan and hours in the project planning. This tool can therefore help a project manager in developing a more accurate project planning. The main conclusions of this study are therefore that by assessing the project risk and uncertainty in this way, it is possible to develop a more accurate project planning and with this possibly enhance the project success.","projects; project management; risk and uncertainty; project planning; resource planning; complex product systems; project-based organizations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-10-18","Technology, Policy and Management","Technology, Strategy & Entrepreneurship","","","",""

(mentor)","2013","In these ages of a more and more increasing energy demand and struggle to reduce CO2 emissions, the need of robust, analytical and fast ways to introduce new alternative energy concepts into practice is imminent. Nowadays, engineers struggle to incorporate all parts of modern power electronic applications, such as new topologies, control concepts, supportive features, into compact structures and that require the joining of forces between different sectors of the electrical engineering _eld. Digital technology, new materials and new control ideas should be combined to produce what is envisioned by new engineers as high end technology for renewable energy systems. One such way to simplify the cooperation of different electrical engineering fields is Rapid Control Prototyping (RCP). In RCP applications, a plant controller is implemented using a real-time simulator and is connected to a physical plant having many advantages over implementing an actual controller prototype. A controller prototype developed using a real-time simulator is more flexible, faster to implement and easier to debug. The project considered in this master thesis involves a Rapid Control Prototyping system for a three-phase grid-tie BSNPC IGBT inverter. A Rapid Control Prototyping system, as mentioned before, includes a computer that runs the Simulink software, a Real Time Computer that runs a compiled version of the Simulink model and the actual hardware. The hardware in the existing case comprises a custom board designed and manufactured especially for this master thesis project and already existing inverter hardware. The custom board acts as an intermediate between the controlling computers and the hardware. It receives and sends signals to and from the Real Time Computer as well as the inverter hardware, is capable of fully operating the hardware and providing the controlling computers with full data and information about the hardware. The data transmissions between the systems are done real-time while the inverter hardware is in operation and the editing and producing of new data is also done in real-time. The data processing inside the two controlling computers is also done in real-time and permits the testing and operation of the hardware simultaneously with its change in control variables, gains and duty cycles. The ease of operation of such a system and the full controllability and flexibility makes it perfect for testing in power electronic applications.","Rapid Control Prototyping; BSNPC; three-level; three phase; grid tie; inverter; VHDL; FPGA; PWM; finite state machine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-10-18","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","EWI","","Electrical Power Engineering","",""

(mentor); Frankenmolen, S. (mentor); Van Tol, F. (mentor); Bakker, K.J. (mentor)","2013","Nowadays suction caissons are extensively used for anchoring large offshore floating facilities. Installation of suction caissons in coarse grained soils is achieved by induced seepage flow in the soil. This reduces the soil resistance at the caisson tip, which contributes to the installation process. Installation in fine grained materials with a low permeability (silt or clay), is achieved by suction (relative to seabed pressure) within the caisson, which forces the caisson to embed. As a result the installation in layered soils, especially sand overlaid by clay, is expected to be more challenging since the reduction of tip resistance is restrained from flow restrictions in the clay layer. It is unclear to what extent the upper low permeable layer will impact the seepage flow and thus the desired tip reduction. During the installation in layered soils one of the main potential obstacles is excessive plug uplift, which could occur at certain applied suction pressures. The objective of the presented research is to assess the governing mechanisms of plug stability during installation of a suction caisson in layered soils where sand is overlaid by clay. It was found from case studies on installation in layered soils that water-injection-devices (WID) were used. Subsequently, two general types of failure mechanisms of plug stability for installation of suction caissons in sand overlying by clay were identified; plug uplift and plug cracking. Further analysis showed that the failure mechanism depends on the dimensions of both the caisson and the clay plug (thickness z). Furthermore, basic experiments executed as part of this research showed that plug cracking is an unlikely failure mechanism for standard aspect ratios (i.e. D/z < 6) Assessment of the plug stability was done by introducing two extreme cases; a fixed plug and a moving plug during installation. Stability of a fixed plug was assessed by introducing a fracture-ratio, which determines the crack-requirement for installation without uplift. When plug uplift can be accommodated to a certain extend (i.e. a moving plug), the relation between the plug uplift velocity and the installation-rate should be assessed. Based on analytical analyses, it is concluded that for low installation rates the total amount of uplift is higher compared to fast installation rates. Finally, the contribution of reverse end bearing (REB) as part of the plug stability was investigated for layered soils. The uplift mechanism at the interface of the plug (i.e. the clay-sand interface) consists of the process of suction mobilization and suction release within the sand. It was found that the magnitude and duration of the temporary resistance (i.e. the reverse end bearing) depends on the dissipation of negative excess pore pressures in time. This shows that for a typical installation period (1 - 6 hours) and hydraulic conductivities lower than 1e-5 m/s, temporary capacity due to delayed inflow of water can be considered. The analytical work was verified with the results of two analysed field cases and numerical analysis. In both field cases water injection devices were implemented as mitigating measure (i.e. to decrease tip resistance) to ensure penetration of the suction caisson in dense sands. However, this system is at present still not a proven technology and back-calculations did not clearly indicate the benefit of these devices. The contribution (or the absence) of REB was recognized for both practical and numerical back-calculations. This indicates that the magnitude of REB is highly dependent on time-effects (i.e. the permeability of the sand and installation rates).","suction caisson; installation effects; soil conditions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geotechnical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Van Duin, R. (mentor); Wiegmans, B. (mentor); Behdani, B. (mentor)","2013","In the current situation, although there are advantages of intermodal freight transport, the performance of intermodal freight transport (IFT) is not good. The market share of IFT is low compared with single-mode road transport. It is necessary to analyze the current operation of IFT system and apply the concept of synchromodal transport to improve its performance. Firstly, the definition and characteristics of synchromodal transport need to be defined before applying it to the current IFT. Another important issue before design synchromodal transport system is to analyze the current operation of IFT. In this research, the service design is from the perspective of logistics service providers (LSPs). The position of LSPs in the current IFT market is analyzed with Porter’s five forces model. It gives a clear understanding of the operation of LSPs and their interactions with other main actors. Based on the analysis on current IFT market, it is important to better match the service capacity and transport demand to provide a flexible transport service. Therefore, the design of the synchromodal transport system realizes the following characteristics: 1. Dynamic planning of transportation; 2. Decision making based on network utilization; and 3. Combining transport flow (volume). An optimization model is developed to create synchromodal transport service schedule and analyze its impact. The model addresses the integrated service design and also takes the time factor into account. In this research, it is assumed that defining the service schedule is done by an LSP, who is able to integrate the transport volume and determine the schedule of different transport modes according to the demand data. The model aims to minimize total service cost which include transport cost and waiting penalties. The input of the model is transport volumes from a specific origin to a specific destination with the earliest pick-up time and the due date. The output is the departure time of each service and the flow distribution. Model application is based on the case of container transport on Rotterdam-Tilburg. 6 scenarios are generated to analyze the performance of synchromodal transport. Firstly the model is applied to the case with the pre-defined demand pattern. The schedule for synchromodal transport service is generated easily. Comparing the results, the total service cost is reduced and the share of sustainable modes is increased. So synchromodal transport can improve the performance of current IFT system. Furthermore, the model could also be applied to the case with undefined demand pattern. The results show that the assumptions for unit transport cost and waiting penalties are quite important, which will influence the choice of transport modes.","freight transport; synchromodality; modeling; service design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

This will lead to an increase of flood risk upstream. Which can be prevented by dredging the river mouth; 2) Both sedimentation and erosion are expected near the Tumumpa Dua coastline. By implementing a beach in the reclamation design the sedimentation can be used beneficial and also the erosion will be stopped; 3) Increased erosion and mangrove retreat due to the construction of the new land reclamation is not expected. But a cure for the existing erosion and mangrove retreat is proposed and designed; 4) The proposed canal between the existing coastline and the new land reclamation is expected to be silted within a few years. Placing the canal above sea level can prevent this. A new reclamation will have large influences on the environment of Manado Bay. Sedimentation and garbage settlement at several spots around the reclamation are likely, coral reefs will be affected during its construction and higher water levels on Tondano are also expected. All the researched negative effects of the planned land reclamation can be prevented or mitigated separately by above mentioned measures. But failure to implement one of these preventing or mitigating measures will result in a large threat for the people or the environment of Manado. This risk might only be justified if a demand for further city expansion has been proven and if all other development options for unused land within Manado city and less preferably the mountainous hinterland have been excluded.","Manado; Sulawesi; Indonesia; land reclamation; domestic waste handling; master project report","en","student report","TU Delft, Department of Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2013","The world of systems and control guides more of our lives than most of us realize. Most of the products we rely on today are actually systems comprised of mechanical, electrical or electronic components. Engineering these complex systems is a challenge, as their ever growing complexity has made the analysis and the design of such systems an ambitious task. This urged the need to explore new methods to mitigate the complexity and to create simplified models. The answer to these new challenges? \textit{Abstractions}. An abstraction of the the continuous dynamics is a \textit{symbolic model}, where each ``symbol'' corresponds to an ``aggregate'' of states in the continuous model. Symbolic models enable the \textit{correct-by-design} synthesis of controllers and the synthesis of controllers for classes of specifications that traditionally have not been considered in the context of continuous control systems. These include \textit{qualitative} specifications formalized using temporal logics, such as \acf{LTL}. Besides addressing qualitative specifications, we are also interested in synthesizing controllers with \textit{quantitative} specifications, in order to solve optimal control problems. To date, the use of symbolic models for solving optimal control problems, is not well explored. This MSc Thesis presents a new approach towards solving problems of optimal control. Without loss of generality, such control problems are considered as path-planning problems on finite graphs, for which we provide two shortest path algorithms; one deterministic \acf{SDSP} algorithm and one non-deterministic \acs{SDSP} algorithm, in order to solve problems with quantitative specifications in both deterministic and non-deterministic systems. The fact that certain classes of qualitative specifications result in the synthesis of (maximally-permissive) controllers, enables us to use the \acs{SDSP} algorithms to also enforce quantitative specifications. This, however, is not the only path towards our goal of synthesizing controllers with mixed qualitative-quantitative specifications; it is possible to use the \acs{SDSP} algorithms directly to synthesize controllers for the same classes of specifications. Finally, we implement the algorithms as an extension to the \texttt{MATLAB} toolbox \texttt{Pessoa}, using Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) as our main data structure.","automatic synthesis; discrete abstraction; symbolic model; qualitative specifications; quantitative specifications; LTL; Pessoa; embedded control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","Embedded Systems","",""

(mentor)","2013","The large growth in containerized trade in the last decades set pressure on the current operating terminals in most ports around the world. In the Port of Rotterdam, the largest port of Europe, expansion became inevitable. With the expansion project ""Maasvlakte 2"" 1000 hectares of new land is created out of the sea, which made room for 5 new container terminals increasing the estimated annual container throughput in 2030 to 30 million TEU. This large ow of containers all have to leave the port to be transported all around Europe. To deal with this large ow and prevent congestion in and around the port, hinterland transport by barge and rail is promoted. To attract more containers via these modalities container flows are bundled to reduce the cost per container and make the hinterland transport more efficient. This bundling however will lead to extra movements around the port and for an efficient and congestion free connection an Inter Terminal Transport (ITT) system has been proposed. In this system vehicles transport containers between the various terminals and service providers around the port and can move over a dedicated road closed from all other traffic. To investigate the requirements of such a system the Port of Rotterdam Authority together with the Delft University of Technology and the Erasmus University of Rotterdam set up a research group investigating several aspects of the ITT system. The research presented in this report investigates a new and fast way of determining the optimal fleet size of system using a model based on linear programming. The benefit of this modelling technique versus the conventional simulation techniques is that it can be built relatively fast resulting in tool which costs less money and presents results earlier than conventional methods. This enables companies and agencies to use this model as a tool for decision making processes which provides insight in the costs and benefits of the considered system. The main question however is: Could a reliable tool be constructed, able to determine an optimal vehicle configuration to provide a yet to be determined performance level for an ITT system?...","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-10-16","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

(mentor); Jonkman, S.N. (mentor); De Bruijn, K.M. (mentor); Van Overloop, P.J.A.T.M. (mentor)","2013","In the Netherlands flood risks are often assessed by using a dike ring approach. This approach has, aside from many advantages, also some disadvantages. The main disadvantage is that, when zooming in on a small area, the effect of the system on that small area and vice versa, is or cannot be accounted for properly. Research has shown that for a set of cases in the Netherlands these effects, called ‘load interdependencies’, have significant influence on flood risk estimates. Load interdependencies of flood defences are the effects of failures of dikes on load conditions of other dikes in the system. These can be both positive and negative; a failure causing a lower load at another locations is called positive, a failure causing a higher load at another location is called negative. The positive effects are caused by a decrease in discharge due to outflow into polders, the negative effects are generally caused by overland flow to another river, called shortcutting. In those cases flow and thus water levels increase, causing higher than expected water levels. To be able to assess these load interdependencies in flood risk analysis a different method is needed, as previous research shows and concludes that these effects cannot be ignored. Therefore the objective of this thesis was to develop a new method capable of dealing with these effects for cases at lowland rivers. Based upon previous research a new method was defined based upon a fast inundation model consisting of 1D branches and storage reservoirs. Without losing too much accuracy, this model was 150 times faster than a similar 2D model. Due to the fast nature of this model it was possible to execute a Monte Carlo analysis for the case of the Bovenrijn/IJssel, one of the cases in the Netherlands where load interdependencies have a significant influence on the outcome of risk analysis. By applying Importance Sampling techniques it was possible to execute the Monte Carlo analysis with a reduced number of runs. For the case of the Bovenrijn/IJssel, a schematization with 22 breach locations was used. By using the new method, it appeared that negative load interdependencies can indeed increase water levels at the IJssel, and it is thus necessary to account for these effects in further flood risk analysis. However, not at all locations at the IJssel negative effects are dominating; breaches along the IJssel compensate the negative effect. Along the Bovenrijn it was found that the effects are mainly positive. From the risk calculations it was shown that the risk at the left bank and the dike ring areas further downstream is mainly caused by negative load interdependencies. Other observations were that, although the flood waves are lower, they are also much longer, causing higher load durations. The water levels observed for the different discharge exceedence probabilities are generally much lower, which means that the actual safety of the dikes in the area is also generally higher. They also show a spreading for each discharge, meaning that the water levels are influenced by the uncertainty in strength of other dikes. From the case study it was concluded that the methodology performed quite well and gave interesting insights in the effects of load interdependencies in the area. However, this knowledge should not be used in all cases. For dike design for instance, it is not feasible to account for positive effects, as one dike reinforcement project would change the safety level of all other dikes. However, for calculations of the Maximum Probable Damage and for prioritization of dike reinforcement projects, accounting for load interdependencies can give a huge advantage.","load interdependencies; flood risk; risk analysis; system behaviour; dike breaches; flood defences","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-10-17","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Huele, R. (mentor); Bollinger, A. (mentor); Araghi, Y. (mentor)","2013","The aim of this thesis is to define the specifications of an agent-based model to study the adoption and diffusion of solar PV in the Netherlands, accounting for consumer preferences and social influences. The conceptualization of the model is based on five pillars: agent-based modeling, the theory of planned behavior, choice modeling, dif- fusion of innovations and complex networks. The first pillar is the main modeling technique and the other four define the decision-making behavior of the agents, which represent Dutch homeowners. The theory of planned behavior (TPB) is used as the main structure of consumer behavior, consisting of intention and adoption (behavior). Intention is triggered by the attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control of the agents. In the model, innovation characteristics based on the theory of diffusion of innovations are used in the attitude formation. Concepts from complex networks are used to create a scale-free network that connects agents together, allowing them to influence each other through the subjective norm. While intention and perceived be- havioral control define behavior in the original theory, this model proposes the use of choice modeling (CM) to use stated consumer preferences as a means to define the final adoption decision in agents with intention to adopt. The design of the model requires two parts: 1) designing a questionnaire to measure intention (TPB) and decision (CM), to be used in a survey, and 2) conceptualizing and formalizing the agent-based model, and using the variables to be measured using the questionnaire to parameterize the agents. The design of the questionnaire includes a first part with questions to measure items according to the TPB and a second one with a choice experiment. In the agent-based model, agents represent Dutch homeowners and the government and the PV market are embedded in the environment. According to expected survey data, agents are divided into 4 consumer groups, defining the range of their behavior. The model is formalized with a pseudo-code describing the initial agent set up, the government, the PV market, the changes in homeowner population distribution every time step, and the decision-making behavior. The formalization of the agent-based model shows that the proposed combination of theories and techniques offers a new and theoretically well-grounded approach to study the developments in the diffusion of PV systems using empirical data. Especially, the theoretical foundations of the TPB and CM provide a strong basis for the decision-making behavior of the agents. Moreover, the results from the questionnaire based on the two theories can be easily parameterized into agent states, providing a straightforward link between empirical results and agent states.","Agent-based modeling; Choice modeling; Theory of planned behavior; Diffusion of innovations; Complex networks; Microgeneration; PV; Netherlands","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering Systems and Services","","Energy & Industry","",""

However, in case of severe accidents, large amounts of hydrogen gas can be released in the nuclear containment. Hydrogen-air mixture forms a very ammable gas which on subsequent ignition can lead to ame propagation in the nuclear containment. This may produce oscillating pressure waves or high over pressures that may damage the safety equipment and even a_ect the structural integrity of the nuclear reactor containment. Hence, there is a need for tools that can perform safety analysis of the nuclear reactors in case of severe accidents. In this respect, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes have been widely used in the past to predict such ow and combustion phenomena.

Mental complaints consequently cause the absence of workers and a low-effective work performance, which in turn, represent losses of millions of euros for the global market. Detachment from their emotional wellbeing can be just aggravated by the unawareness of one’s personal characteristics. Without sufficient self-management skills, engineers don’t know how to cope adequately with stress and furthermore are vulnerable to get into a vicious cycle that wreaks havoc on their health, physically, mentally, and emotionally. Essential at this moment in time, when the Netherlands precedes the development of a participatory society, this project explores the integration of technology and wellbeing, in the search for new interactions to motivate people taking control of their safety, and engaging actively in the enrichment of their wellbeing. With the specialized input from Balans en Impuls’ psychological team and the insider perspective of Jacobs Engineering’s employees, this project translates two recognized psychological tools into a consumer product able to bring the experience of the in-house, face-to-face traditional therapy into the outside of the office. The project is constructed around the finding that engineers tend to be very much driven by their brain, as opposed to by their emotions or intuition. The nature of their work and professional training requires them to have a rational approach to their daily routine, which is eventually transferred to their other fields of being. Additionally to their particular inability to listen to their bodies, engineers going through a stressful moment have a tendency to ignore most of their psychophysiological symptoms and moreover, are incapable of relating their complaints to its original cause: their lifestyle. In order to nourish the target group’s self-management skills, the design of a Product Service System (PSS) to allow the user to keep track of his physical and emotional state intends to motivate engineers to carry out wholesome activities. By monitoring himself, the user is able to have a better understanding of his performance. ncompass helps the user to reflect on who he is, improve how he feels and inspire what he does. The PSS is compounded by two components: an electronic wearable device – n – which, attached to an undershirt, keeps track of the user’s physical activity along the day. Data collected by n is then transmitted wirelessly to an interface device, e.g. a smartphone. An interactive application on the receiving device – compass – processes the information and presents it back to the user. Compass combines real time biofeedback (heart, breath and physical activity) with personal and psychological information in order to create a tangible link between the mind and the body, promoting self-reflection and giving the user personalized feedback to improve his lifestyle. Tests carried out with one prototypes shown that self-monitoring is a practical way to make the link between the mind and the body tangible and consequently, facilitate the acknowledgment of one’s physical and emotional state.","burnout; prevention; psychological; wellbeing; reflection; self-management; self-monitor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Deligiannis, D. (mentor)","2013","The hydrogenated amorphous/crystalline silicon (a-Si:H/c-Si) heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell is considered a great competitor of the most commercialized homojunction c-Si solar cells while it combines the high performance and the low cost potential of c-Si and a-Si technologies, respectively. Furthermore, the implementation of thin intrinsic (i) a-Si:H film between the c-Si wafer and the p/n doped a-Si:H layers has increased even more the high efficiency potential of the SHJ solar cell due to the excellent surface passivation of c-Si. By applying a randomly textured wafer instead of a double-side polished, optical enhancement is achieved resulting in significant reflection reduction and high short-circuit current densities (JSC). However, texturing-induced defects lead to an a-Si:H/c-Si interface with higher recombination which limits the open circuit voltage (VOC) of the SHJ device after using the same cleaning treatment as for the flat wafer. Thus, a one-to-one transfer of process parameters from flat to textured c-Si substrate is not necessarily appropriate and a different wet-chemical treatment needs to be developed. Random pyramidal texturing is commonly achieved by chemical anisotropic etching in potassium hydroxide (KOH) or sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and isopropyl alcohol (IPA). Since an a-Si:H/c-Si interface of high quality is of great importance, etching solution based on tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH) of low concentration due to its high cost, is used as an alternative for avoiding contamination from K+ and Na+ metal ions. Afterwards, investigation for the development of an appropriate wet-chemical treatment of the textured substrate prior to a-Si:H layer deposition is realized. This thesis reports a texturing recipe consisting of low concentration TMAH and IPA which provides a pyramidal morphology with an average reflectance (R350nm-1100nm) of 11.8% at the wavelength range of 350 nm-1100 nm. The reproducibility and homogeneity of the textured surface are confirmed by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) along with reflectance measurements. Subsequently, a wet-chemical treatment of the pyramidal surface involving multiple oxidation steps in 69% nitric acid (HNO3) solution at 110oC is developed and leads to high a-Si:H/c-Si interface lifetime measurements. Finally, the textured substrate and the newly developed treatment prior to the a-Si:H layer growth result in the fabrication of textured SHJ devices with efficiencies above 18% due to the significant improvement of the VOC, highlighting the efficiency of 19.5% mainly thanks to the considerable achievement of a VOC of 680 mV which is similar to the VOC measured on SHJ solar cells with flat substrate.","silicon heterojunction; c-Si/a-Si; texturing; TMAH; cleaning; nitric acid treatment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Photovoltaic materials and devices","","","",""

Emotion influences action selection while RL selects actions based on their anticipated result. Emotions also provide feedback on a situation, reflecting if the situation is desirable or not. The same type of feedback is given in RL based on the results of a state change. Finally, emotion drives adaptations in behaviour while RL continuously updates its policy based on newly gained experience. Because of this overlap, we theorized that a mapping exists from elements of RL to emotions, such that the occurrence and development of these RL emotions matches that in humans. Theory on emotions shows that complex emotions develop later and habituation can be observed in joy and fear. Further supported by theory on mapping situations to emotions, we mapped joy, hope/fear and confirmation emotions. We showed mathematically and in simulations that the development and occurrence of RL emotions with the mapping we created matches expectations based on emotion theory.","reinforcement learning; emotion; appraisal theory; affective computing; action selection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-10-14","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","Media and Knowledge Engineering","",""

(mentor); Goverde, R.M.P. (mentor); Quaglietta, E. (mentor); Beelaerts van Blokland, W.W.A. (mentor); Janssen, B.J.R. (mentor)","2013","An interlocking system forms a vital part of a railway signaling system because it ensures the safe movement of trains. For one by controlling movable track elements like switches and for an-other by controlling signals. The engineering design of interlocking systems poses challenges to both engineers at e.g. Siemens and the infrastructure manager, e.g. Prorail in the Netherlands. Challenges arise from the cumber-some, labor intensive, conservative, ambiguous and failsafe nature of the interlocking engineering design processes. Best practices in lean production systems raise Siemens’ interest in a lean engineering approach, i.e. reduce the ‘waste’ that does not contribute value to the final rail product. The development of RailML, an open source IT tool that aims to standardize the ex-change of data in a variety of rail processes, may prove the lean catalyst. The lean philosophy has however seldom been applied in engineering design processes. Therefore, this research aims to provide insight in the drivers of the engineering design chain that decrease development time, increase data reliability and make application more flexible, while ensuring (fail-)safe systems. For that purpose, this thesis investigates the next research question: To which extent can RailML potentially enable a leaner engineering design of rail interlocking systems? This study focuses on the Dutch railway network. Furthermore, this study only considers engineering design processes and RailML as the data exchange tool. Five sub research questions lead to an answer: Which methodology leads to a lean transformation of rail interlocking systems’ engineering design? Best practices about lean transformations lead to a methodology that commences with defining complexity into standardized and varying requirements of the final design. A future lean structure of the chain follows from mitigating ‘waste’ and achieving lean transformation directions. The more standardized the require-ments, the higher the potential for an IT tool like RailML to miti-gate ‘waste’. Case specific transformation directions include ‘waste’ prioritization, process standardization, open source IT tools, a modular process and information sharing. A model study allows to quantify the improvement of a strategy like RailML on the status quo and benchmark the lean effect. Four criteria count: costs, time, interdependencies and ambiguities. How would a future lean interlocking engineering design change the status quo? The status quo contains twenty processes that struggle with non value added work in progress, many (non machine readable) data transfers, ambiguous interlocking design from scratch, high fixed costs, many validation processes and low productivity rates. A lean engineering design process mitigates most of that ‘waste’ by concentrating on five main processes: project definition, data preparation, interlocking area design, interlocking engineering and a dry test. Realistically, varying requirements and completely new interlocking areas prevent full automation of the engineering design chain. How should interlocking be implemented into RailML for the purposes desired by Prorail? Prorail proposed to use and provided the files of the Santpoort Noord interlocking area as a case study to formalize the interlock-ing in RailML. A RailML interlocking formalization from the per-spective of a train requesting a route, results in a complete, con-cise and RailML group coherent interlocking formalization that allows to capture all necessary rail elements for (Siemens’) inter-locking engineering and the two-block three-aspect system ATB-EG. The RailML structure contains two main sub elements: signals and segments. The signal element captures aspect dependencies on the basis of entrance speed profiles, signal aspect and target signal combinations. The segments element covers route relevant elements. In the case of ETCS level 3, the interlocking formaliza-tion might ultimately become superfluous. How does RailML change the interlocking engineering design chain when implemented as the rail data exchange tool for railway signaling systems in the Netherlands? RailML mainly improves the design stage by machine readable transfers, elimination of interlocking area design from scratch and automates test protocol development. At the engineering stage, RailML eliminates the data preparation process and a part of interlocking IT engineering. These improvements do however assume the existence of a single data source in the chain e.g. a GIS. RailML mainly lacks the ability to achieve a modular engi-neering design, continuous process flow, improved project man-agement and lean perfectionism / learning effect. What benefits does the application of the RailML formaliza-tion have during the engineering design of an interlocking area over the traditional and lean process structure? RailML reduces Siemens’ costs between 17%-27% and covers 21%-35% of a lean cost reduction, depending on project complexity. RailML improves productivity by 26%-47% although this only covers 6%-14% of a lean improvement. RailML relatively improves transaction costs but needs a larger average of non value added work-in-progress to achieve so. RailML reduces the tier rejection rate by 47%-77%, which is 50%-81% lean. RailML worsens the non value added work-in-progress for high complexity projects. RailML shows deviating lead time performance: a reduction of 2%-25% which is 2%-64% lean. RailML reduces the current amount of design rules by 55%, which is 85% lean. In general, RailML improves the performance of the interlocking engineering design chain on almost every performance metric, for each project complexity. RailML covers about 43% of the lean state for a medium complexity interlocking area as Santpoort Noord. Academically, the proposed interlocking formalization excels in its way of incorporating signal aspect dependencies, minimal amount of data (barely any redundancy) and alignment with both industry and infrastructure managers. In fact, on the RailML congress of September 2013, the RailML group decided to study the implementation of the developed formalization for different signaling systems than the Dutch and different engi-neering processes than Siemens’. The lean methodology leads to a scientific benchmark of a strategy’s, e.g. RailML’s, lean perfor-mance. The methodology however needs a substantial amount of data and does not seem to work as well for high complexity pro-jects as simpler ones. The author mainly recommends Siemens and Prorail to continue with the development of RailML, to start an interlocking engineer-ing design pilot project with RailML and to enlarge the degree in which interlocking areas can be standardized. From an academic standpoint, the author mainly recommends to study whether the interlocking formalization works for different signaling systems, infrastructure managers and interlocking engineers, to quantify the effects on the safety case, to investi-gate effects of more detailed data, to find design modeling tech-niques that work on a micro level and to test the hypothesis that high complexity engineering design projects suit less for a lean transformation.","Rail Interlocking; Lean Engineering; RailML; Rail Signalling System; Discrete Event Simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","Transport, Infrastructure & Logistics","",""

(mentor)","2013","Secure systems based on Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are gaining popularity due to their hardware intrinsic security. Achieving high quality in such a system requires high quality manufacturing tests; hence, a good controllability and observability of the internal nodes of the system are required. However, this makes it easier for hackers to get access to internal secret information. Therefore, providing a high quality test while making it very hard/impossible to hack the system is a major challenge. This thesis targets a secure test approach for Fuzzy Extractors (FEs), which constitutes the main component of PUF systems. Two novel Built-in self-test (BIST) methods are proposed; daisy chaining and parallel. Both methods provide a higher security compared to existing methods, due to the fact that they are both scan-chain free and do not require any external connections. The daisy chaining test method reuses existing blocks in the FE for pattern generation and output compression to minimize the area overhead; the method realizes a fault coverage of 95% at the cost of 50k clock cycles and an area overhead of only 2.2%. The parallel test method tests individual and simultaneously each of the Fuzzy Extractor blocks with a Random Test Pattern Generator (RTPG), minimizing the overall test time; the test method realizes a fault coverage of 95% at the cost of 8k clock cycles and an area overhead of 18.6%. The fault coverage can be increased at the cost of either test time or area overhead. The methods presented are generic and are applicable to any Fuzzy Extractor.","Test Fuzzy Extractors Security","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-10-11","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","Embedded Systems","",""

In de derde toetsronde primaire waterkeringen is aangegeven dat de waterkering niet voldoet. Omdat het hier een zeer groot en divers dijktraject is, is ervoor gekozen een onderdeel te onderzoeken. Dit betreft een dijkelement tussen twee woningen. Na contact met het waterschap is gebleken dat het voornaamste probleem de beperkte hoogt van de dijk betreft. Het rapport geeft een aanbeveling voor een mogelijke oplossing. Om tot een integrale oplossing te komen is er in de eerste plaats een masterplan voor een groter gebied opgesteld. Dit gebied loopt over een lengte van ongeveer 50 kilometer langs de noordoever van de Merwede. Hier is gekozen om ten oosten van Gorinchem een dijkverbetering toe te passen en waar mogelijk de dijk een multifunctioneel karakter te geven. Dit is na te lezen in het bijbehorende rapport ‘Masterplan Gorinchem Oost’. Na het masterplan is een volgende ontwerpronde gestart. De nieuwe probleemstelling hier is vergelijkbaar met die van het masterplan. Zowel door de stijging van de zeespiegel alsook vanwege de verhoogde afvoerpieken van de grote rivieren moeten de dijken langs deze rivieren hoger en stabieler worden. Dit is besloten aan de hand van de derde toetsronde primaire waterkeringen. De doelstelling is de dijk bij de Woelse Waard, waar zich aan beide kanten woningen bevinden, te verhogen om de overstromingsrisico’s dusdanig te verminderen dat de dijk voldoet aan de eisen. Hiertoe is het omliggende gebied uitgebreid voor geanalyseerd. Niet alleen is er grondonderzoekverricht en zijn de waterstanden onderzocht. Het gehele gebied rondom het stuk dijk is globaal ontworpen om te bezien welke functies locaal kunnen bijdragen aan het creëren van multifunctionele meerwaarde voor de waterkering. Hieruit is gebleken dat voornamelijk een supermarkt en een hangplaats voor jongeren in de buurt gewenst is. Uit onderzoek naar de omgeving is gebleken dat grote delen van het gebied bestaan uit beschermde (natuur)gebieden. Teneinde mogelijke oplossingen op soortgelijke plaatsen te bestuderen is onder andere gebruik gemaakt van referentieprojecten. Zo worden in Nijmegen opzetschotten gebruikt die als tijdelijke hoogwaterkering kunnen dienen. Een ander vorrbeeld vormen de opgevijzelde woningen in de Krimpenerwaard, die het mogelijk maken de dijken op te hogen, zijn hierbij bestudeerd. Naast de referentieprojecten is een inventarisatie gemaakt van wat er mogelijk is op het gebied ophogen en versterken van dijken. Het gemaakte programma van eisen vormt een eerste indicatie om te kiezen welke gebrainstormde ideeën een redelijke kans van slagen hebben. Hieruit zijn vier varianten naar voren gekomen. De dubbele dijk - hier wordt een tweede dijk achter de huidige dijk aangelegd -, de kistdam op de dijk, de damwand in de dijk, en tenslotte het opvijzelen van de woningen en het ophogen van de huidige dijk. Aan de hand van berekeningen en een zorgvuldige toetsing aan het programma van eisen met is de variant met een damwand tot in de kleilaag in de dijk als beste beoordeeld. Deze variant zorgt voor de minste overlast voor zowel de bewoners als het doorgaande verkeer. Een ander belangrijk punt is dat uit de globale schatting van de kosten deze variant als goedkoopste naar voren is gekomen.

Software agents are able to aid human negotiators, help them achieve better outcomes and even negotiate on their behalf. An active topic in the field of automated negotiation concerns the development of negotiation strategies. While negotiation strategies and their components have been investigated before, there is to our knowledge no substantial work that analyzes the relations between the components. This thesis investigates these relationships, contributing to the field in two ways. First, it introduces the BOA architecture, which defines and isolates the key components of a negotiation strategy. To validate this architecture we have shown that many well-known and state-of-the-art negotiation strategies fit into the BOA architecture. Second, it investigates how the interactions of these key components influence an agent's performance. We examined the effects of combining different components and we determined as well which key component contributes the most to the agent's performance. We have reached the important conclusion that combining better performing components does lead to better performing negotiation strategies. Furthermore, we found a significant difference in the amount of contribution each key component makes to the performance of a negotiation agent. Throughout our research we have also found that the interactions between components play a large role as well in the performance of a negotiation strategy and that these interactions should not be overlooked.","automated negotiation; negotiation strategies; component contribution; strategy components","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","Interactive Intelligence","",""

To enter the shop window market, they want to have a universal product which makes it easy for shop owners to dress their shop window. Van Raalte Displays can play an important role in dressing vacant shop windows to create an extra space for advertisements. The shop window as we know these days exist for more than hundred years, but it is continuously subjected to changes. Nowadays the shop window is not for leisure shopping anymore, but it is used to promote products and product information. Window Funtising is developed to bring leisure shopping back to the shopping street and still using the shop window to promote products. Window Funtising gives a solution for decaying of shopping streets by dressing the empty shop windows. By using this product, the store keeps its shop window effect, instead of placing stickers on the windows of the store, which is used a lot nowadays as a solution to hide a store completely. Window Funtising makes use of three dimensions to dress the shop window in a way which will be recognised by the shopper. The basic principle of the product consist out of a frame which makes it possible to create large illuminated advertisements in the shop window. The frame is built up from several LED-displays which are connected to each other to create a modular display. Movable sides pulls the visual tight, so that variation of fit is neglected. Next to that, new aluminium profiles are designed to combine all the features of the hardware in only two different profiles. The LED-displays can be easily clicked together without creating unlighted areas of the visual. To bring leisure shopping back to the shopping street, Window Funtising makes use of augmented reality.

Adequate and effective management of horizontal subsurface drainage systems is important in fulfilling this duty. The service life time of these systems have to be optimized. Financial resources should be used efficiently. Only since a few years there is a proactive attitude towards management and maintenance of subsurface drainage systems. There is still little experience on how to manage and maintain urban subsurface drainage systems. Current knowledge on system behavior, failure mechanisms and effectiveness of maintenance is mainly based on research to field drainage in agricultural context. More fundamental knowledge on these topics is required in order to assess which maintenance and monitoring efforts are suitable for adequate system management. Approach My research focused on municipally managed, horizontal subsurface drainage systems (mainly installed in the sewer trench). System failure processes, possible locations of system failure, effectiveness of maintenance by jet-flushing and required monitoring and inspection efforts are studied. The knowledge is gained by execution of a detailed case study to two different system types located in the municipality of Utrecht. A predominantly submerged and a predominantly dry system. Past system state inspection and system behavior monitoring data are studied. Time series are analyzed with time series analyses tool Menyanthes. In the context of this research project, an extensive system behavior monitoring campaign is executed in the case systems. Furthermore, several inspection techniques including CCTV camera inspection are applied Results - Knowledge on failure mechanisms. The major failure mechanism observed in the case systems was the formation of ochre. Ochre contamination, a dynamic process, can lead to major problems with high groundwater tables. - Insight in location of failure. Results from this research show that besides problems in the drain-soil interface focused on in literature, internal network clogging can also be a major driver for system failure. - Insight in effectiveness of maintenance by jet-flushing. Jet-flushing appeared to be primary effective in removal of ochre blockages from the internal drain cross-sections. Time-scale of re-clogging is however short. Within several months, the effect can be negated. - A possible approach in system investigation and assessment. Based on the obtained experience in inspecting and monitoring the case systems, an approach in system investigation and assessment is developed. The approach is presented in a decision tree-like scheme. The scheme can be used for the development of a management and maintenance plan for a particular system. Recommendation for future research This research can be considered as initiating research. New questions arose during the research. Permanently submerged (modern) subsurface drainage systems are not yet studied in detail. Some processes are not fully understood yet. Further research is therefore recommended.

(mentor); Sonneveld, M.H. (mentor); Flendrie, W. (mentor)","2013","Introduction Keptin-Jr is a small company that produces cuddly toys of natural materials for babies and toddlers. One of the toys in their assortment, the Girly Toddel with strings, is used at some hospitals. The cuddly toy is put with premature babies so they can grab and pull at the strings, instead of grabbing and pulling at the feeding or oxygen tubes. Conversations with nurses who use these toys revealed a need for more products for neonatology use, leading to this assignment: Design a cuddly toy for premature babies with additional functionality that will positively influence their development. Research & Analysis Research was done to get a thorough understanding of the context of neonatology departments, the needs of premature babies, and the needs and wishes of parents and nurses. For this purpose I have reviewed literature, visited neonatology departments for observational research, interviewed several experts and analysed the knowledge found. With the conclusions drawn from this analysis a design brief was formulated. Preterm birth is birth before 37 weeks of gestation. After birth, premature babies are admitted at a hospital’s neonatology unit where they are taken care of by neonatologists. They have to endure many invasive tactile interventions, such as injections. Due to immaturity of the brain, premature babies are easily overstimulated. Therefore, external stimuli have to be reduced as much as possible. There are, however, also several ways to positively stimulate their development. Positive stimuli for development include: providing boundary, correct positioning, maternal scent, maternal body sounds, skin-to-skin contact, warmth, stroking, rocking and cuddling. These stimuli help the baby to relax, to improve their rhythm and sleeping behaviour or stimulate muscles for development. Many of the previously mentioned ways to positively stimulate the baby’s development are best provided by the baby’s parents. They can provide stimuli the child is most familiar with. But parents cannot always be present. That is why the design brief was formulated as: Design a product for premature babies that provides ways for parents to help them to bond with their baby, when they are together, but also when they are apart. Concept The concept is a cuddly toy blanket, shaped like a butterfly, with a filled head with four different strings for grabbing. There are two types: One will have a separable scent cloth and the other will have both this separable scent cloth and an additional sound module. The cuddly toy has four different types of strings based on what is considered best for premature babies of different ages. This was determined by discussing several types of shapes, thicknesses and materials with nurses of the neonatology department of the Jeroen Bosch Ziekenhuis. The upper wings of the butterfly can be used as a scent cloth. The wings can be taken off by pulling them through the butterfly’s body and worn by mothers and fathers. After the cloth has absorbed their scent it can be pulled through the butterfly’s body again so that the toy wears mother’s or father’s familiar scent, which helps to calm the baby. The butterfly’s firm head, body and separate wings provide several ways to cover, protect and support the baby. This way, nurses can use the toy to make the baby feel more comfortable. Type 2 contains an additional sound module with which one can record and play a song or other sounds. This way, parents can sing a song or make another recording for their baby that can be played when they cannot be present. When parents are away and the child is restless, nurses can play the recording to calm the baby. The product provides ways for parents to bond with their baby. Bonding has a positive effect on premature babies and it will help them to develop. Besides this, it also makes parents feel better when they can participate in caring for their child instead of passively observing. It makes them feel a little less powerless. Evaluation I made several models and adjusted the design until I was satisfied. Then I asked one of the seamstresses who often makes models for Keptin-Jr to make models for evaluation. In order to evaluate the use of the wings as scent cloth, I asked 10 mothers and 5 fathers who have had a premature child, to wear the wings for a day and to make a list of positive and negative experiences while doing so. The week after, I interviewed all participants about how they experienced wearing the scent cloth wings. Of the 15 participants, 14 were very positive about the cuddly toy and liked the idea of the separable scent cloth. Besides this, most participants were also very enthusiastic about the strings and the materials of the cuddly toy. Also the nurses I have spoken to were very enthusiastic about the product. They are particularly happy with the size of the blanket, with the material, and the variation in the shapes and materials of the strings. They only would like the head of the butterfly to become a bit smaller and more squeezable. Finally, based on the results and conclusions of the evaluation sessions with parents and nurses, I have made some small adjustments to optimise the design.","premature baby; bonding; cuddly toy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-10-09","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Popovic, J. (mentor)","2013","In recent years the complexity of the grid systems has grown due to the increased penetration of renewable energy and distributed generation sources. The increased complexity requires new methods to quickly manage the changing sources and loads. This research focuses on one of such technologies, called the Solid State Transformer (SST). A SST uses power electronic devices and a high-frequency transformer to achieve isolation and voltage conversion from one level to another. Several SST topologies have been proposed by different research groups, without a clear consensus on which is most suited for grid applications. To ensure a proper choice of topology, a separate literature review is presented in this thesis. The final choice of topology is extremely modular and can be expanded to any voltage and power level. A first order design is made based on this topology for quantitative research. In order to reduce computation times during simulations, the SST circuit is reduced to an averaged model. After development of the averaged model, the controller for the different parts of the SST is designed. The averaged model of the SST along with its controller is then placed in several grid scenarios to investigate its behavior. These simulations show satisfactory behavior of the SST under both normal operation and disturbances.","smart grids; converter modeling; converter control; small-signal modeling; averaged-signal modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-10-08","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Power Processing","","Electrical Power Engineering","",""

Devices such as smartphones and tablets have become a must-have for contemporary consumers. This development has not left enterprises and organizations unaffected as employees express the desire of using the same devices and consumer technologies at their workplace. As such, organizations have started adopting ‘Bring Your Own Device’ (BYOD) policies. Employees are allowed to bring their personal mobile devices and use them to access critical information or services in the corporate network. The introduction of BYOD programmes stands to deliver several benefits to organizations. However, it presents certain challenges notably in the area of technology and information security. Currently, there are a lot of propositions in industrial literature while fewer in the scientific literature with respect to tackling the technology and information security implications of the trend. It is identified that these propositions are mostly unsystematic while also taking a solution proposing approach. In this sense, decision making efforts of organizations based on lightweight approaches might fail to capture distinct aspects of BYOD supporting technologies and security controls. As such, in this thesis we develop a framework of technologies and security controls to support the content of the decision making process of interested organizations to introduce BYOD programmes. Namely, we investigate the BYOD trend with a desk research shedding light on its origins, the drivers pushing it, the beneficial opportunities and the key challenge areas that are posed to interested organizations. Focusing on the security challenges we investigate the advancements in the threat landscape of mobile devices by reviewing relevant literature and asking the opinion of security experts. Subsequently, we collect from literature the technologies that stand to support employee-owned devices in the corporate network while also the security controls that can assure the protection of sensitive information manipulated over them. Based on this identification we embark on gathering empirical insight to establish a picture on the effectiveness of proposed technologies and residual risks underlying the proposed security controls. For this purpose, we perform semi-structured interviews with security experts and we obtain results from security audits. Next, we consolidate the information gathered for the development of the framework. The framework constitutes a systematic approach comprised of four layers. The layers entail the important areas for decision making, particularly in the area of technologies and security controls, towards the allowance of employee-owned devices for business use. The framework is addressed to practitioners coming from various types of organizations while also researchers in the field of BYOD. Finally, we attempt to evaluate the quality and usability of the framework by asking the opinion of experts. The expert assessment reveals the strong points and shortcomings of the developed framework. Concluding we reflect on the research results, the artifact built and we discuss the limitations while suggesting ideas for future work.","Bring Your Own Device; Mobile Security; Mobile Threats; Mobile Device Management Technologies; BYOD Framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2015-10-07","Technology, Policy and Management","ICT","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor); Storm, S. (mentor); De Jong, M. (mentor)","2013","The effect of minimum wage policy on employment and working hours is crucial for assessing the overall effect of this policy. A large number of scholars studied this issue from both the theoretical and empirical perspectives, but still no consensus was reached. Under the background of economic rebalance which is a transition from the export-oriented economy towards domestic demand-oriented economy in China, this issue is triggering more intensive debate. This paper aims to provide new reliable evidence to this hot debate and fill the knowledge gap in the literature as well. In the paper, a three-year pooled cross-sectional micro data obtained from the large dataset of China General Social Survey covering 28 out of the 34 provinces are used. By establishing regression-adjusted difference in differences models in the short and medium term respectively, a comparative analysis of minimum wage effect on employment and working hours is conducted. The estimation results imply that the negative effect of minimum wage policy on employment and working hours is not very severe: although in the short term it will harm the low-wage male workers' employment and extend their working time, as time goes on, the negative effect will disappear. The Harris and Todaro model could give a possible explanation to the result. Besides, the paper provide the second explanation that the increase of labor productivity may create a space for the increase of minimum wage without hurting employment. In terms of the working hours effect, the increase of minimum wage will extend the working hours for male workers in the short term, but reduce it in the medium term. We attribute this result which is different from many studies in the developed countries to the monthly wage dominant system in China. The longer working hours for male workers in short term may be explained as male workers who remain employed have to extend their working hours to compensate their increase of wage.","minimum wage; employment; policy analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-11-01","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering and Policy Analysis","","Economics of Innovation","",""

(mentor); Simons, R.R. (mentor); Visser, P.J. (mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor)","2013","Wave transmission is a very important design parameter for submerged porous breakwater design, as it defines the dimensions of the breakwater as well as the cost and construction process. The spatial distribution of the wave transmission parameter influences the current pattern on the lee of the breakwater and therefore the sediment transport process. For this reason it is important to create a design tool capable of predicting the variation in wave height around detached submerged breakwaters. This study has been conducted as an extension of the work completed by Amir Ahmadian for his PhD project the University College of London under the supervision of Professor Richard Simons. During his research a large number of experiments were conducted in order to create an extensive database on wave transmission around semi-infinite impermeable breakwaters. The results of these experiments where then used to create an ANN model capable of predicting the 3D wave transmission coefficients around submerged breakwaters. This thesis therefore aims to create an ANN model capable of predicting the 3D wave field around permeable submerged breakwaters, by using the algorithm architecture proposed by Ahmadian. To the author’s knowledge there are a limited number of experimental studies on the field of 3D wave transmission of permeable breakwaters and therefore creating an ANN model based on physical measurements is impossible. For this reason a large number of 3D experiments where performed using MIKE21 BW in order to create a database that will then could be used to train and test the ANN model. Important evidence of the significance of diffraction and breakwater permeability on the wave transmission phenomenon for submerged porous breakwaters where obtained. In addition the results of the simulations where then cross validated against the empirical formula provided by Vicinanza et al (2009). This analysis showed that the quality of the data was very good and could be used for training a Neural Network. During this process it was proposed that the empirical prediction formula of Vicinanza could be improved by introducing a correlation factor, as the numerical simulations showed strong evidence that the diffraction and wave transmission over and through the breakwater have a negative correlation. With regards to ANN modeling the algorithm showed that it has an excellent capability to predict the test dataset (obtained from MIKE21 BW simulation). The analysis of the ANN model revealed that the model predictions are in very good agreement with the prediction method of Vicinanza. Finally the sensitivity analysis of implemented showed that the permeability factor introduced to account for the effects of permeability has the most important contribution to the models performance. Concluding this thesis suggests that the proposed model has the potential to become a valuable design tool for engineering purposes in the field of submerged breakwater design.","submerged breakwaters; ANN; wave transmission","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

(mentor); Schoenmaker, R. (mentor); Veeneman, W.W. (mentor); De Jong, S. (mentor)","2013","Inflation is a worldwide phenomenon that influences future investment decisions. Inflation is the devaluation of money, causing a reduction of purchasing power and price level rise. Nobody knows how high inflation will be, and thus price levels in the future a uncertain. In long-term projects with expenses in the future, it is important to take price level development into account. At the beginning of the project an investor wants to know the size of his expenses in the future to be able to estimate the profit of an investment. Inflation rates over the short term can be estimated, but over the long term, estimates introduce a big risk. Too low estimates of price rise result in higher cost than expected, resulting in financially unsuccessful projects. Too high estimates result in an offer that is not competitive. In modern large-scale road infrastructure projects in the Netherlands, Rijkswaterstaat and contractors enter into long-term contracts. These contracts span over 20 to 30 years and include maintenance expenses that are subject to inflation. In order to maximize Value for Money, Rijkswaterstaat relieves the private parties of estimating price level rise during the contract period. This is done by an index formula. The index formula escalates the payments from Rijkswaterstaat according to the price level rise of the expenses of the contractor. Independent organization publicize measurements of the price level at specific points in time. These objective index figures are input for the index formula. But the formula itself is a model and has, inherently, its imperfections. These imperfections originate from the workability of the formula, and cause a mismatch between the extra cost due to price level rise, and extra income due to inflation correction payments. The largest component in the design of the maintenance plan of road infrastructure is the maintenance regime of asphalt. Typically asphalt pavement lasts for 8-10 years, so it must be replaced during the contract period in order to keep the required motorway available. The contractor has a number of possible maintenance regimes to choose from to maintain the required availability. These regimes have a different cashflow and react differently on the imperfection of the index formula and thus have a different mismatch between inflation cost and inflation correction. This research aims on finding out what maintenance regime has the best performance on this mismatch because there is a lack of knowledge of the mismatch between a DBFM project’s inflation cost and its inflation correction payments. Furthermore, the effect of different maintenance plans on this mismatch is unknown as well. The most influential component of the maintenance budget is the pavement resurfacing because of its financial weight, numerous maintenance strategies, planning uncertainty and unstable product prices. It would be valuable to know how the resurfacing strategies perform on inflation correction in different scenario’s. This is important because inflation correction influences the tenderbid as well as the profitability for the private party. When the parties in DBFM projects are more aware of the gap and how it can be influenced, the projects will result in a higher value for money for the government. The research question is: Which resurfacing strategy minimizes the net present value mismatch between inflation correction and actual inflation cost in DBFM road projects in The Netherlands? To answer the research question, four different maintenance regimes are tested in a model simulating six variable price level developments relevant to the maintenance of asphalt. For this price level development simulation, an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) modelling technique is used. Besides the price level simulation, the model varies the timing of the maintenance activities in each calculation. The timing varies according to data of maintenance intervals in existing road sections. The research shows there are two types of mismatches. The first is already taken into account by the private parties in current DBFM projects. This first mismatch can be exposed by means of a deterministic base case. The second mismatch is not yet incorporated in the mismatch, this type is exposed with the probabilistic analysis of this research. The research concludes that the maintenance regime with the best behaving inflation correction is a regime that uses rejuvenating measures to postpone traditional resurfacing peaks. Furthermore, the differences of the mismatch between the maintenance regimes is relevant to the project’s financial success. The choice of maintenance regime has an impact of over 2% of the asphalt maintenance budget. With the understanding of the mismatch in inflation correction, the contractor is better able to mitigate this risk and create an offer with better value for money. This is beneficial to the efficient use of tax money by the government. Even though the index formula allows for this mismatch, the index formula works as well as possible within the constraints of workability.","DBMF; asphalt maintenance regimes; contracts; inflation; Rijkswaterstaat; correction payments; AMIRA; ICCR; NPV","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Construction Management and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Govers, P.C.M. (mentor)","2013","Clients of door-to-door print advertising are facing several trends that challenge their way of working. Due to the economic crisis clients have less money to spend on their marketing activities, which raises the need to spend their money more effectively. Also, consumers are becoming less sensitive to mass communication and are asking for personalisation of the marketing activities that they face. Therefore, clients are looking for ways to better reach their target group and to address these different consumer needs. The main objective of this graduation assignment, is to increase the probability of reaching the target group for the clients and to introduce a new door-to-door product which helps to achieve this objective. The new product should offer the clients the opportunity to better reach their consumers, more effectively and with less waste. For PostNL the product should create added value in order to keep their clients loyal in a competitive market by offering a wide product portfolio, that serves the different client needs. This report elaborates on the development of this new product and the accompanying product strategy. It was found that the probability of reaching the target group can be increased by decreasing the size of the distribution area. PostNL is currently distributing to selected zip code 4 areas, which are based on the first four numbers of a zip code (e.g. 2513). Several solutions were presented of which distribution by delivery round, the round that a mail deliverer walks, proved to be the most viable option for PostNL. This solution will decrease the distribution area from on average 1700 households to 200 households, which will increase the precision of a door-to-door distribution. An operational feasibility study was performed in order to determine what the impact would be on the door-to-door process when delivery round distribution would be introduced. Also, insights into the exact needs and wishes of the clients with regards to door-to-door print advertising were gained through qualitative client research. These two studies showed that delivery round distribution is a viable option to introduce, as the impact will be limited and a need for a new product, that increases the precision of a door-to-door distribution, is present amongst the current clients. The findings from these analyses were used to determine the exact product proposition and the accompanying product strategy. This resulted in the new product proposition, delivery round distribution. Delivery round distribution, is a distribution of door-to-door print advertising to selected delivery rounds and is relevant when combined with demographic segmentation. Two main benefits will be offered to the clients: 1. Effective distribution 2. Lower costs The new product proposition provides added value to the current clients as it increases the probability of reaching the target group against lower costs. For PostNL the new product can help to attract new clients and maintain their current clients, by offering a wide product portfolio which serves the different needs of the clients. The accompanying product strategy shows that delivery round distribution only is relevant for clients that distribute between 50.000 and 2 million door-to-door folders per distribution and that have defined a high or medium specific target group. As different client types were distinguished from the qualitative client research, the further strategy for each client type is described, showing that the client types require a different approach. Two tools were developed, in order to provide the clients with the most relevant product advice. A roadmap was presented as a basis for the further steps that need to be taken in order to introduce the new product and the accompanying product strategy.","PostNL; product strategy; new product proposition; door-to-door print advertising","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Van Dijk, W. (mentor)","2013","This thesis aimed to design and realize an autonomous actuated ankle foot orthosis that - by injecting power around the ankle joint - can increase mobility of patients with walking impairments. Ankle plantarflexion is a good target for adding this extra support because of the isolated boost of power that needs to be generated during push-off which patients often lack. The conceptual phase resulted in a mechanical design that uses an electric motor and ball-screw gear to create a linear actuator that exerts ankle power via a linkage mechanism. A spring was implemented between the actuator and load, by making the output linkage flexible (a leaf spring). To minimize de devices weight, the approach of this thesis was to find the optimal actuation system, which accounts for a significant part of the total weight of the orthosis. This was done by creating a dynamic model of the motor and gear and use it to optimize the parameters of the linkage mechanism and spring for the amount of push-off power supplied to the ankle. Given the optimized actuation system, the rest of the design was designed and created. Doing walking tests with humans was beyond the scope of this thesis, but preliminary tests to assess the device's performance showed that: (1) The mass of the orthosis is 1.5 kg and mass of the backpack is 5.2 kg, (2) The backpack contains a functional joint torque controller, and (3) The device is capable of autonomous operation. With this set of specifications our ankle-foot orthosis is powered, autonomous and the lightest currently build. We hope that further research with our orthosis will increase the quality of life of patients currently living with a walking impairment.","orthosis; PAFO; ankle planterflexion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-06-14","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

The goal is determination of the position of the mobile receiver. The proposed algorithm consists of two localization techniques known from scientific literature: Time Difference of Arrival(TDOA) and Fingerprinting. In this work the choice was made to focus on two following kinds of signals: white noise and human speech. The proposed algorithm has been tested by means of various variables and these experiments have led to the following conclusions: the TDOA part of the algorithm strongly depends on the synchronization between the receivers while the Fingerprinting performs in an optimal manner when a white noise signal is being used as a source. The Fingerprinting part of the proposed algorithm contains four different ways to compare between the audio signal of the database and the audio signal of a real world situation. It appears that the cross - correlation in time domain yields the best results.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2013-08-21","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Bergema, C.P.A.M. (mentor)","2013","This report is commissioned to examine what happens during a class dedicated to the project Designed by Kids (DBK) and to create a design solution that improves these classes. In the project DBK groups from primary school join in a design competition, guided by their teacher. During multiple classes they go through the following steps of the design process: exploration, idea generation, concept development and prototyping. The graduation project consists of literature research, field research and a design phase. The field research consists of observations, interviews and conversations with experts, and is focused on the participating teachers. The results of this research show that most teachers are afraid for their group to get out of control when dedicating a class to the project DBK. When the students start to show misbehaviour the teacher becomes less able to improvise because of a lack of background knowledge in the subject. He also becomes less flexible and when the chance for achieving the goal of the class decreases, the teacher often chooses to skip the method and/or to hold on to a strict structure. The chance decreases when the students start to misbehave. The structure the teacher holds on to is in contrast to what is recommended for a the setting of a creative session. Further investigation reveals that this undesired behaviour is due to misfitting interventions between the teacher and students, which leads to misunderstanding about what is expected from each other during the class. This is seen most in classes that are dedicated to the idea generation phase of the project DBK. The misfitting interventions occur when the design methods the teacher explains to the group do not fit with the common setting and rules of the classroom. The design goal for the design solution is based on this problem: design a tool that assists the teacher in selecting fitting methods for his group when preparing a class for the project Designed by Kids. The created design is an application for a smartphone that facilitates the teacher’s preparation for classes of the project DBK. The proposal is that the Wetenschapsknooppunt Delft and Meeple (the companies that provide the project DBK) provide the participating teachers with this application because it can help and develop them in linking design methods to their group. The design is evaluated in a consumer test. The result is positive as the teacher noted to be willing to use the tool, but one remark remains: the application should not extend the preparation-time for the class. With the application the teacher can find a design method that fits the context of his classroom by ranking his group on three scales. The combination of the rankings on these scales form the common context. The scales are based on the field research and literature of Ekvall about the ideal creative climate [Ekvall, Waldenstrom-Lindbad and Arvonen, 1983]: 1. The students’ understanding on the design process and methods 2. The emotional safety of the students in the group 3. The students’ ability to create and share individual thoughts After ranking his group on these scales, the application shows which design methods best fit his group in form of a tuning guide, as is done in the Netherlands with the “Kieswijzer” when finding out which political part best fits your preferences. The teacher can select the one he prefers. This can improve the teacher’s class as the teacher’s flexibility is not decreased because of misbehavior deriving from a misfit between the design method and the context of the group. After each class the teacher can evaluate his class and look back to these evaluations. When doing so, he reflects on his own ability to predict which design methods fit his group and can see if the students are developing on the scales. When this latter is the case, the students are learning about design and creativity. This is one of the teacher’s objectives for joining the project DBK. They can thus find out if they are achieving the objective set for the group. This also enables the teacher’s own development of design experience, increasing his confidence in teacher the matter and thus his ability to be flexible and improvise.","education; primary school; creative session; design experience; confidence in teaching; creative climate","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2013","Since the beginning of the container era in the middle of the last century, the containerization is growing. Nowadays more than 90 percent of the world's non-bulk cargo is being transported in a container. With many shipping liners deploying container vessels on the world seas, the competition is strong. Therefore the need to lower the price per container has resulted in the development of vessels with increasing sizes. Continuing on cost reduction, shipping lines tend to make fewer port calls with their vessels. Consequently the call sizes, i.e. the number of containers that have to be unloaded and loaded per vessel in a port, will increase. Because of the competition between harbours and container terminals, terminal operators are forced to handle container vessels as fast as possible while reducing the operational costs. Especially in high labour regions, the labour costs are a large part of the operational costs of container terminals. Accordingly, in 1993, automation in container terminals has been introduced at ECT's Delta terminal in Rotterdam in order to reduce the operational costs. Nowadays there are several (semi-) automated container terminals worldwide and currently there are four in the planning stage. In the first automated container terminals automated guided vehicles (AGVs) were used for the supply and discharge of containers at the quay cranes. Because the realized quay crane productivities were lower than the theoretical ones, and this is partly caused by the transportation vehicles, other vehicles such as the Lift-AGV (L-AGV) and the automated shuttle carrier (AShC), were developed. In this research a comparison is made between several state-of-the-art automated vehicles to find out which is the best performing vehicle type. The characteristics of the investigated automated vehicles are elaborated to gain insight in the possibilities of the vehicles. These characteristics are inuencing the behaviour of the automated vehicles in container terminals. Whether or not the interchange between the stack or quay cranes is linked and what the vehicles manoeuvrability is. Due to the complexity of the system a simulation model should assist in answering the research questions. Taking into account the requirements, a simulation model has been set up using the simulation library of TBA. A benchmark model has been defined using the dimensions of automated container terminals which are currently being build of already exist. For each type of vehicle, terminal layouts are designed within the benchmark model. The design of these layouts largely depend on the size of the vehicle and the manoeuvrability, which manoeuvres can it perform and how much space is needed. An implementation for each type of vehicle and each terminal layout has been made in the model. Several peak scenarios with a varying number of vehicles has been performed in order to obtain results which assist in answering the research questions. The output of the model is also used to gain more insight in the behaviour of the different vehicle types. The results must also contribute to the validation of the model. Considering the quay crane productivities, it can be concluded that according to the results of the performed experiments the L-AGV is the best performing vehicle, however the differences with the other vehicles are not very large. This result deviates from the expectation, which can be explained using the generated output of the simulation. However the use of another type of quay crane could be beneficial for other vehicle types.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-10-04","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

(mentor); Van den Bos, J.P. (mentor); Zijlema, M. (mentor); Van Baaren, P.F.J. (mentor); Hofland, B. (mentor)","2013","Pipeline covers on the seabed are called near-bed structures which are generally made of rip rap. The crest height of a near-bed structure is such that waves do not break over it. Near-bed structures are used to protect pipelines against fishing equipment, ship anchors, dropped objects and preventing destabilizing of the pipeline. There are two ways of designing a near-bed structure. The first is to design a stable construction given the design conditions present in the lifetime of the structure. The second approach is to allow some damage during the lifetime of the structure, and is the approach which this research focuses on. Presently the Rock Manual advises to use a formula from Wallast and Van Gent [2002] to describe the damage development during a storm. In this formula the damage development in time is forced to a dependency found by Van der Meer [1988]. It is unknown if this time dependency based on the number of waves is valid for damage development with near-bed structures. Besides this, the way to include cumulative damage for several subsequent storm conditions is presently calculated as a first approximation with a method from Van der Meer [1999] designed for breakwaters. It is not verified that this method can also be applied for near-bed structures. The goal of this research is to determine the actual relation between damage and time, and to investigate the cumulative damage development for near-bed structures in multiple storm events. To answer the research questions which have been made from these goals, an investigation is performed which makes use of physical scale model testing. Tests are performed in the Environmental Fluid Mechanic Laboratory at Delft University of Technology. After the execution of the model tests, an extensive analysis is performed based on the results of the scale model tests and results of previous research from Lomónaco [1994], Wallast and Van Gent [2002], Saers [2005], Van den Bos [2006] and Tørum et al. [2008]. The analysis concluded that there is not 'one' parameter as assumed so far to describe the relation between damage to near-bed structures and the number of waves. This parameter is thought to be depended on wave height, water depth, stone size and actual damage that occurs after a certain time. Besides this, the damage development did not reach an equilibrium in time with a large number of waves, which was assumed to be the case in other research. The average value for the exponent which describes the relation between the number of waves and damage is used in this thesis. With this relation and more data a new and improved damage prediction formula is investigated. The new prediction found in this thesis calculates the damage to a higher degree of accuracy with less variation present. It includes more parameters than the current prediction formula from Wallast and Van Gent. The extra parameters in this formula are the relative width, structure slope and Keulegan-Carpenter number. The method to include cumulative damage for multiple storm events from Van der Meer was proven to be usable by using the formulas found in this research. An important conclusion from these tests is that damage development stops or reduces to a large degree when a low wave condition passes the near-bed structure when a high condition is already imposed to the near-bed structure.","near-bed structure; pipeline cover; waves; damage; cumulative damage; model tests; design formula","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Jahr, H. (mentor); Zadpoor, A.A. (mentor)","2013","Objective: Due to avascularity, chondrocytes have poor ability to regenerate themselves which is challanging for tissue engineering to achieve full functioning cartilage. Culturing chondrocytes or cartilage tissue has been frequently perfomed by using atmospheric oxygen tensions which is hyperoxic compared to nature of healthy cartilage. Implementing hypoxia as culturing condition closely mimics the environment of native cartilage. Not only culturing conditions, but also the cellular mechanisms such as TGF-? signaling is essential to study the regulations of cellular activities of chondrocytes. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of hypoxia on both chondrogenic markers and TGF-? signaling in human osteoarthritic chondrocytes. Methods: Osteoarthritic human articular chondrocytes were cultured in alginate beads in a microbioreactor for 48 hours. Hypoxic oxygen tension (1% pO2) and 20% pO2 (control) was used as experimental conditions. Gene expression levels of hypoxia targets, chondrogenic markers, and TGF-beta signaling were determined by quantitative RT-PCR. Results: Chondrocytes cultured under hypoxic condition showed upregulation of both chondrogenic markers and hypoxia targets which is an indication for good adaptation of chondrocytes to hypoxia. Gene expressions of crucial molecules of TGF-beta signaling was enhanced by hypoxia. Conclusion: Hypoxia enhances chondrogenic markers and expression of major components of TGF-? signaling in 3D culture of osteoarthritic human chondrocytes. Targeting specific components of TGF-? signaling under hypoxic conditions may represent a suitable therapeutic strategy for the treatment of osteoarthritis.","Chondrocyte; Hypoxia; TGF-?; Osteoarthritis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-10-03","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

(mentor); Pasman, G.J. (mentor); Van Kuijk, J.I. (mentor)","2013","Problem Statement The most standard used process for developing software is currently Agile. Agile splits up the design process in so called two week “sprints” thereby making this process fast and efficient for developers. But current methods of usertesting don’t fit with this fast-paced process as, they are time consuming and too extensive. Therefore results from the user tests become mostly “out-dated” and irrelevant for teams. The same was the case at IceMobile, which is Holland’s largest mobile application producer, who developed award winning applications such as the Albert Heijn and the ABN AMBRO application. IceMobile shifted from an agency model to developing own products for the retail sector, making IceMobile responsible for the quality of the user experience (UX) of their products. Having a usertesting process that fitted with their Agile process became important An empirical study was performed with two product teams, which showed developers having little knowledge about and empathy for their users. Result My proposal for IceMobile are the Flags sessions, containing a frequent process where the teams of IceMobile collaboratively analyse and evaluate the feedback of the user, by watching the interview of the UXlab via a live stream connection. With an effective way of clustering all insights and a fast interview process, the whole session only takes 1,5 hour over two days for the whole team. By frequently conducting flag sessions every sprint, the team builds up knowledge, creates more empathy, which makes results become more reliable. The sessions are flexible and take minimum amount of time, making them fit well with the Agile process of IceMobile. The Flag sessions will involve the team in the usertests, thereby reducing the time of the usertesting process while increasing empathy for the user by the team. Therefore the team comes out of the sessions with more inspiration and motivation to change or develop new features for the user.","Agile; UX; software; usertesting; usertest; developers; app; mobile; research; Scrum; user experience; empathy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design for Interaction","","Final Master Project","",""

Next to flood risk the Itajaí area is also prone to erosion problems during high discharges. Next to these extreme events sedimentation and salt intrusion occur as a daily issue. A proposed solution is implementing a bypass to divert water from the river straight to sea. This thesis describes the impact on the main processes when this implementation is done. Research During the research phase 4 aspects are investigated: Flood risk, erosion, sedimentation and salt intrusion. This is done with Delft3D to investigate the different processes and to be able to look at the effect that these processes have on each other in the current and future situation. For flood risk it was found that a bypass that connects just upstream of Itajaí to the Itajaí-Açu has a very strong effect. It can lower the water levels during extreme events significantly by diverting a large portion through the bypass. For erosion it was found that flow velocities decrease significantly as well. However the good results regarding erosion will have a negative effect on the sedimentation issues which will be discussed later on. Flow diversion is a straightforward solution for erosion as it lowers flow velocities in the current branch. This only has effect downstream of the bifurcation point. For sedimentation it is found that the bypass cripples the tidal flow as the tidal prism only slightly increases due to lowered resistance in the downstream section (bypass and current branch). The capacity of the downstream section is a much larger increase compared to the current branch only than the increase of the tidal prism. Hence the tidal flow diminishes in the downstream section. As tide is the main mobilizer of sediment severe accretion will occur. For salt intrusion the low flow velocities will allow deeper intrusion. Also a landward forcing by density difference between fresh and salt water will force salt water to flow upstream in the current branch. Conclusions The bypass is a good solution if it can be closed during day to day conditions to prevent sedimentation and increased salt intrusion. It only needs to be opened during extreme events. However the total result in that scenario is a strong improvement compared to the financial and human losses that occur once or twice a decade in the current situation.","Coastal; Bypass; Itajai; Brazil; flood risk; sedimentation; erosion; salt intrusion; salinization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Naastepad, C.W.M. (mentor); Mulder, K.F. (mentor)","2013","Water shortage is a major problem affecting certain areas of the planet. Almost 15% of the world’s population has not access to clean water and water demand is expected to double in the next twenty years. Over the past few years, a shift towards renewable energy technologies is observed. Rising energy prices, fossil fuel scarcity and increasing environmental awareness reinforce the shift towards the integration of renewable energy technologies in desalination systems. Greece is currently facing a challenge in terms of maintaining water demand and supply in balance. In the context of this thesis, the presence of a potential regarding the development of renewable driven desalination systems in Greece is investigated. In addition, a Cost-Benefit analysis is conducted in order to evaluate under which circumstances renewable driven desalination system can be financially attractive compared to other fresh water production technologies. In order to evaluate the presence of a potential of the examined innovative technology, the Functions of Innovation Systems (FIS) approach was selected and implemented. The aforementioned approach suggests that there is a set of seven functions that have a direct effect on the build-up of a technological innovation system and should be examined in order to assess its potential. These functions are: Entrepreneurial activities, Knowledge development, Knowledge diffusion through networks, Guidance of the search, Market formation, Resource Mobilization and Creation of legitimacy. The analysis based on the FIS approach revealed that the majority of the examined functions are sufficiently served, meaning that Greece is indeed suitable for the implementation of renewable driven desalination systems. However, areas in which improvements are needed were also identified through this analysis. In more detail, inadequacies were identified in Function 4, since no specific goals are set for the development of the examined technology by the Greek government. In addition, the fact that there is not a specific legislative framework exclusively for renewable driven desalination units acts to the detriment of the technology, making the licensing procedure complicated and time consuming. The limited funds provided by the Greek government for R&D, the low FDI and the uncertainty regarding future provision of other financial incentives by the government do not stimulate further the development of the examined technology. The significant variations among the different geographical districts in terms of water resources availability, existing water supply methods, water needs and water prices, imply that a unified approach regarding the evaluation of the financial feasibility of renewable driven desalination systems in Greece is difficult; hence, zooming in a specific region seemed necessary. For this reason, an initial selection among the fourteen main geographical districts of Greece was performed. The criteria that were taken into account are water scarcity, level of tourism activity, average water price, wind and solar energy potential. The islands located in the Southern Aegean Sea, namely Cyclades islands, fulfill the set of the aforementioned criteria. In order to select a specific island among the eighteen islands located in the selected region a more thorough multi-criteria analysis was conducted. The criteria that were taken into account are water price, electricity production cost, level of tourism intensity, predicted water deficit, precipitation, quantity of transported water, percentage of water supply already covered by desalination, average annual solar radiation and average annual wind speed. The multi-criteria analysis led to the selection of Sifnos Island. The results of the CBA indicated that, taking the perspective of a private investor, conventional desalination systems still constitute a more attractive choice in financial terms, implying that the lower initial investment in such systems outweighs their higher annual operational costs. However, these results proved to be sensitive in terms of the discount rate, the salvage value and the electricity tariff. As far as the theories used are concerned, both the FIS approach and the Cost-Benefit analysis proved to be quite straightforward to implement. The integration of international indicators added value in the FIS analysis; an overlap in the content of certain functions was, however, identified. In addition, the indicators of function 7, identified in the literature, were characterized vague. Based on the above, theory recommendations are made in the final Chapter of this thesis. Apart from theory recommendations, the outcomes of the study formed the basis for policy and managerial recommendations. In more detail, the Greek government should formulate specific goals regarding the penetration of renewable energy technologies in fresh water production while simplifying the current time-consuming licensing procedure. In addition, the government should focus on attracting FDI. In order to maintain the high level in terms of research activities, Greek universities and research institutes should continue attracting European funds for this purpose. Finally, the Greek government should support young engineers and other professionals who are currently seeking job opportunities and provide incentives to entrepreneurs in the field of renewable energy technologies in order to stimulate not only the examined field but also the Greek economy. In order to attract investors, private companies should also examine systems of co-production of fresh water and energy in order to generate higher benefits by selling the excess of solar and wind energy to the Public Power Corporation. In addition, since the results of the CBA proved to be sensitive in terms of the electricity tariff, private companies should consider as clients not only private investors, but also public entities, such as municipalities.","renewable driven desalination; Functions of Innovation Systems; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Greece","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2015-10-03","Technology, Policy and Management","Department of Technology, Dynamics and Sustainable Development","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor); Jelinek, F. (mentor)","2013","The field of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is calling for steerable mechanisms to increase the functionality and versatility of the contemporary instruments. Since reusable steerable instruments cannot pass the sterilization regulations, disposable instruments could solve the cleaning problem. In order to be cost-competitive, a cheap production process like injection molding should be used to produce disposable tips. The goal of this study was to design a torsion stiff injection moldable disposable tip for laparoscopic instruments, which can steer 60° in all directions. Flexures were chosen to serve as joints for the new design, named MoldTip, because in this way the number of parts can be reduced, which is beneficial for the price of the tip. The flexures need also to guide the cables, therefore the tip is divided in two parts – the core and the sleeve, which could be injection molded. The parts could be injection molded by a mold with two moving inserts. A torsion stiff instrument was achieved by having a core made of polyetherimide (PEI) and a sleeve made of polycarbonate (PC). The torsion stiffness of the MoldTip (790 Nmm/rad) increased almost by a factor 8 with respect to a state-of-the-art disposable steerable instrument of CambridgeEndo (103 Nmm/rad). The cost of this improvement is that the bending stiffness increased by a factor 2, which means that more effort has to be made to steer the instrument. The MoldTip is torsion stiff, can be injection molded, and can steer 60° in all directions. With the MoldTip a promising direction in the development of steerable instruments is opened.","disposable instrument; steerable instrument; laparoscopy; minimally invasive surgery; injection molding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-10-16","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

(mentor); Molenbroek, J.F.M. (mentor)","2013","This master thesis shows the process and results of the design project ‘Tic Tac Tiles - An interactive activity unit for children in the Playscape’ Introduction At this moment the therapists of the Child Development and Exercise Centre of the Wilhelmina Children’s Hospital have problems to motivate the older children (9-15 years) to exercise, since the Playscape (training hall) is too childish. The goal of the project is to motivate children through an interactive solution to become active and to offer the therapists a way to observe, analyse and train the skills of the child. Context The current context that copes with the above mentioned problem is the Child Development and Exercise Centre of the Wilhelmina Children’s Hospital (Utrecht). In the Playscape children will have therapy. The purpose of the space is ‘Inviting children to move in a spontaneous and natural way and offer the possibility to train’. At this moment that purpose is not achieved. With the new product this purpose should be achieved. Activities that therapists would like to see during therapy are jumping, running, crawling, turning, balance, walking, climbing, leaning on arms, throwing, catching, hopping, standing up and cycling. Furthermore functional activities are getting more important. The biggest problem during therapy is the motivation of the children. Users The users of the new product are the (physio)therapists and the children. The focus in this project is on children in the age of 9-15 years with different diseases. This is a quite broad target group and for the new product it is important to take the physical and mental conditions into account. Furthermore the individual preferences of the children should be taken into account. The children in the age of 9-15 years would like to do hockey, soccer, shooting games, car games and dancing games. Gaming In this case gaming is an interesting solution direction, since the aspects of therapy and gaming complement each other. The aspects that can be seen both in therapy as in games are: motivation, adaptability, individual level, intensity and continuous feedback. Vision The vision for the idea generation phase is: “The product has to motivate children from 9 till 15 years, to move in a spontaneous and natural way and to train their fitness and/or muscles in the Playscape by means of a variety of active video games. Competition, challenges and rewards in the games let the child immerse in the game. It is important that the game can be adjusted to the preferences and the physical condition of the child.” Idea generation During the idea generation and the idea selection phase an iterative process took place. The idea generation techniques were alternated with idea selection techniques. During a selection session 29 children of 12-13 years old gave their opinion on some ideas. With a creative session at IDE many ideas were generated. Selection sheets were used to select the ideas based on criteria. Finally a selection session at the Wilhelmina Children’s Hospital took place. With a few ideas left the therapist and children could give their opinion. The ideas of Dance Hero, Lasergame and Sports were chosen to develop further. Concepts With the input from the users, inspiration from the current active gaming market and mock-up testing the three ideas were further developed into concepts. The three concepts are Dance Hero, Lasergame and Soccer wall. Dance Hero is an intensive dancing game. Especially girls like this game. The downside of this concept is that many games like Dance Hero already do exist and that with Dance Hero the game is connected to the patented Guitar which can give problems. Lasergame is a game that focuses on the exploration of motor skills. The downside of Lasergame is that it is not intensive like the therapists prefer. Furthermore the dimming of the lights gives problems. The last concept of Soccer wall is an intensive game in which many sports are possible. Especially boys like this game. With all the input from the children and therapists the concept that will be developed is Soccer wall. This concept offers a lot of variety for the huge target group. Final Design The final design is Tic Tac Tiles, a movable wall with 36 interactive tiles connected to it. These tiles can be used as a wall and as a floor. The tiles respond to pressure and give feedback by changing the colours of the lights. In that way 12 different games can be played. Tic Tac Tiles can be used with different balls, rackets and sticks, but also by jumping and hitting. Prototype To test the feasibility of Tic Tac Tiles a prototype of four functional tiles is built. During the prototyping many insights in the technical details of the tiles could be gathered. User test The desirability of the Tic Tac Tiles is tested with a prototype at the open day of the Wilhelmina Children’s Hospital. The children like the Tic Tac Tiles a lot and would like to see it in the hospital. The intensity of movement while playing with the prototype was high enough to be considered as training. Recommendations For the future development a manufacturer is needed that has interest in producing Tic Tac Tiles. Wilhelmina Children´s Hospital will purchase and test the first Tic Tac Tiles, so further improvements can be done. At this moment it is important to continue with the current sponsor project and to start new sponsor project to finance the future development. Furthermore it is important that the therapists get familiar with games in general and Tic Tac Tiles. In that way they know how this can be implemented in the therapy. With the Tic Tac Tiles the older children can be motivated to exercise in a fun way.","design; medical; interactive; children; movement; motivation; Tic Tac Tiles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor); Kolstein, M.H. (mentor)","2013","Low cycle corrosion fatigue is an interesting issue in civil Engineering because it may effect the lifetime of structures in negative and unexpected ways. However, analysis of design codes has revealed that low cycle corrosion fatigue is not a major issue in the design of offshore structures because these structures are designed with a global elastic philosophy. This means that the number of cycles that a structure can withstand usually stays well within the high cycle range. The joints ( welded or otherwise ) revealed to be the less resistant elements to low cycle corrosion fatigue. Furthermore, it was revealed that in the ultra low cycle region the effect of the environment is heavily reduced. It was also revealed that the effect of cathodic protection is strongest in the upper spectrum of the high cycle range and deteriorates in the lower spectrum of the high cycle range. It was also revealed that a structure in air and a structure in seawater with cathodic protection have essentially the same fatigue resistance when in the ultra low cycle range. In the ultra low cycle range, the problem appears to turns into mostly a low cycle fatigue problem. In the ultra high cycle region the problem appears to turns into mostly a corrosion problem. S-N curves that can predict the low cycle fatigue life of structures in a deleterious environment are very rare. The only S-N curve available that can be used for structural steel subjected to low cycle corrosion fatigue is one for tubular sections. However, Mathematical modeling based on regression and a principle of constant slopes in a fatigue cycle region ( low cycle, high cycle, ultra high cycle ) has made it possible to not only calculate the low cycle corrosion fatigue life of tubular joints but the low cycle corrosion fatigue life of other types of joints as well.","Fatigue; Low Cycle; Environmental Cracking; Low Cycle Fatigue; Low Cycle Corrosion Fatigue; North Sea","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-11-08","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural and Building Engineering","",""

The largest river in the area, the Huong river, flows through the city of Hue and is used for fishery, tourism, sand mining, sewage system and trashcan. The city of Hue is a touristic city and holds an old Imperial City, a quite old sewage system and a lot of agricultural activity in the surroundings, especially the rice paddies around and the fishery in the Cau Hai lagoon. Due to the short distance between mountains and coast, in combination with a distinct wet and dry season and high average precipitation rates, a lot of challenges concerning water related problems can be identified in the Hue area. For the Water Resources University in Hanoi 22 of those problems (cases) are indicated, to provide future students a topic for their graduation work and presented in the Cases Report by this project group. The selection of cases is performed by talking to different experts in the fields of Disaster Management, Coastal Engineering and Water Management; talking to students of the university and by visiting the actual project area. In this field visit most of the case locations are visited to get a better view on the current state of the problem. All observations are stated in the Field Work Report of this project group. Although the cases are presented as individual problems, a lot of relations between the problems exist e.g. salt intrusion is influenced by reservoir regulation, while the stability of the inlets is related to the sediment balance of the area. These relations are used to emphasize the need for an integral and multidisciplinary approach towards the individual cases: every proposed solution needs to take into account the impact on other processes in the area. The cases 'Reservoirs and Dams' and 'Stability of the Thuan An inlet' are elaborated to function as a reference for future students, by applying the steps of the Engineering Process. There are four major dams in the area around the city of Hue, each with their own regulation scheme. Another dam, the Ta Trach dam, is currently being constructed. The Binh Dien dam, which is already in operation since 2009, and the Ta Trach dam have a major influence on the upstream discharge of the Huong river and require complex regulation schemes. This is enhanced due to the parallel positon of the dams: they are located in two different branches of the Huong river. The problems are complex due to conflicting interests from several stakeholders: most reservoirs are used for waterpower generation, which conflicts with for example flood control and water supply purposes. In 2009 this conflicting interests led to a severe flooding in Hue, when the Binh Dien reservoir needed emergency discharges to reassure the safety of the dam itself. In this research four main functions have been assigned to the Binh Dien and Ta Trach dams; hydropower generation, flood control, water supply and regulation of salt intrusion in the Huong river mouth. From these functions several requirements regarding the reservoir discharge over time have been obtained from a literature study. The requirements have been applied to both dams in different scenarios, after which some general conclusions could be stated. It appeared that the Binh Dien cannot fulfil the requirements on its own, but that with the future Ta Trach dam in operation enough capacity will be available for the water supply and salt intrusion requirements. With the combined reservoirs even more hydropower could be generated than currently without the Ta Trach dam. However, the flood control requirement appears to have major conflicts with respect to other main function requirements, and will be difficult to properly implement in reality without making concessions in the other functions. In history, the Thuan An inlet has always been a morphologically active inlet, with several openings and closures. The coast surrounding the inlet is a wave dominated coast; and while the inlet is accreting during dry season, it 'flushes' during the wet season. In 2012 several breakwaters and jetties have been built to stabilize the inlet, with limited success due to bad placement of the structures as a whole and failing armour units. For this case the stabilizing criteria are based on the guarantee that a CEMT III class vessel can navigate through the inlet for the coming 30 years. Three solutions are proposed: dredging, extending the current south breakwater and a combination of the previous two. To assess the solutions use is made of the process based model Delft3D. The grid of the model is provided by Lam (2007), and by applying wave- and wind conditions, sediment concentrations and discharge characteristics, a prediction towards the future behaviour could be made. To reduce the time to run the model to one overnight computation, input reduction and morphological factors are applied. From the scenarios dredging seems to be the most appropriate solution, in which the maximum dredging interval (before the inlet becomes unnavigable) is 3 years. Beside the fact that dredging does not need new construction works, it is also the most flexible towards extreme accretion due to extreme weather events. This last reason lead to an advised dredging interval of one year, although the total amount of dredged material in 30 years is larger than dredging every 3 years (17.7 Mm3 versus 13.8 Mm3), it provides the highest flexibility. However, before implementing the solution further research should be performed by improving the quality and accuracy of the model. This is possible by reducing the input reduction, apply a lower morphological factor and by doing longer computations in order to oversee the full effects. Finally, the applied model used a too coarse grid near the shoreline to analyse the precise effects on the coastal area, therefore the grid size near the shore should be reduced.","Hue; coastal zone management; water management; disaster management; intgrated water resources management; reservoirs; coastal erosion","en","student report","TU Delft, Department Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

This was done using Iquique in the north of Chile as a case study. Solutions for improvement of current practice have been searched within specific activity areas of hazard management: prediction, mitigation and response. Prediction concerns the available intelligence on the chance of occurrence and the related force of the tsunami event. For this, earthquake (and resulting tsunami) scenarios have been defined and modeled with NeoWave in order to establish probable boundary conditions for the rest of the research. A scenario based on the conditions described by [Chlieh et al., 2011b], with a Mw. 8.8, turned out to have the worst results (runup of 12m max, inundation of almost 10m max, and arrival time less than 12 min). Based on these results estimations have been made of the number of people at risk and economic damage. The number of people at risk was derived from zonal data from [SINTIA, 2010] and resulted in at least 12,500 people living in inundated areas. Direct economic damage was derived using fragility curves [Mas et al., 2012b] and building value estimations [Blong, 2001], and resulted in 14:90M damage in an Iquique downtown area and 142M damage in the Zofri shopping mall area. For mitigation of tsunami effects, prevention of the tsunami event (e.g. by means of breakwaters) has not been taken into account. Focus has been on city evacuation, possible slope failures of infrastructure, and possibilities of vertical evacuation. For city evacuation remarkable differences between inundation maps from SHOA, ONEMI, the Municipality of Iquique, and our model results were indicated, from which the cause is not clear. An optimistic calculation on evacuation possibilities of the Zofri shopping mall has shown that only 6,000 people (from 10,000 people present during peak hour) could escape. A slope failure analysis of the main exit from the Zofri area and the highway A16 has indicated that both slopes are instable. Additional geo analyses pointed out that safety zones in higher grounds are stable, that there's a lack of knowledge on liquefaction of quaywalls (which could be troublesome for port evacuation routes), and that scouring of sidewalks is likely (however it will not occur during evacuation). An initial analysis on high buildings in Iquique resulted in 56 buildings that have been examined for vertical evacuation and two areas that lack any possibilities for vertical evacuation (Zofri and the port). An hydraulic load analysis has been done, based on both NeoWave model results and analytical approach. After a comparative stability analysis with available criteria for seismic loads, 21 buildings in Iquique were marked as suitable for vertical evacuation.","Tsunami; earthquake; mitigation","en","student report","TU Delft, Departments Hydraulic Engineering - Geoscience & Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering - Hydraulic Engineering","","","","-20.216875, -70.152341"

The many destinations with each their own regulations of customs and governments can make the distribution of goods sometimes very difficult. Distribution of non fresh catering products happens via the central warehouse at Schiphol Noord. More than a hundred vendors supply different products to the warehouse, these products are then used in aircraft departing from Schiphol Airport or for distribution to one of the outstations of KLM. For flights within Europe the aircraft are loaded for the outbound flights as well as for the homebound flights, so there is no need to load the aircraft at the destinations. For flights from Schiphol to a destination outside of Europe, the catering articles for the homebound flight are loaded at the outstation. This requires a local stock of articles at the outstations, which is provided by periodic shipments with sea vessels. Loading these vessels happens at Schiphol in a central warehouse. When articles are temporary out of stock at the central warehouse at Schiphol when they need to be loaded in a vessel, the articles are usually transported by airfreight at a later moment or they are temporary out of stock at the outstation which results in the fact that they cannot be loaded onboard of flights. So when articles are not available for flights that depart from Schiphol, the result will almost immediately be that these products are not onboard. Shortly, when products are not available at the central warehouse at Schiphol when needed, it will result in high costs(air freight is significantly more expensive then sea freight) or unavailability of these products onboard.
