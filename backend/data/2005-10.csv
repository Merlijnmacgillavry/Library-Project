(mentor); Alderliesten, R.C. (mentor); Homan, J.J. (mentor)","2005","The fatigue life of an aircraft is dependent on the loads of the aircraft service spectrum. Due to the variable nature of the load spectrum, fatigue crack growth is accelerated and decelerated by interaction effects. Interaction effects, like crack closure, make an accurate prediction of the fatigue life challenging. The material GLARE, a laminate built up of aluminium and glass fibre layers, is used in the fuselage of the Airbus A380. Fatigue crack propagation is the dominant part of the fatigue life of GLARE structures. For GLARE, crack closure is thought to be a significant interaction effect and is not yet investigated for GLARE. In this thesis crack closure in GLARE is investigated. The study limits itself to crack growth in simple coupon specimens with through cracks, loaded in the longitudinal direction in a lab air environment at room temperature. The investigation started with a literature study on fatigue, interaction effects, crack closure, and load variations in both metals and GLARE. A test plan is proposed and executed from which the test results are analysed and conclusions drawn. Crack closure is the result of crack tip plastic deformation. As the crack propagates, plastic deformation comes in the wake and closes the crack. This reduces the effective stress range and consequently the crack growth rate. Load variations in CA cycles lead to a crack growth acceleration or decelerations that can be partly explained by crack closure. For two stress level sequences, the crack growth rate acceleration or deceleration can be explained by crack closure and compatibility of the crack front geometry. Crack growth in GLARE is a self-balancing mechanism with delamination growth between the aluminium- and fibre layers. The fibres “bridge” the crack by leading the stresses through it. This results in an approximately constant stress intensity factor and crack growth rate for long ranges of crack lengths. Crack closure in GLARE is investigated with two tests series:  CA fatigue tests with determination of the crack opening stress for various stress ratios. These tests are duplicated for different aluminium sheet thickness, lay-up and maximum stress levels.  CA fatigue tests with simple load variations and two stress level sequences. The course of the crack opening stress and crack growth rate are monitored for (multiple) overloads, underloads, combinations of these and for low-high and low-high stress level sequences. The load variation tests are duplicated for different magnitudes of the maximum/minimum stress. Also the delaminations are investigated at different stages in the load history. The tests results of the CA fatigue tests proved that crack closure in standard GLARE can be described with the crack closure correction proposed by Schijve for aluminium 2024-T3. Crack growth in GLARE loaded under CA, can be calculated with the relation of Schijve with the stress ratio in the aluminium layers (excl. curing stresses) multiplied with a stress ratio correction and new constants C and n for the Paris region. In the load variations tests with overloads, the behaviour of the crack growth rate after a load variation is comparable to aluminium. An underload does not cause crack growth acceleration, different to what is seen aluminium. The crack growth retardation after an under-/overload combination was comparable to the crack growth retardation after an over-/underload combination and a single overload. Low-high and high-low stress level sequences in GLARE gave similar effects on the crack growth rate as what can be seen aluminium. This is the result of a temporal change of the effective stress range.","fatigue; crack growth; interaction effects; crack closure; Fiber Metal Laminates; GLARE","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Mechanics, Aerospace Structures & Materials","","","",""

De opgave voor een kleine gemeente, met zijn beperktere gemeentelijke apparaat, minder ervaring en beperkte invloed is dus des te uitdagende. Voor dit soort opgaven wordt procesmanagement vaak toegepast om de opgave tot een goed einde te brengen. In het uitgevoerde onderzoek wordt middels een multiple case studie gericht gekeken hoe de ontwerptheorieën (elementen) van het procesmanagement in de praktijk worden toegepast bij stationsontwikkelingen binnen een kleine gemeente. Hierbij zijn de ontwerpelementen op het gebied van openheid, veiligheid, voortgang en inhoud toegepast als conceptuele bril van het onderzoek. Naast het gericht kijken naar voorgenoemde ontwerpelementen is ook gekeken naar andere organisatorische en management aspecten die een rol hebben gespeeld ten aanzien van het managementproces en de beoogde stations(her)ontwikkeling. Hierbij valt bijvoorbeeld te noemen de invloed van het dualisme op een dergelijk proces. Op basis van de onderzoeksresultaten zijn conclusies getrokken ten aanzien van het toepassen van procesmanagement bij stations(her)ontwikkelingen binnen kleine gemeenten.

(mentor); Hoogendoorn, S.P. (mentor); Wiggenraad, P.B.L. (mentor); Horstmeier, T.H.W. (mentor); Kerridge, J. (mentor); Bovy, P.H.L. (mentor)","2005","This report studies walking and travel choice behavior of pedestrians concerning stairways and escalators in public transport facilities. With respect to walking behavior of pedestrians, we focus on deriving traffic characteristics such as free speeds and fundamental diagrams of pedestrian flows. Bi-linear models are hypothesized for the speed-density relationships of pedestrian traffic on stairways and escalators. In regard to travel choice behavior of pedestrians, two types of choice behavior are discussed: the first one considers the selection between available stairways and escalators to facilitate level changes; the second one concerns the choice between walking and standing on escalators. To calibrate our hypothesized walking and choice models, observations were conducted in the NS intercity train station of Den Haag Holland Spoor on the 1st of June, 2005 (Wednesday) with a combined technique of infrared detectors and video cameras. 6 infrared detectors were installed to observe trajectories of individual pedestrians while 2 video cameras were used to observe personal characteristics such as gender and age of passengers. Observation data from these two sources will be jointed to allow analysis of pedestrian behavior taking into account their personal characteristics. The observations lasted for a period of 3.5 hours without interruption (15:40~19:10). However, no congestion had been observed. Prior to utilizing the infrared and video data for analysis, some preparatory works had been performed. These preparatory works include:  Convert infrared trajectory data from “pixel” to “cm”, which involves correction for both lens and perspective distortion;  Match split trajectories within one field of view (infrared detector);  Combine infrared trajectory data and personal characteristics read from video films;  Correct (infrared) flow data based on video reading. Our analysis of free speeds show that free speeds are influenced by directions of movement, types of infrastructure, and personal characteristics of pedestrians, namely, gender and age. The free speeds found on stairways are about 0.77 m/s and 0.68 m/s in the descending and the ascending direction respectively; those on escalators are about 0.88 m/s and 0.82 m/s in the descending and ascending direction respectively. Besides, in average, male passengers walk faster than female ones; Moreover, in general, free speeds decrease with age. Our findings concerning the fundamental diagrams of pedestrian flows are quite limited due to the small variation of traffic conditions observed. During our observations, the highest flows observed on stairways are 0.86 P/ms and 0.18 P/ms in the descending and ascending direction respectively, while those on escalators are 0.93 P/ms and 0.67 P/ms in the descending and ascending direction respectively. With respect to the choice behavior between stairways and escalators, binary logit models are applied for the model formulation. Based on the choice situations at the observation site, factors influencing the choice behavior may include travel time, physical effort, safety and comfort, personal characteristics of pedestrians, and vicinity. However, due to the incomplete travel information observed, simplified route networks are proposed for the analysis. In addition, only factors of travel time, physical effort, safety and comfort, and personal characteristic are considered in the utility functions. Our estimated results indicate a weak explanatory power of our hypothesized choice models. Possible explanations include the exclusion of influencing factors such as time pressure and vicinity, incomplete travel time information, possible bias caused by the algorithms applied for the estimation of alternative travel time. In regard to the walk/stand choice behaviour on escalators, our study in this report is limited to the discussion about choice availability and influencing factors. The availability of the walk/stand choice may be determined by the distribution of standing passengers on escalators particularly those near to the entry. In addition, the main factors influencing this stand/walk choice on escalators may include physical effort, travel time and time pressure. Finally, our investigation on pedestrian observations with infrared detectors shows that large amount of trajectory data can be observed and extracted automatically with existing program. Besides, our algorithms applied to correct trajectory data and the method used to join infrared and video data provide satisfactory results. Thus we conclude that the application of infrared detectors on pedestrian observations is promising. However, further studies should be performed to evaluate the accuracy of the detection outcomes and to develop algorithms to match trajectories across different fields of view to expand its possible application on pedestrian study.","behaviour; public transport facilities","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport en Mapping","","","",""

One of the measures that will be used is compensating grouting. Compensation grouting is a technique where from a vertical shaft horizontal injection pipes will be brought into the soil underneath the foundation of the protected building. A pump will inject the soil with grout (water cement mixture) through injection points. The main objective of this research is to set up an experiment where, by means of grout injection, the geometry and the propagation of a grout fracture in sand can be examined.

(mentor); Verwijs, J.W. (mentor); Bildea, C.S. (mentor)","2005","Within the Dow Chemical Company the strategy is to centre process flowsheet design activities around the simulation tool Aspen Plus (from Aspen Tech Inc.). However, the model library of Aspen Plus is limited in type and number of models of process unit operations. Equation oriented modelling tools, such as gPROMS (from Process Systems Enterprise Ltd.) or Aspen Custom Modeler – ACM (from Aspen Tech Inc.), can be used to develop custom models of process unit operations which are not available in the Aspen Plus model library. For consistent flowsheet simulation and optimization it is required that these custom models can be exported to and used within Aspen Plus, just like any other model already available in the Aspen Plus model library. Recently, interfaces – based on the CAPE-OPEN standards - have been implemented in the latest releases of the above mentioned process simulation tools. To test the status and performance of the software interoperability, as well as to examine the custom model performance in Aspen Plus, a model of a gas separation membrane unit is developed in gPROMS and in ACM and exported for use in Aspen Plus. This thesis describes the achievements made in the development of the custom membrane model and its interfacing with Aspen Plus. Also, an improved method for model initialisation is presented. Model initialisation is one of the principal obstacles for the development of generic custom models, i.e. models which can run successfully irrespective of the set of components, physical property method, or range of operating conditions. The main conclusions from this study are that several software features enhance the development of generic and robust custom models in equation oriented modelling tools, such as a hierarchical model structure, the usage of an external physical property package, as well as the incorporation of a model initialisation structure (e.g. like the one proposed in this thesis). Moreover, the current functionality and performance of the interfaces for custom models between gPROMS and ACM on one side – and Aspen Plus on the other side – are not sufficient to be used for industrial practice. They need to be improved significantly by the software vendors.","simulator; membranes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","DelftChemTech","","","",""

(mentor)","2005","Pressure Sensitive Paint is a non-intrusive measurement technique, with which pressure distributions over surfaces can be measured. In wind tunnel application both accuracy and speed are of high importance. The PSP technique can be applied in two different approaches, the intensity based and the decay based method. The intensity based method is generally applied with satisfying performance. The decay based method is used less commonly, both speed and accuracy are considered insufficient for commercial wind tunnel use. Opposite from what today’s numbers indicate, the decay based systems are sometimes believed to be potentially much more effective. At DNW an experimental decay based system was available. The system is already used for over 10 years. Old studies indicated that measured data was not fully understood. The source for the disappointing results could not be identified. The goal of the present research was to gain further understanding of the system and to improve its capabilities where possible. To gain understanding the basic physics underlying the PSP operation were investigated more extensively. The expected decay behaviour is modelled in terms of a probability distribution. Relating observed decay to pressure is commonly done by curve fitting. The derived model for the decay however indicated that a different way of signal processing might give better results. By modelling the decay as a distribution, signal and noise are introduced inherently. Together with the new signal processing approach, the best possible accuracy or signal to noise ratio could be established. Speed of the system could not be increased, accuracy gained approximately a factor 2. From the derived model a prediction of the measurement could be made, in most cases the predicted accuracy was twice as good as what was obtained in practise. Differences between expected and obtained accuracy can be explained by the non ideal set-up and circumstances. The derived model matches measurement very well. Although the used setup can not be improved much, future decay based systems might outperform their intensity based counterparts.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""
