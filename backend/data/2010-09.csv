(mentor)","2010","A huge number (40%) of all human deaths are caused by cardiovascular diseases. In the past decades, a lot of research was done about the cause and the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. An implantable device, such as a pacemaker, is a well known method to prevent death by cardiac problems. This thesis explores the possibility of improving detection and reducing power consumption of ECG detectors. To find a suitable structure of our design, basic information about cardio signal and the heart is needed. Analog sense amplifier method is the method in this thesis to detect the QRS complex (obtains from depolarization of the ventricular in the heart) and the T-wave (creates by ventricle repolarisation) of IECG (intracardiac electrogram) signal. This method consists of analog signal processing block and an A/D converter. A wavelet filter (WF) is used to design the first part. In the introduction, wavelet transform analysis, mother wavelet, the desired approximation and suitable decomposition are discussed. These are parts of the wavelet filter. The wavelet filter is designed in discrete time domain due to its gain accuracy and low power consumption. Moreover, the switched-capacitors filters have an accurate frequency response as well as good linearity and dynamic range. The thesis discussed the design of discrete-time switched-capacitor (SC) fully differential folded cascode amplifier. The second part of the analog sense amplifier is the A/D converter, which consists of a sinh transconductor and a peak detector circuit. As the WF implemented in discrete-time, the detector block should do this as well. That is why the sample and hold (SH) block is used at its input of the detector block. The binary output is expected to be seen from the QRS complex and the T-wave of the heart signal. The whole system with an ECG signal input is built in five scales, which is needed to zoom in the different frequencies of the ECG signal. Every scale is implemented for different resolutions by using different clock frequency signals. Another way to implement the different scales is to change the ratio of the capacitors. This method is not used in this thesis, because the minimum values of the capacitors are already chosen. The system is able to detect the ECG signal with the ultra low power and small area design.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electronics","","","",""

(mentor); Pesch, U. (mentor); Stikkelman, R.M. (mentor); Overschie, M.G.F. (mentor); Siemonsma, H. (mentor)","2010","This thesis is the result of a graduation project, conducted at the financial consultancy firm Maritime Transport and Business Solutions, to fulfill the Master of Science program Management of Technology at the faculty of Technology, Policy and Management at Delft University of Technology. This thesis comes forth out the increasing awareness of the port industry on sustainability and the continuous growth of container transport. Dutch ports are more and more constrained by their physical and environmental boundaries. To reduce the environmental and physical constraints of ports, this research aims to examine whether it is possible to stimulate container terminal operators to enhance their environmental performance. Environment is one of the three elements to enhance sustainability. In order to enhance sustainability it is important to increase the environmental performance without compromising the economic and social factors. A port authority has two revenue streams which both can be used to pressure concessionaires and visiting modalities. This thesis focuses on the incorporation of environmental criteria in the concession agreement and thereby the feasibility to exert pressure on the private sector to increase sustainability. This is combined in the following research question, “How can environmental criteria be incorporated in the awarding procedure for port concessions in order to enhance sustainability of container terminal operations?"" In order to do so three building blocks are determined that will provide the information. These three building blocks are, - Concession awarding process, - Evaluation methods for port concessions, - Environmental themes. Container terminal concessions are increasingly awarded via a competitive process. This competitive process can consist of private bilateral negotiation or container terminal concessions can be awarded through an open call for tender. In the awarding process environmental criteria are underexposed but already present in the form of existing legislation and permits. The use of environmental awarding criteria is virtually absent in ports with the exception of Maasvlakte 2. For Maasvlakte 2 concessions an environmental management system and modal split criteria have been used as environmental awarding criteria. The developed evaluation method for port tenders does not differ from other investment projects. The Net Present Value technique is used to determine the added value of the container terminal investment for the port authority. The net present value technique is incorporated in the business case which is an analysis of to determine whether an investment for the port authority is worthwhile. The weighed sum is an evaluation model is the most widely applied evaluation model for tenders. The European Commission implicitly refers to use the weighted sum as evaluation model to evaluate the outcome of a tender process. The establishment of weighting is ultimately determined by political decisions. The net present value technique provides insight on the costs or benefits on the incorporation of environmental criteria and is used as input to apply the weighted sum technique. The combination to determine the value of a project with the net present value technique and further develop an evaluation method with the method of the weighted sum provides an evaluation method to combine the best of both worlds. Environmental themes that are important for consideration in the awarding process of container terminals are: - Air quality, - Energy consumption, - Intensification in use of space, - Water quality management, - Noise, - Light - Preservation and development of nature. These themes have come forth out of desk research and the conducted expert interviews. The themes are reviewed by experts in interviews to judge the feasibility of the themes for the construction of awarding criteria. For the port authorities, an expert from the Port of Rotterdam, two experts from the Port of Amsterdam and one expert of Zeeland Seaports are interviewed. To represent the terminal operators one expert of APM Terminals and one expert of Europe Container Terminals (United States Environmental Protection Agency) have been interviewed. Representing the government, three experts of the Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management were interviewed. In order maintain coherence with economic and social parts of sustainability for both these aspects of sustainability an indicator is introduced. For the economic part this indicator is profitability and for social part this indicator is employment. The combination of environmental, social and economical themes represents the sustainability framework. The interviewed experts have acknowledged that incorporation of environmental awarding criteria will stimulate environmental innovation and considering the environment is an increasing dominant factor to maintain their license-to-operate. This license-to-operate is under continuous pressure due to the general trend in society to enhance sustainability. In order to cope with the general trend in society the experts have indicated that intensification in use of space is the most important theme to enhance sustainability. Dutch ports and society are constraint by the physical constraints of the country. To be able to expand the ports’ transshipment without physical expansion benefits the port authorities and society in general. Society in general benefits due to the reason that space can therefore be utilized for other purposes, as housing or recreation for instance. Therefore an indicator for this theme is developed which is based on terminal efficiency and is calculated by the annual throughput per square meter. The second stage of this research has reviewed the feasibility to incorporate intensification of space in the awarding process. To be able to provide sensible comment on this topic, two cases were abstracted from real terminals. The straddle carrier terminal and the change needed in a rail mounted gantry crane terminal. On basis of their differences the needed change to increase sustainability in port operation is mapped. The analysis of the reference terminals was divided in a financial review, an environmental analysis and the application of the evaluation methodology. The reference terminals have revealed that in Hong Kong intensification of space is possible on basis of current practices. The reference cases served as input for the financial review. A business case served as financial review. The business case has revealed that intensification of space is financially feasible. The financial analysis has indicated the trade-off between the economic indicator, profitability and the environmental indicator, space. Based on this business case the performance measures and scoring functions for the weighted sum are constructed. Both reference container terminals are subjected to an environmental analysis based on the sustainable framework of environmental, social and economical themes. This analysis has indicated that the rail mounted gantry crane terminal will have similar of better environmental and social performance than the straddle carrier option. However, due to the higher investments needed to realize the rail mounted gantry crane terminal the profitability of this terminal is lower. To assess whether incorporation in use of space will actually enhance the sustainable performance of container terminals an expert meeting has been held. The port experts of MTBS have revealed that the total sustainability can be determined when all of the above mentioned themes are quantified. Therefore, at this stadium no conclusion can be provided whether the sustainability of container terminals is enhanced with the incorporation of space. However the The general conclusion of this research is that it is possible to enhance the environmental performance of the port by integrating environmental criteria the concession agreement. Based on reference cases the financial, technical and environmental feasibility of the environmental criteria can be determined. The input following from the business case can be used as input for the evaluation model. The application of the weighted sum technique will determine the performance measures and scoring functions of the environmental criterion. When incorporating environmental criteria in the awarding procedure it is important to consider that the environmental criteria are measureable and are attributable to the party responsible. The incorporation of environmental criteria will lead to additional costs without generating additional revenues for port authority and terminal operator. However, from the expert interviews follows that incorporation of environmental criteria is necessary to respond to the general trend in society where environment is becoming an increasingly important topic to maintain their license-to-operate. This implies that environmental criteria have great potential to be incorporated in the near future.","concessions; tender procedure; intensification in use of space; port; environmental criteria","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-09-30","Technology, Policy and Management","Technology Dynamics and Sustainable Development","","Management of Technology","",""

It is being considered as a promising EOR (Enhanced Oil Recovery) method for maturing light and heavy oil fields. A numerical and experimental study of the CWF was conducted, focusing on the underlying physical phenomena. In MATLAB, a numerical model describing a 1D CWF process was formulated assuming immiscible conditions. Modeling predictions have shown that in this simulator the oil swelling accounts for an increased oil production, together with a reduced residual oil saturation. This reduced residual oil saturation is the consequence of a reduced interfacial tension. However, the effect of this reduced residual oil saturation should be studied thoroughly. In addition to the numerical model, core-flood experiments have been performed using Bentheimer sandstone and n-hexadecane to validate the model predictions. It was found that injecting water containing 3.7% CO2 of the total mass of the aqueous phase reduces the residual oil saturation from pure water flooding to about 12.8. The experiment is performed with periods of injection and no injection, where an experiment with continuous injection would have provided more information about oil banking. The results of the experiment have been used to validate the model. From this validation it is deducted that either the residual oil saturation is reduced if the CO2 content in the oil phase is increased or there are errors in both the experiments and simulations. The mechanisms occurring during CWF are described (oil swelling, viscosity reduction, changing densities, solubility, changes in residual oil saturation).","Petroleum Engineering; Carbonated Water Flooding; tertiary recovery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Petroleum Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Cotofana, S.D. (mentor)","2010","Multiprocessor Systems on a Chip (MPSoCs) are suitable platforms for executing complex embedded applications. To reduce the cost of the hardware platform, applications share resources, which may result in inter-application timing interference due to resource request conflicts. Bounding or prohibiting this interference is crucial, as the timing of real-time applications has to be predicted in each possible case. Resources that allow sharing without application interference are denoted as composable. Composability is a desired platform property, as it enables the design and analysis of applications in isolation, and their integration with linear effort. Previous work demonstrates composability for different resources, i.e., processor, interconnect, memory. Processor composability is achieved by utilizing an Operating System (OS) that schedules fixed duration task slots, using a two-level, hierarchical approach. First, the OS determines which application owns the next slot following a strict, preemptive Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) policy, and then it picks and schedules a task of that application. As scheduling decisions are taken exclusively at slots borders, when a task finishes before its slot depletes, the time left is wasted. This may result in low processor utilization for streaming applications for which the execution of a task may start after its predecessor tasks have finished. In this work we propose a new task scheduling strategy, namely application-space task scheduling that eliminates wasted slot time. We make use of the fixed duration slots and the application TDM, to preserve composability, but the application invokes the task scheduler immediately after each task finish, inside its slot. As the application-space task scheduling strategy alone may not support all types of task scheduling, e.g., preemptive, we propose to combine OS-space and application-space scheduling on the same processor. To experimentally investigate the composability and performance of our scheme we survey existing benchmarks for the embedded domain, and build a workload consisting of two streaming applications and a synthetic application. We executed these applications on an MPSoC with two processor tiles, a monitor tile, all connected by a Æthereal NoC. Our experiments indicate that mixing application-space and OS-space task schedulers is composable. Furthermore, the application-space task scheduling achieves 17% to 40% better performance than the OS-space task scheduling for the streaming applications exercised.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-10-05","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","A transition through the Earth's atmosphere is inevitable if it is desired to bring or return something useful from space. The transition is also known as the atmospheric entry, which is characterised by a highly energetic vehicle. Three types of entry can be distinguished: ballistic, glide and skip entry. In the hypersonic transition of a glide entry, the heating and structural loading can become severe enough to damage the vehicle and/or the crew. The attitude of the vehicle has to be controlled to avoid this. In addition, the vehicle should target an interface with the TAEM phase. During which the vehicle is aligned with the runway. The process of determining the attitude throughout entry is called mission planning. For on-board mission planning, simplifications need to be made on the vehicle, its environment and the flight dynamics to achieve an acceptable computation speed. As a consequence, the real trajectory will deviate from the planned trajectory. The trajectory tracker has the task to steer the vehicle towards the planned trajectory. The combination of a planning and tracking algorithm forms a guidance algorithm. The main question of this thesis work is formulated as: Is it possible to design an on-board executable guidance algorithm, for the hypersonic transition phase, which safely targets the TAEM interface? Four tasks have been derived from this question: simulator development, planning algorithm design, tracking algorithm design and guidance algorithm testing. The simulator serves as a test bed for the guidance algorithm. In the development of this software, a systems-based approach is taken with respect to the vehicle and its environment modelling. The advantage is that the software has a clear modular structure and it becomes easy to extend the simulator with new capabilities. The design of a trajectory planner has been decomposed into an angle of attack and bank angle planner. The angle of attack planner operates on the assumption of an equilibrium-glide trajectory. The bank angle planning algorithm is centered around an iterative search for a drag profile that corresponds to an estimated trajectory length travelled between entry and TAEM interface point. By incorporating the bank angle planning and tracking algorithms in one guidance algorithm, the main question is answered positively. The algorithm executes fast enough for an on-board implementation.","Mission; Re-entry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-10-20","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","Astrodynamics & Space Missions","",""

For this purpose, initially the concept of policy analysis and its evolutionary process from traditional and expert-based approach to participatory style, and role of context in policy analysis in general and participatory policy analysis in particular are studied. Next, the concept of public participation is elaborated through studying the levels and purposes of participation, type of participants, and the methods or techniques of public participation. Afterwards, risk and challenges of participation are enumerated, and a number of ""factors of participation (FP)"" which are sensitive to politico-cultural context are identified. Thirteen FPs are introduced and classified into four main categories of factors. Next, the cultural and political indicators which steers these FPs are explored. Hofstede's Theory, World Value Survey (WVS) by Inglehart, Schwartz cultural values orientations, cultural study of GLOBE project and Minkov cultural study, are the cross-cultural theories examined in order to extract measurable cultural indicators to explore the identified FPs. Subsequent to the recognition of cultural indicators three globally reputable research projects, namely Freedom in the World Survey, The Economist Intelligence Unit’s Index of Democracy and Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI), in which governance indexes and democracy indicators are periodically calculated in the national level, are scrutinized in order to identify the most relevant political indicators to this thesis. Exploiting the relation between cultural and political indicators and factors of participation (FP), a framework is developed for each category of FPs. In this framework, each FP is evaluated by national scores of some cultural and/or political indicators, every FP has two poles which are assigned to extreme scores of relevant indicators and are distinguishable by specific attributes. In order to test the applicability of the developed framework, several national cases have been studied utilizing the framework. A comparative case study for a specific participatory method - consensus conference – would be done for some other countries. The case studies show that the framework can effectively explain the influence of contextual factors. Furthermore, the case studies are also helped to revise and improve the framework in a reciprocal process. It is revealed that the framework can provide awareness for policy analysts who want to employ participatory approach. This is in fact the descriptive application of the framework. Moreover, the framework can have the prescriptive application. Although this application should be elaborated in a separate research, the practical application of the framework initiates at the end of thesis. The implication of each FP's attributes is indicated and accordingly can guide the analysts to select and adapt the purpose and method of participation. Some relevant features of known public participation methods are introduced and a tentative example of practical considerations is demonstrated. The research concludes with an indication of the considerations about the research/framework and gives some suggestions for future research.","participatory policy analysis; public participation; policy analysis; cultural dimensions; political indicators; factors of participation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-09-28","Technology, Policy and Management","Policy Analysis and Management","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

The main research question of this thesis is: “How can the acquisition process of NELFCRO be improved by integrating theory from academic literature and practice from NELFCRO employees’ perspective?” To answer this question, this research was conducted in different phases, namely analysis and synthesis phases. As part of the analysis phase, context analysis and concept analysis were carried out. In the context analysis phase, interviews of NELFCRO’s employees and NELFCRO’s flyer analysis were conducted. The main results of this phase are the company context which emphasized the perceived positive aspects and perceived negative aspects of NELFCRO based on its employees’ perspective. Next to the context analysis, a concept analysis was conducted by a literature study on acquisition process in order to develop the ground of this research. The results of this literature study are theoretical framework of acquisition process and list of aspects that are theoretically involved in acquisition process. As part of synthesis phase, the integration of the context analysis result and the concept analysis result were carried out. Validation of the research results on context analysis and concept analysis were conducted. The validation was part of the focus group activity with NELFCRO’s employees as participants. The focus group was also aimed to enrich the concept of the integrated frameworks and NELFCRO’s context with new ideas. The main result of the synthesis research phase is an integrated matrix of theoretical framework and NELFCRO’s context. This matrix was used to analyze the NELFCRO’s perceived aspects, which are closely related to acquisition process. Furthermore, it was used to generate possible unique selling propositions (USPs) of NELFCRO. Then, possible solutions to generate company’s proposed-USPs were discussed and some recommendations were generated. In this research phase, the validation of the research results was carried out. Also, in the focus group, NELFCRO’s employees were involved to think together about their company’s acquisition case based on the research result. To conclude, as the answers to the main question, the acquisition process can be improved by making NELFCRO’ employees aware of their perceived positive aspects and making them focus on those perceived positive aspects of the company. These perceived positive aspects of the company are possible to become NELFCRO’s unique selling propositions (USPs). These USPs are important to be emphasized to the potential customer, especially in the acquisition process. Beside the perceived positive aspects, emphasis could be given to the improvement of the company’s perceived negative aspects into more positive aspects, eventually making them potential company’s USPs. Besides the recommendations that are generated from the discussion on possible solution for NELFCRO, further recommendations are also presented in the end of the research. The results of this research can be used as the start for further study of NELFCRO in its acquisition process.","acquisition; marketing; Unique Selling Proposition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Science Education and Communication","","Science Education and Communication","",""

(mentor)","2010","Due to the extreme sensitivity of the superconductive gravimeter GWR T020, based at Metsähovi Research Center in Kirkkonummi, Southern Finland, various local meteorological and hydrological changes influence or disturb its measurements. This study is part of a large research project which aims to identify the contribution of the local hydrology at Metsähovi to these gravimeter measurements. For this purpose a study is made to investigate the geological structure of the subsurface and the hydrological properties of the stratigraphic layers. In order to perform numerical calculations a digital model is made using digital modeling software. A field investigation is performed consisting of:  A literature study on hydro-geological setting in Southern Finland.  An extensive fieldwork consisting of bore holes, field observations and various field measurements (among others GPS, GPR, slug tests and monitoring of soil moisture with soil sensors).  Laboratory work to obtain necessary soil properties. Main property which was found is the grain size distribution. A large amount of data is gathered and processed in order to integrate the data into a structural model. A method is found to integrate a maximum amount of information into a model and by optimally using the understanding and knowledge of the geological setting. A model is constructed with several layers. The area can be characterized in two hydrogeological domains. One is the higher area where overburden is thin and only till covers the bedrock, the other is a lower area dominated by a low permeable silt and clay layer. The till is low permeable but is still found to infiltrate water considerably. The hydrological setting of Metsähovi is analyzed and theories of the hydrogeological processes which govern moisture changes in the area are investigated. Main focus is how these processes can be modeled with their governing laws and parameters. It is recommended to initially make a 1 dimensional model with software such as CoupManual.","3D stratigraphic model; quaternary geology; Oasis Montaj; gridding; hydrogeological modeling; water content change","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-10-10","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geotechnology","","Engineering Geology","",""

The market of bamboo products in Western market is gradually growing due to the increasing awareness of sustainability. The bamboo toys are especially very rare and new for the Western market. The objective of this project is to design a bamboo toy that can be produced by craftsmen at Tre Vang in Vietnam for preschool children in the Netherlands, creating both sustainable production and play. To achieve the objective, four phases have been carried out in this project: analysis, synthesis, prototyping, and evaluation. The final design is an improved Marbulus marble toy made from solid bamboo, Tam Vong, in a set of play mat (with packaging and manual) presented by a usage scenario. Marbulus is construction game which can be played in group. Children learn to build the bridge, put the tracks in the right slot with different slopes. They create their own marble runs with this construction set which can stimulate their creativity and reasoning. Besides, assembling the tracks in configurations suited for children’s developing understanding and also a way to learn and practice their hand-eye coordination. Solid bamboo crafted design makes the play set attractive and durable for years of educational and fun play. Moreover, it is not an industrial product but hand made product. Hand made product can create more appreciation and connection between the consumer and the product and also creates a closer relation between the user and producer as well.","toy; bamboo; design for children; sustainability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Storm, S.T.H. (mentor); De Jong, M. (mentor)","2010","In response to the abandonment of monetary targeting, Inflation targeting (IT) has emerged as a dominant monetary policy framework in both industrializing and industrialized countries. The framework was aimed to provide a new anchor for conducting monetary policy, and the theoretical underpinnings of this framework are based on two things: First, the IT model provides a core mechanism where the interest rate is being used as a policy instrument to achieve a low and stable inflation. Second, institutional aspect of this policy provides guidance towards an independent central bank that is argued as a way to gain a central bank’s credibility. However, the claim is not free from criticisms; some economists view this policy is implemented at the cost of low economic growth and high unemployment. This research is aimed to provide a deeper analysis on Inflation Targeting framework by addressing its two theoretical foundations: First, the standard IT model is being assessed by considering a missing variable namely labor productivity. Second, the institutional analysis is employed to explain the implementation of IT in a - typically developing - country (i.e. Indonesia), and since the IT policy follows a type of transplanted policy (from International Financial Institution to Countries), the adoption of IT policy is evaluated under the institutional transplantation perspective. As a conclusion, IT policy is not costless, the cost is not only in term of losing output but also in term of losing labor productivity, and the institutional analysis showed that the adoption of IT by a country does not increase the credibility of a central bank.","Inflation Targeting; Monetary Policy; Macroeconomic Model; Institutional Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Innovation Systems","","Economics of Innovation","",""

(mentor); Anjam, F. (mentor)","2010","The speed gap between a processor realized in Semi-custom ASIC technology and a processor realized in FPGA technology is narrowing. In processor design, the approach is to define the microarchitecture of the processor and to design and implement it for executing an application domain. In this thesis, we have investigated the approach to design a customized and parametrized VLIW processor, such that it becomes better suited for imaging applications. We analyzed the requirement of a fingerprint application. Porting the application to the VEX simulator required design and integration of an arithmetic module for emulating 64-bit arithmetic. Subsequently, the application was ported to the VEX simulator such that we could derive the set of architectural parameters for the VEX processor. Based on these parameters, we designed a pipelined and scalable VLIW processor according to the VEX ISA. Moreover, the design of the processor was implemented and realized in a Virtex-VI FPGA. Furthermore, to create the instruction memory for the VEX processor, the required toolchain was developed from the inherited development framework of the r-VEX project. For this purpose, we extended the back-end of the VEX compiler, re-designed the assembler, integrated the linker and the loader. The resulting toolchain allowed us to extract and execute the fingerprint application's bottleneck and three other benchmarks, on the VEX processor. Compared to the inherited development framework, the re-designed toolchain is more mature and better to utilize, as it is able to create the instruction ROM for the VEX processor. The Fibonacci benchmark results showed that the VEX processor is 3.32 times faster than the original multi-cycle r-VEX processor. Moreover, the results of three other benchmark indicate that our designed processor is able to execute a range of applications.","VLIW; processor; fingerprint; verification; VEX; toolchain; FPGA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-03-26","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Master of Science Computer Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2010","Four decades after Neil Armstrong's 1st steps on the Moon the time has come to take it one step further, the permanent occupation of humans on lunar soil. Permanent occupation of humans will revive the dream of exploring space and will open the doors for space flight to Mars or even further. For this reason this project investigates the possibilities of placing a base on the South Pole of the Moon before July 1, 2020. The South Pole has been chosen for several reasons, although the main reason is the recently discovered presence of water by NASA's LCROSS mission in 2009. The base itself consists of four modules made of an inflatable structure to minimize for weight. The following research question was set at the beginning of this study, Is it possible with the current technology to establish a permanent manned base on the South Pole of the Moon before July 1, 2020? This project was setup by ESA and is a joined effort of three students of the Delft University of Technology, Antonio Pagano, Valentio Zuccarelli and myself. The mission itself is therefore also divided into three parts, the Earth ascent, the Earth-Moon trajectory and the descent to the lunar surface. This study will focus on the last part, the design of the lunar descent trajectories. The goal of this study is, Design of the optimal lunar descent trajectory with the goal of constructing a permanent base on the lunar South Pole. This project assumed that the launchers Ares-I and Ares-V are available for the lunar base mission, as well as Constellation's lander Altair. The descent trajectory is optimized for maximum payload that can be brought to the lunar surface. The descent starts at the end of the Earth-Moon trajectory, a 100 km altitude, 89.8 deg inclination circular parking orbit. The following three different methods are used to study the descent trajectory and are compared at the end: dividing the descent into intervals, indirect method and gravity-turn trajectory. By using the indirect method the biggest payload mass can be brought to the lunar surface. With the results a launch schedule is proposed, including 19 launches, that make it possible to build the lunar base before July 2020.","lunar base settlement; trajectories","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-10-20","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","Astrodynamics & Space Missions","",""

(mentor); Van de Geer, S.G. (mentor)","2010","The Ahold Innovation Team (AIT) creates new technological applications for Albert Heijn, Etos, Gall&Gall, Hypernova and Albert. The most potential innovations are developed until ready to test on a small scale. Thereafter, the ideas need to be transferred to the business in order to implement them large scaled on the shopping floor. Over the last few years however not many ideas from the AIT have been successfully transferred. It can be stated that there is a gap between their ideas and the implementation. The main objective of this graduation project, therefore, was to develop a concept that can help bridge this gap. Analysis An analysis of the AIT, their way of working and other stakeholders that are involved, showed that symptoms of the gap appear in different phases of the innovation process. Insights into these topics were used as a starting point to held interviews with stakeholders and execute a competitor and a consumer analysis. Here from, a total of 38 symptoms of the gap between ideas and implementation resulted. These symptoms could be clustered in three main groups called ‘vision’, ‘selection’ and ‘collaboration’. The first cluster includes the AIT needing to first have a clearer vision of where they want to go to and then use technology in order to get there, instead of starting from a technological perspective. Secondly, more solid criteria should be used to select ideas that fit to the needs and wishes of the business. Finally, better collaboration with the other stakeholders of the innovation process can stimulate an easier transfer of the technological ideas into the implementation phase. Idea generation and concept development The three main clusters of symptoms that emerged from the analysis were used to generate concept ideas. A process of diverging and converging of new ideas showed that several elements could be combined to enlarge their solution areas. Finally, based on criteria from the AIT, the final concept was chosen: The scenario concept. The scenario concept was further developed to specifically fit the mission of the AIT by gaining more information about the possibilities of the scenario planning technique. From another in depth analysis it was concluded that the scenario concept is very well suited to execute in the form of a workshop in which several stakeholders can participate to stimulate collaboration. It also showed that the scenario planning technique actually offers a way to more continuously execute future thinking instead of only during the building of the scenarios itself, as it can provide guidelines for the search for environmental trends. The objective of the scenario concept can therefore be formulated as: Collaborative creation of a vision on the future in order to continuously generate and select successful technological innovations. The scenario concept was subsequently tested with the Etos. Insights from this test were then used to optimize the scenario concept into its final proposal as further described below. The final scenario concept The scenario concept provides a new way of innovating and consists of six phases, which are led and primarily executed by a project manager. The core of the concept consists of two one-day workshops (phases 3 and 5), facilitated by the project manager, in which three groups of participants work together. These three different groups are technology experts from the IM department of Ahold, employees from a certain business department, and external participants with a creative profession. The goal is to make use of the different insights of these participants in order to generate and select new ideas to finally create a roadmap (plan) of new technological innovations that fit the participants’ shared vision. Phase 1. Frame the search First, the project manager has to set parameters for the study which will make the end result more specific to the purposes of the business department that is involved. The topic must be selected, along with the time horizon and the geographical boundaries of the study. Phase 2. Analyze driving forces Within the boundaries that are set, the project manager executes a PESTED trend research. Phase 3. Determine main drivers & build scenarios In the first workshop the participants will be asked to score the PESTED trends on their impact on the store and the (un)certainty of happening within the determined time horizon. From the critical trends, two are determined as main drivers of the scenario matrix. The combination of the extremes of these drivers defines four different scenarios of the future. Creative techniques are then used to let the participants further enrich these scenarios. A final discussion at the end of this first workshop aims to find out how the participants imagine the future will evolve; their ‘shared’ vision. Phase 4. Take-home assignment To ensure more familiarity with the scenarios, a take-home assignment was created which the participants have to execute in between the two workshops. Phase 5. Experience scenarios & interpret consequences In the second workshop the scenarios, personas and potential technologies are used as input to come up with new technological innovations. The best ideas will collectively be selected based on their fit to the participants’ expected evolution of the future and, according to their assessed development in time, placed on a roadmap between now and the future time horizon. As this roadmap builds upon environmental trends, guidelines and examples for ‘early warning signals’ of possible trend shifts are provided. These need to be monitored after finishing the scenario concept and discussed every six months with the internal workshop participants in order to decided whether the roadmap of technological ideas need to be adjusted or can remain the same. Phase 6. Create projecta’s Finally, the input for the idea generation and selection can be used to create enriched visualizations of the ideas. These so called projecta’s are to be created by the AIT members in collaboration with external creatives that have joined the workshops. Implementation At the end of the project, an implementation plan was written to administer the scenario concept within the organization. For internal communication purposes a movie and a manual were created.","innovation; technology; scenario planning; vision; implementation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-05-01","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Melles, M. (mentor)","2010","Food consumed outside of our home is an increasingly important part of our diet. Every day around 4 million Dutch consumers eat one or more main meals outside the household premises. More than half of these meals are not consumed when eating out of our home in a traditional way, e.g. at a full-service restaurant, but are what is called functional out-of-home eating. Functional out-of-home eating considers food on-the-go, for instance while travelling or shopping. Also eating at work or at school is considered functional out-of-home eating. Research shows that out-of-home foods are often higher in energy and moreover, frequent consumption of out-of-home food is linked to poorer diet quality and risk for obesity. Although most people have the basic knowledge about what healthy food is, they do not yet put this knowledge into practice, often resulting in bad food choices. Especially for people leading busy lives, working long hours at demanding jobs and often being on the road – keeping a healthy diet can be difficult. This master thesis describes the user-centred research and design process towards product concepts that support these people in making healthy food choices in the out-of-home context. To get insight in the food choices of users and the context surrounding them three user studies were carried out: an online questionnaire, a probe study and a field study. With the online questionnaire the key descriptors of functional out-of-home eating in the Netherlands were found, such as locations, frequency and timeslots of functional out-of-home eating. The probe study gave insight in the experiences of users and the key motives, patterns, dilemmas and factors that influence eating habits. With the field study, an attempt was made to grasp the moment of the act of participants eating out of home, to find actual qualities, feelings and attitudes of food choices. The results were used to describe the present context of functional out-of-home eaters and defined the factors that influence food decisions. It was found that functional out-of-home eating brings about complex interactions. It became clear that the barrier to healthy nutrition is not the lack of desire or motivation, but is instead the result of lack of some of the key elements that enable a person to make healthy choices and the influence of external and internal factors that consciously or unconsciously influence choice. These barriers were translated to design goals which enabled the formulation of a design brief. Based on the design brief, four concepts were developed that differed on several aspects, such as interaction-, technological or content dimensions. In an evaluation session all aspects of these three dimensions were evaluated. Healthy food choices in the out-of-home context contribute to a healthy diet and healthy lifestyle. This report presents a design proposal for breaking down the barriers to healthy food choices in the out-of-home context. The proposal can serve as a direction for further development.","functional out-of-home eating; behavioural change; healthy diet","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-09-25","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor); Sääksjärvi, M. (mentor)","2010","Douwe Egberts Coffee Systems focuses on the core portfolio of coffee and coffee systems. This results in a category maintenance approach for the cross selling category. Cross selling is selling additional products to existing clients. The economic crisis and increased competitive forces of private labels put pressure on the cross selling category. In order to maintain the substantial margin contribution, a category leadership approach is required. This graduation project is part of the category leadership approach. The aim is to design or improve one of the four main products of the cross selling category: sugar, creamer, cacao or papercups. If the new design incorporates added value, the margins of the category can be sustained or improved. In order to find out what could add value, seventeen decision makers of the market segments Small Business, Medium Business, Health & Care and Hotels have been interviewed. The interview techniques that were employed to obtain latent information are a projective technique and Laddering. The main insight that was gained is that Douwe Egberts can only discriminate portion packs (sugar, creamer and cacao) by increasing the efficiency and sustainability, but that the Douwe Egberts brand does add value to papercups. In addition to the interviews, a literature study was conducted, food trends were observed, and information about Douwe Egberts and its market were studied. All information about what could add value to Douwe Egberts’ cross selling products was collected and categorized. These categories were used to formulate platforms: consumer driven themes that inspire innovation with which competitive advantage is created. The two platforms are based on the difference between papercups and portion packs. The first platform is titled ‘Image endorsing papercups that support variety efficiently’. The second platform is called ‘Convenient portion packs that have a real low impact on the environment’. The platforms were used to spark creativity in two sessions that were organized to generate ideas. The two winning ideas are ‘Choose your image’ and ‘Sugar drops’. - Choose your image - The decision maker chooses one or multiple designs for papercups that suit his corporate identity at the targeted coffee drinking occasion. The chosen style is applied to the other cross selling products s/he buys. - Sugar drops - The sugar ‘drops’ in the renewed portion packs improve the usability when dispensing sugar, reduce the spoiling of ingredients, and enhance tidiness. Moreover, the new shape differentiates Douwe Egberts from competitors. Implementation of these ideas will testify to the category leadership approach and might increase sales.","Laddering; Hierarchical Value Map; Projective Technique; Platform","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-09-24","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Zitha, P.L.J. (mentor); He, Y.Y. (mentor)","2010","Large amounts of natural gas hydrates have been found in sub-oceanic deposits and beneath permafrost regions. It has the potential to become a major hydrocarbon resource in the near future. Research is needed to evaluate the production possibilities of this new resource. CH4 hydrate dissociation and production is an endothermic process and a production challenge is the reservoir temperature reduction. CO2 is thermodynamically favoured over CH4 in the hydrate form and it has been suggested to use CO2 to prevent cooling by replacement of CH4 hydrates with CO2 hydrates. This technique has three advantages: sequestration of CO2, increased CH4 production and maintaining formation stability. The effect of CO2 injection on the CH4 production from a hydrate reservoir has been investigated by numerical simulations. A sensitivity analysis on the CH4 production has been performed by varying the injection pressure, temperature, reservoir properties, hydrate blockage models, intrinsic kinetic rates for CO2 hydrate formation and numerical parameters. The research has been performed by running numerical simulations using the kinetic simulator STARS from CMG. A 3D homogeneous class 2 hydrate reservoir was constructed with a production well completed in the hydrate zone and an injection well completed in the free water zone, injecting liquid CO2 in the free water zone below the CH4 hydrate zone. The injection and production well pressure were regulated to create CO2 hydrate forming and CH4 hydrate dissociation conditions in the reservoir. The simulation results have shown that when CO2 is injected, the cumulative CH4 production can increase with 50-60 %, while storing significant amounts of CO2 simultaneously. 2 % of the injected CO2 was produced at the production well. CO2 hydrates were formed directly under the CH4 hydrates, supplying the dissociating CH4 hydrates with a low grade heat source. No upward moving front of CO2 was observed. It is concluded that CO2 injection only increases CH4 production when the temperature of the reservoir is too low to support further hydrate dissociation. The highest recovery rates are achieved with low injection pressures. Injection of CO2 in the gas phase is favoured and the intrinsic kinetic formation rate for CO2 hydrates is a major influence on the CH4 production. It is concluded that CO2 injection in a Class 2 hydrate reservoir could increase the CH4 production under certain conditions.","hydrates; co2; sequestration; class 2 hydrate","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geotechnology","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2010","Project complexities might deliver a contribution to failure of projects in reaching the project goals. Research towards project complexities has been done in engineering projects, but not in maintenance projects. There is a difference in maintenance projects and engineering projects. For that reason one cannot assume that the comparable results coming forward from the research towards project complexities in engineering projects account for maintenance projects as well. The differences between maintenance projects and engineering project can be found in e.g. the schedule and cost estimations. In many maintenance projects the full scope of work is only known when the project is already in the execution phase. This is the result of discoveries that are done e.g. when equipment is opened up. Consequently the schedule and cost estimations cannot be fixed before the project has started. Other differences are the resource levelling, which is more dynamic in maintenance projects or the short execution phase relative to the planning and preparation phase. Maintenance projects are executed during the operation phase of a plant or construction. A construction project earns back the upfront investment during the operation phase. Maintenance project have therefore an influence on the Return on Investment (ROI) of construction projects. There are many organizations that are trying to save on their maintenance expenditures. This, in combination with the influence maintenance projects have on the ROI of a construction make them an important and interesting topic to research. For this research the following main research question is formulated “How can project complexities in maintenance projects be assessed and managed?” This research has an exploratory character. Exploratory research has got a qualitative nature which has as a result knowledge on attitudes, behaviours and perspectives of involved key-persons in the projects. Hence this is suitable for this research. The a qualitative research using case studies as research instrument is conducted at Hertel Singapore Pte. Ltd. Hertel executes maintenance projects in the petrochemical industry. The research is limited to planned preventive and planned corrective maintenance projects. Two of the maintenance projects are executed at an oil refinery, the others at a tank farm and chemical plant. The projects at the oil refinery were the mitigation of Corrosion Under Insulation (CUI) and the shutdown of a Crude Distillator (CD-5 Unit). At the tank farm and chemical plant it was a tank bottom leak and shutdown respectively. The data for the research was collected in two ways. First a desk research was done towards maintenance projects, project complexities and the background history of the projects used for the case study. Next interviews were held with key-persons involved in the projects. Semi-structured interviews were held guided by a questionnaire. During the interviewees the interviewees were asked to assist in filling in the TOE framework. The TOE framework is a framework developed in engineering projects to assess the project complexities. Part of this research was to investigate whether or not this framework can be of value in maintenance projects. For every case study at least three interviewees assisted in filling in the TOE framework. The results of the assessment of the project complexities with the framework are briefly analysed. During the interviews the interviewees were also asked to point out three to five severe elements from the TOE framework and to mentioned complexities that are missing from the TOE framework, if possible. The results of the different cases where further processed in the cross case analysis. In the cross case analysis the high scoring elements of the combined cases have been compared with the results of the assessment of the individual cases. The elements that were present in at least three cases have been combined with the elements that were pointed out in the TOE framework as severe by the interviewees and the missing elements according to the interviewees. After eliminating elements that were not typical project complexities the following elements remained present.  Is there a strong project drive (cost, quality, schedule)?  What is the number and nature of dependencies between the tasks?  What is the required effort for communications about the project (internal)?  Are the resources (materials, personnel) and skills required in the project, available?  Are involved parties aware of HSSE (health, safety, security, environment) importance?  Are there interfaces between different disciplines involved in the project (mechanical, electrical, chemical, civil, finance, legal, communication, accounting, etc) that could lead to interface problems?  Is the project organization set up from the beginning of the project?  How congested is the working area/site location?  Are there many unusual workers involved in the project? A number of these severe complexity elements evolve over the project and managed. A discussion of possible improvement to manage the most severe complexity elements has been provided. This can be mostly related to more cooperation between owner and contractor and earlier involvement of the contractor. Between them a strong project organization should be set up. From the research it appeared that not only is the management of the individual elements important, but there is also a different outcome in the perspectives of the owner and contractor. Awareness of these perspectives should be created between the both. Additionally there are less complexity elements that have been given a high grade in existing relationships. It is therefore recommended to work towards a relationship between owner and contractor to reduce the project complexities. There is more (quantitative) research towards maintenance projects and its project complexities needed. In this future research a adapted TOE framework should be created that is based on the typical project complexities that resulted from this research. The TOE framework has been of value for this research as it helped the researcher to obtain the research. However to assess the project complexities an adapted framework has more value. It is recommend to Hertel to make use of this adapted framework to create an awareness of the project complexities with the owner and to build a better relationship in addition to the set up of a strong project organization in the early start of a project.","Complexities; Maintenance; Projects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Technology, Strategy and Entrepreneurship","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor)","2010","Currently, a low cost, single-chip multi-band WCDMA/GSM transceiver is needed for the 3G segment of the cellular communication that provides backward compatibility with the 2G GSM network. In this thesis, a novel, multi-band, low noise transconductance amplifier (LNTA) is presented. The LNTA has three stages, which are the transconductance, feedback and single ended to differential conversion stages. In order to eliminate the bulky and lossy passive balun deployed for single ended to differential conversion before the LNTA, a single transistor was used preceding the LNTA in order to provide a differential output. The LNTA is designed with a large transconductance in order to suppress noise in the second stage mixer of a wideband transceiver. Hence, CMOS transconductor was employed as the input stage, and the transconductance of the LNTA was stabilized by the constant gm biasing circuitry. Moreover, an active feedback technique was developed to increase the linearity of the LNTA. Finally, a dual band matching network was used in order to realize multi-band operation. The LNTA presented in this thesis achieves 1.8dB – 2.8dB noise figure in the WCDMA bands. S11 is below -12 dB from 870MHz to 960MHz and it is below -15dB from 1.8GHz to 2.2GHz. The worst case out of band IIP3 is -14dBm for low band and -8dBm for the WCDMA high band. The total current consumption is 9mA from a supply voltage of 1V. The LNTA has been designed in IBM’s 65nm CMOS process technology.","CMOS amplifier; active feedback; dual-band matching","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","The Department of Microelectronics of the Department of Microelectronics (ME) within the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (EEMCS)","","Microelectronics","",""

(mentor); Houtzager, O. (mentor)","2010","Modeling sedimentary heterogeneities of reservoir rocks is typically performed using geostatistical methods. Geostatistics reproduce the spatial distribution of heterogeneities based on available data. There are several geostatistical methods to build 3D reservoir model simulations, such as the object-based or variogram-based methods. MINES ParisTech has developed a new generation of models, both stochastic and process-based to reproduce the complex internal architecture of fluvial and turbidite reservoirs. The prototype software including this new approach is called Flumy. This process-based stochastic model simulates meandering channelized reservoirs at the reservoir scale. The purpose of this study is to build a realistic 3D geological model of complex fluvial reservoir architectures using the latest version of the processing modeling software Flumy. The project consists of using the current stand alone version to model a fluvial facies architecture of a subsurface data set from a Carboniferous fluvial succession located in the Southern North Sea. A series of 3D facies models based on the sedimentological interpretation of logs and modeling parameters were thus realised. Facies models were then exported to Petrel for quantitative analysis (e.g. sensitivity analysis and volume calculations). The process-based stochastic approach allows to obtain more realistic and reliable geological models. It respects the complexity of sedimentary processes and thus represents with more accuracy the lateral and vertical heterogeneities of fluvial reservoirs. The prototype software, Flumy, satisfies these requirements. However it is still under development and has limits and constraints which are described in this project.","geostatistics; stochastic; modeling; process-based; Flumy; fluvial; meandering; heterogeneity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Department of Applied Earth Sciences","","Section Applied Geology","",""

Two of these elements seem hard to grasp, and one moves the world. Together they form the ingredients for an interesting challenge; how can we provide comfort to the occupants of future cars? The power consumption of comfort features in a fuel efficient vehicle can reduce the vehicle range over 35%. From these comfort features, the HVAC has by far the largest impact. Reducing this energy consumption of HVAC systems in fuel efficient cars should therefore be a priority. Although the weight of comfort features also reduces vehicle range, the effect is much smaller. Real world test sustain the idea that the impact of the HVAC on the vehicle range of energy efficient vehicles is very large. The Human body is has a very narrow thermal comfort zone. The heat balance equation can predict if the body is experiencing thermal neutrality. This model does not predict local discomfort. Individual body parts experience comfort at different temperatures. The feet and legs generally need the most heating and the face and upper body the least. The following strategies can be used to lower energy consumption of the HVAC system:  Shift from global comfort to local comfort  Insulating and air recirculation  Shift from convective cooling to radiant heating  Lowering summer soak temperatures on warm days  Preheating the car on cold days  Use of Phase change materials Alternative comfort features have been developed and combined into a coherent interior design. PMV thermal simulation software has been used to make an estimation of the HVAC energy reduction in two scenario’s: Summer: Under these conditions the new comfort features result in a 50% lower HVAC load. Winter: the new comfort features result in a 33% lower HVAC load.","comfort; car; interior; thermal; energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-09-20","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

The bearing structure contributes for around 60% to the environmental costs due to material use in a building and thereby for a large part of the total environmental costs for a building. This impact can be reduced by means of ‘Sustainable Construction’. Problem definition At this moment, a comparison between structural designs are based on the cost and time of construction, the integration of architectural and installation design and the required construction height. Sustainability is not taken into account in this comparison. For the development of ‘Sustainable Construction’, it is necessary to indicate the degree of sustainability of the various structural alternatives for a building. The current tools for measuring the sustainability of buildings, such as GreenCalc+, GPR Gebouw and BREEAM-NL, are very extensive and not suitable to evaluate the sustainability of different constructive alternatives. Research My research focused on the development of a method and design tool for the determination of the degree of sustainability of structural designs. The approach was divided in three phases: 1. Analysis of the problem: study to the present assessment tools and the influence of the bearing structure on the sustainability of a building. 2. The development of the method: Determining the basis for comparison (annual environmental costs) and determining the total environmental costs of a building, based on the structural design, and its estimated service life. The estimated service life is calculated on the basis of the specific building characteristics. 3. Implementing the method into the design tool, written in Java, and testing the tool by determining the sustainability of four structural designs, made for an office. Results 1. A method for determining the sustainability of a building, based on the structural design. Improvements over the current assessment methods: - A more detailed calculation of the environmental costs of a building through a detailed calculation of the material quantities in the bearing structure. - A better approximation of the lifespan of a building. 2. An easy to use design tool to determine the sustainability of structural design variants. Conclusions and recommendations A flexible designed building, ready for future changes in use of the building, can have a long lifespan. For an accurate assessment of sustainability it is therefore required that the life of a building is determined on the basis of the specific building characteristics and not only on its function. The developed method is able to evaluate the flexibility and approximate the lifespan of the building. With the development of the method for evaluating structural designs sustainability, it is now possible to asses structures, that are well thought out, properly. In contrast to the current methods, investment costs in the flexibility of a building can be made visible in the annual environmental costs. This has a positive influence on the ‘Sustainable Construction’. It’s recommended that the calculation of the estimated service life of a building will be further developed and calibrated. Further the aspect of dismountable building has to be integrated in the assessment method.","duurzaamheid; constructies; levensduur; sustainability","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Building Engineering","","Structural Design","",""

The computation of electromagnetic fields inside the female breast. 2. The focussing of power such that the power dissipated in the tumor is maximized while the power dissipated in healthy tissue is minimized. In our investigation we simulate a two-dimensional configuration with a circular array of line-sources operating at a single-frequency within the range of 1 to 10 GHz.

(mentor); Mugge, R. (mentor); Jager, M. (mentor)","2010","The Brain, Body and Behavior department of Philips Research have been working on the development of a new technology based on the stimulation of the human brain through the visual sense. This stimulation is made by a light source that presents specific characteristics (frequencies given by flickering conditions) that can influence the brain activity and thus the mental states of the people. Since Philips as a company embarked in a new strategy of becoming a world-leading brand for health and well-being products, the research team has the aim of finding product applications for this technology in which it can improves the well-being of the consumers. The main objective of this project is to reach a conceptual approach for a product that applies this innovative technology being developed by Philips through a strategic process containing a market analysis, consumer research, conceptual exploration and finally a strategic advice for the product launching. The light stimulation technology gives the possibility to reach mental wellness states such as relaxation and cognitive performance. From this point, the current situation of the market is assessed, defining the product category as well-being enhancer products in which, traditional solutions as well as innovative ones are already competing. After analyzing the circumstances of the category, it has been found that the category is attractive for introducing a new product developed by Philips due to its large size and fast growth. Although there are some competitors already playing in the market, most of them are not fulfilling the needs as it can be done by the product in development. Moreover, Philips with its valuable brand awareness and image has a great advantage against the identified direct competitors that are mainly small companies. One of the objectives of the project is to define the appropriate target group for the product. For doing so, a segmentation analysis was conducted based on the behavior of the population towards health and well-being helping identifying which segment has the need for the benefits that the light stimulation can offer. The target group was defined as ‘Young professionals’ from 25 to 35 years old. This group has a visible stress and busy lives, are open to technology and new alternatives, and have a proactive behavior towards their health and well-being. Through focus group sessions, insights were gained from the selected target group that proved the attractiveness of these consumers for the developing project. The need for a solution to improve their mental well-being (mostly in the work environment due to their stressful lives) was visible. Moreover, possible usage scenarios were discussed leading to define that the usage of the product should fit and be adapted to their daily activities rather than demanding extra time. During the sessions, participants also tested competitor products, which gave the conclusion that what is being offered is not fulfilling their needs and expectations. From this point, it was possible to define the specific direction for the concept development. The product should be used on a working environment, and fit their working activities without being intrusive or distracting. The core benefit of the product was defined as light stimulation for recharging energy. This formed the base for the concept exploration, which was made through a creative session with participants that generated several ideas and some concepts through generative methods. The concepts were assessed and evaluated against the product requirements that were formed from the conclusions drawn from each phase of the project. A further development of the chosen concept was proposed and later taken as the base for the launching strategy. In the final phase, the strategic advice has the vision to support the communication of the value and benefits of the product to facilitate the adoption. It is designed keeping in mind the goal of adding value to Philips as a brand, being in line with the brand promise of sense and simplicity and spreading the image of their commitment to improving people’s health and well-being.","Strategic Product Design; Philips Research; Consumer Research; Light Stimulation; Well-being","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Wartenberg, L. (mentor)","2010","Van Nicholas -The titanium bicycle company- wants to extend her portfolio with a full titanium folding bike that is focussed on the urban commuting market. The mechanical properties of titanium are excellent for the application of a folding bike frame; strong and light. The new folding bike should differentiate itself from the competition by performance and appearance (clean, smooth and aerodynamic). The folding bike should not compete on price. It should be a high-end product for an exclusive target group that has special demands. The final design, the Tigris, is the result of combining the strength of titanium with top class components and innovative hinge solutions. The hinges are designed to be ‘invisible’ to enhance the smooth appearance and create the feel of riding a full sized bike. Competitive advantage of the Tigris are: Light weighted (10kg in total) Aerodynamic design (exclusive) Clean frame (no clamps or catches) Invisible hinges (smooth appearance) High usability (rolling folded package) Small folded package (118 Litres only) Good ride (large wheelbase, 18”wheels) High-end components (high efficiency) Belt drive (clean, durable, silent and light) The combination of these qualities is unique and therefore positions Van Nicholas immediately in the top ten of the folding bike market. The Tigris is designed for those who want to travel by folding bike as part of a mobility chain, while still maintaining a high image by its exclusive smooth design.","Titanium; Folding; Bicycle","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-09-16","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Van Breemen, E. (mentor); Vikström, T. (mentor); Boosman, M. (mentor)","2010","The goal of disaster management is to deploy the scarce amount of resources as effectively as possible. Exercises are needed, because disasters occur seldom while the logistical chain of disaster management is very complex. Currently the two most important support tools for these are EmergoTrain System (from Swedish institute KMC) and ISEE (from Dutch company E-Semble). Experts envision that combining the best from these two methods will result in a superb support tool. Therefore the following graduation assignment was written and executed within E-Semble: “Design a commercially viable product to combine the best of EmergoTrain System and ISEE in one exercise. This product should make disaster management training and exercises more effective.“ This graduation project led to the design of the Dynamic Gubbar System (DGS). Gubbe is Swedish for “little old grandpa” (plural: gubbar). All over the world, the paper puppets used in EmergoTrain System are called “gubbar”. As DGS is based on EmergoTrain, but offers dynamic vital signs, the word gubbar is included in the product name. The product design is documented in a thesis, in detailed technical drawings and in detailed functional specs. DGS consists of paper resource puppets and patient devices which are placed on vertical whiteboards. The patient devices come in an iPod Touch version and in a custom made version. The whiteboards simulate locations during a disaster (e.g. disaster scene and hospital wards). Students coordinate the whiteboards. They can play with the patients and resources on the whiteboards, thereby simulating disaster management procedures. All user-inputs run via the patient device’s touch screens, which are connected with a server. Extra computers are included in the system for instructors and students. Vital signs of patients are dynamic. They change over time or when correct treatments are executed on them. Important data is logged on the server and is accessible for instructors during the exercise and after action review. DGS offers a clear overview and intuitive interfaces. A prototype system was tested successfully during a medical incident commander course. DGS is targeted to train the silver and gold command levels (e.g. paramedics and coordinating hospital staff). Because of the computer based support, instructors can spend their time most effectively on students. The next step in development is to start up a pilot project together with three launching customers using the iPods Touch product version.","design; serious gaming; disaster management; logistics; chain; EmergoTrain; ISEE","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-09-16","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Van Lint, J.W.C. (mentor); Baggen, J.H. (mentor); Hoogendoorn-Lanser, S. (mentor); De Vries, Y. (mentor)","2010","With the pace of economy and the level of urbanization speedup, the vehicle possessions and usage has increased. The resulting traffic congestion has become a big problem in modern cities. Instead of new infrastructure supply, attention has been switched to a more efficient use of existing infrastructure. The fact that current road network capacity has not fully explored offers the opportunity for traffic management to play a role. Commissioned by the Dutch Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management, a pilot project called Praktijkproef Verkeersmanagement Amsterdam (PPA) as one of the most ambitious traffic management projects has finished its concept proof and ex-ante evaluation phase. In the project, a hieratical multi-level control approach is proposed for the metropolis of Amsterdam with various measures from local upgrades to network integrated traffic management. It is recognized that as more and more DTM measures are deployed, integration is needed to play full effect. Encouraging initial results have enlightened for investigation in other countries. Beijing, the capital of China, witnesses the boost economic and urban development in the past decades. At the same time, it is challenged by unprecedented traffic problems. In this study, the concept inspired by PPA project is extended to Beijing. Given the different background, the objective of the research is to investigate traffic characteristics in Beijing, conceptually design traffic management measures and schemes specific to Beijing situation, predict and evaluate the potential of traffic management in improving the traffic in Beijing. The need for traffic management can be explicated both from theoretical and policy perspective. From traffic theory, either conventional fundamental diagram or macroscopic fundamental diagram reveals the traffic property on link and network level. The underlying mechanisms indicate opportunity for the design of effective traffic management measures. And among the policy instruments, utilization weights out to be the optimal. Literature and past experience in traffic management are reviewed then on. Subsequently, the research objective is achieved by exploring to the Beijing network. Beijing has generally a distinguished grid type network with six urban ring expressways as the skeleton. Due to the recourse limitation in urban area, further road expansion is difficult. While at the same time, the considerable expansion rate of car-owner ship is expected to remain. In this case, it is anticipated that the gap between supply and demand will further grow. Next to that, the study digs into details of the network, figuring out the unique road structure and corresponding traffic flow behaviour. It is found that the urban ring expressway is very different from regular highway in structure, and so is the traffic composition on expressway. Lack of interface between expressway and urban roads as one of distinct points receives attention. The sensitive areas in the proximity of the interface: virtual on-ramp, off-ramp and weaving area is focused. Besides, other general traffic characteristics on main roads and distribution on different grade of roads are studied. Based on the findings, some traffic measures are innovated in the study tailoring to the traffic characteristics in Beijing. On a local level, static measures as simple infrastructure adjustment are recommended in accordance with local situation, and dynamic measures are further proposed in an attempt to be better reactive to the prevailing traffic dynamics. Afterwards, a four-phase integration framework is designed specific for incident situation as the first trail approach of traffic management integration. In the ensuing of this study, a case study is performed on a sub-network area in Beijing to predict and evaluate the potential of the proposed measures. It is done with the approach of simulation and modelling, DYNASMART-P 1.4 is utilized as the main simulation tool. According to the simulation result, local measures do show effect on local level, but deteriorate the network performance. As far as the author is considered, since the difference is so minor, some influential factors should be reconsidered. Under the two-designed incident case, integration of DTM measures according to the proposed phase scheme shows obvious effect in ameliorating the influence of non-recurrent case. However, the optimal phase of integration differs according to the severance of incident, indicating the decision point of level of integration is of an important issue. With the experience from foreign countries, research investigation, and modelling results, the future of Beijing traffic management is prospected at the end. Requirements of different phases of the traffic management development are looked into for Beijing case, it is concluded that traffic management is of potential and opportunity, thus should be paid special attention to in the future development in associating with other necessary policy instruments.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

(mentor); Peck, D.P. (mentor); Vander Velpen, B. (mentor)","2010","This project explores the opportunity of sustainability for Royal Haskoning (RH) to enrich its business. Reason for this study are the sounds heard that sustainability creates smaller and bigger changes in many sectors, and RH showing to be eager to aid in providing the needed technological innovation. As an engineering consultant however, RH is not innovative in the way required for sustainability: it is positioned at the final, highly defined stages of companies’ development processes. A first step in looking for ways to aid companies in their transition towards sustainability is therefore redefining the relation of RH and its clients. A research carried out among RH’s relations firstly verifies the demand for engineering knowledge in the field of sustainability. Secondly, it defines the field in which innovation for sustainability comes across, leading to an opportunity for the engineering consultant: Using a collaborative form of product development termed ‘open innovation’, the engineering consultant is thought to highly participate in companies’ innovation processes. That is, provided it lives up to certain game play. This new game play suggests the engineering consultant to take up the role of a matchmaker. In a collaborative context it will develop technology that creates new links between demand and offer. The research also points at a major hurdle for engineering consultants moving to this position: their focus on short term. A new way is suggested for Royal Haskoning as an organization to fit in the role of matchmaker by partially changing its business model to one that allows a long term approach. By setting up a separate structure termed ‘Royal Match’, RH employees are given the opportunity to develop technology in collaboration with clients and other partners. Additionally this project presents a conceptual tool design assisting employees in working with this new program.","sustainability; innovation management; corporate strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","PIM","","","",""

(mentor); Desmet, P.M.A. (mentor); Plettenburg, D.H. (mentor)","2010","In The Netherlands, about 3750 people have an arm prosthesis, and the rejection rate is astonishing. Especially in puberty, appearance and fashion become more important. Teenagers can be very honest, direct and even cruel in their opinion, and when you wear ‘an ugly prosthesis’ the criticism seems credible. Several studies were conducted with prosthesis wearers, their teenage peers and their prosthetics professionals, to measure the emotions and concerns regarding existing and futuristic prosthesis designs, as well as to evaluate the created concept designs. Natural appearance is an important issue, and therefore hook prosthetics are unsuitable with strong associations with pirates and robots. The cosmetic glove gets the most positive emotional responses of all existing prostheses. However, it is vulnerable, maintenance sensitive, expensive and unsuitable for physical activities teenagers perform during their active daily lives. A natural appearance is also achieved when a prosthesis looks like ‘it is covering a healthy limb’. This corresponds with prosthesis wearers who see their prosthesis not merely as a replacement of their arm, but as an accessory to their body. The ArmWear products elaborate on this idea, with a glove and elbowcover that can be worn over any existing hand-shaped prosthesis. ArmWear is a tailor made product, feasible to produce by the piece. Next to the natural appearance, the functions of the ArmWear allow the teenage prosthesis wearer to quickly add protection and grip to their cosmetic glove, and easily customise the appearance to match their personal style and clothing. DYO-Patches can be custom designed, in order to create a prosthesis they feel confident with and proud to wear.","armprothese; arm prosthesis; arm prosthetics; premo; emotions; teenagers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Medisign","",""

(mentor); Sleeswijk Visser, F. (mentor)","2010","The current electric shaving market is stagnating in many regions of the world; and the blade market share is growing faster than the electric shaving market share. Philips is looking for new business opportunities to grow market share in the shaving market. A growth business opportunity that consists on targeting young men that are about to start shaving with an electric shaving solution has been identified. By targeting youth when they are about to start shaving, Philips could increase the possibility of men to start shaving with the brand´s electric shavers. As a result, young men could stay loyal to the shaving method (and the brand) when buying shaving products in the future, ensuring market share growth of electric shaving appliances not only among young men but also among older men in the long term, as 45% of men stick to the shaving method they start shaving with either blade or electric shaving. The project started by defining the risks which the new business opportunity might mean to Philips, pinpointing the current focus of Philips electric shavers on bringing shaving performance to men above 25 years old, the limited knowledge of the company on young men´s needs when starting to shave, young men´s shaving competitive product environment, and emerging trends that encourage men to keep up a stubble or styled beard. This encouraged the definition of an exploratory research to better understand trends on young men´s personal care market, needs and motivations of young men when starting to shave and the analysis of potential product competitors. In addition, Philips Shaving and Grooming business was analyzed by focusing on the current product portfolio and product market introduction strategies. The conclusions of the sections exploratory research and Philips Shaving and Grooming business analysis defined the facts that gave the foundation to identify opportunities and threats, to define whether Philips should go forward or not with the new business opportunity of targeting young men (budget restrictions and calculations were not considered in the scope of the project when making the decision). The analysis of the opportunities and threats revealed the following reasons why Philips should go forward with the business opportunity: young men´s shaving needs and motivations were identified to which current shaving products in the market do not give a solution; next, opportunities to improve the value proposition for shaving appliances was identified, which could help to define new shaving solutions for starting to shavers that could bring new customers to Philips Shaving and Grooming every year, since the starting to shave market of young men is a yearly new market. In the contrary, the most relevant reasons why not to go further targeting young men were based on the current innovation process of Philips Shaving & Grooming, which is still in the transition of being a user centered company (which does not ensure the ability of the company to deliver on specific needs of young men); furthermore, competing brands showed to have strong communication campaigns that target young men with styling products, whereas Philips market introduction strategies focus on retail shops instead of in end consumers. In addition, young men showed no interest in spending money on shaving appliances, unless shaving would bring more relevance and advantages to their personal care routine. If the product innovation process Philips currently follows was changed to one that focuses on defining products that deliver on the previously identified specific needs of young men, and also defining a brand that promises to bring a solution to young men`s needs and motivations to shave, Philips could define a differential advantage between the rest of the competing products that focus on targeting young men either with styling products (which is not an identified need of starting to shavers), sending razor blades to starting to shavers (razor blades do not deliver on the wish of young men of not getting nicks and cuts when starting to shave) and with low end products (which just focus on cutting the hair of and therefore do not bring an additional value to the personal care routine of young men). Therefore, I advice Philips to go forward with the new business opportunity by switching the innovation program into a more user and brand driven process, in order to bring meaningful shaving solutions to young men; by developing solutions that deliver on the specific needs of starting to shavers and bring value to the personal care routine of young men. The following four steps were followed (based on brand driven innovation process) to define the strategy Philips should follow to bring meaningful solutions to young men. First, a brand that is meaningful for both young men and Philips was defined, by starting from young men`s shaving needs and personal care motivations to define the brand that will guide the company through the innovation process. Second, a brand push strategy was defined with specific guidelines that intend to guide the innovation process: three guidelines that came from the analysis of the future personal care market of young men defined the relationship between the brand and the young men, the analysis of the competitive product environment resulted on the definition of the positioning of the brand in the market and, the user’s needs and motivations analysis defined three different personas that intend to guide Philips when developing shaving solutions (the three personas will help Philips to focus on designing solutions on the aspects of the brand promise that matter the most to each of the different personas). Third, design guidelines that intend to turn the brand promise into tangible experiences of the young men were defined: the brand name, logo, guidelines to define the navigation on the website, etc. And last, different touch points (interaction between the young men and Philips) were designed which intend to visualize the proposed different interactions between young men and the brand, such as the product, the packaging and a facebook application among others.","brand; personal care","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-03-10","Industrial Design Engineering","Design management","","Strategic Product Design","",""

The literature will portray the initial skepticism towards the first signs of global warming and the depletion of unsustainable energy sources. It will lay out how the evolution of mild symptoms into hard realities -such as the exponential increase in droughts, hurricanes and other natural disasters-drove these polarized opinions to a unified global belief that radical measures in energy policy needed to be taken. The accounts will continue by describing how the global discussion then moved to the implementation of sustainable energy alternatives. And they might explain how this drove the competition between solar and wind energy industries, which in turn pushed the development of their technologies. Even though dynamic substructuring might not star in those passages, I believe it will contribute to the technological evolution needed to sustainably meet tomorrow’s energy demand. This includes the field of wind turbines. Dynamic substructuring is in essence a linear structural dynamic analysis methodology that models a structure by the assembly of a set of substructure models, hence segmenting the normal linear model. By the implementation of this approach, components can be validated individually and reduction techniques can be tailored to the characteristics of and interaction between the components. Moreover, processing costs can be reduced via parallel computing and the ability to interchange component models without having to re-build the entire dynamic structural model. However, when operational analyses such as time integration are required and the model or its components are expected to undergo large rotations or displacements, the dynamic substructuring methodology needs to be integrated into a formulation that includes rotational effects, such as the floating frame of reference formulation (FFR). This formulation places the linear structure model into a floating reference frame. The body’s deformations within this frame remain linear, but the frame’s kinematic description is highly non-linear. This often leads to major reductions in processing efficiency, diminishing the competitive advantage that dynamic substructuring offers in comparison to other formulations. In the case of the operational analyses of multi-megawatt wind turbines on the other hand, rotation forces on the important turbine sub-systems tend to be relatively low. Hence the engineer’s gut feel leads to the belief that the floating frame of reference formulation can be significantly simplified. By (partly) linearizing the terms in this formulation, processing costs might significantly reduce at the loss of only little accuracy in the analyses. This leads to the main research question of this thesis: To what extent can the rotational effects be simplified for various wind turbine operational analyses without significantly impacting their dynamic characteristics? In order to answer this question, a simple wind turbine dynamic model is constructed in the floating frame of reference formulation. The terms in this formulation are subsequently simplified by various approaches and evaluated in terms of accuracy and processing costs in three different time simulations. This findings of the analysis will indicate which simplification approach will provide accurate results at minimal processing cost. The results indicate that the processing cost of the 2.3 megawatt turbine model can be reduced to less than one percent with respect to the reference model in steady operation, at negligible accuracy loss. In more transient cases, such as the simulation of startup or (emergency) shut down, the degree of simplification needs to be reduced to maintain the accuracy of the model. this leads to a smaller reduction in processing cost, now to twenty percent in of the original processing costs. The research demonstrates that the simplification of rotational effects in turbine models is feasible and has a significant effect on the processing times of the codes. The thesis hence recommends further development of the simplified FFR formulations. The formulations could be implemented into dynamic substructuring tools, allowing the analysis of operational dynamic interaction of a system’s subcomponents at competitive processing costs. Also, turbines of other sizes could be investigated, possibly leading to a presentation of the simplifications in non-dimensional form. In result, tailored simplifications of rotational effects can be applied to any wind turbine model. From the theoretical perspective the thesis recommends further research into simplifying the FFR formulations using other parametrization techniques, such as Euler parameters and Rodriguez parameters. These might pose new opportunities in terms of processing efficiency. The optimization of dynamic turbine modeling will contribute to speedier design iterations that result in more cost effective turbine designs. With a little bit of luck this industry might consequently turn wind into a leading global supplier of energy. And who knows, the odd history book might mention the contribution of dynamic substructuring to this process.","modeling; wind turbine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-01-06","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

TUC’s ambition is to create South African-inspired products that express social & environmental awareness. With their products TUC would like to trigger their consumer to become more interested in sustainability. This ambition was inspired by the Ubuntu philosophy. They believe that by positioning a humanitarian fashion brand on the market, they have made the first step to be part of this common link. If being fashionable means you can help others, then buying one of our products can be beneficial in innumerable ways Ubuntu: Together we can create a better world! - TUC: designs the products - They: people from neglected areas get offered a job the profit goes to local children’s project - You as a consumer can be good for yourself and for someone else The purpose of this graduation project is to advise TUC how their future as a sustainable company can be guaranteed. Therefore it is important to place the brand Plakkies good on the market and to create a strategy which will lead TUC towards a healthy and responsible company with a clear future vision. Plakkies(first product of TUC) is a social minded flip-flop fabricated by TUC’s factory established near the slums of Durban in South Africa. All the profit made returns for 100% to children’s projects in SA. During TUC’s first business year, TUC was mainly product-focused. As Plakkies was so strongly supported by its stakeholders, it was on the market, without knowing if TUC was a still an NGO-project or already a company. From the start, they were missing a ‘shared understanding’ about what their business model actually is, which is crucial for any company. An elaborated strategy , called the ‘three-phase strategy’, which will lead TUC towards a healthy and responsible company with a clear future vision is created. The consumers’ perception will make the difference more than before. Communication, transparency is one of the strongest differentiation elements for a humanitarian fashion brand. Brands will have to make more efforts, both for total customer perception and for Corporate Social Responsibility, in order to keep on deserving the consumers’ trust. Outline of the ’three-phase strategy’: Phase 1: Heal - The most important aspect is to become a healthy, trustful, transparent and a humanitarian fashion brand. Phase 2: Stabilize - The main focus of the stabilization phase lays on the development of their product portfolio and to introduce new products into the existing markets. Phase 3: Grow - The main focus of the Growth Phase lays in the geographic expansion of the brand. Now TUC is stabilized, they have the wished image, a stable team, a nice product portfolio, and are ready to grow.","Corporate Social Responsibility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2010","At the moment, about 30 million people worldwide are suffering from hearing loss. Most people are helped with a simple hearing aid that just amplifies sounds coming to the ear. However, if the hearing loss is too severe, these aids will not help. More than 100.000 people worldwide need a more complex device in order to let them hear again. A cochlear implant is such a device and is partially implanted inside the human body. Today’s implants are not able to let people hear sounds as people hear them with normal hearing. The main cause can be found in the stimulation accuracy of the auditory nerve fibres. To improve this accuracy, research should be performed in order to improve stimulation algorithms, increase the amount of electrodes and focus the stimulation field of the electrodes. Researchers now reached the limitations of existing neural response readout systems needed for reading out the evoked compound action potential for their research. These limitations urge the need for a new neural response readout system having a dynamic range of 126dB, that is small, power efficient, has noise levels under 10µV and can handle input signals exceeding the supply voltage. The readout system will be able to read out 256 electrodes and is implemented in a MEMS cochlear implant. Existing techniques do not offer solutions to meet the above specifications. An overall readout system design is proposed based on compensation containing an input system, multiplexer, compensation circuit, amplifier and an analog to digital converter (ADC). Because the overall readout system is too big to design in one thesis, only the input system is handled. Existing techniques do not offer solutions to handle input signals above supply voltage being compact, power efficient, have high dynamic range and have a low noise contribution. A new technique based on additive instantaneous companding in order to record the evoked compound action potentials from the stimulated auditory nerve is proposed. Three alternative circuit implementations are proposed, two voltage domain implementations and a charge domain implementation. The proposed input systems are designed to be implemented in AMIS I3T25 (high voltage) CMOS technology. The charge domain circuit implementation is very promising only using 70 components, having a bandwidth of 10kHz, and a noise level of 1.1pV. It is capable to readout input signals which are bigger than the supply voltage while the signal information is preserved. For checking the correct working of the circuit, a signal reconstruction is performed. In addition, this charge domain implementation is never reported before in literature.","Neural readout; Additive instantaneous companding; Cochlear implants; evoked Compound Action Potential (eCAP); Human hearing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-09-10","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Electrical Engineering - Microelectronics","",""

(mentor)","2010","Cognitive rehabilitation exercises are typically not designed to be motivating. The use of virtual reality and gaming technology can help with increasing the patient’s motivation and adherence. A physically active gaming experience leads to an increased adherence and affective attitude and an increased incentive to engage with healthy behavior. A psychological perspective on player motivation allows game design to explicitly focus on motivational variables, while affective gaming mechanisms allow games to infer the player’s affective state and change their content accordingly. This research project investigated if neurocognitive rehabilitation exercises based on affective gaming and physically active interaction lead to an increase in motivation of elderly people, while improving their cognitive skills. Part of this project was carried out at the Sensory-Motor Systems (SMS) lab1 , under supervision of the lab’s director Prof. Dr. –Ing. R. Riener. The SMS lab is associated to the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich, and the University Hospital Balgrist, Medical Faculty, University of Zürich, Switzerland. The goal of this project presented has been to develop and evaluate the hypotheses, methodology, and system prototype to enable the SMS lab to conduct a clinical experiment which investigates patient motivation in virtual reality based neurocognitive rehabilitation. A prototype system was created consisting of an affective gaming based training and assessment environment for the mental rotation task. This prototype system was used in a pilot study with 9 able-bodied and healthy participants aged 55 to 80. The results support the hypothesis that use of affective game design elements (e.g. incorporation of high scores, achievement medals, adaptive difficulty, different game modes and offering affective feedback) is motivating to the elderly population to engage with rehabilitation exercises. The results also support the hypothesis that a physically active gaming experience (provided by e.g. embodied interaction mechanisms) is motivating to the elderly. However more data is needed for the results to be more conclusive.","cognitive rehabilitation; virtual reality; affective computing; games","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Mediamatics","","Media & Knowledge Engineering","",""

(mentor); Loeve, A.J. (mentor)","2010","To diagnose and treat colon cancer a colonoscopy is usually performed. Current colonoscopy is performed by advancing a colonoscope (scope) through the tortuous colon. However, the flexible scope often buckles when advanced. This can cause discomfort and pain for the patient and can make the examination of the colon difficult for the endoscopist. Guiding the scope, with an overtube that has a controllable rigidity, when the scope is advanced could reduce these problems. The rigidity of the overtube should be switched between a flexible state, that allows the insertion of the overtube, and a rigidified state that provides sufficient support to the scope. The PlastoLock overtube utilizes the glass transition of Purasorb© PLC 7015 (PLC). By changing the temperature of its PLC components from 43 to 5°C, the PlastoLock overtube is reversibly rigidified. A physical test model of the PlastoLock overtube shaft was developed and its stiffness at 43 and 5°C was determined. The tests showed a reliable, reversible and fast change in stiffness. The stiffness of the test model in flexible state is sufficiently low. However, the stiffness of the rigidified test model is insufficient. A larger change in stiffness was found when testing the test model submerged in water compared to passing water through the PLC components. The measured stiffnesses were considerably below expectation. Possible causes for this discrepancy were investigated, but require further testing to confirm. These future tests should also indicate whether the stiffness of the rigidified test model can be increased.","colonoscopy; overtube; variable stiffness; glass transition; PlastoLock","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-09-07","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

(mentor); Daamen, W. (mentor); Baggen, J.H. (mentor); De Vries, Y. (mentor)","2010","Congestion is a problem that nowadays is facing people all over the world. It affects (in different degrees) developed countries as well as undeveloped. Congestion and queues on freeways cost money due to loss of time and therefore productivity. As a result it is considered important to assess it, in order to determine the severity of the problem faced. In the case of the Netherlands, a clear and accurate review of the causes of congestion and their contribution to vehicle loss hours is missing. For that reason, Rijkswaterstaat [RWS] proposes to investigate this topic. As a result, the main matter of this project is to differentiate diverse types of congestion. Hence the main research objective is to design a method to automatically identify the recurrent and (the most common) non-recurrent delays during single occurrences, on Dutch motorways. To achieve this objective the research question is posed: “Which part of single event delays on the Dutch motorways is caused by the following non-recurrent elements: roadworks, incidents, and adverse weather conditions?”. Besides that, the intention is to answer a set of subquestions and sub researching objectives, which are naturally related with the main research question. To accomplish these goals, it was necessary first to have a clear definition of congestion, which in this study was used travelling below a reference speed. It is also required to have a clear differentiation between recurrent and non-recurrent congestion. These are the elements that will be measured in this report. Reviewing the existing methodologies to assess different congestion, it was found that exist two main approaches to assess different congestion components: simulation-based and data driven. They both were examined in order to determine which would be the most suitable approach to be used in this study. Taking into account several factors, it was decided that the most promising approach is data driven, and thus it is the used in this report. During the checking process it was noticed some gaps in the existing methodologies to assess congestion, which are: explicit assessment of various causes of non-recurrent congestion, possibility to add in the model new causes of non-recurring congestion, different to those originally considered, lack of a structured methodology, and lack of considering network effects. Hence the new proposal fills all these gaps. Bearing in mind these facts and based on the existing methodologies, a new method was proposed to assess and to distinguish the different parts of the congestion: recurrent and non-recurrent, expressed in terms of delays. Given that the data collection process in the Netherlands uses inductor loop sensors spaced approximately 500 m, then the input data are speeds and flows measured by these sensors per motorway sections (space between these detectors) aggregated every 5 min. The remaining inputs are network configuration and databases containing time and locations of the mentioned nonrecurrent events. The outputs are the delays, classified in total, recurrent, non-recurrent with known and unknown (other) causes. The methodology was validated to show that its outcomes are realistic, and they are properly measuring the field conditions. The methodology was applied to a case study with real data. It was chosen a zone in the Randstad area including the A4, A13, A20, and A12 motorways in the Netherlands. The resulting delays data were analyzed and some conclusions were derived from the case study. It was found that in this area the A13 and the A20 present the higher congestion levels. It was also found that recurrent delays represent more than 50% of the total delays and among the considered causes of non-recurrent congestion, incidents is the one that occur more often. In addition to the goal of measuring non-recurrent delays, it was also considered the existing policies and measures created in the Netherlands to handle them. It was found that they are the result of several years of investments and developments. Therefore, the existing policies and measures to tackle non-recurrent congestion (mainly Incidents Management IM and roadworks planning) have high quality. Nevertheless it is considered that it is required further integration of the above mentioned measures with ITS services, in terms of traffic management measures and an extensive use of the providing information services. The last is especially evident in handling adverse weather conditions, as one of the considered sources of non-recurrent congestion. It was found in the results of non-recurrent delays classified as ‘other causes’ are higher than expected. Part of it is originated in bottlenecks whose cause is not among the databases. Therefore it is considered that although the quality of the existing information is high, it is still necessary more information about different kinds of occurrences, different from those considered in this study. The case study results are promising, however the developed methodology requires more data (in more motorways and considering more time) in order to derive more generic conclusions.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

(mentor); Bombois, X.J.A. (mentor)","2010","The European power market has changed substantially over the past twenty years. Increased competition, increasing use of renewables and environmental regulations contributed to a power market in which the power supply and demand fluctuates more frequently than ever. By nature, most power plants are sensitive to these fluctuations. The main reason for this is coupling between throughput (i.e. power output) and quality (e.g. pressure, temperature) and coupling amongst the quality parameters itself. As a consequence, when throughput fluctuates the quality is disturbed and oscillations occur in many of the process loops. Since these oscillations reduce power plant efficiency, increase wear and reduce plant lifetime it is desired to investigate solutions. In this study the effect of multivariable advanced process control (MIMO APC) on internal process loop oscillation and performance is investigated. Furthermore, the effect of improved process loop control on overall power plant performance is studied. To this end, a conventional drum-boiler power plant simulator (PID-controlled) is equipped with an Hinf-controller. A safe shutdown master-slave control structure is proposed to enable practical implementation. To accentuate the influence of improved internal process loop control on overall performance, the Hinf-controller will be responsible for four boiler process loops (the boiler has a central role in determining the overall behavior of power plants). This study shows that MIMO APC is a viable method for reducing oscillations and improving performance of internal process loops. It has become clear that better internal control also improves overall power plant performance. As a result, the effective maximum power production rate can be increased, which was found to have a surprisingly small effect on the achieved performance increase. These results indicate that it is possible to increase the economic potential of power plants using MIMO APC.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

Subsequently, the design of the port master plan can commence in which first of all the approach channel, harbor basins and manoeuvring and berth areas have been designed. As a next step the characteristics of the various terminals have been determined, under which the number of berths, quay length and surface areas. After using all port elements listed above jointly, several port masterplan layouts have been drawn up. From these port masterplan layouts, the most promising alternative has been selected after comparison by means of a Multi Criteria Analysis (MCA) on various criteria under which nautical ease, safety, expansion possibilities and costs. Concluding to this, the selected port masterplan layout has been optimized. The resulting harbour layout has been assessed regarding the topic of in-port wave penetration and propagation. Limiting operational wave criteria have been defined and relevant wave processes have been evaluated with the wave simulation model DIFFRAC-2DH. In order to decrease wave reflection due to monolithic breakwaters (and thus the port’s downtime), new simulation runs were carried out with an improved breakwater configuration using low-reflectivity caissons. With these wave-dampening improvements included, the simulation model runs yielded very positive results. The wave study was concluded with an assessment on port oscillations as a result of earthquakes, tsunamis and meteorological forces. After the performed wave study, the port breakwaters have been designed. For this, two typical cross-sections were selected. After including construction constraints and wave damping measures, a rubble mound breakwater was designed with a specific armour layer, and a vertical composite breakwater as a perforated wall caisson on a rubble mound foundation bed. The application of wave energy absorbing measures is a necessity in order to minimize the port’s downtime, and will have to be included in a final design. The designed port masterplan layout meets all specifications and requirements and its breakwaters are adequate in creating calm in-port berthing conditions resulting in high uptimes of the berths.","port; design; masterplan; layout; container terminal; bulk terminal; Nador; Morocco; breakwater; wave penetration; wave study; diffrac; wadi; MCA; evaluation; multi criteria analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-09-02","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

The target of this thesis is to design and implement a Linux-based application which can synchronize multimedia playback over a WPAN with high accuracy. By analyzing the synchronization requirements, the synchronization problem is decomposed into playback synchronization and clock synchronization. To achieve a synchronized playback based on synchronized clocks, we explore several open source projects and eventually build a synchronized player which can play video with frame-by-frame level synchronization. For clock synchronization, the principles of a typical computer clock and the most popular time synchronization – NTP are studied. Based on that, a new time synchronization protocol with quick-start and anti-interference properties is designed. We also conduct a survey to test if the application meets the users’ requirement of synchronized playback. The final results show that our application provides a synchronized playback with the accuracy which is acceptable for most users.","synchronization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-09-07","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","Master Electrical Engineering Track Telecommunications 2008","",""

Although notable real-time performances have been achieved, these works rarely satisfy both real-time processing and high stereo matching quality requirements. In this thesis, we propose a stereo matching algorithm suitable for hardware implementation based on the VariableCross and the MiniCensus algorithm. Furthermore, we provide parallel computing hardware design and implementation of the proposed algorithm. The developed stereo matching hardware modules are instantiated in an SoC environment and implemented on a single EP3SL150 FPGA chip. The experimental results suggest that our work has achieved high speed real-time processing with programmable video resolutions, while preserving high stereo matching accuracy. The online benchmarks also prove that this work delivers leading matching accuracy among declared real-time implementations, with only 8.2% averaged benchmark error rate.

(mentor)","2010","Financial options are contracts which define rights on stocks in a financial market. Real options arise in for example economical, personal or societal context. The holder has a real option in the sense of a real `choice'. Real options appear in for example the dike height problem, where one has to make optimal choices about when to increase the dike level and by which amount. Another example is the forest harvesting problem, where one can determine the harvesting time. (Real) option prices can often be formulated as a stochastic optimisation problem. The impulse control problem represents a problem class which incorporates jumps on the state process, like an instantaneous jump in the dike level. The dynamic programming principle can be derived from the above representation. The infinitesimal version results in the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. Two pricing methods for financial and real options have been discussed. The first method is called the dynamic programming approach. In this case we assume that risks cannot be hedged and the holder asks a risk adjusted discount rate for holding the option. In the second approach it is assumed that the asset markets are rich enough to be able to hedge risks and the market will not reward the holder for holding his risky option. This method is called the contingent claims approach. We focused on the dike height problem based on work of Kempker and v.d. Pijl. The state dynamics of a basic model consisted of the dike height and the stochastic economic value of endangered goods, which is exposed to possible floods. The average water level was supposed to follow a deterministic function. Occurrences of extreme water level may cause flooding and they were added to the model. The controller can perform dike heightenings at certain construction costs. A recursive algorithm based on Fourier-cosine series expansions, called the dike-COS method, enabled us to solve the dike height problem. With this we obtained a control law, which describes when it is optimal to increase the dikes and by which amount, depending on the economic value of endangered goods and the current dike level in comparison with the water level. Parameter variation showed that the real option value, in other words the expected costs of flood protection under optimal heightenings, increases in the expected economic growth and the intensity rate of extreme water level and decreases in the risk adjusted discount rate. An alternative model, incorporating a stochastic average water level, was also considered and we developed an extended two-dimensional algorithm. The results showed that the expected costs of flood protection increase if the volatility of the average water level is increased. A method which considers several scenarios of deterministic water level, instead of a stochastic level, may perform satisfactorily to estimate the real option value under uncertain water level rise.","real options; fourier-cosine expansion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Numerical Analysis","","Applied Mathematics","",""

To support this the Clean Sky Joint Technology Initiative (JTI) is developing and improving breakthrough technologies, that will be demonstrated on a flying prototype. The Clean Sky JTI is split up into six technology domains; one of these is the Smart Fixed Wing Aircraft (SFWA). This domain aims to develop and test a new wing design that makes use of passive and active flow and load control technologies. Department of Systems Engineering and Aircraft Design (SEAD) at Delft University of Technology has been asked to develop a simulation framework to support the internal systems design on the Smart Fixed Wing Aircraft. During this thesis work a parametric model and framework has been created for two flow control technologies and their pneumatic supply system. The model is based on Knowledge Based Engineering (KBE) techniques, which aim to increase the productivity of engineers and allow more detailed and fair concepts trade-offs. The two selected ‘smart technologies’ are Hybrid Laminar Flow Control (HLFC) and Fluidic Actuated Flow Control (FAFC). The first extends laminar flow using a combination of Natural Laminar Flow and Boundary Layer Suction. The second delays separation, stalling and buffeting by reenergising the boundary layer using pulsating or synthetic jets. The parametric model creates a 3D representation of various internal system concepts, which is used to evaluate the Internal Aerodynamics, External Aerodynamics (HLFC only), weight and cost. The internal aerodynamic analysis uses handbook relations and has been incorporated into the KBE environment. It has been validated for conceptual design with limited success. External aerodynamics is performed with a link to Xfoil-suc. The cost and weight are currently based on component and (sheet-)material price and weight. The product model created in this thesis work can evaluate multiple concepts of the internal system for both ‘smart technologies’ and thereby allow a more detailed and fair trade-off. Due to the lack of available input specifications, e.g. aircraft-type and external aerodynamic data, a trade-off between the concepts could unfortunately not yet be made.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Systems Engineering and Aircraft Design","","","",""

(mentor); Van Paasen, L.A. (mentor); Mulder, A. (mentor)","2010","This project focuses on the shear strength of Devonian sandstone cobbles that will protect the area between the sea-water breaker and the beach and will be used to construct a runway for a large crane for the new Maasvlakte 2. In rock slope design the shear strength of sliding interfaces is often based on Coulomb’s model in which shear strength (?) is expressed as a function of cohesion (c), normal load (?) and the friction angle (?). A specific model on shear strength behaviour of rockfill is proposed by Barton (Barton, 2008). Barton’s model can be used to predict shear strength of rock joints and rock fill when basic rock properties are known. One main factor of influence on shear strength of rockjoints and rock fill is the basic friction angle. A Golder direct shear box was used to obtain the basic friction angle of the Bremanger sandstone. First the basic friction angle was determined (using flat saw-cut surfaces). In the next phase fresh tensile cracked rock discontinuities were tested. Measured stresses were corrected using measured dilatancy to estimate the basic friction angle. The influence of different rock properties such as roughness, rock strength and visible layering was studied. Finally natural non-matching surfaces were researched to see how the shear strength changes due to the weathering and smoothening of the rock. The following main results and conclusions were drawn from the research project: Flat saw-cut surfaces: - The basic friction angle of the Bremanger (flat saw-cut surfaces) was not measured correctly. Since the sample halves were polished in order to make them match, the measured friction angle is rather an indication of the polishing process than the rock properties. Tensile-cracked surfaces: - For the tensile cracked samples, the average residual friction angle is 1111 degrees. The residual friction angle was used as the basic friction angle rather than the peak friction angle since high peak shear stress values are caused by asperities at the edges of the tested samples. The shear strength dropped massively as soon as these asperities broke off. - Residual friction angles do not depend on wet or dry test conditions. - There is a direct link between UCS and shear strength. The higher the UCS value, the higher the residual stress value. - The Bremanger sandstone is a Metasandstone. Layering is still macroscopically visible but cleavage does not occur along this layering. Natural non-matching surfaces: - These surfaces were weathered and smoothened. This caused the residual friction angle to drop to 1111degrees. 3D Leica pictures confirmed that the surface of this tested sample was smoother than the fresh tensile-cracked ones.","Bremanger; friction angle; Barton; rock joints; rock fill; basic friction angle; residual friction angle; shear stress; golder shear box; maasvlakte","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geotechnology","","Geo-Engineering","",""

On the other hand, the tolerable overtopping discharges are defined at certain points behind the crest where the total overtopping is reduced. The scope of this thesis is to find an empirical formula to describe the distribution of overtopping at the space behind the crest. This thesis comes as a further investigation on the work conducted by v.Kester [2009] for regular waves. In this research, a physical model was developed on which irregular waves are tested. Because of the duration of the tests and the amount of collected water (significant lose of water during the test), a completely new measuring system was designed. Five influencing parameters (variables) are considered on this research: wave height, wave period/steepness, slope angle, crest freeboard and crest permeability. The entire overtopping process is analysed separately for the total overtopping discharge, the overtopping discharge directly behind the crest and the distribution of overtopping behind the structure. In the analysis of the data collected from the measurements, the impact of the varying parameters is investigated leading to useful conclusions and better understanding of the entire process. Additionally, the experimental findings are analysed and compared to the relative existing methods. Based on the TAW [2002] method which is proposed by the EurOtop Manual [2007], a prediction formula is developed. This formula is a generic version of TAW [2002] formula in which a new reduction factor ?c is introduced in order to describe the decay of the overtopping and thus predict the discharge at any certain distance behind the crest. Other relevant methods are also analysed (Juul Jensen [1984], Steenaard [2002], Besley [1999] and v.Kester [2009]) and conclusions for their applicability are drawn leading to suggested improvements or corrections. Apart from the distribution of overtopping, on this thesis the determination of crest freeboard (which is an ambiguous issue) is also investigated. Finally, suggestions of further research on this topic are discussed.

(contributor)","2010","Singapore’s coastal waters are characterised by relatively complex tidal behaviour due to it’s location between two large oceans with different tidal regimes. This complex tidal behaviour results in poor understanding of the hydrodynamics and sediment dynamics. The hydrodynamics of the Johor River estuary, including part of the Singapore Strait and the Johor Strait, are investigated with a computational model in order to enhance the understanding of the sediment dynamics. The computational model used for this study is the Singapore Regional Model Refined and Aligned (SRMRA), which was developed applying the Delft3D modelling system. The domain of this validated model covers part of the Andaman Sea, South China Sea and Java Sea. An intra-tidal analysis over a period of 25 hours reveals that the tide propagates throughout the entire study domain up to the northernmost part of the Johor River. During the ebb phase in the estuary, the flow in the Singapore Strait is in the eastern direction. In contrast to many other shallow estuaries, the water levels are observed to be ebb dominant the further upstream. The transport patterns in the Johor River estuary on a larger timescale are described by means of the residual flow. The depth averaged residual flow is stronger and more multi-directional near the mouth of the Johor River estuary than in the upstream part. An ebb dominant and flood dominant channel can be observed. The residual flow in the surface layer is directed in the ebb direction and the residual flow in the third layer from the bed is directed in the flood direction. Moreover, the residual flow in the surface layer is stronger than the residual flow in the lower layer. The model predicts roughly a larger bed shear stress in the southern part of the Johor River estuary than in the northern part. In the area around Pulau Tekong the bed shear stress consequently was found to exceed most of the time 0.1 N/m2, which is considered a reasonable value for the critical bed shear stress for erosion of fine sediments. In the northernmost part of the Johor River the predicted bed shear stress is small enough for a sediment trap to be developed. Analysis of the particle paths shows that during the period of flood tide, flow from the Johor Strait may travel into the Johor River. Once a particle flows out of the estuary into the Singapore Strait during ebb, it is not likely to flow back into the estuary during flooding.These findings contribute to a larger understanding of the hydrodynamics and sediment dynamics of the Johor River estuary.","estuary; tidal channels; tidal computations; singapore","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Singapore-Delft Water Alliance","",""

(mentor)","2010","One of the failure mechanisms of a rubble mound breakwater is the failure of its armour layer. In order to determine the stability of an armour layer, the design load has to be defined, which is in fact the wave that attacks the structure. Being a highly stochastic phenomenon, the wave action is not easily defined, while there is always some uncertainty inherent to its definition. In a deterministic calculation this uncertainty is totally overlooked, as the possible variations of the design wave height are not taken into account. In order to incorporate uncertainties into the design process, and therefore increase its reliability, probabilistic design methods should be applied. A commonly used approach is a semi-probabilistic computation on level 1, which introduces the application of partial safety coefficients, yet the indicated methods to derive and apply them do not clarify the uncertainties incorporated, adding an undefined degree of safety in the process, or end up with incorrect results under certain conditions. Another approach is a fully probabilistic computation on level 2 or 3. This type of design tackles explicitly a great deal of uncertainties, hence its results can be considered much more accurate. However it is not commonly used, due to the fact that there are not straight forward guidelines to support it, and therefore a number of critical decisions by the designers are required. The main objective of this study is to indicate the weaknesses of the existing design methods, and to suggest a design approach that is both attractive to designers and sufficiently reliable. This is achieved through application of the existing methods in an example case, whose features facilitates a critical assessment, and enables formulation of an improved approach. The chosen case is the jetties at the entrance of Galveston port, in the Gulf of Mexico, and the features of interest are the hurricane-dominated hydraulic climate and the fact that the structure is located in shallow water, meaning that the design load is determined by depth-limited waves. The design methods that are demonstrated are a classical deterministic design, a semi-probabilistic calculation on level 1 as proposed by PIANC in 1992, and a fully probabilistic calculation on level 3 with a Monte Carlo simulation. Based on the evaluation of the three design processes and the results, the new approach can be developed, which suggests a rational framework for deriving safety factors. According to it, a set of safety factors is generated which incorporate the same uncertainties as a fully probabilistic design; hence an equally reliable result is extracted. The final product is a guideline for code makers indicating the procedure to derive the safety factors and a guideline for future designers indicating the analytic steps for a proper use of the safety factors. In addition a large number of concluding remarks are summarized, which can contribute in optimizing the performed analysis. The concluding remarks refer in particular to the determination of hydraulic boundary conditions, the application of the design methods, the probabilistic model used for Monte Carlo simulation, the proposed design approach, and the safety factors derived with this approach.","armour layer; partial safety factors; design methods","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

In this regard, research into the two-bladed rotor has garnered some interest in the recent past, to see if the optimum cost can be shifted in the favor of the two-bladed wind turbine. Objective: The objective of this thesis was to determine the costs of energy delivered by a two-bladed wind turbine and a three-bladed wind turbine and to determine which turbine’s cost is lower. Energy cost was treated as the main discerning factor between the turbines. Method: Two concepts were defined; the two-bladed wind turbine and the threebladed turbine. For the three-bladed concept two cases were considered; one with a design tip speed ratio equal to that of the two-bladed concept and another with a design tip speed ratio lower than the first case. Only the rotor and the support structure were designed. For the rotor, Delft University airfoils were used. The Blade Element Momentum theory was used to design the rotors and to obtain the rotor power and thrust. Support structures were designed based on the Rayleigh method for stepped piles. Bladed 3.80 was used to determine fatigue damage of the rotors and support structures. Components in the nacelle were not designed but their masses were estimated using scaling relations. These masses along with rotor and support structure masses were translated into Euro’s using cost factors obtained from literature. An offshore site roughly 70km from shore was selected and hundred of these designed turbines were hypothetically installed at this site. Cost of installation and electrical infrastructure was obtained from data available. From this and the rotor and support structure costs the investment cost was obtained. The Annual Energy Yield of the turbines was also calculated. These, along with operation and maintenance costs were used to calculate the energy cost. Main Results: From the design iterations it was seen that the energy cost of the twobladed turbine was slightly lower than that of the three-bladed concept with a lower design tip speed ratio. Another important result of this report was that a three-bladed turbine with a tip speed ratio equal to that of the two-bladed turbine gave the lowest energy costs. It was also seen that the energy yield of the two-bladed concept is lower than that of the three-bladed concept and support structure costs for the two-bladed concept is higher.","Windenergy; wind turbine; two-bladed; three-bladed; rotor; tip speed ratio; blade; support structure; nacelle; LPC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Wind Energy","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

CFIAs are attractive for sensor readout, because of their high CMRR and their ability to interface with ground-referenced sensors. Several chopping and auto-zeroing techniques have been developed to reduce the offset and 1/f noise of such amplifiers to the ?V level. As a result, their dominant source of error is now gain error, which is limited by mismatch to at best 0.1%. This paper describes a CFIA that applies dynamic element matching (DEM) to achieve a gain error of less than 0.04%. Moreover, it presents the first silicon implementation of the ping-pong-pang (PPP) auto-zeroing scheme, which enables a 3.5× reduction in power consumption and 2.5× improvement in gain error as compared to state-of-the-art ping-pong auto-zeroed CFIAs.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Electronic Instrumentation","",""

(mentor); Zaaijer, M.B. (mentor); van Rooij, R.P.J.O.M. (mentor); Kling, W.L. (mentor)","2010","Maintenance of offshore wind turbines is much more expensive than that of onshore machines. Several suggestions have been made in this respect to reduce operation and maintenance costs by employing simpler turbine concepts with higher reliability. Particularly, stall-controlled machines have been suggested as robust and reliable options that could lower operation and maintenance costs, due to the lack of a pitch mechanism and its control system and because of the lower failure rates they seem to have. This turbine concept, however, trades-off turbine performance against operation and maintenance costs. The focus of this thesis is to determine the possible gains regarding operation and maintenance and the losses in power performance resulting from changing turbine concept from pitch to stall control. To do so a design assessment of a baseline, pitchcontrolled turbine and an alternative, stall-controlled one is carried out. The turbines are designed for an IEC class IA and aimed for a specific location in the North Sea. The designs are then compared and evaluated according to their technical and economical performance. Qualitative as well as quantitative comparisons are pursued to get insight in the advantages and disadvantages of each concept when intended for offshore locations. The energy yield, availability, operation and maintenance and levelised production costs associated to each turbine design are estimated to identify which turbine option could lead to the most benefits in the case of an offshore wind farm. From the analysis made it can be observed that the use of a stall-controlled scheme does contribute in reducing the operation and maintenance expenses of an offshore wind farm project. The loss in performance, however, surpasses the gains in maintenance and availability attained.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Wind Energy","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""
