(mentor); Root, B.C. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Spacecraft navigation and control is difficult in deep space operations. Especially around asteroids, the irregular gravity field increases the difficulty of estimating the spacecraft trajectory. Autonomous navigation can increase the safety and accuracy for orbit proximity operations. Furthermore, it eliminates the need for continuous communication with the spacecraft. For the implementation of autonomous navigation in deep space, the onboard guidance navigation &amp; control (GNC) should be able to accurately estimate the attitude and relative position of the spacecraft. By using sensor fusion, information from individual sensors can be combined to increase certainty and accuracy of the state estimation. A sensor fusion model is proposed, comprising an inertial measurement unit (IMU), star tracker and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) as navigation sensors. The aim of this research is to investigate the feasibility and performance applying sensor fusion for the spacecraft state estimation.<br/><br/>A navigation filter is applied to a benchmark scenario that orbits an asteroid at 50 km. In this scenario, asteroid 433 Eros has been selected for its unique shape, which has been mapped during the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) mission. A simulation is performed to approximate the dynamics and kinematics of the mission environment. The simulation takes a polyhedron model of the asteroid, a third-body disturbance by the sun, and an additional acceleration due to solar radiation pressure into account. The simulation forms a base for the sensor measurement simulation. As the IMU consists of an accelerometer and a gyroscope, the measurements total to two sets of available data for position as well as attitude estimation.<br/>The navigation filter estimates the position, velocity, attitude and gravitational constant of the asteroid, by use of an extended Kalman filter (EKF). The EKF is augmented for the quaternion states to a multiplicative extended Kalman filter. The navigation filter is simulated for a benchmark scenario, as well as for different orbital heights and temporary loss of the star tracker as well as the LiDAR sensor.<br/><br/>As a result, it is concluded that it is feasible with the given sensor set to approximate the position and attitude of a spacecraft in proximity of 433 Eros. For the position, a root-meansquare error (RMSE) of 0.5 m is found at an orbital height of 50 km. Using a time step of 0.1 s for the EKF is recommended after a trade-off between accuracy and computational time. It is concluded that the proposed model for state estimation is sufficiently accurate for position and attitude estimation for the given benchmark scenario. With this navigation filter, we come one step closer to the development of autonomous navigation for asteroid observing spacecraft.","Autonomous Navigation; asteroid observation; Extended Kalman Filter; Star tracker; LiDAR; IMU; Sensor Fusion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Pan Oston is a company who makes steel product like checkouts and kiosks for the retail market. A sizable part of Pan Oston’s revenue are checkouts and self-checkouts (SCOs). It is expected that in the future of retail these products are less relevant. This is why Pan Oston has requested the design of an improved gate that will be used in self-checkout areas and in future checkoutless stores. It is also requested to design a system that replaces the currently often used barcode scanner that automatically lets people pass the gate or block them.<br/><br/>A gate is designed that improves upon existing gates in terms of communication, seamlessness and ease-of-use. The goal of this gate is to make it easy and pleasant for customers to leave the SCO area while supporting the SCO host by giving him/her more control. By using animated green, orange and red lights that are intuitively integrated in the gate, communication between customer and gate is optimized. Sounds are played in case of a warning or an alarm. This gives customers extra hints on what is going on but most importantly alerts the host and other store personnel of the gate’s current situation so that they are always aware even if they are not looking. The gate can be customized if needed, which is one of Pan Oston specialties. In summary the gate improves upon its competing gates in communication, looks, focus on the host and theft-prevention.<br/><br/>For the auto-passthrough system Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is used. By attaching BLE signal emitter to the baskets and carts and by placing BLE signal receivers at the SCOs and gate we can keep track of who has paid and who has not and let them leave or block them accordingly. BLE is used because the system will be applied in existing and future supermarkets that use SCO areas. These are supermarkets people are often dependent on so we cannot use biometric technology like face recognition, even though these technologies are incredibly powerful. Because not all customers will like being a part of these technologies, they cannot be applied in these stores. The flip side is that it is now mandatory to use a basket or cart and no more than 1 basket or cart is allowed per group that shops together.<br","Retail; BLE; Access Control; Gate design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Sometimes, this rhythmic behaviour is affected by abnormalities in the tissue. These conditions are referred to as cardiac arrhythmias. One kind is of specific interest, called atrial fibrillation (AF). To further study AF, methods have been developed to estimate the conductivity of cardiac cells based on the measured electrical signals. In addition, other parameters of interest besides the conductivity are involved. The goal of this project was to consider one of the parameters in the electrogram (EGM) model: the sensor-to-cell height.<br/>First, we studied the effect of the height as a parameter in the model when used for conductivity estimation. To that end, a detector was built with which we can explain the effect of all involved parameters on the ability to accurately estimate any parameters of interest.<br/>In addition, we considered the case where the height is unknown and is estimated, thus possibly including estimation errors. The focus was on the consequences of making errors in the estimation of the height with respect to conduction block detection and conductivity estimation.<br/>Lastly, the effort was made to estimate the height. Here, the optimisation problem of height estimation was formalised and derived as its implementable form. At first, a simplified EGM model was assumed in order to mimic and estimate cell-specific effects, i.e. the cell conductivities. Then, the height was estimated in various situations to study its behaviour and performance under different conditions. Then, also the standard EGM model was used in the same way, after which we also tested the performance of the designed algorithm in combination with existing conductivity estimation methods.","cardiac arrhythmia; atrial fibrillation; conductivity estimation; sensor-to-cell height estimation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Signals and Systems","",""

Practitioners in a few industries, such as public relations, have been at the forefront of personal branding and will continue to attract people from other industries and even graduates to start focusing on building and managing their personal brands. In the near future, personal branding may become mandatory for graduate jobseekers and even further popularized in university and college vocational education.<br/>Previous studies have shown that personal branding can help improve graduates’ employability, which is done through a three-stage approach: firstly, establishing their brand identities, then positioning their brands to the audiences, and finally checking how well it matches the company’s brand for which they are seeking employment. This study conducted empirical research on 80 science/engineering graduates no more than two years ago to determine the level of correlation between each of the three and their perceived employability through PLS-SEM analysis. On this basis, the study also explored whether and to what extent perceived external marketability plays a role in the impact of personal branding on perceived employability.<br/>The PLS-SEM analysis results show that the conceptual model is a good fit. According to our research, the impact of graduates' core personal brand identity and personal brand positioning on perceived employability is not significant. This finding makes us think about whether the current personal branding guidelines, which generally focus on improving personal brand positioning, are really useful. The study also found that extended personal brand identity had a direct contribution to graduates' perceived employability. The most important finding is that the fit between personal brand and company brand makes the most difference for graduates' perceived employability, and perceived external marketability also plays a significant mediating role. This reveals that future graduates should look more into their brand fit with the preferred company when seeking employment.<br/>This study provides valuable new insights into the impact of personal branding on the perceived employability of science/engineering graduates. Although the results are encouraging, future researchers can build on this study with longitudinal or cross-sectional follow-up studies.","Personal branding; Structural Equation Modelling(SEM); Perceived employability; Brand identity; Brand positioning; Fit with the company brand; Perceived external Marketability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Open innovation ensures that there is a mutual flow of knowledge and skills between organizations. In this regard, the focus of open innovation is on forming mutually beneficial connections that can ensure competitive advantage. The market gets optimized processes and technologies, and the organization can achieve profitability. Although open innovation can have many benefits, it also brings challenges. The most important is the support within an organization to adopt open innovation. Employees are critical to open innovation. If organizations want to achieve successful open innovation, they must embed open innovation into the organization's mission and vision. This report maps the relationships between middle management leadership behaviors and employee open innovation behaviors. Leadership behaviors focus on developing the behaviors of employees and leaders themselves in relation to open innovation. Leadership encourages the development of employees' personal and professional skills. Leadership emphasizes decisions to build and maintain relationships and to promote open innovation behavior among employees, thus stimulating open innovation within the organization. Semi-structured interviews based on an exploratory qualitative method were used for this research. Interviews were conducted with 12 participants. Six leadership experts and six employees from different areas in the Netherlands were selected for this purpose. This research conducted a multilevel analysis and found that leadership behaviors drive important organizational changes related to open innovation and improve open innovation behaviors of employees. To implement open innovation within the organization, open innovation must be integrated into the mission and mandate of the organization. This creates effective collaboration between leaders and employees. Leadership can enable the use of leadership behaviors that can develop skills and competencies critical to open innovation. In addition, leadership behaviors have been found to influence employee behaviors related to open innovation when it comes to improving knowledge acquisition and sharing. In addition, employees are motivated to enter into external relationships with other organizations. Leadership behavior influences employee knowledge and skills. Leaders can influence the way employees acquire and share knowledge outside the organization and stimulate employees' open innovation behavior. Similarly, they can develop in the area of communication to foster useful long-term relationships. 9 In addition, more transparency, less time pressure, and the provision of support are important for gathering and sharing knowledge and building partnerships. This work has demonstrated effective leadership behaviors that can improve employee skills and competencies and specified the shift in organizational goals from open innovation to open employee innovation behaviors. Development within the organization can be accomplished by improving open communication and bonds between leaders-employees. In addition, there must be open communication between leaders and employees to motivate them to participate in open innovation activities. This research suggests that leadership behaviors can improve employees' open innovation behaviors by developing these behaviors in two phases of open innovation: obtaining ideas from external sources and idea integration. Open innovation involves individual employees and leaders, which can improve the output of open innovation in the organization.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Dense suspensions can be found in various industrial and natural processes. A relatively new technique uses the principle of additive manufacturing to produce products from a wide variety of materials by printing with dense suspensions. To reach a high print quality the suspension rheology must be understood very well. Current knowledge about suspension rheology however lacks the capability of predicting the exact behaviour of a predefined suspension, especially for dense suspensions. Direct numerical simulation (DNS) in combination with a second order accurate immersed boundary method (IBM) (Breugem, 2012) can be a useful tool to research suspension rheology. However, currently no numerical results are known for suspensions close to the jamming limit produced with this method.<br/>The current work validates the capability of the IBM to simulate dense suspensions by comparing produced results with existing numerical and experimental data. This is done by simulating a plane Couette flow for a range of particle volume fractions &#x1d719;=0.2−0.6, all of which are simulated with two friction coefficients (&#x1d707;&#x1d450;=0 and 0.39). Furthermore, the focus is on Stokes flow of neutrally buoyant non-colloidal suspensions with monodisperse spherical particles and the channel height was chosen equal to 13.5 particle diameters. DNS has been used to analyse the suspension rheology in terms of mean concentration profiles, velocity profiles, interactions in the microstructure and particle stress profiles. Steady-state concentration profiles of the simulated cases show a particle layering effect close to the confining walls. This layering effect alters the suspension rheology significantly and for that reason the wall regions are analysed separately from the core region. For both regions the microstructure, the relative viscosity and the normal particle stresses are analysed. The results agree well with existing numerical results (Gallier et al., 2016) (Yeo &amp; Maxey, 2010a). Comparison with experimental work (Dbouk et al., 2013) (Zarraga et al., 2000) shows that results for the relative viscosities of the unlayered core regions are lower in general, reasons for this difference can be higher friction factors or the use of non-spherical particles in experiments. However, the same asymptotic trend is observed for increasing &#x1d719;. The maximum packing fraction &#x1d719;&#x1d45a; was found by fitting the relative viscosities to the Marron &amp; Pierce equation (Maron &amp; Pierce, 1956), which gave &#x1d719;&#x1d45a;=0.69 for &#x1d707;&#x1d450;=0 and &#x1d719;&#x1d45a;=0.635 for &#x1d707;&#x1d450;=0.39. These results for &#x1d719;&#x1d45a; are in good agreement with results from (Gallier et al., 2014).<br/>In general the IBM turns out to be capable of reproducing existing numerical data. Furthermore, results have been obtained for suspensions closer to the jamming limit than known so far in numerical work on this particular flow regime. Besides that, the present results are obtained with an advanced soft-sphere collision model, including lubrication corrections for close approach of particles, which has been extensively validated with collision experiments in a previous study. Comparison of the results from this work with experimental data shows larger differences. The reason for this can be that the suspensions in experimental set-ups deviate from the idealized suspension in the simulations. Besides that experimental results differ significantly from each other, indicating that differences also exist between the experimental suspensions. These differences have to be clearly defined in order to make a valuable comparison. Therefore it is currently difficult to determine how accurately the IBM simulates suspension rheology.","dense suspensions; rheology; DNS; Couette; particle layering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Process and Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Santema, S.C. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Recently, Deloitte, Nibud and ING conducted a study on financial health in the Netherlands. As a next step, the involved parties have taken the initiative by creating the Financial Health Index (FHI), a tool to measure people’s financial health via fifteen questions. Deloitte is searching for new channels that they could use to stimulate the usage of the FHI and other initiatives that could create a positive impact on the financial health of the Netherlands. The retail channel is an important financial health channel were customers make the actual financial spending decisions, and could therefore be a promising new direction. This lead to the initial research question of this project: ““Is the retail channel a feasible and impactful way to reach end-users for the FHI, in order to help them improve their financial health?“<br/><br/>Because of the newness and abstractness of the topic, a qualitative research study was conducted. Nine highly experienced professionals in the retail industry were interviewed, giving an understanding of retailers attitude concerning customers’ financial health, as well as a possible implementation of the FHI and other interesting initiatives. This showed that in order for retailers to contribute, the FHI might not be the best solution, mainly due to the privacy constraints, the lack of use cases and missing business case. It was found that in order to get retailers to contribute, it might be better to offer more generic financial health solutions, that do not include the profiling of customers. <br/><br/>Other existing initiatives were identified and analyzed, in the financial health domains “to loan”, “saving”, “spending”, “income” and “planning”. After a selection process and re-clustering, interesting clusters appeared. The requirements and wishes gained through the research showed that the area of “saving” seemed most promising to leverage the retail channel to improve customers’ financial health. In order to generate the biggest impact, it was chosen to focus on a retail saving program for Christmas, as “a lot of Dutch citizens struggle with financial health which increases in January, because they are not prepared for the extra retail expenses in December”. This was the problem statement starting the design phase.<br/><br/>In the design phase, a research into the simulation of saving behavior was done. Next, two design iterations were conducted. The first iteration included a user research, through two user questionnaires. The second iteration included co-creation sessions with retailers. The focus of the design phase was on gaining insights into the options and best solutions for the four most important design choices for the retail saving program. These were the “saving goal”, “user journey channel”, “business model” and “user saving process”.<br/><br/>The outcome is the “CareFree Christmas” initiative. This initiative allows customers to save for a specific retail product, while gaining a reward for their positive financial healthy saving behaviour. For retailers, this allows them to create a social impact by helping customers with their financial health, while at the same time increasing customer loyalty, purchase guarantee and a better cashflow. <br/><br","Financial Health; Deloitte; Retailers; Saving programs; Christmas","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

It is time-consuming to assess and little is known about the way it is influenced by the characteristics of a bridge. In many cases, a bridge needs testing after is has been finished to determine the specifications of a damper. <br/><br/>Striving to reduce the environmental impact of bridges, there lies a great potential in using materials with a low environmental impact, such as timber. This research combines the lack of knowledge about dynamic behaviour of footbridges with the need for using timber instead of other materials. It consists of two parts. The first part, the parameter study, investigates the influence of three preliminary design parameters on the dynamic behaviour of a long-span timber footbridge, namely the pylon height, the pylon shape and the amount of cables. The second part, the optimisation study, examines to what extent it is possible to design a long-span timber footbridge that does not need dampers to control excessive vibrations.<br/><br/><br/>To this end, a parametric model of a bridge was made in which parameters can be varied and optimised to create realistic design variants. To be able to optimise taking into account dynamic behaviour, a python script was written to automatically determine the type of modes. The results of the parameter study show that the dynamic behaviour can be influenced by the parameters, although the results depend on the specific model, dimensions, parameter values and damping value. The results of the second part show that a with a 14% increase in mass a design variant that does not need dampers to control excessive vibrations can be obtained.","Human-induced vibrations; Timber; Parametric design; Optimisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

(mentor); de Vries, M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer type among men, and the third deathliest form of cancer. Several treatments are available to treat prostate cancer. Low Dose Rate Brachytherapy (LDR BT) is one of them, which inserts permanent radioactive seeds into the prostate using a needle. The literature review performed prior to this thesis, investigates if LDR BT is an effective method and how the quality of life is affected by the treatment compared to other treatments. Furthermore, the various anatomical variations that could intervene with the procedure are analyzed and how they are currently dealt with. It was found that during this treatment multiple complications can arise; first pubic arch interference could prevent the needle from reaching all parts of the prostate. Second, unwanted needle deflection can cause incorrect dose distribution, and third, delicate tissues like the urethra can obstruct the path of the needle. The introduction of a steerable needle in the field of brachytherapy could have the potential of treating patients with particular anatomical variations, add more maneuverability for the surgeon to steer around certain tissues and adjust unwanted needle deflections. All contributing to an accurate dose distribution and therefore an improved quality of life of the patient.<br/><br/>This thesis aims to design and develop a steerable needle for LDR BT of the prostate along with defining the design parameters of the steering capabilities to predict the bending of the needle. The needle should have a lumen for radioactive seeds to pass through, should use the steering mechanism of the preceding high dose rate wire needle and it should be able to steer 30mm laterally over 150mm insertion in order to reach the entire prostate.<br/><br/>Multiple theories are developed to predict the deflection behaviour of the needle. A theory that can predict the needle tip path, two theories that predict the distal deflection in air, and lastly a theory that predicts the deflection in tissue. One of the theories that predict the distal deflection in air is based on the proximal angle and the other one on the proximal force. To test these theories, a steerable wire needle, made of spring steel, for high dose rate brachytherapy is borrowed. From these experiments it can be concluded that the theory for the prediction of the needle tip path gives results close to the measured values and the prediction of the distal deflection based on proximal force give adequate results with an error of 1.77mm ±1.6mm. This error is in between the acceptable threshold of 2mm-5mm. The other two models presented errors of 15.1mm ±15.2mm and 14.4mm ±14.6mm, which give inaccurate predictions and are therefore not used as basis for the design of the steerable needle. An analysis is performed on the individual parameters within the two models. This provides insight into which variables need to be adjusted to design a steerable needle that complies with the requirements.<br/><br/>Based on the two models and the analysis of the individual parameters, a steerable needle that complies with the requirements, is designed, manufactured and tested. The manufacturing of the needle was limited by the availability of materials, causing the inner lumen to be slightly smaller than initially designed. The first tests are performed in air to compare the results with the previous experiments done with the wire spring steel needle and to verify the prediction models. The needle tip path and distal deflection based on the proximal force predictions both proof to be adequate models with the latter having an error of 2.75mm ±2.99mm. The steerable nitinol needle with a lumen, is also tested in tissue stimulant to provide a proof of principle and verify the theory of deflection in tissue. It is demonstrated that the needle can steer within the tissue stimulant, and insert an object though its lumen into the tissue. The model for the prediction of the deflection in tissue can be proven empirically. In addition, the prediction of the distal deflection based on the proximal force can also be applied for bending in tissue, if a constant is added to account for the bevel tip of the needle.<br/><br/>To provide an additional substantiation for the prediction model, a third needle is tested in air. This needle is borrowed and is intended to be used in high dose rate brachytherapy. This needle, made of tungsten, also proofs that the model can make adequate predictions with an error of 1.76mm ±1.4mm.<br/><br/>One of the requirements of the needle is that the inner lumen must accommodate the passing of a radioactive seed. Due to the unavailability of certain materials this was not accomplished. Therefore, a theoretical design is made with a larger inner lumen. For further research this design can be manufactured and tested.<br/><br/>The steerable needle presented in this thesis provides a proof of principle for a steerable needle with a lumen. It could have the potential of overcoming the anatomical obstacles presented in the literature review and therefore aiding in an accurate dose distribution. Furthermore, it can also provide the surgeon with the capability of adjusting unwanted deflection created by the needle. In addition, by analyzing the variables that influence the steering, a model is made that can predict the deflection based on the proximal force applied.","Low dose rate brachytherapy; Steerable needle; Prostate; Compliant mechanism","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-07-01","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Antonini, A. (graduation committee); Maris, H. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The water authority ”Hunze en Aa’s” initiated a demonstration project adjacent to the Dollard where non traditional dike reinforcement strategies could be developed. For this project Sweco designed a sea dike with an outer slope more gentle than traditional. This dike is called the ”Wide Green Dike” (WGD) and has an outer slope of 1:7. This dike is designed for 10 l/s/m overtopping with hydraulic boundary conditions provided by HYDRA-NL. This report examines whether 10 l/s/m of overtopping leads to failure of the WGD. In this context failure means erosion of the inner dike slope. Whether failure occurs is based upon the cumulative overload method (Steendam et al., 2015).<br/><br/>The WGD is rebuilt in a computational model called SWASH, which is a general-purpose numerical tool for simulating non-hydrostatic, free-surface, rotational flows and transport phenomena in one, two or three dimensions. The flow velocities on the rebuilt dike for the overtopping design condition are analysed. In this study SWASH is used to analyse 2D wave interactions from nearshore along a shallow foreshore towards and over a sea dike. <br/><br/>The simulation using the locally generated waves results in no overtopping. The overtopping criterion is normative for the crest height and no overtopping indicates that it is likely that the design of the dike can be optimized. But before any decisive conclusion can be made more research into the wave cli-mate in the Dollard is needed.<br/><br/>As the scenario using the locally generated waves resulted in no overtopping, a new scenario is created. This scenario has other wave boundary conditions, such that there is overtopping. This simulation results in 57 l/s/m overtopping but without any initiation of damage on the lee side according to the cumulative overload method. This result would indicate that exceeding an average overtopping of 10 l/s/m might not necessary lead to failure for a dike with a more gentle, compared to standard, outer slope. The same simulation shows that the current relation for the flow on the lee side is likely not sufficient to describe the full flow pattern. According to literature the flow velocity on the lee side of a dike increases and stabilizes. However, SWASH simulation results show after the initial increase also a decrease in flow velocity. The current relations for the flow velocity on the lee side only include the first initial increase but do not include the observed decrease in flow velocity. The kinematic shock theory equation, shows good agreement with the decrease in velocity. The results show that the tipping point (change from flow velocity increase to decrease) is located at 97% of the predicted final flow velocity (Van Gent equation). It seems that a combination of the Van Gent equation and kinematic shock equation can represent the flow velocity along the lee side of a dike.<br","Overtopping; Swash; Kinematic shock; Dike","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

One such class of vulnerabilities are out-of-bounds writes, which are still one of the most widespread and dangerous types of security bugs in memory-unsafe programming languages five decades after their initial conceptualization.<br/>Their discovery through automated methods like fuzzing, however, has gained substantial traction in the past years and facilitates their discovery in large numbers with minimal human intervention. On the other hand, the analysis following their initial discovery - triaging, root cause analysis, and patching - mostly requires human expertise and intuition. As this need for manual effort affects the time to assess a vulnerability's security implications and prioritize patching accordingly, partial automation of the triaging process is essential. A promising approach is the automatic extraction of vulnerability characteristics that provide vital clues for a bug's exploitability. Such characteristics, which typically require substantial effort to collect manually, can aid a human analyst in triaging and thereby speed up the process while, at the same time, making it more accessible. <br/>In this work, we investigate how the set of affected source code-level objects, which is a decisive indicator of an out-of-bounds write vulnerability's exploitability, can be automatically distilled from a program and an input suspected of causing an out-of-bounds write. As this poses unique challenges with regard to invasiveness, we propose a novel approach for out-of-bounds write detection that facilitates monitoring a compiled program for spatial memory safety violations without the need for instrumentation. We implement a prototype of our design and evaluate it on benchmarks and real-world vulnerabilities, showing that its detection performance is largely on par with state-of-the-art instrumentation-based detection approaches and even outperforms them in several scenarios at the cost of increased performance overhead and a higher rate of false positives.","Exploitability Evaluation; Memory Safety; Out-of-bounds Writes; Whitebox; Bug Triaging","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Cyber Security","",""

With large-scale brain imaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), functional connectivity analyses have shown altered connectivity patterns in humans and mice with neurobiological disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To further investigate different mutations that contribute to ASD, a behavioral neuroscientific experiment has been performed at the neuroscientific department of Erasmus MC. During the trial, brain activity in groups of wild-type and homozygous mice is measured using functional ultrasound (fUS) while allowing for spontaneous behaviors of mice. The homozygous mice lack the SHANK2 protein, resulting in hyperactivity and autistic-like behavioral alterations associated with ASD in humans. Understanding the origin of ASD is key to providing effective treatment. However, with the introduction of novel large-scale brain imaging techniques such as fUS, new methods have to be developed that enable functional connectivity analyses. Furthermore, new insights might also be acquired from dynamic functional connectivity analyses, in which changes in functional connectivity over time are evaluated. Subsequently, the question remains if it is possible to unravel differences in brain dynamics between wild-type and homozygous mice using a dynamic functional connectivity analysis.<br/>First, an fUS data model is developed to model how fUS signals arise from a generative perspective. This model comprises a combination of a convolutive and a state-space model. Subsequently, inference of functional networks and their temporal dynamics can be performed. Also, a pre-processing pipeline for experimental fUS data is designed to reduce problem complexity and data cleaning. The performance of the developed methods is evaluated on the experimental data set, where a difference in brain dynamics between wild-type and homozygous mice is investigated.<br/>It is found that a deconvolution procedure using the non-negative least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (NNLASSO) is necessary to reconstruct the underlying activity of neural populations. After that, using the hidden Markov model (HMM) as a state-space model, it is found that functional networks and their temporal dynamics can be learned from fUS data using expectation maximization (EM). It has been discovered that the developed methods consistently decompose reconstructed neural activity into biologically plausible functional networks from experimental fUS data. Also, with 96% certainty, a difference in brain dynamics between wild-type and homozygous mice is found using this method.<br/>In summary, in this thesis, novel methods are developed to perform a dynamic functional connectivity analysis on experimental fUS data. Also, by performing such dynamic functional connectivity analysis for the first time on fUS data, a consistent decomposition of reconstructed neural activity into biologically plausible functional networks and a possible difference in brain dynamics between wild-type and homozygous mice are found. This research highlights the potential of fUS as a large-scale brain imaging technique in the quest to understand the origin of ASD and other neurobiological disorders.","functional ultrasound; dynamic functional connectivity; state-space models; hidden Markov model; deconvolution; NNLASSO regression; spatial independent component analysis; mice behavior","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Circuits and Systems","",""

For this research, the water-energy system is the urban water cycle and the renewable electricity production for the urban water cycle. Twelve alternatives were proposed for the water-energy system. The different alternatives are divided among those that consider the reuse of wastewater, rainwater harvesting, and the use of wind turbines, PV panels, or both for the renewable electricity production. Then, those alternatives were optimized to produce the minimum water demand shortage, minimum amount of treated water that is not reused, and renewable electricity shortage. Later, the optimized alternatives are evaluated using multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA).

Recently, this class is introduced as an extension of the class of Max-Plus-Linear (MPL) systems in the field of max-plus algebra. The MPL framework is useful when modeling Discrete Event Systems (DES). Describing DES in conventional algebra results in nonlinear system descriptions, but when described as a max-plus linear system, the model becomes ’linear’ in max-plus algebra. The extension class of MP-LPV systems is introduced as a tool for parametric modeling, providing the possibility to model uncertain and nonlinear dynamics in a parameterized linear system structure. MP-LPV systems are the max-plus algebraic analogue to the conventional class of Linear Parameter Varying systems. The system matrices of MP-LPV systems can depend on the varying parameter in different manners. Problems arise when the varying parameter depends on the state vector itself. The resulting system description is then implicit. Due to properties of max-plus algebra, it cannot always be guaranteed that such implicit MP-LPV systems have a solution. This leads to the solvability problem. In this thesis, we first define different levels of implicitness in MP-LPV systems, and present frameworks for each level to solve these solvability problems. The results will thereafter be illustrated with a case study that describes an urban railway system. Then, we will present a first model predictive controller for a MP-LPV system with the urban railway system as application. Research about MP-LPV systems has so far been about modeling and system analysis, and little research has been done in control approaches. This model predictive controller can therefore be considered as a first step in controller design for MP-LPV systems. Lastly, the foundation is laid for analyzing closed-loop stability of MP-LPV systems subject to model predictive control.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

However, the combination of the two deserves more attention than in the literature to date. When solving VRP problems, computed routes must be checked for feasibility. Among the feasibility checks to perform, we need to guarantee that the load plan is feasible, namely that all the assigned products fit inside the truck. This involves solving a CLP.<br/><br/>Since the check of load plan feasibility is performed frequently, a short computational time is important. Hence, the load plan feasibility check is usually performed using approximation methods. Having rapid and reliable load plan feasibility estimations is crucial to reduce computational times when solving the VRP problem.

This is the cheapest way for an infant to travel by plane, and is an available option for all destinations with all European airlines. However, this travel method causes discomfort for parents, as they are constantly required to hold their infant and attend to the child s needs in a tight surrounding.<br/><br/>The Amsterdam based company, Wick Wings, has come up with an idea that could offer parents a comfortable solution for travelling with their infant by plane: a baby carrier designed specifically for use on a plane*. This concept forms the base of this graduation project for the master Integrated Product Design, with the following objective:<br/><br/>‘Designing, building, and testing a hands-free travel solution in the form of a baby carrier for use on a plane, during medium-haul and long-haul flights with a baby of 0-12 months old, taking into account European regulations only.’*<br/><br/>To complete this project, a design approach was used with a strong focus on prototyping to make decisions about the embodiment of the final product. The design process started with a research phase, which included research methods such as market analysis, expert interviews, participatory research, and the studying of many online sources. This research phase was followed by intertwined ideation, conceptualisation and embodiment phases, resulting in a working prototype for a new baby carrier design for travelling by plane with an infant. <br/><br/>The research phase showed that there are many different baby carriers available on the market that meet the specific requirements to enable ergonomically sound carrying for both parent and infant. These carriers do contain some attributes that are convenient for travelling by plane, however they also contain attributes that are inconvenient for this use context. <br/><br/>Baby carriers are not allowed for use on a plane during all stages of a flight, and must be detached when the fasten seatbelt light is turned on. However, baby carriers are not easy detachable in the tight space available to individual passengers on a plane. Additionally, parents’ desires to alternate parental duties during a flight requires easy attaching and detaching of a baby carrier as well. <br/><br/>The product solution that was created for the project is The Wick Carrier. The product introduces a new baby carrier system, that allows for easy attaching and detaching of the infant to the parent, both while standing and sitting. <br/><br/>The final prototype of The Wick Carrier was tested with parents and infants to validate the design, and formulate additional design recommendations for further developing the product for introduction on the market.<br/><br/>* Slightly adjusted to follow an embargo on the results of this graduation report.<br","baby carrier; airplane; infant","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-31","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

During this graduation process, the possibilities for adaptive reuse for one of these police buildings, Huis ‘t Velde in Warnsveld, have been researched. <br/><br/>In order to work with Huis ‘t Velde, it was necessary to have a look at another group of buildings as well, besides the police buildings, namely country houses. A lot of country houses have lost their function as a private home during the course of the 20th century, among others because of the rising costs of maintenance of these relatively large buildings, and the surrounding estates. This makes the research and design for the adaptive reuse of Huis ‘t Velde even more relevant, since the findings might also be helpful for other country houses.<br/>Most of the country houses have shown a strong development over time. They have different time layers, and each time layer has it’s own story. But nowadays most users aren’t aware of this.

From this, 3 main strategy’s of dealing with these time layers in the adaptive redesign process were found.

Moreover, the Willingness to Pay (WtP) for comfort and Value of Time (VoT) are derived. With the combination of both models, the WtP for risk attributes given a perceived risk level is derived. The combination of both models shows the Willingness to Pay values for the different risk attributes, given a certain perceived risk level. To test the influence of perceived risk on modal split, three routes with real-world values are used. The results implicate a maximum of 5% market share difference possible.

However, for the Landelijke Eenheid it is still unclear and abstract what a police campus looks like because they have never developed a police campus so there is not a campus assessment framework on how to make a police campus yet. What we know about the police campus at the moment is not enough. Therefore, this research will investigate what a campus can offer to the organization of the Landelijke Eenheid for the location of Driebergen. By making use of the four perspectives of den Heijer, a new campus assessment framework is made to help the Landelijke Eenheid with an overview of their ambition and vision document and the four real estate documents that are used within this research. The empirical part will focus on the new campus assessment framework and how the occurring contradictions can be solved. The input for the research will be conducted through both qualitative and inductive research. Semi-structured interviews are held and a case study about a campus with similar contradictions (Brightlands Chemelot campus) is executed. The theoretical review will focus on the campus, its management and the operationalization of a campus. The Activity Theory by Engeström is used to examine the activity of creating a police campus and serves as the conceptual framework. The goal in this research is to formulate an outcome of how a campus can support the organization of the Landelijke Eenheid.","Campus; Campus management; Activity Theory; Operationalization; Assessment Framework; Landelijke Eenheid","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-07-01","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

In the Netherlands, the Paris Agreement is translated into policies that aim for circularity and sustainability at different governmental levels. These policies are directed at the sustainability transitions within different fields, such as the built environment. The construction sector is responsible for high levels of CO2 emissions, however, there is a big housing shortage in the Netherlands and the aim is to construct 900.000 new houses by the end of 2030. This challenge requires a transition to a more sustainable way of constructing, to stay below the critical threshold of 1.5 °C global warming. The transition from traditional housing constructions to timber constructions can arguably be a solution to this challenge. To accelerate this transition, the Metropole Region of Amsterdam (MRA) has written a covenant that aims to construct 20% of the total housing production in the MRA by timber, by 2025. This is a high ambition, as currently only some pilot projects are constructed out of timber. While the covenant might give body to this transition in the MRA, there are still a lot of questions about how different policy instruments can foster the timber transition in the MRA. Many studies have been conducted on transitions and innovation policies, and affluent policy instruments for the transition of innovations are presented in literature. However, literature lacks in presenting how a combination of different policy instruments can foster a sustainability transition. This research, which is case study based, therefore researches the different policy instruments that are or can be implemented to foster the transition of timber constructions in the MRA. The literature study presents the theories that make up the theoretical framework and give a deeper understanding of the concepts that are used. The empirical research consists of a document analysis, a stakeholder analysis, interviews with stakeholders and an expert session for validation. The stakeholders within the empirical research are stakeholders that are actively involved in the timber transition in the MRA. This research finally gives answer to the question ‘How can a combination of policy instruments foster the transition to timber housing constructions in the MRA?’. It contributes to the existing literature on policy instruments for transitions by providing concrete methods and an operationalization of the analytical framework for the development of a combination of policy instruments for the timber transition. Furthermore, this research provides policymakers with recommendations on the development of a combination of policy instruments for the timber transition, as well as for sustainability transitions in general. Lastly, this research contributes to broadening the knowledge on the timber transition, as much is yet unknown and there is a great demand for more knowledge on this topic.","timber constructions; transitions; sustainability transition; policy instruments; policy mixes; innovation policy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

(mentor); Veer, F.A. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Continued humanitarian crises have caused the amount of forcibly displaced people to increase rapidly in recent years, creating an urgent need for constructing adequate sheltering to house the displaced. Governments and international organizations attempt to accommodate the growing demands by subsidizing and mass producing temporary transitional shelters that do not always meet all the emerging needs of refugee families.<br/><br/>Many of these settlements are planned with a temporary use in mind, however, more often than not, they end up growing and turning into more permanent parts of cities themselves. In the case of Syrian refugees, several camps were set up in Jordan as an emergency response to accommodate the displaced families, namely the Zaatari camp in 2012 and the Azraq camp in 2014, with Zaatari camp being the largest Syrian refugee camp globally. These camps have now existed for nearly a decade, which collides with the original intentions of them being temporary, and are gradually becoming more permanent. When refugees first arrive they are in need of immediate sheltering and assistance, as time goes by their needs change and evolve in order to adapt to a more long-term setting. At the current rate, refugees are occupying their substandard shelters beyond the recommended lifespan resulting in housing that is largely inadequate (3RP, 2021).<br/><br/>Due to the rigid nature of the shelters provided to refugees, some families in the Zaatari camp, for example, have been rearranging the units provided to them in order to accommodate their specific spatial needs. These self-made rearrangements are clearly shown to have evolved over time and are becoming more intricate, showing a need for adapting and evolving the one-size-fits-all structures provided by international agencies into more customized solutions corresponding to individual family needs.<br/><br/>Additive Manufacturing in construction is an emergent technology that has garnered the attention of many researchers and developers recently, with new developments being constantly made in the field of 3D printing buildings and building components. Researchers argue that 3D printing as a construction technique can be a valid alternative for overcoming the limits and shortcomings of typical construction methods of refugee shelters being used currently, and can fulfill the requirements of adequate housing for refugees. <br/><br/>Earth presents itself as a construction material with various functional and environmental benefits for the construction of shelters. Moreover, earth has been widely used in buildings for thousands of years around the world and has demonstrated its ability to stand the test of time. Buildings made using earth are reusable, recyclable, and inherently biodegradable allowing vegetation to grow back into them after use leaving no waste behind (Rael, 2009). Furthermore, earth is a material that is readily available on-site in many locations needing minimal transport compared to other materials, which in combination with its other properties enables building structures with very little embodied energy (Volhard, 2016).<br/><br/>Mass customization is inherent to the process of additive manufacturing where robots can produce customized designs in an iterative process and no two models have to be alike, which in combination with using earth found on-site as a medium for printing, could make it a viable approach to constructing shelters that would meet individual refugee family needs. This research aims to investigate the possibilities of doing so through developing a mass-customization design tool for 3d printing refugee shelters using earth.<br","Digital Fabrication; Shelters; Refugee Camp; Earth Construction; Clay; Computational Design; 3D Printing; Design Informatics; Material Science","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","","32.294402, 36.328305"

The wave equation describes waves that propagate through a certain medium. The solution of the wave equation is a mathematical description of what that wave looks like. There are many fields of study where the wave equation is used to model processes that behave like travelling waves. For instance, a vibrating string or membrane can be modelled by the wave equation very well. Furthermore, the wave equation can be used to model light or sound waves and how they reflect and refract when travelling<br/>through different materials.<br/>Because the wave equation is such an important tool to model these phenomena, there are many people working on solving the wave equation in different contexts, i.e. finding a solution. However, it is difficult (often impossible) to find an exact solution. Therefore, people usually calculate a ’solution’ that is approximately correct.<br/>An important question to ask is: ’Does the wave equation always have a solution?And is there only one solution?’. Physically, the answer is clear. If a string is vibrating, it clearly cannot vibrate in two ways at the same time and it will always vibrate in some particular way. Even though the answer is clear physically, answering this question mathematically is more difficult. It is good to remember that the wave equation is just a mathematical model of propagating waves, and it could very well be that the wave equation has more than one solution or no solution at all in some particular context.<br/>The answer of this question is important for the people calculating approximate solutions to the wave equation. If there does not exist a unique solution, the process of calculating the approximate solution may break down.<br/>Answering that question is the subject of this thesis. We will first introduce the necessary mathematical tools, after which we will use existing research to find out under which conditions the wave equation has one, and only one solution. Finally, we will extend our results to more general equations than just the wave equation.","Differential Equations; Wave Equation; Analysis; Numerical Analysis","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

As a result, enablers and barriers are allocated and addressed in terms of providing proposals to improve re-adaptive housing new construction in the Netherlands. For both the allocation and the addressing, a professional panel has been discussing these findings and shed a critical backlight from different actors within a project team.<br/>The main four themes that came forward were 1) financial; 2) legal; 3)design and 4) governance.<br/><br/>Newly constructed re-adaptive housing in the Netherlands can be managed by a) first finding an investor who is willing to have a long-term vision for its financing to be paid back as re-adaptive housing shows a higher yield but over a longer time than usual housing construction; b) having the municipality and/or other larger legal bodies willing to make policy changes (or introduction) in new flexibility in-use-policies with regards to the current building policies on a national level; c) offering a tenant contract with ownership over infill to the residents; d) providing the architect a very specific and clear brief/design assignment on re-adaptive architecture and e) setting up a different resident organisation with a more extensive communication between owner-resident and a continious management, even after the construction phase.<br/>(Re-)adaptive housing and above stated recommendations also lead to role changes of stakeholders as residents play a stronger role since they take partly a designing, financing and ownership role. An additional stakeholder is the resident representative. Construction engineer and architect will have to work closer together. And the the owner/organisation will have to play a bigger role after construction as continuous guidance and management is needed.<br/><br/>Re-adaptive housing never re-visits the initation phase (when renovation or transformation is happening) but rather has the introduction of the ‘re-phase’ which enablers (re-)adaptation of the housing unit. This phase is imbedded to such an extent that systems and information of what the possibilities are (within architectural space/design but also structural) are clear and set for residents. The operation phase (becoming more a loop) is longer due this re-phase, and also results in shorter life cycles and thus less need for maintenance. Lastly, the design phase is longer and the construction phase is shorter in comparison with regular housing. It can be concluded that re-adaptivity is a process as its continuous / open ended, has a certain procedure to be followed (especially during the re-phase), doesn’t have a definite duration, is event-driven and neverending.<br/><br/>In order to enable re-adaptive housing in the Netherlands, re-adaptive housing should be seen, initiated and followed through as a process and not a project.","adaptive; re-adaptive; housing; re-adaptivity; Structuralism; open bouwen; Metabolism; alternative housing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

(mentor); Ledoux, H. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","To keep the Panama Canal operational year round, the water level in the canal is maintained above the minimum depth. As water is passed through the locks and into the oceans on either side, the canals main reservoir looses fresh water, and this water is then replaced by the canals secondary reservoir which is Lake Alajuela. The Lake Alajuela reservoir is supplied of water by two large rivers, bringing in a sediment flux and decreasing the reservoirs capacity over time. Sedimentation sets a time limit to the use of the reservoir, and understanding this process and predicting the future morphological changes to occur in the reservoir are key to ensure continuation of operations in the Panama Canal. To predict the quantities of local sedimentation in the reservoir, a machine learning model is trained with features extracted from bathymetric models covering various years. These features are computed values that correlate with morphological processes. As such, the adaptiveness of a machine learning model along with the ability to extract morphological features from any elevation model provides the possibility to predict future sedimentation where other methods with empirical and numerical methods do not suffice due to a lack of data and restrictive parameters. Three types of machine learning algorithms and 21 features were initially tested for the purpose of the morphological modelling, during which the SVR model was the most successful. The testing was done on the R´ıo Chagres basin as well as the R´ıo Pequen´ı basin, both located in Lake Alajuela. Extensive hyperparameter tests were done to optimize and further test the performance of the SVR. Depending on the study area and the scale of the morphological behavior occurring, slightly different sets of features were most effective. Nevertheless, in both study areas tested the runoff model has proven to be a key factor for predicting the sedimentation and achieved a 70 to 80% accuracy for predicting zones of low or high sedimentation. The same model trained with the data from 1997 to 2018 was then used to predict 6 years into the future where more dynamic morphological behavior will occur according to the model. A downstream moving sediment front in the R´ıo Chagres basin is recognized and predicted to have moved 500 meters between the years 2018 and 2024. Such a sediment front travelling too far into the reservoir could have catastrophic consequences for all operations of the Panama Canal, making the awareness and anticipation of its progression highly important.","Machine Learning; Morphology; Sedimentation; Panama Canal","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","","9.234444, -79.575556"

Lignin and cellulose are the most abundant biopolymers on earth and produce a lot of waste by ending up burnt or in landfills. Thus, a great field of research is currently explored with cellulose and lignin waste as an alternative to petrochemical-based products. Coming from the pulping and paper industry, lignin waste could be implemented through the use of an additive manufacturing process to reduce or avoid the necessity to cut trees. Also, 3D printing elements with lignin and cellulose as feedstocks have not yet been explored. Thus, this master thesis aims to promote wood waste as an ecological contributor to the building industry through the use of an additive manufacturing process. This research will be driven by 3D printing a window frame as there is a lack of replacing or enhancing existing window frames. Moreover, large-scale 3D printing companies are faced with the problem that the interface between window frames and 3D printed walls does not perfectly fit within each other. As current fabrication processes to produce building elements are based on flat regular machinery and 3D printing technology is based on curved stacking layers, a perfect connection could only be implemented by 3D printing a window frame. Thus, after understanding the explored limits and possibilities of 3D printing with a wholly bio-based material coming from its waste in regard to mechanical and printability properties, a window frame will be designed and printed as a proof of concept. The final results have shown the potential of 3D print elements in a cold extrusion process with lignin and cellulose in combination with water and methylcellulose. However, more research is necessary to improve the material and printability properties of the recipe to become a fully reliable and integrated facade component to replace existing building components or improve the connection between window frames and habitats.","Lignin; Cellulose; Wood; bio-based; 3D printing; Additive Manufacturing; Window","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","","52.002200, 4.373600"

Building services are most likely integrated into floors and wear out or become obsolete every 7-15 years (Brand, 1995). Currently, 58% of all timber products are landfilled (Lucas et al., 2017). To ensure timber structures’ long and useful service life, adaptability and integration with building services should be considered (Rogeau et al., 2021). A modular, adaptable shape, capable of integrating and replacing building services should be the outcome of this research. Many timber structures are expected to be built. Let’s prevent an environmental disaster of building waste in 2050 by answering the question: What disassembly and manufacturing improvements are necessary for timber floor systems to increase adaptability and circularity for building services in dwellings. The aspects to design a fully circular timber are circularity, manufacturing and structural. From the literature research, the following criteria are found that are related to these objectives: Modularity, Simplicity, Disassembly, Adaptability, Density and Slenderness. Summarized these objectives make: Easy Adaptive Reuse. A multi-criteria analysis (MCA) is used to grade the timber floor systems with the criteria found, the socalled grading tool. The outcome of the grading tool is a ribbed floor that can be disassembled into parts and connected by mechanical or shaped connections. The result is a final prototype by experimental design based on the criteria and improved through surveys. The final product is suitable for the construction industry and fits into mass customization to increase its impact. The engineering part uses the ribs for the ULS and SLS to shape a composite structure. By making a demountable mechanical connection the structure increases its circularity and stiffness, so it takes the best of both worlds. FlexHolz is a flexible system that increases circularity and is suitable for mass customization.","Circular Construction; Floor system; Timber Construction; Flexibility; Design for Disassembly","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-06-30","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

To combat this, ECOncrete Tech Ltd has developed a new eco-friendly armour unit, the CoastaLock. With its ecological advantages proven, its hydraulic performance is still largely unknown. This thesis aims to do the first exploratory research into the stability, reflection and overtopping performance of this CoastaLock armour unit, through a literature study and physical model tests. Data is gathered during physical model tests on a deep-water impermeable slope with different wave steepnesses, armour unit spacings, underlayer thicknesses and block orientations.<br/><br/>The mechanism of breathing is witnessed in tests with CoastaLock armour units. This mechanism shows the armour layer repeatedly getting lifted up from the slope and placed back on it as a result of pressure differences over the top layer during maximum wave run down. This mechanism causes movement of granular material in the underlayer, with large under deformations as a result. This thesis, therefore, advocates for listing the breathing mechanism as a failure mechanism.<br/>The CoastaLock armour units show stability numbers of approximately 2 when tested at armour spacings below 10%, and stability numbers larger than 4 when tested at armour spacings larger than 10% for a wave steepness of 3.5%. Wave steepness is shown to be of a minor influence too, with the influence of underlayer thickness and unit orientation being negligible.<br/>The reflection coefficient is shown to be mainly dependent on wave steepness, and minorly on armour spacing. Reflection coefficients of approximately 0.8 to 0.5 are measured for wave steepnesses between 1.5% and 4.5%.<br/>Overtopping is shown not to play a role in situations with armour spacings lower than 10%, as the layer fails before overtopping can become an issue. For the more stable spacings, those larger than 10%, the overtopping discharge is quantified and the roughness factor is shown to vary from 0.732 for 10% spacing to 0.61 for 25% spacing. Factors other than the spacing are of a minor to negligible influence.<br/><br/>The CoastaLock armour units show promising results for situations with a short leakage length and large armour spacings, i.e. situations where the pressure differences over the top layer are small. However, this research is the first exploratory research into these armour units and should therefore be interpreted as no more than an indication of the behaviour of CoastaLock. It is recommended to expand the research into these units, both on the units in different situations as on the failure mechanisms of the units and the solutions thereto.","ECOncrete; CoastaLock; Placed block revetment; Revetment; Breakwater; Coastal infrastructure; Overtopping; Reflection of waves; Stability; Physical model tests; Coastal Engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

This can affect the safety and reliability of the algorithms, as it is difficult or even impossible to determine which are their failure characteristics and how they will react in situations never tested before. It is possible to remedy this lack of understanding through the development of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence and eXplainable Reinforcement Learning methods like SHapley Additive Explanations. In this thesis, this tool is used to analyze the strategy learnt by an Actor-Critic Incremental Dual Heuristic Programming controller architecture when presented with a series of pitch rate and roll rate tracking tasks in a variety of non-linear flying conditions, which include flying close to the stall regime, experiencing non-linear reference signals, reaching the control surface deflection limits, and flying with large sideslip angles. This same controller architecture has been previously explored with the same analysis tool but limited to the nominal linear flight regime, and it was observed that the controller learnt linear control laws, even though its Artificial Neural Networks should be able to approximate any function. This thesis shows that, even in the non-linear flight regime, it is still more optimal for this controller architecture to learn quasi-linear control laws, although it seems to continuously modify the linear slopes as if it was an extreme case of the gain scheduling technique. Additionally, a more complex Reinforcement Learning architecture based on the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm is also explored with the same analysis tool, to demonstrate its usability in the presence of non-linear control laws and to improve our understanding of this offline state-of-the-art algorithm.","Machine Learning; Reinforcement Learning; Deep Learning; Adaptice Critic Designs; Explainable Artificial Intelligence; SHAP; Flight Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

In recent years a new flexible class of visual synthesis methods has gained popularity: generative adversarial networks. These deep neural networks can be trained to reproduce arbitrary images based on a dataset of about 10000 examples. After training, they can be harnessed to synthesize audio-reactive videos by constructing sequences of inputs based on musical information.<br/><br/>Current approaches suffer from a few problems which hamper the quality and usability of GAN-based audio-reactive video synthesis. Some approaches consider only a small number of possible musical inputs and ways of mapping these the GAN's parameters. This leads to weak audio-reactivity which has a similar motion characteristic across all musical inputs. Other approaches do harness the full design space, but are difficult to configure correctly for effective results.<br/><br/>This thesis aims to address the tradeoff between audio-reactive flexibility and ease of attaining effective results. We introduce multiple algorithms that explore the design space by using machine learning to generate sequences of inputs for the GAN.<br/><br/>To develop these machine learning algorithms, we first introduce a metric, the audiovisual correlation, that measures the audio-reactivity in a video. We use this metric to train models based only on a dataset of audio examples, avoiding the need of a large dataset of example audio-reactive videos. This self-supervised approach can even be extended to optimize a single audio-reactive video directly, removing the need to even train a model beforehand.<br/><br/>Our evaluation of the methods shows that our algorithms out-perform prior work in terms of their audio-reactivity.

In this study the heating of domestic hot water with Peltier elements as solid state heat pumps, and a heating network was investigated. A numerical model that solves the thermal energy balance within the Peltier elements was derived to describe the internal temperature distribution of the Peltier element, and its interaction with the domestic hot water and the heating network. The model was used to simulate the performance of 40 Peltier elements in a custom designed Peltier Heat Exchanger. Experiments were run to validate the numerical model. The numerical simulation of the temperature distribution within a Peltier Heat Exchanger and the temperature distributions observed in the experiments were not in agreement. The model input parameters Seebeck coefficient, resistance, thermal conductivity and a relation for the Nusselt number were re-evaluated using the experimental results. After the adjustment of the model input parameters, the new simulation results were able to accurately describe the temperature distribution with the Peltier Heat Exchanger. The Peltier Heat Exchanger was able to deliver domestic hot water with a COP between 1.2 and 1.8 depending on the flow speed of the domestic hot water and the heating network. The COP can potentially be increased by using Peltier elements with a higher Seebeck coefficient.","Peltier elements; Heating network; Domestic hot water; Coefficient of performance; Heat transfer; heat pump","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy, Flow and Process Technology","",""

Understanding causality is key to the success of NLP applications, especially in high-stakes domains. Causality comes in various perspectives such as enable and prevent that, despite their importance, have been largely ignored in the literature. In view of the lack of a dataset that can be used for causality-related research, in this thesis, we first build a first-of-its-kind, fine-grained causal reasoning dataset - FineCR, that contains new causality relations such as enable and prevent, with the help of human annotators. Our dataset contains human annotations of 25K cause-effect event pairs and 24K question-answering pairs within multi-sentence samples, where each can contain multiple causal relationships. To study current NLP models' ability to deal with the causality-related dataset and to figure out the problems that still exist, we define a series of NLP tasks based on FineCR, including causality detection, causality event extraction and causality question answering. Our experimental results with state-of-the-art deep learning models prove that there is still much room for improvement on those causal reasoning tasks. We found that those models have different shortcomings for different tasks. For the causality detection task, current classification models are easily affected by keywords, while the model cannot accurately extract the events for the causality event extraction task. And for the causality question answering task, it is sometimes difficult for the model to find the corresponding answer due to its inability to understand the semantics well. Those discoveries indicate the need to design better solutions to event causality research. In conclusion, our novel datasets and tasks provide a challenging benchmark for evaluating models' causal ability, and the experimental results shed light on future directions for improving neural language models.","Causality; Dataset; Natural Language Processing; Question Answering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

However, the transcranial application of functional ultrasound on humans, with the exception of the acoustic windows in the skull, remains a huge challenge because of the properties of the cranial bone the acoustic waves will reflect, refract, attenuate or will cause aberration. Therefore, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the incoming signal is too low for transcranial functional ultrasound (TCfUS). This thesis tries to overcome the SNR problem of TCfUS with the design of a 64-channel ultrasound acquisition system that is focused on achieving the highest SNR possible. This is achieved by placing the analog front-end (AFE) chips as near to the transducer elements as possible and by oversampling the incoming signal with a factor of 25, a theoretical increase of 15 dB of the signal-to-quantization-noise ratio over the current state-of-the-art is estimated. The proposed design is a receive-only system where the transmission of the ultrasound pulses is carried out by a separate ultrasound system. The design splits the acquisition system into a front-end and a back-end subsystem, where the front-end system is implemented using four AFE58JD48 analog front-end chips from Texas Instruments. From here the data samples are transported over fiber optics to the back-end subsystem, which consists of a VCK190 FPGA board from Xilinx, where the samples are processed and/or transported to a workstation for storage. Because the system organization differentiates from more conventional research ultrasound systems, a trade-off is introduced between processing and throughput, resulting in three processing configurations for the FPGA with each a different focus: raw RF data sampling, real-time processing, and hardware processing. Due to time and resource constraints, no measurements and results are available on the SNR and decimation. However, a theoretical exploration has been done on the expandability of the number of channels which was found to be 192 channels for the VCK190.","Functional Ultrasound; Transcranial; FPGA; Acquisition system; Ultrasound Imaging; System Architecture; high-speed; brain imaging","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://ultrasoundbrainimaging.com/ Website CUBE https://neuro.nl/ Website department of Neuroscience at Erasmus MC https://neurocomputinglab.com/ Website Neuro Computing Lab","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

(graduation committee); Lanzafame, R.C. (mentor); Antonini, A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Coastal and offshore infrastructure must be designed to withstand extreme wave-induced loading conditions. Extreme Value Analysis (EVA) is often employed to infer probabilistic distributions that provide information about extreme design conditions. In traditional practices, EVA is performed under the assumption of stationarity. This means that the probability of extreme events is constant in time. However, hydraulic loading conditions are expected to exhibit temporal variability in severity and frequency as a result of climate change. Therefore, the assumption of stationarity becomes questionable. Nonstationary extreme value analysis (NEVA) for inferring extreme hydraulic loads have become more attractive in recent years. However, the applicability of NEVA models is debatable ansd differs on a case-by-case basis. Large scale oceanic bodies can be characterized by spatially and temporally varying extreme wave characteristics. Clustering analyses have proven to be successful to identify regions exhibiting similar extreme wave characteristics. Creating clusters based on similar extreme wave characteristics can potentially improve extreme value modelling because intra-cluster information can be pooled to derive more accurate extreme value models.<br/><br/>This research presents a practical assessment of the applicability of clustering analysis and non-stationary extreme value modeling of extreme wave statistics at cluster level in the North Sea. The primary objectives of this research are: (1) Study the temporal variability extreme significant wave height (Hm0) and extreme wind speeds (U10) in the North Sea domain, (2) Investigate how hierarchical clustering analysis (HAC) can be employed to cluster grid points that exhibit similar extreme wave characteristics, (3) How the obtained clusters and temporal variability can be employed to derive extreme value models describing extreme Hm0 statistics at cluster level and (4) assess whether NEVA models at cluster level form a practical alternative compared to conventional stationary analysis in the design and risk assessment of hydraulic infrastructure in light of climate change. <br/><br/>Temporal trend analysis of Hm0 in the North Sea showed that the period between 1990 and 2020 can be characterized by a decreasing trend. Between 1950 and 2020, a decrease in Hm0 intensity is observed in the Western regions and an increase is observed in the East. This is reason to believe that the variability in extreme wave climate is cyclical rather than monotonic. There is reason to believe that temporal variations of extreme U10 are responsible for the temporal variability of extreme Hm0. Initial clustering results partition the North Sea domain into 50 clusters based on characteristic values for the significant wave height (Hm0), peak period (Tp), and dominant wave directions (θ1 and θ2). After splitting clusters based on geo-location and merging clusters based on the intra-cluster statistical properties of the wave parameters, 63 clusters are obtained. The identified clusters and temporal variability are used to define NEVA models describing extreme Hm0 statistics at cluster level. Intra-cluster Hm0 observations are detrended before fitting the GEV parameters by means of Bayesian Inference. Informative priors are constructed by pooling the GEV parameter information from the intra-cluster grid points. Potential non-stationarity is accounted for by adding the Theil-Sen parameters (b and b0) to the location parameter (μ∗), making the location parameter a linear function of time. The model parameters subsequently read: Hm0 ∼ GEV (μ∗ + (b · t + b0) , σ∗, ξ∗). Using the extreme Hm0 data from the clustering centroid yields the most promising results for describing extreme Hm0 statistics at cluster level under the condition that the intra-cluster exhibits homogeneous values for b and b0.<br/><br/>The applied HAC analysis presented in this research is not the optimal strategy. The identified clusters exhibit heterogeneous values for b and b0 Because non-stationarity ofHm0 was not accounted for during the HAC analysis. This hinders the performance of the NEVA models at cluster level. Also, whether the derived methodology can be applied for the long-term projection of future extreme wave events in the North Sea is debatable. The non-stationary of extreme Hm0 is best described by a cyclic pattern. Without a thorough understanding of the underlying causes of the non-stationary in Hm0 and without future projections of the extreme wave climate, the applicability of NEVA for deriving extreme Hm0 design conditions in light of climate change cannot be guaranteed.","Waves; Extreme Waves; North Sea; Climate Change; Clustering; Clustering Analysis; Hierarchical clustering; Extreme Value Analysis; Non-stationarity Extreme Value Analysis; Temporal Trend Testing; hydraulic Infrastructure; Hydraulic Structures; Design and Risk Assessment; Netherlands; Flood Safety; Probabilistic design; design loads; climate adaptation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","","56.5110, 3.5156"

As part of the thesis, a model was made accounting for longitudinal variation both in the grain regression and gas flow. This model was validated through data from T-Minus Engineering measuring the pressure at the forward closure. With a sensitivity study, the effect of aspect ratio and length was researched. This resulted in a recommendation for geometry changes of the DART booster of T-Minus Engineering B.V. . Furthermore, additional validation data was acquired of static pressure along the length of the motor, instead of single-point measurements, to provide better validation of one-dimensional models.

As a result, standard data practices needed to be set in order to facilitate the storage and exchange of these city models. For this purpose, the Open Geospatial Consortium ( OGC ) adopted CityGML as an international standard for effective use of 3D city models. Generally, the models are encoded in Extensible Markup Language ( XML ) files, however, other file encodings can also be used like JavaScript Object Notation ( JSON ) files with CityJSON. Moreover, CityGML can also be adapted for a database encoding like the 3D City Database ( 3DCityDB ), on which this thesis is based upon. The benefit of using a database encoding is that databases are built to handle and organize large amount of data, which 3D city models usually consist of. The 3DCityDB is an open source project developed for PostgreSQL and Oracle databases. It is supported by other software in the 3DCityDB suite that facilitate its use in different applications. The 3DCityDB tries to simplify the complexity of CityGML, however, its approach remains difficult for users to access data directly without technical knowledge of databases, Structured Query Language ( SQL ), CityGML and/or 3DCityDB structure. Derived frm thios limitation, the primary objective of this research is to develop an approach that could simplify user interaction with the 3DCityDB from within a Q Geographical Information System ( QGIS ) environment. To achieve this, ”3DCityDB-Loader”, a QGIS plugin, is developed to handle complex server operations in the background, whilst providing a user-friendly workspace environment. The complete functionality of the plugin is segmented into client and server-side parts. This thesis focuses on the client-side development but both parts were jointly developed in a common iterative process of requirement identification, development, testing and assessment. The most important requirements for the plugin is to have layers that can interact with 3DCityDB data, be able to work with multiple users with different privileges, allow for multiple scenarios (database schemas), allow to edit attributes, handle different Levels Of Detail ( LOD ) and geometry representations and finally be able to operate from a Graphical User Interface ( GUI ) in QGIS . Regarding the client-side part of the plugin, it can manage database connections, manage the server-side installation, manage and create layers for multiple scenarios from a GUI , include CityGML generic attributes, enumerations and codelists and automatically set their relations, automatically structure a hierarchical QGIS Table Of Contents ( TOC ) and finally automatically apply standard colors on different features. At the time of writing this document, the plugin is at version 0.4. The limitations are mostly related to functionalities that are not yet supported, with future development being tracked from the project’s GitHub repository. All in all, ”3DCityDB-Loader” facilitates the use of 3DCityDB for users of different fields and expertise with the common denominator being the well-accustomed QGIS environment.","CityGML; 3DCityDB; QGIS; Database; plugin","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

The goal is to design a place where a closely knitted community of makers, scientists, and artists is cultivated. They will be the decision-makers and the actors in space exploration.<br/>To learn how to do that, initially, the thesis embarks on the research of some community aspects on Earth and the way public space contributes to their cultivation in our cities. Specifically, the focus of the study is to observe and analyze the function that Het Park in Rotterdam serves to people. It is a look into the congenital and human side of living in an industrialized world and the values this brings to the community. In space, that natural side will inevitably be different or non-existing and to maintain the values that nature and the park bring to our lives we need to develop a translated alternative. The goal is to add a playful and authentic element to a potentially very machine and virtual future in space.<br/>After an introduction to the direction in which we have been heading since the industrial revolution, the research examines 4 major values taken from the park- social value, health, freedom, and engagement, to understand the importance of addressing the natural and human qualities. Those values are analyzed through park visits and sketches of people utilizing their environment and adapting it with simple means. Conclusively, the research highlights the importance of the presence of the public park in people’s lives even if we forget it or do not notice it on a daily basis and it shows how such a place can strengthen the community and make people more caring and more respectful (Cohen, et. all 2006). It identifies which are the key elements that play a role in the value that the park brings to the citizens. Thus they can be taken and appropriated to the space environment and the space station design.

Accordingly, many church buildings have been converted or are used multi functionally such as the Stevenskerk in Nijmegen (NL), the monumental case study of this project. Thereby, the lifespan of<br/>the building is extended while making use of its embodied energy.<br/>However, the large enclosed space and the insufficient energy performance of the non-insulated building skin lead to an immense heating demand and closing of the Stevenskerk during the winter period due to unsatisfactory thermal conditions. Excessive heating results in a high energy consumption and building related CO2 emissions which are a main contributor to the ongoing climate crisis. Furthermore, the limited usability and accessibility during the cold season reduce the visibility of the national monument. This creates a lack of understanding the relevance of conserving religious heritage among citizens. <br/>Therefore, this project investigated different renovation strategies with the aim to improve the thermal comfort in the Stevenskerk as a case-study for monumental and multi-functional churches by answering the research question «How can the renovation of the stained glass windows in combination with indoor space adaptations increase the thermal comfort in the multi-functional Stevenskerk in order to improve the accessibility of the monument all year around?»<br/>Additional ambitions and values for the identification of suitable renovation measures were defined: the usability of the space, the reduction of the heating demand, the conservation of significant monumental values, the durability of the measures with respect to their sustainability, the proportionality of the financial investment and the acoustic and lighting conditions.<br/>Literature review, in-situ measurements in the Stevenskerk, thermal computer simulations and physical calculations in combination with research by design enabled the identification, the development and the comparison of different renovation methods. The project introduced an evaluation framework which<br/>resulted in a comparative overview of different window renovation and spatial adaptations strategies which is applicable for the Stevenskerk as well as for other multi-functional and monumental church buildings in the Netherlands.<br/>According to the assessment of the introduced strategies, a renovation proposal for the Stevenskerk was developed. Based on the finding that one renovation measure for the whole building cannot fulfill all requirements, distinctive interventions for the different zones in the Stevenskerk are suggested. This enables a flexible and adaptive use according to the needs of different user groups and the space in a long-term perspective in accordance with its social responsibility as a building for the community.<br/>To conclude, this project presents an approach on how to combine current user and building requirements with the preservation of heritage values by developing and selecting suitable renovation strategies in order to promote the functionality and visibility of the Stevenskerk and other multi-functional churches as «living heritage».","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

Further, it is estimated that this 39% is total of 11% Embodied Carbon emissions (mainly the carbon emissions during construction processes and material production processes) and 28% Operational Carbon emissions (mainly the carbon emissions during the operation period of the buildings, for e.g., carbon emissions due to heating and cooling systems). Despite of achieving remarkable results in reducing operational carbon, the embodied carbon is increasing proportionally to the total carbon emissions. And, if no steps taken to focus on embodied carbon, then it is estimated that it can increase up to 57% of the carbon emission by building sector, by 2040. For these reasons it is imperative to focus on embodied carbon right from the initial design stages of new, extension, or renovation building projects. The key sources of the carbon emissions during the construction of any building system are the structural elements and building skin elements. That is due to the “Upfront Carbon” emissions by high consumptions of fossil fuel-based carbon intensive materials like cement, steel for main structural elements and aluminum for the façade elements. Thus, to focus on Upfront Carbon from early stages of designing is crucial to mitigate embodied carbon.<br/><br/>Hence, the purpose of the project here is to develop “An envelope” for the extension proposal from the Delft Student Rowing club - Proteus Eretes. To fulfill the purpose and to answer the research questions set in the research framework, the project is divided in to four phases, Research phase, Concept phase, Engineering phase, and Reflection phase.<br/><br/>Research phase includes the set of literature research, case studies, and interviews. It involves the understanding of the requirements of Proteus Eretes for the extension. Most importantly it consists of the understanding of various protective and technical functional requirements such as Insulate, Support, and Protect of the building envelope. To focus on embodied carbon of the building envelope, during research phase, the study of embodied carbon is subdivided in to three parts “Focus – Calculate – Mitigate”. By focus, it means to understand every life cycle stage of the embodied carbon as a part of whole life cycle approach, and then calculate the global potentials of the materials used, by referring to the EPD’s. And then mitigate part includes various mitigation strategies and tools. Here, circular design strategies such as design for disassembly, design for adaptability, and design for reuse are employed with the integration of carbon sequestering materials in the Product Development Methodology, during the Concept phase. Further in the design development the fundamentals of Prefab building process are considered by making the whole design modular and produced using one digital carpentry machine. The Engineering phase consists of the in depth planning of assembly order of the components in factory and on site. Thus, making the final design building envelope constructable with circular design principles and carbon sequestering materials to mitigate its embodied carbon.<br/><br/>Key words – Embodied carbon, Upfront carbon, Extension, Building envelope, EPDs, Circular design, Design for disassembly, Design for adaptability, Design for reuse, Carbon sequestering, Prefab building process, Digital carpentry, Product Development Methodology","Embodied carbon; Upfront carbon; Extension; Building envelope; EPDs; Circular design; Design for disassembly; Design for adaptability; Design for reuse; Carbon sequestering; Prefab building process; Digital carpentry; Product Development Methodology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

There is a rise in global temperature levels and greenhouse gas emissions. The building industry has a huge share in this aspect. The current built environment accounts for almost 40% of energy consumption and 36% of CO2 emissions in the Netherlands. Therefore, to meet national energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emission targets, the energy performance of existing buildings is critical. In existing buildings, the challenge is threefold when it comes to refurbishment. Occupant behaviour towards indoor environment and energy usage behaviour. Secondly, the labour required for technical changes and lastly the financial limitations. Therefore, it is important to design or redesign buildings with the aim to provide good indoor quality using energy-efficient building elements which are simple, adaptable, sustainable, and affordable. The study explored in this graduation focuses on the renovation of Proteus Eretes rowing accommodation using integrated climate design strategies. The report highlights the need of occupants and their interaction with the indoor environment. The proposal is a combination of key solutions that can make a huge impact on energy savings and comfort conditions in the rowing facility.

As a result, a design for a new city called Navi Mumbai was presented in 1964. It was originally planned to further extend the urbanization of Mumbai to the mainland instead of any further northwards. This satellite town needed to decongest the population, absorb the migration from the countryside, reduce the concentration of economic activity on Bombay Island and lower the traffic congestions. Navi Mumbai was a city planned for the common man; with jobs and housing in different sectors. <br/>But instead of becoming a city for the common man, Navi-Mumbai today is, as many cities of the so-called Global South, a place where social inequality is growing and housing becomes a commodity. <br/>Housing is a primary human right, but for the urban poor it is a prerequisite of political and social citizenship. For them a house is not only for life alone, but a house is also a production and marketplace. So the project focuses on a better integration of the people from the lower income groups into the city’s urban fabric. So they have fuller access to wider social networks, a more dignified social role and a deeper source for accumulating information, credibility and dignity for the urban poor in public life as well. <br/>Two World Merge is about two different scales. One being the unit scale, by combining economic and domestic activities within one housing unit to create healthier working and living conditions.

It additionally argues the mitigation of the impact of the cities and the building sector on climate crisis. The aim of the thesis is to find a sustainable, in terms of longevity and feasibility, connection between the unexploited building stock and the shelter-less people, for the benefit of the users, the society and the environment alike, through zero-energy design and circular adaptation. <br/><br/>The study analyzes the possible approach of renovation and adaptive reuse of the existing, untapped, residential buildings in order to meet the current climate regulations and future occupants’ needs. A literature review examines three main domains separately: zero-energy design, circularity and collective housing. A case study analysis of alternative collective housing models in particular monitors the porosity of this plan and its ability to be combined with zero-energy and circular principles. This research offers the opportunity to recognize possible methodologies that can then be applied on a specific case study. <br/><br/>Research is consolidated in the case of the refugee settlement complex of Alexandra’s Avenue (1933-36), in the city of Athens, and seeks to propose a number of recommendations for its renovation, energy upgrade, redevelopment and reuse. The fact that the research refers to listed buildings, constitutes the biggest limitation, in terms of design decisions. The case study it-self, clearly depicts the afore-mentioned issues in the Athenian context, and alongside includes building, social, historic and other characteristics that compose an ideal example for an energy efficient, user-oriented, adaptive reuse.<br/><br/>A step-by-step approach is adopted in order to develop (re)design methodologies for the energy transition and circular adaptation of the case study. In addition, a possible network of interactions between the involved stakeholders is proposed so as to create a holistic and functional business model. Ultimately, the thesis proposes an inclusive and integrated framework for the renovation of the existing, old, heritage, building stock, driven by zero-energy and circular principles, for the less-favored, towards a new typology of social and collective housing. The development of this framework is based on facts and data that can make it potentially applicable to similar cases elsewhere. <br/><br/>Further research on the topic would help facilitate the transition to integrated frameworks of renovation processes.","adaptive reuse; social housing; Residential buildings; listed; heritage; Collective housing; zero energy design; Circularity; circular renovation; operational plan","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","","37.988863,23.7534108"

Different societal problems that already exist will continue to grow if nothing changes in policy, like a shortage of care staff, a shortage in housing, loneliness among elderly and other problems. Facilitating intergenerational reciprocity can contribute by adressing these problems and offering a healthy future of the elderly with enough care capacity. The main question 'How can architecture support reciprocity in intergenerational relationships that include elderly?' is answered from several perspectives and translated into architectural interventions. Three different perspectives are taken into consideration, directly and indirectly leading to reciprocity: Co-care, co-dividuality and comunity. For reciprocity within professional care context (Co-care), the workload needs to be reduced to create more room for reciprocity to happen. Several architectural interventions can be done that directly or indirectly impact the workload within professional care For reciprocal releationships to happen within the personal context (Co-dividuality), elderly need to have a sense of equal value. This can be facilitated by different architectural means, some of them being applicable for all elderly. Other architectural interventions leave room for the uniqueness of each elderly. Some co-dividual aspects also impact healthy living and have a indirect impact on reciprocity. Co-munity functions as the catalyst of the other two perspectives. For reciprocity to happen within community, there needs to be social involvement. Social involvement is distinguished on three differentlevels: Bonding, bridging, and linking. All levels need different kinds of architectural interventions to facilitate reciprocity. Taking all the researched perspectives into consideration, a positive feedback loop can be seen, resulting in less need for care and improving health. All topics discussed in this research are interconnected connected and when facilitated, they offer 'growth' of every other aspect.","Elderly; Housing; Care; Intergenerational; Co-dividuality; Community","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOG_GkbLWlY Under the Sun - An Architectural Short Movie","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","Architectural Engineering Graduation Studio",""

Currently, 3 GW of offshore wind are installed in The Netherlands. However, the ambitions of the Dutch government are to have 30 GW offshore wind installed by 2030. The current installed offshore wind capacity of Europe is 28 GW. The EU ambitions are to install 60 GW by 2030 and to install 300 GW by 2050. Wind farms are designed to have a lifetime of 20 to 25 years. When wind turbines reach their end-of-life, they have to be decommissioned. The already installed capacity and the enormous amount of turbines that are to be installed in order to reach the offshore wind ambitions, eventually all have to be removed. To date, only a hand full of offshore wind farms have been decommissioned. This is due to the fact that not many wind farms have reached their end-of-life. The most used technique is partial removal, where a cut is made at a few meters below the mudline and the top part of the monopile is removed from the marine environment. However, this method leaves a significant part of the monopile in place after decommissioning, leaving behind tonnes of steel in the subsurface. Completely removing the monopile from the marine environment can be done by using vibratory pile removal. By modelling the forces and limits involved in vibratory pile removal, an estimation of the diameters up to which vibratory pile removal is technically feasible has been done. In addition, the costs and $CO_2$-eq. emissions have been modelled and examined. The opposed method uses vibration to reduce the soil resistance along the shaft of the monopile by creating soil fatigue. With the currently available tools, it is possible to extract monopiles up to a diameter of approximately 5.8 meters in clay and up to approximately 7.9 meters in sand. For a mixed soil profile, it is likely that the limit lays with these two numbers. Likely, it is possible to extend these limits by developing more powerful tools or by internally dredging the monopile before using vibratory pile removal. By retrieving extra steel from the soil by choosing complete removal over partial removal, more steel can be recycled. This leads to an extra emission reduction of approximately 100 to 830 mT $CO_2$-eq. per monopile, dependent on the diameter and the type of connection between the transition piece and the monopile. Whether complete removal is preferred from a economic point of view is dependent on the type of connection between the transition piece and the monopile and the diameter. Based on the results found during this research in can be said that all wind farms that reach their end-of-life up to 2039 can be decommissioned using vibratory pile removal. Dependent on the soil type of the subsurface, even wind farms reaching their end-of-life up to 2045 can be removed using vibratory pile removal. In many cases complete removal should be preferred over partial removal based on both economic and environmental grounds. In some cases a cost benefit analysis should be made in order to determine whether a higher reduction of $CO_2$-eq. emission is worth the extra costs involved in completely removal a wind farm with vibratory pile removal.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","",""

In this context, the most common data model is CityGML, which provides an application domain extension called the Energy ADE to store energy-related data in a systematic manner in XML format. On the other hand, CityJSON has been developed as a JSON-based encoding to exchange 3D city models, with the aim of eliminating the hierarchical structure and shortcomings of the XML-based CityGML. However, even though an extension mechanism exists in CityJSON, an energy-related CityJSON extension is not present in the current literature. Therefore, the aim of this thesis is to develop and test a CityJSON Energy Extension. To achieve this, the space heating demand calculation of buildings is chosen as the use case to validate and test the Extension.<br/>In this thesis, a simplified version of the Energy ADE, called the Energy ADE KIT profile, is used as the first step to create a semi-direct translation to a CityJSON Energy Extension. After validating the Extension with the official validator of CityJSON, the space heating demand is calculated for a subset of the Rijssen-Holten in the Netherlands according to the Dutch standard NTA 8800. Required input data is collected from various data sources and stored in the CityJSON Energy Extension to test its usability for the use case. The Extension is then improved depending on the results of the tests based on the use case. The results show that the semi-direct translation lacked numerous objects and attributes to store certain input data, while the final version of the Extension fully supports the use case. Furthermore, while the semi-direct translation contained deep hierarchical structures, these were eliminated in the final Extension to comply with the design decisions behind CityJSON. The main differences between the Energy ADE and the CityJSON Energy Extension reflected this philosophy as well, where the former was built with a deep hierarchical structure, while the latter flattens this hierarchy by using the characteristics of JSON. In addition, a comparison in file sizes showed that the input 3D city model of the study area in CityJSON format had a file size of 40.6 MB, whereas the output CityJSON + Energy Extension file with all input and output data was 65.8 MB. It was discussed that this increase of 25.2 MB in file size is not significant, considering the high increase in the number of objects stored in the file. On the other hand, space heating demand calculation resulted in negative values for 32 buildings in the study area, which was not expected. While the possible reasons were detected, a solution could not be developed in the given time frame of the thesis. Overall, this thesis showed that the CityJSON Energy Extension can provide an easy-to-use alternative to CityGML Energy ADE, where the Extension files can be simply parsed by software and easily understood by the user without reaching large file sizes.<br","3D city modelling; CityGML; CityJSON; Energy ADE; Urban Energy Modelling; Space heating demand","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

This information can be used in sustainable urban planning, urban climate research, population estimation, and three-dimensional (3D) building reconstruction, etc. Nowadays, building height information is obtained mostly by photogrammetry, high-resolution photos, and aerial Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. However, the existing technique is constrained by issues of scale, cost, and quality. <br/>The Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) was launched in 2018, using photoncounting LiDAR technology to gather Earth’s surface elevation data globally. It represents the highest level in space-borne laser altimeters and has been proved can estimate building height. <br/>In this thesis, a method is proposed to estimate the height of all buildings in the Netherlands. To estimate the building height, elevation data from ICESat-2 and footprints from Basisregistratie Adressen en Gebouwen (BAG) are two used datasets. Spatial interpolation methods and percentile methods are used to get ground and roof elevation for each footprint, respectively. Random Forest Regression (RFR) method is used to deal with the low coverage of ICESat-2. <br/>The result shows that less 3% of buildings could obtain their height from ICESat-2 data. Among these buildings, 90% of them are lower than 10 meters and half of them are between 5 - 10 meters. This caused a low performance of the prediction model with Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.1m. The building between 5 - 10 meters has the smallest MAE of 1.1267m. Small amount of available of ICESat-2 data is the key reason, which leads to the training data of building over 10 meters is not enough. <br/>The results reveal it is impossible to get the height of all buildings in the Netherlands with ICESat-2 data. But the proposed method is a feasible option for buildings between 5 and 10 meters in height.<br","building height; ICESat-2; Random Forest Regression","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

(mentor); Ploeger, H.D. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The building permit process in the Netherlands is mostly digitalized, however, there are still some issues. A downsize of information, the manual checking from the municipality, and the duration of the process are some of these issues. To overcome these issues information between 3D building design models, so-called Building Information Modeling (BIM)s, and 3D city models must be exchanged. To exchange interoperable information between BIMs and 3D city models is called integration. In this research, automatic rule checking is performed after the BIM encoded in Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) is converted to a 3D city model encoded in CityJSON. Integration, however, is not as straightforward as it seems. Other researches have been carried out to perform a full integration from 3D city models encoded in CityGML to BIMs encoded in IFC. This is rather complex and so use cases are utilized. In most other researches using the building permit process as a use case, the automatic rule checking is performed in the BIM domain. In this research, a conversion is performed from a BIM encoded in IFC to a 3D city model encoded in CityJSON. The first step in this research is to analyze land use plans and select the most often used rules. These rules are further analyzed on required information to check the rules. For both IFC and CityJSON, the required information for the rules representing the same information as entities in the standards are selected. In the next step, the input models are analyzed on the presence of the entities from the standards. Before the conversion is performed, it is determined which entity will be converted from which input model and whether or not additional information is needed. Finally, the conversion is performed. The 3D city model can be used for rule checking and satisfies the selected rules. The implications of this research are described for the digital building permit process as well as for the integration of the two domains. Guidelines to model correct BIMs for the digital building permit process and further integration are drafted. In conclusion, the tool created in this research works successfully. Automatic rule checking on all the rules in land use plans is technically possible. In practice, automatic rule checking will most likely not take over soon, since rules are still written ambiguously, builders work with 2D drawings mostly, and the Environmental and Planning Act is soon to be established.","BIM; building permit process; automatic rule checking; Netherlands; 3D city models; land use plans","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

(mentor); De Breuker, R. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In the last few years, a new aircraft configuration has been developed: the electric Vertical Take-off/Landing aircraft (eVTOL). To improve aircraft efficiency, structures are lighter and more flexible. Due to the structure's flexible nature and the use of propellers for propulsion, eVTOL are prone to whirl flutter, which consists of a dynamic instability produced by the propeller aerodynamics and structure interaction. <br/>This thesis aims to assess whirl flutter in a multirotor VTOL considering propellers in thrusting conditions. A semi-analytical model was developed and then implemented on MATLAB for two types of configurations: a conventional propeller and two counter-rotating propellers at the tip of a cantilever beam structure.<br/> The propeller aerodynamics in thrust conditions were obtained through blade element momentum theory (BEMT) and extended to counter-rotating propellers. Then, the BEMT flow characteristics were coupled to a quasi-steady aerodynamics perturbation model using strip theory to obtain the forces produced by the propeller whirl motion. Additionally, the beam structure was modeled using a space frame finite element model, in combination with a two-degree of freedom system model for the propeller-pylon structure. Then, the structural system was coupled to the unsteady aerodynamic forces produced by the whirl motion obtaining the aeroelastic model from which the stability analysis was performed.<br/>The model was used to analyze whirl flutter on a multirotor aircraft designed by the company Betronka SPA. It was found that the multirotor does not suffer from whirl flutter for the designed flight conditions, considering the conventional and counter-rotating configurations. Afterward, to study the thrust influence on whirl flutter, flow conditions and propeller angular speeds outside the designed limit were studied. The main findings are: the counter-rotating propeller configuration is more stable compared to the default configuration, increasing the whirl flutter speeds; thrust conditions stabilize the default configuration, increasing the propeller angular speed to encounter whirl flutter by 4%; thrust conditions are negligible for counter-rotating propeller configuration considering constant angular velocity. <br","Whirl flutter; Multirotor; BEM; Flutter; Aeroelasticity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Water utilities face many challenges, including pipe bursts that cause significant non-revenue water losses. Detecting those bursts early is important for the water sector in its path to achieve sustainable water resource management. This study presents a scalable data-driven methodology for burst detection in water distribution systems that is based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based neural networks (NNs) and includes two stages: prediction and classification. Time-series of hydraulic (flow and pressure) signals are fed to the LSTM, whereas domain (time) features of the next time step are fed independently to regular neurons. These two streams of information are then concatenated to predict the values of the hydraulic features of the next time step. The model is trained on normal conditions only, so that when fed with data corresponding to a burst, the predictions will mismatch the observations. Comparison of the predictions to the observations is quantified though an error function, which is then used for classification. Specifically, a variable error threshold that corresponds to a pre-defined extreme percentile of the error distribution is used to discern bursts from normal conditions. The methodology is corroborated on two different types of bursts: (a) real bursts in district metered areas (DMAs) in the United Kingdom and (b) simulated fire hydrant leak tests in the same DMAs. For the real bursts, sensitivity analysis of the algorithm is performed to assess how data resolution and error threshold affect the performance. The flexibility of the method is studied for the simulated fire hydrant leaks, where additional information streams from new sensors are incorporated in the model by means of applying transfer learning and fine-tuning. The results obtained demonstrate that this scalable LSTM-based methodology works reasonably well in real-life settings and can successfully identify burst events, both real and simulated, even in DMAs with a small number of installed sensors. Furthermore, it is assessed how the flexibility of the LSTM neurons is pivotal for burst detection when utilizing a varying number of sensors.","Deep learning; LSTM; Transfer learning; Burst detection; District metered areas","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-31","","","","Water Management","",""

Firstly, frame-level AF probing tasks were implemented to analyze AF information captured by different speech representations.

Traditional methods rely on empirical assumptions and statistical theories that require continuous calibration and still struggle to accurately represent local variability.

The combustor is operated with methane as fuel and air as the oxidiser, under an overall lean equivalence ratio ranging from 0.6-0.9. The work focused on designing and applying different experimental techniques under varying operating conditions. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is used to characterise the flow field for reacting and non-reacting conditions. Local gas temperature and gas composition measurements are performed to characterise the formation of NOx in the combustor. Emission data and local gas temperatures are further reported as a function of the equivalence ratio, thermal power input, and oxidiser's oxygen concentration. PIV revealed the flow field structures to be very similar between non-reacting and reacting flow conditions; the location of the recirculation zones remained unaffected. Significant differences exist in the axial flow velocities and turbulence levels in the central recirculation zone (CRZ). Radial temperature measurements near the reaction zone revealed the temperature profiles to flatten for a decrease in equivalence ratio, indicative of distributed combustion. Gas composition measurements are performed near the exhaust of the combustor. The measurements showed the combustor to perform very well from an emission standpoint. Measurements showed the NOx on the centreline to be ultra-low (&lt;10ppm) for all cases investigated. The N2O and NNH mechanisms are identified as the major contributors to the production of NOx and not the thermal pathway, as the gas temperature is consistently below the thermal NOx threshold of 1800K. A reduction in the equivalence ratio and a reduction in the oxygen concentration both reduce NOx emissions. The measured levels of CO and CH4 were negligible near the exhaust for all operating conditions investigated, confirming that combustion is fully completed at this location. Measurements of CO and CH4 near the reaction zone indicate distributed combustion, where a reduction in the equivalence ratio below 0.7 resulted in elongation and widening of the reaction zone. Oxygen measurements near the exhaust and close to the reaction zone indicate the entrainment of cooling air into the combustion chamber, which would locally influence the equivalence ratio. It is recommended to redesign the exhaust duct connection to eliminate the entrainment of cooling air.","Flameless Combustion; Distributed Combustion; Ultra-low NOx; Experimental Research","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-06-28","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The usage of third-party verified credentials bring us convenience in authentication. The Verifiable Credential (VC) data model is a new standard proposed by the W3C association to ease the expression and verification of third-party verified credentials on the Internet. The issuance and presentation of verifiable credentials are tamper-evident and privacy-preserving by design. However, the current verifiable credential data model lacks an explicit revocation design that guarantees the secure operations of the system. The lack of a revocation mechanism significantly limits the application of verifiable credentials. This thesis studies the revocation mechanisms of existing verifiable credential implementations. The existing revocation mechanisms are either tamper-evident or privacy-preserving. None of them can achieve the two properties together. To evolve the revocation mechanism to be both tamper-evident and privacy-preserving by design, we propose a new method which combines the BBS+ signature, a cryptographic accumulator and the blockchain. Our design enables the verifier to verify the presented credential’s revocation status without compromising the credentials holders’ privacy. We implement a proof-of-concept of our revocation mechanism to show it is practical in the real world. The experimental results show that after adding our revocation mechanism, the presentation time of a five-attribute credential changes from 22.22ms to 62.11ms (+39.89ms), and the verification time changes from 13.36ms to 44.56ms (+31.86ms).

Double Descent refers to the shape of the test risk curve, which can show a second descent in the over-parameterized regime, resulting in the remarkable combination of both low training and low test risk. However, much is still unknown about this behaviour. In this thesis we consider Double Descent and more specifically 'beneficial overfitting', meaning that the lowest test risk as a function of the number of parameters is achieved in the over-parameterized regime. We are mainly interested in under what conditions beneficial overfitting occurs. We start by exploring the test risk behaviour for simple linear regression models, with isotropic Gaussian, general Gaussian and sub-Gaussian covariates. For random feature selection and isotropic covariance, beneficial overfitting occurs for a large signal-to-noise ratio. For deterministic feature selection and isotropic covariance, beneficial overfitting occurs if we select features corresponding to the lowest weights. Without feature selection, beneficial overfitting occurs if the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix have a long, flat tail. In the second part of this thesis we check whether the same or similar results can be applied to other models as well. Specifically, we look at kernel regression, random Fourier features and a classification model. It seems that the linear regression results agree with the random Fourier features model, linear and quadratic kernel regression and classification model, but are not applicable for the Gaussian kernel regression case. Hence, more factors need to be considered, besides the eigenvalue behaviour of the covariance or kernel matrix and the way in which features are selected, to fully explain Double Descent and beneficial overfitting.","Double Descent; benign overfitting; beneficial overfitting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

The aim of this paper is to create a uniform model to store both positive and negative generative and discriminative knowledge tuples. Models are evaluated on a set of generalized queries as well as on the storage they require. Four possible models were evaluated of which two were the most promising: the generative model and the combined model. The generative model is efficient in storage and retrieving generative knowledge for concepts, but relatively slow in distinguishing concepts. Combining the generative model with discriminative tuples gives the combined model, a model that is the most efficient for all queries but expensive in storage.

In wind farms, the so-called wake effect provides the biggest limitation on wind farm total power output. Using wind from the unaffected boundary layer to re-energize the wind flow in the wake provides a method of limiting this wake effect. In this study, kites are introduced to steer the wind flow of the unaffected boundary layer into the wake through a downwash velocity. RANS (Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes) simulations are performed in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software OpenFOAM of the atmospheric boundary layer (1), a small four-turbine wind farm (2) and a wind farm with static kites between the turbines (3). The turbines are modelled through the actuator disc approach, and kites are introduced through the more complex actuator line method. Results of the athmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and wind farm simulations correspond well with literature. Through extensive kite parameter studies, an optimal layout of kites in the wind farm is presented yielding a wind farm efficiency increase of 2.3 %, which increases over 5% for even larger kites. Kite size and the kite’s downstream location show to impact the re-energising levels of the wake flow the most. The kites generate a downwash wake instead of a single downwash velocity, a finding that should further be studied in future research.","Wind Energy; Kites; Energy Efficiency; Wake Aerodynamics; Atmoshperic Boundary Layer; WInd Farm; Actuator Disk Method; Actuator Line Method; OpenFOAM; CFD","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The increased power density on chips resulted in increased heat and the formation of non-uniform hotspots. Earlier research has shown that the package design and layout of package components in flip-chip design can influence the thermal heat distribution on a chip. Especially the copper pillars play a role in the distribution of heat on a chip. These pillars can reduce the maximal temperature of a hotspot when placed correctly. Designing a pillarmap that adheres to manufacturing rules can be lengthy and complex. Therefore, pillarmaps are currently not optimised for thermal behaviour. The default strategy is to place them in a grid. This research aims to automatically optimise pillarmaps for thermal heat distribution with the use of artificial intelligence. Pillarmaps are optimised using the theoretical behaviour of heat in packages combined with Stochastic Hill Climbing and Squeaky Wheel Optimisation techniques. The layouts are automatically re-simulated in a finite elements simulation tool when needed. The optimisation strategies are tested on experimental setups with single and dual hotspots. The optimisation strategies are also evaluated on an actual product, but limitations on pillar placement reduced the effect of the optimisation techniques. Also, the influence of different pillar diameters on an optimisation strategy is discussed. The optimisation techniques can reduce hotspots and improve the heat distribution in a scenario with multiple hotspots. The success of the optimisation techniques is subject to the amount of freedom they have to change pillar locations and where the hotspots are on the chip.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

(mentor); Nikolic, I. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In light of worsening climate change and an increased interest in adapting infrastructure to cope with its effects, model-based decision support has become an essential tool for policy makers. In conditions of deep uncertainty, models may be used to explore a large space of possible system behaviours and so encourage a wider consideration of the possible futures. Such methods, where the focus is intentionally broad, fall under the remit of exploratory modelling and are a potential antidote to traditional predictive modelling methods where only a marginal treatment of uncertainty is attempted. One serious issue limiting the full exploitation of exploratory modelling is its computational intensity, the many computational experiments requiring large amounts on computing power which makes some analyses too expensive to attempt. In order to fully exploit the promise of exploratory modelling new methods of reducing computational intensity are needed. Polynomial chaos expansions (PCEs) are one class of methods which may fulfill this role. Our results conclusively demonstrate that PCEs are capable of accurately reproducing statistical moments and determining Sobol sensitivity indices significantly faster than direct-sampling methods, often requiring orders of magnitude fewer function evaluations. However, we found that the curse of dimensionality rendered conventional PCEs too costly for use with higher-dimensional models. We found that conventional sparse grids were effective at reducing the computational cost associated with fitting PCEs with high-dimensional models, as long as the model output was sufficiently smooth. For models where sparse grids were able to converge with reasonable accuracy, supplementing the PCCs with a modified Gersnter's dimension-adaptive algorithm further improved convergence times. The anisotropic refinement strategy employed by the algorithm allows for accurate determination of Sobol sensitivity indices with a minimum of computational effort.","Exploratory Modeling; Sensitivity Analysis; Modelling; Polynomial Chaos Expansion; curse of dimensionality; model order reduction; Surrogate modelling; uncertainty quantification; Sobol' Method; Sampling; Design of Experiment; Interpolation polynomials","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://github.com/JeffreyDillonLyons/curse_breaking Github repository.","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

These materials have garnered interest owing to their unique properties such as high electron mobility, high gravimetric capacity for hydrogen especially after metal decoration, thermal conductivity and tensile strength amongst others. However, for sustained operations of the devices involving these materials, their chemical stability against oxygen is of paramount importance. Especially in the applications involving exposure of the material to air. Abundance of oxygen in the air and its high reactivity increases the likelihood of oxidation of the material. In this work, chemical stability of hydrogen passivated 2D Boron structures; Borophane and 2D Boron Hydride against oxygen were analysed. First-principles calculations reveal that Borophane and 2D Boron Hydride have a less negative binding energy thus indicating that the oxygen binds less strongly to compared to Borophene which does not possess surface passivation by hydrogen. Experimental studies in the literature involving synthesis of 2D Boron Hydride reported presence of vacancies. The effect of vacancy site towards the reaction with oxygen was therefore analysed to maintain consistency with the synthesized materials. The simulations were performed on Borophane and 2D Boron Hydride by introducing a Boron vacancy in the system. The DFT simulation of defect containing Borophane revealed that oxygen binds less strongly in the physisorbed state and more strongly in the chemisorbed state, relative to the values obtained for Borophane without any defects. In case of 2D Boron Hydride it was observed that the vacancies provide a stable site for oxygen, for both physisorbed and chemisorbed state. From these simulations we can conclude that presence of vacancies in Boron based 2D materials generally leads to a stable site for oxygen.<br/> <br","Borophene; DFT; Chemical Stability; Boron Hydride; Oxidation; ab initio; first principles; Nanomaterials","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-06-28","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

This waste consists of various chemicals, acids, and heavy metals which are used during these extraction processes. The tailings are usually stored off in tailings storage facilities (TSF) in a loose state, gradually consolidating over time. TSFs founded in seismically active areas are susceptible to liquefaction due to earthquake loading. Historic data show that about 35% of dam failures are due to liquefaction of the tailings, thus increasing the need to study the liquefaction responses of tailings under cyclic loading. Extensive studies have already been<br/>conducted using cyclic direct simple shear (DSS) and cyclic triaxial (CTX) tests as these tests under constant-volume conditions can evaluate the change in pore pressure within a soil accurately. Previous study shows what importance the relative density and sloping ground conditions, known as drained shear bias, have on the cyclic resistance to liquefaction of the tailings. However, in practice the pore water is not bounded within the material and excess pore water can flow out through installed drains. A round-robin program, issued by the University of Western Australia (UWA), requested a study on the liquefaction response of a particular fine-sand tailings material. Inspired by this round-robin program, an interest raised in studying the cyclic shear response of tailings by using a direct shear box to investigate the cyclic behaviour under partially drained conditions. With use of the direct-shear apparatus of Wille Geotechnik, a test program has<br/>been set up to study the influences of relative density and drained shear bias under stress-controlled cyclic shearing and under constant normal load conditions.<br/>Results of the experiments met the expectations that denser soils have a 9.6% higher cyclic resistance ratio (CRR), and samples with applied drained shear bias have a 32% lower CRR compared to samples tested with level ground conditions. Furthermore, samples which underwent post-cyclic shearing showed strain-hardening responses and yielded higher shear stresses compared to the monotonic test, indicating that the constant normal load further densified the samples during cyclic shearing. However, during the experiments, it was<br/>quickly found out that the loading frequency was not being applied optimally making it not possible to analyse influence of partially drained conditions . This study showed promise on its capabilities to study cyclic shear loading on a soil. For future work, it is suggested to perform similar tests under a uniform loading frequency with the use of a shear box to evaluate its capabilities to study on partially drained conditions. It is also recommended to conduct tests under constant volume conditions, to evaluate the shear-box apparatus’ capabilities to<br/>study the liquefaction response of a soil due to excess pore pressure generation.","Direct Shear Box; Cyclic loading; Tailings; CSR; CRR; Relative Density; void ratio; CDS; post-cyclic shear test","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

(mentor); Drenthe, Nigel (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The renaissance of reusable space launch vehicles that is being witnessed in the current space industry demands a new cost estimating approach, which takes into account not only the time dependency in the lifecycle brought upon by reusability, but also the complementary considerations of minimizing cost and reliability. To achieve this end, a methodology was developed which allows to estimate both cost and reliability, and in a trade-space test various configurations at the development and operating phases, in order to achieve an optimum configuration which minimizes cost, maximizes reliability, and fulfills the design requirements. The development, manufacturing and operations costs of reusable launch vehicles were obtained using the Theoretical First Unit equivalence method. This includes the particular cost features of reusability, including the recovery hardware, the retrieval of the reusable equipment and its refurbishment. Furthermore, a model for the failure cost was developed, including: Flight replacement, Insurance Penalties, Failure Investigation, Modifications and Downtime. A reliability model is implemented in parallel to the cost model, which allows to obtain a flight-dependent reliability estimate, taking into account the possible reliability increase methods, such as redundancy, derating, engine-out capability, and extensive testing. This is achieved using publicly available test and operational data and using non-parametric (Kaplan-Meier) as well as parametric (Exponential and Weibull Maximum Likelihood Estimates) techniques in order to obtain life-cycle reliability. These two models coalesce into a trade-space where it is possible to tune the launcher configuration in order to meet its requirements, while minimizing cost and/or maximizing reliability. At the design level, the features of different configurations and testing programs can be compared, in order to achieve the lowest cost possible while attaining the necessary reliability targets. On the other hand, at the operation level, the reliability figures can be used in conjunction with the cost per flight in order to obtain the expected cost of failure and value throughout the life-cycle of the launch vehicle. This allows the designer to forecast the potential financial losses throughout the operating life of the vehicle, and look to minimize these losses while securing proper funding to cover them, which is especially critical in the first years of operations. Two use-cases are presented. Firstly, the model is applied to the Falcon 9 vehicle. Verification of the cost figures shows that the error of the methodology is under 30%. A projection of the life-cycle costs is obtained, as well as the expected cost of failure and expected value. Recommendations are given in order to mitigate losses and advise the planning of the life-cycle of the fleet and its reuses. It was found that at an initial stage, where cost reduction from learning and reliability growth haven’t yet taken hold, flights have a negative expected value, meaning that the launch provider can expect to lose money with these flights. Insurance options are investigated in order to mitigate these losses. Secondly, a study is done based on the Ariane 6 publicly available data, in order to study the impact of varying the number of engines in its first stage as well as engine commonality with the upper stage. It was found that for an expendable vehicle such as the Ariane 6, a single-engine configuration provides the most value, as the manufacturing costs of producing several engines per flight does not compensate eventual lower development costs. On the other hand, it was found that for a reusable vehicle, the stricter the reliability requirements, the more a multi-engine configuration is advantageous. This is due to the lower development costs combined with the replacement of the high cost of manufacturing engines with refurbishment costs, with an optimum for a configuration of 4-5 engines.","Cost; Reliability; Reusability; Space; Rocket; Reusable Launch Vehicle","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The aim of this study was to come up with an innovative and strategic mapping-based toolbox or methodology that will function as a new addition to the existing valuation guidelines. In this way, an attempt was made to contribute to the development of knowledge for a more inclusive, people-centred and participatory way of dealing with heritage (in line with the current societal shift). <br/><br/>This study showed a step-by-step method whereby the Plague house in Leiden (a 17th century national monument in the Netherlands) was used as a canvas. The first step of this method consisted of counter-mapping the social meaning of the past by means of a ‘newspaper counter-map’ focusing on the 20th century, and a ‘crossed-history counter-map’ combining archival information from different time layers. The next step of this method consisted of counter-mapping the social meaning of the present. This was done in four (slightly) different ways and by means of four different target groups, namely through:<br/><br/>•The combination of a short anonymous and analogue survey and individual counter-mapping assignment with target group 1 (fifteen residents of the nearby ‘Vondellaan’ and ‘Van Baerlestraat’ in Leiden) and target group 3 (three employees of the Naturalis museum, the former function of the Plague house).<br/>•A low-key, interactive and participatory stand with anonymous survey questions on pin boards and two collective counter-mapping assignments with target group 2 (about twenty different visitors during the ‘De Buurt’-festival event, held in the Plague house).<br/>•A joint and face-to-face dialogue (‘oral history’) about the survey questions and collective counter-mapping assignment with target group 4 (two residents of the Plague house complex).<br/><br/>The last step of this method consisted of subsequently ‘linking back’ the data obtained through the counter-mapping of the present to the spatial (physical) elements of the building. This was done on the basis of three different themes:<br/>1. Memory / spirit of the place<br/>2. Place attachment / spatial qualities <br/>3.

More importantly, however, the results also seemed to indicate that the combination of (the various concluding results from) each of these methodological steps of both the past and the present, due to the merging of these partly corresponding and partly different perspectives, can provide a more comprehensive, inclusive, and in-depth insight into the socio-cultural or ‘intangible’ aspects that can potentially be used as a design narrative or guiding theme.","architectural heritage; intangible aspects; (collective) memories; social meaning; spirit of the place; collaborative mapping; counter-mapping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Explorelab","",""

In this work, we explore the potential of fusing a 3+1D radar point cloud and a monocular image to further close this performance gap in 3D object detection. We propose a generic and modular fusion architecture to extract both spatial and semantic cues from an RGB image to complement the radar point cloud. In a two-stage approach, we first generate a 3D point cloud representation of the input monocular image appended with semantic information through our proposed RAID (RAdar guided Instance-aware Depth) network, which takes monocular depth map and panoptic masks predicted from any pre-trained state-of-the-art networks, and a radar depth map as input. We then append the resulting point cloud to the 3+1D radar point cloud in a straightforward fusion scheme and train a point cloud-based object detection network. Results on the View-of-Delft dataset [1] show that our fusion approach significantly outperforms multiple state-of-the-art radar-camera fusion methods (proposed fusion vs. best baseline: 53.6 mAP vs. 50.8 mAP), and yields comparable performance to a network trained on LiDAR input when evaluated in the safety-critical driving corridor (80.5 mAP vs. 81.6 mAP).","Radar; LiDAR; Camera; Sensor Fusion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Despite there being roughly an equal divide between the sexes, pubic space Navi Mumbai remains a male domain similar to many other cities around the world. Women’s access to public space is highly conditional and therefore their movement within these spaces is limited. Social restrictions on women’s spatial mobility reduce their job opportunities especially those from the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) and the Low Income Group (LIG) since their livelihoods depend on public space. These women are faced with issues regarding their own safety, their sense of belonging and the lack of access to basic needs such as sanitation. The opportunities for women in the informal sector are extremely limited and the restricted access to public space only exacerbates this issue.<br/><br/>The City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) of Maharashtra was formed by the government in 1970 with the aim to address the urban housing shortage among the lower and middle income groups, including slum dwellers. Their mission is to house these people in pucca, meaning permanent, houses by the year 2022. However, in recent years, the Mass Housing Scheme has become standardized, failing to deliver what it promises, offering no planned amenities and only providing 2 very similar dwelling types. The scheme’s incapability to provide for different people’s inhabitation patterns and needs, demands a new approach. The same is true for the environmental impact on the area, specifically in regards to the mangroves. Ever since CIDCO started to develop the satellite city there has not been any serious action taken to preserve and expand the natural environment.<br/><br/>In response to the research, the proposed project targets areas in Navi Mumbai where the CIDCO Mass Housing Scheme has already been built in order to activate the existing schemes by means of a gender sensitive approach. A set of gender sensitive principles have been derived from the book Why Loiter? by Shilpa Phadke, writing on women and the risk on Mumbai streets. These principles have been applied at every scale from the urban strategy to the individual dwelling unit. The scheme consists of four components including separate building types for each income group with public space acting as a social connector. The project aims to show that by increasing the density and taking up more ground space, an unwelcome dead zone can be converted to a lively, safe and inclusive neighbourhood for all.<br","Gender Sensitive Design; Mass Housing; Affordable Housing; Navi Mumbai; India; Safety; Income Generation; Social Inclusion; Mixed Income","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Global Housing","Global Housing: Mixing Navi Mumbai","19.116519, 72.994866"

The design uses locally available earthy materials and is fully constructed out of CEBs, which makes the elements reusable, able to being safely demolished and zero-waste. The project proposes low-tech construction methods and the possibility of shelter modules to grow into a settlement, while taking sustainable and people flows into consideration. It takes into account the cultural architectural, inner climate and comfort requirements in the attempt to create a home for the refugee communities, rather than a temporary solution.","Shelter Design; Modular Architecture; Earth Construction; Gamification; mass customization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The goal in this thesis is to make a prediction on the total processing time for logistical systems to complete their tasks. For simple systems that can be described using a regular max plus state space model this is done by calculating the systems eigenvalue and multiplying that by the number of iterations required. But, for more complex systems that can only be described using a switching max-plus state space model such as a production line that can change during production, or a rail network where some rail segments become unavailable at times. If these changes to the system are fully within control of the operator they are easily accounted for when predicting the total processing time. But, if the system switches stochastically then one would need to simulate all possible permutations of operation to know the average processing time of the system. Alternatively, one might approximate this average processing time using some simplified model. We found three main methods to predict the total processing time. Firstly, we can fit a generalized extreme value distribution to a histogram of the systems performance and then extrapolate this distribution function. Secondly, we can fit a marginal cost model to a limited simulation of the system and then extrapolate based on that model. Lastly, we can rewrite the expectation of how long the system might take to go through N iterations to an inequality by adding an arbitrary diagonal matrix S, which if minimized can be used to approximate total processing time. All three prediction methods can, when fitted properly predict at least within 15% accuracy with the fitted extreme value distribution generally performing best. We also found that it is possible to save total processing time using a controller based on the marginal cost model if it is possible to exert some limited control over the mode switching process.","max-plus algebra; switching max-plus linear system; prediction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Outdoor positioning can be easily achieved, with the widely used Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), which comprise a universal standard for positioning and are included in every person’s mobile device. However, due to the presence of high buildings in dense urban environments and bad reception in indoor environments, the performance of GNSS is significantly degraded. Therefore, alternative ways of positioning and localisation respectively, need to be explored. In indoor environments, unlike outdoors, there is no universal standard, as the different indoor localisation techniques, that are currently implemented have their own bottlenecks. The most widely used Wi-Fi fingerprinting, requires a constantly up-to-date radio map of the signals from the Wi-Fi access points, whose creation is also a heavy and time-consuming technique. Additionally, other techniques require an installation of costly sensors or either equipment. <br/><br/>Therefore, this thesis investigates the possibility of the ceilings in public or semi-public buildings, being used for indoor localisation, by using features that are included in a simple mobile device. The research additionally involves location tracking of different users, in order to discover different movement patterns in an indoor facility. Indoor localisation is achieved based on the comparison of user and reference data, that can be both point clouds and images, using the Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) of an iPad 12 pro and camera sensors of an Android device. The point cloud-based localisation is implemented based on different combinations of global and local registration techniques, while the image-based approach involves different feature detection, description and matching techniques. Using a web-application to visualise the indoor localisation results, an indoor model and a network graph of the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment, location tracking of different users is implemented and visualised in a heat-map. Additionally, a dashboard is created that can be used by a facility manager to translate the user paths to valuable information and reveal different movement patterns in an indoor facility.<br/><br/>The followed methodology showed promising results, concerning the reliability of ceilings for real-time indoor localisation, based on LiDAR and camera sensors, that are incorporated in up-to-date mobile devices. The robustness of Colored Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm for indoor localisation based on point clouds was revealed, both in terms of time efficiency and quality, while the combination of Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) feature detector and Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) descriptor provides the optimal indoor localisation results with image data. The proposed pipeline revealed encouraging results for use in emergency situations, based on static data acquisition of a user, while it is also suitable for dynamic applications, in case a sensor is mounted on an automated device for indoor mapping operations.<br","Indoor Localisation; Location Tracking; LiDAR; iPad 12 pro; Point Cloud Registration; Feature Matching","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

While a host of technology is offered, in potential joint military operations or joint civil-military operations, several difficulties elapse in geospatial communication, due to different Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS), non-conforming resources, different data formats and different areas of responsibility perception between the stakeholders. The multidisciplinary geospatial communication, data integration and a common modelling geospatial framework is integral for the accurate and fruitful modelling of a military scene assisting in joint operations. Discrete Global Grid Systems (DGGS), while not being a new concept, recently emerged in the geospatial community with various distributed implementations, as a framework to integrate, analyze and manage geospatial data. This thesis attempts to apply a DGGS, using an existing distributed implementation, to integrate different format, two dimensional and elevation geospatial datasets, coming from military and civilian stakeholders, to identify the potential of this approach for military scene modelling. The different approaches of quantization of the datasets are explored for their efficiency, quality and the ability to assist in performing geospatial military analysis, while according APIs are developed for the DGGS conversion. Given the model of the military scene the research tackles the geovisualisation alternatives and a case study is also conducted for a military geospatial operation (ranging) using the DGGS approach. The results show the promising potential of the DGGS approach to model military scenes, providing a uniform area based framework, encapsulating the different qualitative and quantitative military information, offering strong connectivity and hierarchy relations and increasing the qualitative spatial perception and multidisciplinary geospatial communication. The datasets’ DGGS conversion showed advanced integration, segmentation, aggregation and visualization capabilities, also exploiting the 3rd dimension data. Uniform storage through the DGGS integration can be realized in a database, facilitating the distribution of military data. A DGGS can also support common military geospatial operations (i.e. ranging). However, the quality of the results is highly dependent of the original data accuracy/spatial uncertainty and the demanded precision requirements of the scene’s coverage. In parallel, due to the fact that this technology is still emerging and dynamically optimized, it is not mature yet to handle high precision requirements and be treated as a frame with high positioning accuracy for high scale military scene coverages.","DGGS; Discrete Global Grid System; Military scene; Modelling; Military; DGG Systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

These results can then be vectorized, extruded in 3D with their semantic description, and added to a simple 3D model.<br/><br/>This thesis demonstrates that building height data fused to a CNN on RGB aerial images improves the semantic segmentation of roof superstructures for classes with relief. Fusion of absolute and relative height data with different interpolation methods applied to LiDAR point cloud data is achieved through a fusion network from the state-of-the-art (FuseNet). First, experiments prove that detection accuracies increase by 11% on average for dormers and 12% for chimneys compared to U-Net output on the same dataset. Best performance is reached with the fusion of absolute height (rather than normalized) and IDW or NN interpolation technique (rather than none). However, although superstructure types are better recognized, their boundaries are fuzzier due to data input mismatches, and more background pixels are classified. Secondly, the predictions and modelization of both a Bavarian and Dutch test set prove the technique scalability. However, a training set annotated for Bavaria and applied to a test set in the Netherlands yields inaccurate results due to local architectural typologies and different input data characteristics.","Semantic segmentation; Roof superstructures; Deep Learning; CNN; Fusion network; LiDAR; 3D city models","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

While most concepts related to localisation and navigation of outdoors environments are already well derived from various researches and softwares, the indoor environment remains a significantly unexplored area. Nevertheless, lately there have been increased interest on Location Based Services (LBS) and Indoor Positioning Systems (IPS). There are already several methods available for indoor localisation such as Wi-Fi Fingerprinting and Bluetooth Beacons, but none of them is fully functional yet. It remains a field that requires more and further research and investigation in order to reach a satisfactory and complete Indoor Localisation-Navigation method. <br/>Therefore, this thesis's main objective is to investigate and explore a new method for Indoor Localisation based on Isovists. The exploration and evaluation of Isovist-Fingerprinting approach for Indoor Localisation can extend the fields of LBS and Geomatics. The main research question is “To what extent can isovist support Indoor Localisation” and through this and a series of sub-questions to analyse the Isovist concept in relation to the Indoor Localisation. This is achieved by forming a proof of concept and a methodology that investigates how the Isovists would benefit an LBS.<br/>To succeed that the methodology is divided into 4 main sections. The Data Acquisition for which the newly supported from smartphones Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) technology were used. The Space Syntax and Isovist Analysis Measures, where all the concepts related such as the Isovist Parameters were analysed in depth for better understanding of their effect. Then the Matching and Localisation Algorithms, where the possibilities and options on how to reach the localisation were investigated and analysed. And finally, the Tests and Experiments took place in order to evaluate all the prior stages of the methodology.<br/>The main conclusion of this research is that a method for Indoor Localisation based on Isovists is feasible and can indeed support an LBS. The analysis and evaluation of all related components has be done and if putting all the parts in the right order they can be of high value for LBS applications. Since is a new method of Indoor Localisation, there is plenty of future work to be done which mainly focuses on how to connect it with existing techniques and integrate all together into a user application.","Indoor Localisation; Indoor positioning system; Space Syntax; Isovist; Isovist Fingerprinting; Isovist Analysis; Indoor navigation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

The aim of this research has been to discuss the complexity of the grey area between privately owned public space and public space, as well as the emerging issues related to POPS within the City of London. In which my design proposal acts as an investigation to how architecture could create a more balanced relationship between public and private interests as a response to the current privatisation of public spaces. It tries to find opportunities and possibilities by making use of this identified grey area and memory of site, space, elements and materials. Therefore, the research and design research has focussed on the architectural translation of this grey area as a means to understand how the architect could have influence: analysing usage, elements and materials of 15 existing POPS. It brings forward the notion of affordances and appropriation of space in order to create places which invite and allow different uses or behaviour and might trigger a more diverse and broader public. This allows POPS to be less determined and more open for own interpretation, as it promotes a more free use of public space. The users or actors play a vital role in this, since they are the ones who change the space into the desired program. Which in the end creates a sense of ownership. <br/><br/>In London - and many other metropolitan cities -, we have seen the large shifts public space has gone through over the years, as well as the effects on architecture and the people who inhabit the city. These changes have been the result of social, political and economic influences specific to their time. The last decades London has become a city where public good is being sold off to the highest bid. Private investors have become owners of large parts of the city and along with that, the number of ‘genuine’ public space decreases. My research tries to obtain a better understanding of why these changes occur and if these changes are still relevant in current times. As well as it aims to take a critical stand within this discussion, since it has become clear the believed positive effects of selling public good to private investors has caused large scale gentrification and created places of exclusion. By identifying the grey area within privately owned public spaces in London, my project seeks for an architecture in which the potential of the grey area is fully utilised and can result in a more representational space grounded in time and place. The design proposal tries to show ways in which architecture might mediate. By understanding the change in nature of public space throughout history and the reasons behind these changes politically, economically and socially: architecture can attempt to contribute in creating places where public, as well as private interests can benefit both. Possibly, create spaces where the imbalance between private and public will be less visible and tangible. <br","public space; privately owned public space; POPS; gentrification; ownership; Thatcherism; Commons; affordances; appropriation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Architectural Design Crossovers","","51.5298108,-0.1231131"

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The Haringvlietbrug, which was delivered in 1964 and connects the island of Goeree-Overflakkee to the Dutch mainland, approaches the end of its lifetime. Rijkswaterstaat and Witteveen+Bos investigate the potential use of vibration-based structural health monitoring (SHM) to track deterioration. In vibration-based SHM, a change in the structure’s eigenfrequencies indicates probable damage but most current approaches focus on fundamental modes of the structure which are not or hardly affected by small structural impairments. In this study, vibration-based SHM was employed on local modes of vibration of the Haringvlietbrug, with the hope of detecting small-scale damage. New obstacles arose as a result of this: the influence of environmental and operational variabilities (EOV) on the eigenfrequencies of the structure was often larger than the influence of small damage. As a result, the EOVs should be filtered out of the recorded acceleration data before damage sensitive features can be extracted.<br/>To investigate this, 32 accelerometers and 16 temperature sensors were installed in two segments of the Haringvlietbrug. The sensors yield a large data set which was analysed extensively. This made it clear, among other things, that the dynamic response of the bridge deck showed large variability when comparing different vehicle passages.<br/><br/>The first research objective was to investigate the applicability of similarity filtering (SF) to filter out operational variabilities from the Haringvlietbrug acceleration signals to extract damage-sensitive features. SF amplified similarities and damped differences between samples of vehicle passages. This way, only consequently excited modes should remain in the signals which were subsequently used as damage-sensitive features for SHM. <br/>This study found that using SF to filter the operational variabilities from the Haringvlietbrug data set was ineffective. Three reasons were identified for this. First, the method was not robust as a single deviating sample or a poorly chosen filter coefficient significantly influenced the results. Secondly, missing closely-spaced modes might have caused inconsistency of the results. Lastly, SF was not able to converge to consistent behaviour as the variability of response of the bridge deck might be too great for different passages. The latter reason was investigated further in the remaining of the research. <br/><br/>The second research objective was to improve the understanding of the effect of vehicles on local bridge vibrations of the Haringvlietbrug for the application of vibration-based SHM. First, the eigensystem realisation algorithm (ERA) was used to identify and compare consistent mode shapes in order to better understand bridge deck vibrations and find patterns in the eigenfrequencies. ERA is an operational modal analysis (OMA) and output-only system identification technique. <br/>ERA was able to identify two consistent modes in the data but they had a large variance in both shape and eigenfrequency. The uncertainties of the results were too large to draw firm conclusions based on ERA because two of ERA’s key assumptions were not perfectly met and the input samples were not optimal. <br/><br/>Next, a semi-analytical model of a segment of the Haringvlietbrug was built to simulate the important sources of the variability as found in the acceleration recordings of the Haringvlietbrug. The goal of the model was to investigate the sensitivity of the response of the beam to variations of input parameters. The model was both used for time-history analyses and eigenfrequency analyses. Parametric studies showed that the response of the beam was highly sensitive to the time delay between moving masses (dependent on the axle configuration and vehicle velocity), the unevenness (describing any source of vibration of the interaction between vehicle and bridge deck) and the vehicle velocity. These parameters influenced both the amplitude and the shape of the acceleration response of the Haringvlietbrug bridge deck in the time and frequency domain. <br/>The effect of the three dominant parameters was further investigated by simulating four characteristic cases from the Haringvlietbrug data set. Hypotheses on the source of the measurement variability were formed by qualitatively comparing the results of the model to the measured response of the bridge. The model parameters were able to describe a large part of the variability but it was concluded that it is likely that some factors that were not included in the model also play a role in the variability of the measurements.<br/><br/>The above findings led to the following recommendations for further research. Firstly, it is recommended to only select similar vehicle passages for SF because this would improve the ability to converge to consistent modal behaviour. Secondly, should someone want to further explore ERA, it is recommended to equip a section of the bridge with a high spatial density of accelerometers to improve the reliability of the results. <br/>Next, some recommendations related to the model were made. The first step of follow-up research would be to verify the influence of the model parameters on the dynamic response of the Haringvlietbrug by experimenting with different test vehicles. Subsequently, depending on the importance of the parameters, possible extensions of the measurement set-up for a new campaign were proposed. Secondly, the current model could be improved by introducing more parameters, like acceleration of the moving mass or by implementing a more realistic vehicle model, to be better able to explain the dynamic variability. Thirdly, more parameters could be investigated by building a 3D finite element model. This would make it possible to investigate the influence of the presence of multiple vehicles on the bridge and 3D wave propagation. <br/>Upcoming research into data-driven approaches of vibration-based SHM of bridge decks is recommended to focus on similar passages as not all samples contain the same information on the dynamic behaviour of the structure. Decreasing the variability of the input samples might improve the performance of the algorithms.<br","similarity filtering; dynamic response; local vibrations; analytical model; dynamics of structures; VBI","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-01-01","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Hydraulic Structures","",""

The current diagnosis of tumor progression is based on visual appraisal or manual measurement of largest diameters, neither of which is a fully quantitative measure. The RANO criteria dictate that more than 25% growth in the product of two largest diameters indicates tumor progression. A more accurate assessment can be done if the tumor is fully segmented and a measurement of tumor volume is obtained. Tumor volume measurements have been shown to reduce variation due to inter- and intra-rater variability, patient position in the scanner and subjective determination of the largest diameter. Both tumor segmentation and size computation must currently be done manually and can be very time-consuming. A number of automated algorithms have been developed for lesion segmentation, but none have yet made it into clinical practice. This project focuses on the gap in currently available tools, which is the lack of volumetric analysis, particularly as it pertains to longitudinal data. We propose a tool that offers intuitive, flexible, and easy to evaluate quantitative analysis of uploaded tumor segmentation data. The tool computes volume metrics, such as tumor volume and dimensions, and visualizes them in a statistical analysis. It is based on R and utilizes modern packages for data analysis, and is deployed as a web interface using the Shiny R package. It enables the user to upload their own lesion segmentation data in NIfTI format. For easy demonstration and proof of concept, it makes use of default data from BraTS, a publicly shared repository of brain lesion data. This tool can be used for segmentation exploration of groups of patients or study participants, and it scales to any cohort size.

One of these parameters is the atrial fibre direction, which is often assumed to be known in conductivity estimation methods. In this thesis, a novel method to estimate the fibre direction from epicardial electrograms is presented. This method is based on local conduction slowness vectors of a propagating activation wave, which can be calculated from a corresponding activation map of the atrial tissue. These conduction slowness vectors follow an elliptical pattern that strongly depends on the underlying conductivity parameters. The fibre direction and conductivity anisotropy ratio can therefore be estimated by fitting an ellipse to the conduction slowness vectors. Applying the presented method on simulated data shows that it can accurately estimate the fibre direction, and that the performance of the method depends mostly on the range of wavefront directions present in the measurement area. The main advantage of the presented method over existing methods is that it still functions in the presence of conduction blocks, as long as the surrounding tissue is approximately homogeneous.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Circuits and Systems","",""

Our model is implemented as an IOHMM with 4 states following a multinomial distribution and a non-stationary Normal Inverse Gaussian distribution for each output distribution. We use SPOT prices of each bordering country to create a ’spread process’, which are then used as target values. As inputs various market drivers for each respective country were used. The model produces a mixture probability distribution for the spread for each hour of the month. Taking the discounted expected value then gives the hourly capacity value; certain Greek calculation is also possible. The results show that the capacities follow a comparable trend to the market. The predicted values for September and October fall short of the realized prices; we expect this to be due to unprecedented volatility in the energy market. Finally, we tested whether certain key drivers were mapped to the spreads as one would expect; this was the case for the Dutch and French drivers, but not for the German drivers.","IOHMM; Electricity Market; option valuation; real options analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

The stagnation region at the vane leading edge is, typically, exposed to the highest thermal load, thus, the showerhead configuration of film cooling is often applied on the leading edge. Widely used lean-­burn combustors implement swirlers, leading to a complex flow field over the nozzle guide vane as the swirling profile is often preserved at the inlet of the guide vane. The nozzle guide vane external heat transfer coefficient in the industry is often computed either with boundary layer codes or RANS methods. However, higher accuracy hybrid RANS­LES models are of interest since such models are becoming more and more available due to improved capabilities to facilitate the increase of computational resource demands. This study aims at introducing hybrid RANS-­LES modelling to investigate swirling inflow effects on showerhead film cooling performance.<br/><br/>The implemented methodology and various turbulence models are first validated by replicating an experimental case of a linear cascade of blades. The uncooled blade external heat transfer coefficient distribution is compared to the experimental data for cases with turbulence intensities of Tu =1% and Tu =8%. The SST k − ω and lag elliptic blending k − ε turbulence models successfully replicated the HTC distribution but the γ − Reθ transition model was required to capture transition on the suction side for cases with Tu =1%. The showerhead film cooling effectiveness is investigated with both RANS and hybrid RANS-­LES models for a configuration of three rows of staggered cooling holes and blowing ratios of 1.4 and 1.9. Uniform inflow and two profiles of swirling inflow are analysed, with the strongest swirl being coupled with a radial temperature profile. Results indicate that the RANS­-LES hybrid model is promising in capturing the unsteadiness of the horseshoe vortex. Mixing between mainstream and coolant jets, and the inherent unsteadiness of the mixing shear layers can only be captured with a scale resolving simulation. The swirling inflow lead to an altered stagnation line and imposed a radial pressure distribution close to the leading edge, which interfered with the coolant distribution on the<br/>leading edge. The coolant jet contact with the vane surface area is found to be the most important parameter affecting the cooling effectiveness since a coolant lift­off led to a significant reduction in cooling effectiveness. A lift­off was often observed in areas where the swirling velocity component misaligned to the mainstream flow direction. A positive contribution to cooling effectiveness was recorded in regions where the swirl component aligned to the mainstream flow direction. The increase in cooling effectiveness was observed due to locally increased momentum of the main flow that aids coolant staying attached to the surface. The benefits of hybrid RANS-­LES modelling are established, and the<br/>results signify the importance of accounting for an unsteady stagnation line during the design of the showerhead film cooling.","Heat Transfer Coefficient; Gas Turbine; CFD modelling; hybrid RANS/LES; Showerhead film cooling; Swirling flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Inconsistent demand leads to peaks in passenger activity on the network. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has introduced a need for social distancing as well, limiting the desired capacity of vehicles. To combat this, intelligent real-time and data-driven decision making is required. In many cases, the data required is lacking or not available in real-time. Our research addresses these challenges by providing means to gain insight into the passenger load of public transport vehicles. The focus of this research is to investigate how using in-vehicle sensor data can help in constructing an estimate of the passenger load and evaluate its contribution.<br/><br/>By combining in-vehicle sensor signals with historical passenger flow patterns, a novel fusion model<br/>based on gradient boosting machines is constructed that can make real-time predictions of the passenger load using this data as input features. The evaluation shows that its estimates have a mean absolute error (MAE) score of 7.83, outperforming a random forest model baseline by 37%. Moreover, a crowding indicator analysis demonstrated that when predicting crowding indicators, the model achieves a weighted F1 score of 0.828. An ablation study found that excluding the in-vehicle features from the model reduces the model’s performance significantly, it could reduce the performance by up to 42%. In fact, the same experiment showed that having only the in-vehicle features is preferable to historical passenger flow features. Therefore, we conclude that using in-vehicle sensor data can be a feasible alternative to historical AFC data for predicting the passenger load.<br/><br/>The methodology has been extended by constructing a short-term forecasting model based on Seasonal ARIMA and GARCH that uses real-time signals of the passenger load to update its forecasts. The results show that while the forecasts lack accuracy initially, once the model is updated the forecasts improve up to almost a negligible error. When model predictions are used as update signals, the forecasting model is still able to improve and the results are competitive, despite the error contained in the signals.<br/><br/>Overall, we conclude that the proposed real-time model offers a suitable method for passenger load prediction and clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of using in-vehicle sensor data as input features.

Depending on the aggregation method used, the local updates are either the gradients or the weights of local learning models. Unfortunately, recent reconstruction attacks apply a gradient inversion optimization on the gradient update of a single mini-batch to reconstruct the private data used by clients during training. As the state-of-the-art reconstruction attacks solely focus on single update, realistic adversarial scenarios are overlooked, such as observation across multiple updates and updates trained from multiple mini-batches. A few studies consider a more challenging adversarial scenario where only model updates are observable, and resort to computationally expensive simulation to untangle the underlying samples for each local step. In this paper, we propose AGIC, Approximate Gradient Inversion Attack, that efficiently and effectively reconstructs images from both model or gradient updates, and across multiple epochs. In a nutshell, AGIC (i) approximates gradient updates of used training samples from model updates, (ii) leverages gradient/model updates collected from multiple epochs, and (iii) assigns increasing weights to layers with respect to the neural network structure for reconstruction quality. Our experiment results show that AGIC increases the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) by up to 50% compared to two representative state-of-the-art gradient inversion attacks. Furthermore, AGIC is faster than the simulation-based attack, e.g., it is 5x faster when attacking FedAvg with 8 local steps in between model updates.","Reconstruction Attack; Federated Learning; Federated Averaging","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

The application relies exclusively on RGB frames from the phone's camera as input to the DR pipeline. Multiple algorithms for object selection and tracking, as well as a patch-based inpainting approach were adapted. Selection and tracking of objects was very reliable at interactive speed. Inpainting led to convincing results for planar surfaces and unstructured textures, often delivering acceptable results even in more complicated scenes. Future optimizations are required for real-time performance of DR algorithms even on a flagship smartphone, as the hardware was a constraining factor.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the efficacy of Forth as a target language for Extraction from Agda, in the hopes that Forth may prove to have the potential to be a better target language than the currently used target languages, Haskell and Javascript. Forth is a stack-based, imperative language, meaning that values are pushed and popped from a stack through the use of ’words’ instead of passing and returning values with functions, as is the case in most languages. Agda is a dependently typed, purely functional language. A dependent type is a type whose definition depends on another value, which allows for types with very specific information, such as a ’Vec n’ representing an array of length ’n’. These dependent types are used to write code with more certainty about its correctness and behaviour. Overall, Forth can be used as a target language to compile Agda code, however many of the advantages of Forth are squandered by executing code written and structured with Agda in mind, making it a rather ineffective target language when compared to other solutions such as Haskell.","Agda; Forth; Dependent Types; code Extraction","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

From these measurements, perspectives are constructed for each agency with the use of Principal Component Analysis. The agencies investigated are the Dinas Lingkungan Hidup Jawa Timur (DLH Jatim), Belai Besar Wilayah Sungai Brantas (BBWS) and Perum Jasa Tirta I (PJT). As an addition to the PCA, a neural network model is constructed and trained to recognize the measurement agency of a datapoint from the measurement values. It was found that the all three agencies recognized oxygen as a dominant driver in water quality processes. Secondary processes were mostly driven by rainfall, but the effect of this was seen differently by the agencies. DLH Jatim distinguishes surface waste runoff separately from rainfall, while Perum Jasa Tirta I will see them as inherently connected. BBWS will not recognize the surface waste runoff process as a significant factor in the water quality. These differences found in the representation of core processes in the Brantas outline how different agencies can have a different perspective on water quality. This was further underlined by the conclusions from the neural network analysis.

However, most of the time, training multiple agents together using single-agent self-play yields poor results as each agent tries to learn how to perform their task while their teammates are also learning. Thus, training models to reach an optimal behaviour in such situations becomes a challenging, if not impossible issue to overcome. One possible solution to deal with this problem is to facilitate a centralized training process in which the policies of all agents are evaluated by a centralized critic that has access to the observations and actions of all the agents in the environment. By using this approach, the environment becomes stationary and the agents learn in a similar way to using a single-agent algorithm in settings where only one agent needs to be trained. In this paper, we test whether by using a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm with centralized critics, as opposed to single-agent ones, we would obtain an agent that generalizes better to new partners in a collaborative environment such as Overcooked, where coordination is critical for good performance. The results display a similar performance between the two algorithms when evaluated through self-play and slightly better or worse results when paired with the human model, representing a mediocre agent, depending on the map. Thus, the multi-agent, centralized critics algorithm used in this study did not train agents that generalize better to new partners. However, the training metrics clearly indicate that the centralized critics method makes the agents learn and converge twice as fast as its single-agent version.","Reinforcement Learning; Centralized Critics; Multi-Agent Environment","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","https://github.com/andrei-07/rp-overcooked-centralized-critics Link to GitHub repository","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

Previous research within this field proposed the system called SolAR, and proved the possibility of using a solar cell as both a power source and an activity sensor. A wrist mounted solar cell generates more energy than it uses during operation, while achieving a high classification accuracy for different activities. While the wearer performs different activities, the power output of the solar cell fluctuates. In turn, these fluctuations are used to recognise activities. To extend on the concept of SolAR, this paper introduces a prototype to obtain data from different activities while performing day-to-day tasks. During these activities, ordinary actions are performed to emulate natural circumstances. Analysis of this data initially shows no significant drop in accuracy when compared to SolAR. Further examination shows significant differences in mislabelling rates when comparing to the results of SolAR.","VLS; Human Activity Recognition; solar power","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

There is a knowledge gap both in the literature and society in the field of performance measurement of the livestock feed industry with environmental concerns. Livestock feed companies need support in the decision-making process to produce environmentally sustainable livestock feed at as low as possible costs.<br/>Design/methodology/approach – An environmental performance index for livestock feed is constructed based on techniques of the min-max transformation, the analytic hierarchy process and simple additive weighting. The verified environmental performance index for livestock feed is brought into practice; different scenarios, which all represent a feed composition, are quantitatively compared to a benchmark feed composition. The environmental performance index is validated with an uncertainty analysis and sensitivity analysis.<br/>Findings – The constructed environmental performance index for livestock feed is assessed by comparing nine scenarios against a benchmark feed composition. The results indicate that the environmental performance index for the livestock feed industry is technically feasible and effective to measure the performance of the livestock feed industry from an environmental and economic perspective. <br/>Research implications – The constructed environmental performance index for <br/>livestock feed can serve as a decision-making tool for livestock feed companies. As a response to climate regulations and a market pull, this paper provides a tool for livestock feed companies to select livestock feed compositions with the best performance based on environmental sustainability and economic performance.<br/>Originality/value – A new performance measurement method is designed for an <br/>environmental performance index for the livestock feed industry. From the literature, environmental sustainability variables are identified. The data on the environmental performance are obtained from a public database as well as a livestock feed company. The created index can contribute to decision-making in the livestock feed industry.","Performance measurement; livestock feed; composite indicator; environmental indicators","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

The method consists of detecting QR markers from the video stream, and then updating the position, orientation, and scale of the virtual content in order to minimize the error between the real markers and their corresponding virtual markers. This allows for more accurate tracking and can be used in more complex environments. Three different evaluation methods are proposed.

The immersed boundary method is often used in conjunction with the LBM to simulate flow around curved, moving boundaries in the interior of the fluid domain. In the immersed boundary method, the boundary is imposed on a non-conforming grid by applying an external forcing at the boundary. The distribution of this external forcing is calculated based on interpolation of nearby fluid nodes, and the force field is then distributed over a number of nearby fluid nodes.<br/><br/>The immersed interface method is an approach similar to the immersed boundary method, but imposes this applied force field directly on the solution field through jump conditions. It has yet to be correctly applied to the LBM framework. In this thesis, a proposal of an immersed interface method in the LBM is made, and its implementation is validated and compared against the immersed boundary method. To aid in this, a solver capable of solving fluid-structure interaction is developed.<br/><br/>It is shown that the immersed interface method in the LBM has significant benefits compared to the immersed boundary method, in particular with regards to reducing numerical oscillations in the spatial variation of the boundary force distribution, as well appearing to yield a slight increase in overall accuracy at the same level of grid refinement.<br","lattice boltzmann method; Fluid-structure interaction; Immersed boundary method; immersed interface method; Numerical Modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

A voice-coil actuator, placed along the stylus tip, simulates object compliance by modifying its stroke force. Electrovibration, generated between the stylus tip and a capacitive screen, delivers roughness and stickiness cues. In addition, temperature feedback on the fingertip is provided by a miniature thermal module. We conducted characterization experiments to determine the physical characteristics and limitations of the device, followed by a psychophysical experiment, where the perceptual dimensions of the device were extracted using the semantic differential method on a set of artificial textures. Our results revealed four tactile dimensions, with the first two related to texture surface properties, and the third and fourth dimensions linked to material softness and coldness, respectively.

In order to represent an aspect of the type in a general way I used containers, a uniform way of representing types that store data.

Finally, propose new possible improved solutions to the issue of side-channel attacks in SDNs and future research on the field.<br/>We conclude that current side-channel attacks target the separation control and data planes at the core of the SDN paradigm, by exploiting the response delay created by a centralized logic system in the controller.

In this research, an experiment is conducted to check the viability of this technology, by transmitting a message to multiple phones with different recording frame rates and checking whether the technology functions adequately for each frame rate. The viability is checked through multiple factors, with the most important one being flicker, due to the negative health risks. If there is no flicker, the throughput of the LED at that frame rate and blinking frequency is checked at multiple distances.

We propose user-guided test amplification to allow developers to guide the test amplification to generate new test cases based on their branch coverage expectations. We create a user-guided test amplification prototype that starts with the method developers want to test, aids developers in communicating which branch should be covered, and assists developers in inspecting and selecting the amplified test cases. We conduct a technical case study with two Java projects and show that our approach cannot always produce a test case to cover a given branch because objects are not initialized with the right parameter values to fulfill the target branch condition. We also perform a user study with 12 software developers to investigate developers' opinions on our approach. The evaluation result shows that the user-guided test amplification generates amplified test cases that developers are satisfied with and is especially useful when developers want to generate tests to cover a specific branch.

With this emerging understanding, the role of employees in building and delivering a brand is increasingly recognised and exploited. Through internal branding efforts, companies can aim to improve the alignment of their employees with their brand, by making sure employees (1) understand the brand, (2) identify with the brand and (3) commit to the brand to eventually be able to (4) behave in line with the brand. This thesis aims to examine and improve the internal brand alignment at creative tech company WeTransfer, to eventually make for more fulfilled and connected employees, who can better deliver the brand promise to make for content and loyal customers. <br/><br/>To understand the context, a study consisting of corporate ethnography, qualitative interviews and existing data analysis was conducted. The findings from the research illustrate that the rapid growth of WeTransfer has a considerable impact on its internal brand and culture. On the one hand, there is a need for guidance of employees, to make sure their understanding of the brand does not fragment further. On the other hand, it is found that the freedom and autonomy of employees should be preserved. Thus, the challenge is to find a balance in guiding employees to contribute to the brand, while retaining their freedom. <br/><br/>To address this challenge, a strategy is developed based on concepts from literature, to (1) make the WeTransfer brand clear by concretising it internally and (2) make the brand live by facilitating an internal conversation. To illustrate how this strategy can be executed, a two-component design is proposed. Firstly, a WeTransfer manifesto is co-created with employees, aiming to translate the abstract brand values and purpose into concrete behaviour on the work floor. Secondly, the Living the brand program is developed to activate the manifesto and initiate discussion on the matter. The program is led by a team of brand ambassadors and engages all employees in several activities to learn about and reflect on the manifesto. <br/><br/>In this time of rapid growth, the design proposal has the potential to make explicit what aspects define WeTransfer and should be held on to. It helps the company strengthen those aspects and get all employees pulling in the same direction. Executing the advised strategy - making the brand clear and making it live - has the potential to contribute to the authenticity of WeTransfer’s brand. Employees will be more strongly connected to the brand and be able to deliver the brand promise.

(mentor); Peeters, J.W.R.

Renewable energy sources are dependent on weather conditions therefore security of energy supply is not ensured and the need for energy storage is growing. Hydrogen is considered a clean energy carrier that can be used for energy storage. Water electrolysis that uses renewable energy is a sustainable method for the production of green hydrogen. Water electrolysis is a process by which water is split into hydrogen and oxygen by using direct current to drive the reaction. During the production of green hydrogen heat is released to the environment. Little research has been conducted on the amount of heat released during green hydrogen production and on the temperature of the released heat. It is unclear if the released heat could be used. <br/>This research serves to answer the question ""Is it possible to use the heat released during the production of green hydrogen using alkaline water electrolysis?"". To answer this question a model has been developed in ASPEN Plus. This model represents an alkaline electrolyser, consisting of an electrochemical model, a thermal model and a cooling system. To validate the output of the model, the hydrogen production output has been compared with an alkaline electrolyser developed by the company Nel hydrogen. The thermal efficiency of the model has been calculated with and without using the waste heat. To use the waste heat the system first needs to be cooled. To determine which heat exchanger is best to use for recovering the heat of the alkaline electrolyser, three different designs have been implemented in the ASPEN model. The designs have been analyzed and the best option is implemented in the model. The amount of heat that can be recovered has been investigated as well as the options for the use of the recovered heat. The results are discussed and recommendations are made for follow-up research.","Electrolysis; Aspen Plus","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Process and Energy Technology","",""

Today, years into the process of decolonization, the situation is still not much different. This occidental acceptance of people separated from their way of living, their culture reflected in the urban structure, creates the hybrid urban environment that hides the existence of different cultures. This oxymoronic thinking concerning diversity creates the complex mechanism of merging cultures, backgrounds, and customs and hides everything different or other. As a result of this situation, it is possible to point toward placeless cultures in the city of London. People or locations that are culturally significant without any material or immaterial connection to their urban surroundings. They maybe are located in the cartesian urban space of London, but they are placeless in the imaginary and mental view of the city. We need to abandon the occidental approach in architecture as we develop our neighborhoods to create a city that belongs to everybody and nobody, to create a city where everything is placeless and placeness.<br/><br/>The design is composed of 3 connected layers of togetherness with different levels of publicness which I categorize as communality, commensality, and conviviality. While communality of the project is completely public, the publicness of the building decreases with commensality and conviviality but still keeps the aspect of togetherness. They are not completely separated, on the contrary, they feed on each other. The layers of the project bridge with each other in different ways. This connection happens, either by the literal circulation of people and goods or by other means such as the visual connection or change in temporality. Hence the design pushes people to gather not only through planned encounters with the program it offers but also through incidental encounters that happen along the connections of different functions.<br","diaspora; community; commensality; conviviality; London; Colonial","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Architectural Design Crossovers","",""

The goal of this research is to explore the potential for a device that utilizes the interaction between biomolecules and hBN as a new approach to protein sequencing. Our hypothesis is that molecules adsorbed to hBN surfaces can be unfolded and moved at a controlled velocity through the use of shear horizontal surface acoustic waves. These surface acoustic waves utilize acoustoelectric effects that create forces on polarizable molecules. Until this point, the use of surface acoustic waves for manipulation of molecules has not been explored in the framework of single-molecule sequencing. Along with this, the surface interaction between biomolecules and hBN has been investigated primarily with simulations, while experimental confirmations are still lacking. To address this gap in the field, we conducted experiments to fluorescently image lambda DNA, M13mp18 DNA, and α-synuclein proteins adsorbed to hBN surfaces and analysed their free diffusion behavior. We subsequently designed, fabricated and characterized shear horizontal surface acoustic wave devices compatible with measurements in fluid and with an inverted fluorescence microscopy setup. Here, we studied the behavior of the same molecules adsorbed to an hBN surface when subject to acoustic actuation. It was found that limited diffusion effects were visible for α-synuclein proteins and M13mp18 DNA. However, it was possible to observe fragmented lambda DNA freely diffusing on the hBN surface. When acoustically actuated it was found that α-synuclein proteins and M13mp18 DNA located on the hBN surface could not be manipulated. Lambda DNA molecules that were in contact with the hBN surface could be manipulated through acoustic actuation. These findings open up further research opportunities for the use of shear horizontal waves in manipulation of molecules on 2D material surfaces.","hBN; Surface acoustic waves; biomolecules; 2D materials","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

They provide the ability to reduce imbalances by absorbing the forecast errors for consumers and renewable energy sources. This has the added benefit that congestions occurring due to supply and demand mismatches would be prevented. Furthermore, they allow generating a stable power consumption for a longer period by utilizing the available reserves. The electricity markets are all power markets, where the products grant an amount of power for a certain period. Therefore, the introduction of a battery would make it easier to buy power for a portfolio of consumers. Currently, it is not yet feasible to use a battery for the consumer segment as the revenues generated are simply too small to pay the battery back before it reaches the end of its lifetime. <br/><br/>This report aims to describe a machine learning-based battery operating algorithm that can be utilized for the consumer market. The operating algorithm will be trading on the day ahead and the voluntary aFRR market while satisfying the demand of the consumer(s). The trading is done based on the forecast generated by different machine learning models. For the day ahead market, two forecasting models are tested, namely an XGBoost algorithm and a Dense Neural Network. For the imbalance market, a simple Dense Neural Network and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are compared and for the consumer forecast, an XGBoost model is compared to a Lasso. All forecasts are combined to create a profit-maximizing algorithm. Lastly, a comparison is made between having an individual battery for every homeowner and aggregating a group of consumers together in a larger battery is compared. <br/><br/>The results show that forecasting an aggregated group of consumers has a significantly lower error compared to forecasting individual demand patterns. The large errors in the individual forecast result in a large opportunity cost, based on the Value of Lost Load (VoLL), which renders the benefits of owning a battery useless again. However, the aggregated group of consumers combined into a single large battery is profitable. Considering the current prices (22Q1) the battery generated enormous profits, such that the battery would be break-even in less than 2 years.","Machine learning; Battery System; XGBoost; Neural Network","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-06-27","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Therefore, these dynamic objects need to be removed before using MLS point clouds. This thesis designs an efficient and memory-friendly Octomap-based dynamic object detection and removal method for MLS data. Firstly, the original MLS data is split into multiple data frames based on the timestamp of each capture point. Each data frame is inserted into a separate Octomap along with its neighboring data frames. The free points in all Octomaps are extracted by setting an occupancy probability threshold. Second, the region of interest (ROI) related to the dynamic object is delineated by the MLS sensor mounting height and the local large vehicle height limit. Only the free points located within the ROI are retained. Then the free-point rate and the multi-return rate are calculated for each free point using a fixed radius spatial search to denoise and detect vegetation points. Finally, the KNN spatial search is used to remove vegetation points and extract dynamic objects from the free points. The proposed method is tested in four case sites in Delft, the Netherlands and its producer’s and user’s weighted average dynamic object detection and extraction accuracies are 88.004% and 82.624%, respectively. The weighted average overall accuracy is 99.833%. Compared with the original Octomap, the proposed method is 35.472% more efficient on average and can be further accelerated by parallel computing, with a maximum memory consumption of only 42.437% of the original Octomap. The implementation results and accuracy assessment demonstrate that the proposed method can be effectively applied to dynamic object detection and extraction tasks in MLS data sets in a compute-friendly and memory-friendly way.","MLS data; Dynamic Object Detection; Octomap; Pointcloud","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

Historically, the city was strongly connected with industry, however during the last decades, it was facing many shifts. The industrial sites are gradually redeveloping, and the society has become more heterogeneous because of the migrants and expats. Its diverse population is creating vibrant communities, however, the municipality’s policy and general image of the public space do not reflect this character. Instead, the functional range rather follows the global capitalist tendency. The streets of the centre are built with shops and gastronomical venues and the possibilities for non-consumption time spending are quite limited. Furthermore, this charming city is not free from common issues. The global crises are also visible in the housing shortage, inflation, gentrification, etc. The current politics is not fulfilling in sufficiently overcoming them. Today, the city of Maastricht is awaiting for the new redevelopment, the Sappi factory slowly moves up north and leaves the post-industrial site ready for the new purpose. The municipality plans to create a new housing and cultural neighbourhood, turning the quarter into a more hip destination. Unfortunately, this approach is creating a threat of growing gentrification of the area and, what is the most significant, the loss of one of the most interesting culture providers in the whole city. The plan covers also the Landbouwbelang demolition and further development of the dwelling facilities. The Landbouwbelang (LBB) is a vibrant and diverse community of artists and activists that around twenty years ago squated the abandoned, old building of the grain storage, located next to the factory site. The community is not fully legal inhabitants or owners of the property and according to the municipality’s project is doomed to leave the building in the near future. <br/><br/><br/>Gleaning<br/><br/>The studio’s theme - Glaneurs, Glaneuses and gleaning means reusing and giving a new life to what was left behind. One of the first encounters on the topic was Agnes Varda’s documentary “Les glaneurs et la glaneuse”. In the film, Varda travelled throughout cities and villages in France to document various types of gleaners. It shows how the at of gleaning evolved and how diverse it can be. In the past, it was a natural act of compensation and an opportunity for the less privileged. The landholders did not become less wealthy by leaving some of the harvests on the fields and the poor could benefit from a gratuitous feed. Nowadays, this is no longer a tradition, in many places, the law and the private owners prohibit it. In many situations, the crops stay on the fields and get wasted by letting them rotten or burning them or destroying them in any other way. This procedure is a capitalistic turn relying on increasing the value and controlling the product focusing on the economic aspect, and neglecting the social impact. <br/><br/>The act of gleaning related to architecture links with the accessibility of spaces, distribution of resources and social rights. Those echoes are strongly visible in the urban context as growing issues of inequalities. In the built environment, using the leftovers is associated with the redevelopment of spaces and giving them a new life and purpose. The act of gleaning could be an organised shift as adaptive reuse or an almost spontaneous procedure of appropriation and occupation as an act of different purposes: political, economic or social. It can be seen as a sustainable approach and a response to the throwaway culture of the Anthropocene - the easier thing is to start from the carte blanche than deal with the complex dependencies and achieve the compromise. <br/><br/><br/>Position<br/><br/><br/>Care <br/>- the provision of what is necessary for the health, welfare, maintenance, and protection of someone or something<br/><br/>Empathy <br/>- the capacity to understand or feel what another person is experiencing from within their frame of reference, that is, the capacity to place oneself in another’s position<br/><br/><br/>After analysing the context and observing the global trends based on capitalistic system, it was striking how the aspect of empathy is invisible in the spaces that are surrounding us and also in the architectural discourse and practice. <br/><br/>It can be stated that caring is at the very core of architecture itself, since the dawn of time, it has been orientated on creating a shelter and protecting humans from the outside world and its threats. However, today we do not have to fight the elements to survive, so what could we consider caring architecture? <br/><br/>The interpretation of care is vast. But to get into the core of its meaning, we could say that the goal of care is to put more attention to everyday life. People still have to work, travel, shop and do all the other chores, but with a bit of empathy put into designing those scenes, it can be done with more comfort and dignity. However, today, this value is strongly underrated as a general feature and also as an architectural approach. <br","care; empathy; inclusive housing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","","50.851368, 5.690973"

They sediment memories of the lived past and the potential future and are therefore regarded as spaces of another realm that operate between the spatial and the temporal. Historically, these sites were found entangled with the living city’s core where people gathered to exchange shared experiences. Today, the speed of the city, along with its rapid expansion, no longer allows for such spaces to occur within the living realm. Spaces that hold memory are detached from other urban systems, and therefore, appear as isolated memory islands. The problem is, without the interaction of people and their use as collective public ground, these spaces are threatened by the loss of memory and can no longer facilitate experiential memories. <i>While the creation and disappearance of new layers of memory can be regarded as a natural cycle of any city, the continuous expansion of funerary spaces outwards means that there is no room in the contemporary city for new memory spaces to be formed.</i><br/><br/>This research examines the role of the cemetery as a memory space that can act as an interface between such dead and living memory making practices, and challenges society’s changing attitudes towards death that, over time, transformed funerary sites from collective public space to secluded necropoli. In an effort to disrupt the pattern of exclusion of death and memory from the urban fabric, and to accept death as a part of everyday life, this research is guided by the following main question: <br/><br/><i>How can the contemporary city accommodate new memory spaces within the programs of everyday life without compromising their inherent heterotopic nature? </i><br/><br/>By exploring the intersections between the layers of individual, collective, and experiential memory, this research defines what a new memory space in the contemporary city entails.","layering; psychogeography; memory space; urban memory; memory; rhythm; temporality; cemetery; burial; London","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Architectural Design Crossovers","","51.522830, -0.075305"

However, the preceding GAN based models for building massing generation make use of only simplified and two dimensional representation of the built environment.<br/><br/>This work improves upon the existing deep-learning-based methods for generation of building massings and building group layouts, by fusing high accuracy three-dimensional building models with site context derived from cadastral and topographic data, sourced from openly available datasets in the Netherlands. Pix2pixGAN implementation in PyTorch, trained on existing massing data encoded into images as heightmaps, is used to generate building massing geometry. Two methods for geometry extraction from heightmaps are introduced, voxelization and vectorization. The goal for the model is to maximize similarity of morphological traits of configurations generated by the model to the ground truth training data. The effects of multiple proposed training configurations on the resulting massings generated by the model are evaluated, together with visual assessment, using their Spacematrix mappings.<br/><br/>Three distinct models with specific goals are presented - parcel infill model, street block infill model, and urban fabric infill model. All three models show a capability to learn spatial traits of existing building configurations and transfer them into new situations not encountered in the training data, which is confirmed by the distribution of Spacematrix mapping of the generated results being similar to the distributions of the ground truth data.<br/><br/>The proposed methodology represents a novel approach to generating building massing configurations by autonomously inferring the rules of their composition from existing urban areas. The resulting models could be used to provide initial states in optimization-driven design approaches, or as smart massing suggestion engines, assisting architects and city planners during the early building design process.","Generative Adversarial Network; Generative Design; architecture; massing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

(mentor); Rohde, M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","River estuaries are strongly modified by human interventions, such as dredging. For example the Ems river (Germany and Netherlands) has been deepened between in 1965 and 2005. As a result the sediment (sand and dirt) concentration has increased enormously \cite{Ems_data}. The muddiness of this sediment blocks sunlight and decreases the friction of the water with the bed level. The transport of sediment into the river is mainly caused by non-linearity in tidal waves. As a result of the elevation of the bed level and the friction change of the Ems river, the amplitude of the M2 and M4 tide has changed, which was concluded in previous research. In this study the M2 and M4 tide are studied individually, subjected to deepening, widening and friction change. The main research question in this study is '\textit{How does the propagation of the M2 and M4 tide change, subjected to deepening, change in width and change in friction?}' The result to this question can be applied to tidal rivers. To illustrate this, the results are compared to historical data of the Ems river. The sub question in this study is; '\textit{Can historical observations of the amplitude of the M2 and M4 tides in the Ems river over the years be explained with the change in propagation of the M2 and M4 tides, subjected to deepening and friction change?}'. <br/><br/>The questions are answered with help of a model. The model is constructed with the one dimensional water equations, where boundary conditions are used. Next the equations can be used in two cases. In the first case, which is used to answer the main question, the variables width, depth and friction of the river basin are taken to be length independent variables. In the second case, the width, depth and friction of the river basin are taken to be length dependent variables. This second case is used to model the propagation of the M2 and M4 tide for the Ems river. For the first case an analytical and numerical solution exist. From the error, the optimal grid size for the numerical model is obtained, which is taken as $N=100$. For the second case only a numerical solution exists. <br/><br/>With the model it is concluded that widening and an increasing friction cause a damping effect on the propagation of the M2 and M4 tide. Deepening, however, has a different effect on the M2 and M4 tide. It was seen that for certain value change in depth the M2 tide shows an amplification in amplitude, while the M4 tide shows an damping in amplitude for the same value change. The plots obtained in this part of the study can be used to see what is expected to happen to the amplitude of the M2 and M4 tide when a variable is varied in a tidal river basin. The latter is done for the Ems river. <br/><br/><br/>An important observation made with the $x$-dependent model is that the amplification in amplitude from 1965 to 2005 can be explained by the decreased friction, due to increasing muddiness in the Ems river. Secondly, relatively, it was seen that the amplitude of the M4 tide shows a much greater amplification in amplitude at the beginning of the river than the amplitude of the M2 tide. This could be explained by the different change in amplitude of the M2 and M4 tide subjected to deepening, which was concluded from the $x$-independent model as well. However, the difference in M2 and M4 tide between 1965 and 2005 is not due to deepening on its own. Namely, the change in amplitude due to deepening highly depends on the value of the friction, which is different for the years 1965 and 2005. It is concluded that the exact amplitude of the M2 and M4 tide cannot be predicted with the $x$-independent model. However, it is concluded that the results from the $x$-independent model can be used to predict how the M2 and M4 tide will change due to deepening relatively to each other. <br/><br/><br/>The results of this study are strongly influenced by the assumptions made to derive the model. Before the one dimensional, $x$-independent model was compared to the observations for the Ems river between 1965 and 2005 a few decisions had to be made regarding $x$-dependent to $x$-independent variables. This process needs to be further researched, before applying the x-independent model to other tidal rivers, which is left for further research.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

Not only providing the highest level of employment around the world but also making this one of the most polluting activities (Provin et al., 2020). There is a growing awareness among the Dutch government that something should change. To take responsibility for contributing to solving this global problem, the Dutch government has formulated the goal to have a fully circular textile industry in 2050. Although the formulation of this goal is a valuable step current initiatives and policymakers are missing a sense of direction and different scholars have pointed out that the current state of affairs is not enough to reach the goals that are formulated. <br/><br/>The current textile industry is facing a global lock-in leakage, which is forcing businesses to make unsustainable choices with as leading motive for economic growth. <br/><br/>This pattern seems difficult to break. As the current value chain is spread all over the world and production and consumption have become geographically and socially far removed from each other. Dutch circular initiatives focus on end-of-pipe solutions or technical improvements to their own value chain. These solutions can be seen as incremental changes to the system instead of more radical change and deep cultural change that is needed to break the lock-in leakage. This thesis aims to understand the spatial implications of this more radical change and therefore it focuses on answering the following question: <br/><br/>How should the urban landscape of Noord-Brabant be configurated to overcome the metabolic imbalance with spatial circularity in the textile industry, while achieving its own sustainability? <br/><br/>Answering this question, the research first formulates preconditions, dimensions, and circular ground rules for local textile production. This is done with a diachronic analysis. This allows understanding of how the system changed and through time is influenced by the dynamics of the context. The next step of the research is to create an understanding of how circular solutions translate to spatial and design interventions. This is done with research by design that is shaped by the systemic design approach. An important conclusion of the research by design is the insight into how different design solutions are related throughout scales, this results in the realization that systemic changes lead to programmatic changes and eventually cause land-use and alternative settlement patterns. <br/><br/>Apart from this theoretical understanding of what a systemic change entails the research by design chapter focused the research on wool production as this material flow closely relates to both the historical and the contemporary context and metabolic imbalances. The different principles and design solutions are translated into a design tool that emphasizes the relation between the solutions. This tool is a pattern language. It breaks down a complex system into easily understandable blocks of knowledge (Ben Croxford et al., 2020). The last part of the research focused on finding a certain hierarchy in the formulated pattern language. This hierarchy is important as it values the relationship between the different patterns. To find the value of the links a structure map was established. The structure map showed how the context both facilities the implementation of the patterns but also how the patterns help to achieve the goals that the region has set. The answer to the main question is the structure map that shows the spatial framework that is needed to both help Noord-Brabant achieve its sustainability goals and help with the establishment of a local circular textile ecosystem. <br/><br/><br","local textile; Sustainable circularity; Spatial circularity; Metabolic imbalances; Systemic design; Planetary urbanism","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","51.4826537, 5.2321687"

The temporal variability of consistently occurring wave trains can be analyzed through so-called wave families (Portilla et al., 2015). The wave partitions show that a unimodal wave spectrum occurs 35% of the time in front of the coast of the province of North Holland in the Netherlands. This means an error is introduced 65% of the time as unimodal spectra are assumed in traditional methods that use generalized wave parameters to estimate sediment transport. When the wave field is not unimodal, the angle between wave trains is considerable. Only 39% of the time is the angle between a wave train and the most energetic wave train smaller than 60°. For 43% of the time, the angle is between 60° and 120°. The remaining 17% are wave trains propagating in opposite directions. The difference in wave angle is half of the time larger than 50° when a threshold of one meter of deepwater significant wave height over the whole spectrum, defined by Holthuijsen (2007), is used.<br/><br/>Unsupervised machine learning techniques Principal Component Analysis, Maximum Dissimilarity Analysis, and the kmean clustering algorithm are used to group similar wave spectrums over time, spatially group wave families, analyze the wave climate's spatial-temporal variability, relate wave - and weather conditions, and assess their impact on wave-driven potential sediment transport. The Principal Component Analysis is used as a dimensionality reduction technique. This study shows the physical meaning of the Principal Components and their temporal variability in the wave frequency-directional spectrums, where Principal Components describe wave energy in each frequency-directional bin. The kmean clustering algorithm groups similar wave spectrums over time and gives insight into wave conditions, like calm and stormy conditions, called Sea States. The Maximum Dissimilarity Technique changes the focus between common conditions or extreme events. The wave partitions, wave families, and Principal Components give additional insight into the Sea States.<br/><br/>Potential sediment transport estimations are made by traditional methods that use a representative wave frequency and direction and through vectorizing and superpositioning the estimations by wave partitions and wave families. The outcomes show that it is challenging to predict sediment transport for multimodal wave conditions with state-of-the-art sediment transport formulations and models. The results show that the wave period significantly impacts sediment transport. The sediment transport for coexisting wave trains causes about 58% of the time more sediment transport than traditional methods. Here the not considered interaction between wave trains on bedload and sediment suspension will enhance sediment transport. Furthermore, the sediment transport estimations give insight into the wavefield and weather conditions that contribute most to the yearly wind-wave induced potential sediment transport caused by high energetic or consistently occurring conditions.<br","Sediment transport; Principal Component Analysis; multimodal wave conditions; Maximum Dissimilarity Analysis; kmean clustering; wave partitions; wave families; ESTELA; synoptic atmospheric pattern; frequency-directional spectrum; wave train","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-06-30","","","","Civil Engineering","","53.196594, 4.478243"

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Mangrove is a coastal vegetation type primarily located in the tropical regions between 5 North and 5 South. This coastal vegetation is capable of reducing the force of incoming waves. This is a result of the obstruction created by the roots, stems and canopies against waves to propagate through. Because of this capability, mangrove vegetation offers coastal protection against extreme annual flood events for 15 million people. Recent studies identified that in 2050, the present-day 100-year extreme sea level will occur annually in a large part of the tropical region. The increase of these extreme events is primarily driven by the projected sea level rise. The hypothesis is that before this chronic flooding is observed, storm-induced flooding might already be observed. The expected increase in the probability of these extreme events is defined as non-stationarity of extreme events. The hypothesis therefore is that the non-stationarity of extreme events could already be observed in historical data.<br/><br/>This study examined non-stationary extreme events between 1987 and 2018 for a total of 5809 hydrodynamic environments distributed around the global mangrove coastline. These mangrove environments defined the hydrodynamic wave characteristics and water levels. The results showed that 87.5% of the mangrove environments have a positive trend in the location parameter of the Generalized Pareto Distribution for the extreme events. The shift of the location parameter indicates an increase of the impact of the extreme events. These extreme events were defined as multivariate extreme events consisting of the significant wave height, the mean wave period and the skew-storm surge, respectively the parameters H<sub>s</sub>, T<sub>m</sub> and S. This combination is based on the fact that the coastal protection offered by mangroves is depending on the water level and the energy within the long-period waves.<br/><br/>The methodology proposed is capable to perform a non-stationary multivariate extreme value analysis and observe the evolution of the extreme events in these three dimensions between 1987 and 2018. The study showed that the average of the extreme events has been increasing at 70.6%, 72.6% and 64.6% of the mangrove environments in the discussed three dimensions. The average multivariate extreme event in mangrove environments increased by 0.06 m, 0.16 s, and 0.7 cm in three dimensions respectively H<sub>s</sub>, T<sub>m</sub>, and S. Furthermore, the number of extreme events increased, on average, between the first and second half of the time period, from 4.16 to 4.32 extreme events per year.<br/><br/>The global impact assessment of the non-stationarity of these multivariate extreme events was translated to the 27440 mangrove locations along the global coastlines. Statistical upscaling methods allowed the application of a numerical expensive hydrodynamic model to propagate the offshore conditions to onshore. The impact of the non-stationarity of extreme events was applied to a theoretical framework, introducing the possibility of defining the vegetation width as an optimization parameter. To meet the same safety standard for the 1/40 year design condition in 2018 concerning 1987, the vegetation width of the theoretical framework had to increase on average by 16.8 m. After post-processing the hydrodynamic runs, the results showed that the coastal safety offered by mangrove vegetation is depending on the combined impact of these three parameters, emphasizing the importance of expanding the mangrove vegetation to withstand the non-stationary multivariate extreme event.<br/><br/>The main recommendations from this study are based on the results. First, the study showed that the required vegetation width to ensure coastal safety has increased. It is therefore highly questionable if a stationary extreme value analysis is still valid in these environments, especially when the currently neglecting sea level rise is taken into account. Second, the observed increase in multivariate extreme events and the number of extreme events may reduce the persistence of mangroves and therewith their ability as coastal protection.

A technology capable of enabling SSTO access to space is the air-breathing engine, which has a high specific impulse and low thrust-over-weight (T/W) ratio compared to conventional rocket engines. This necessitates the use of a Horizontal Take-off and Horizontal Landing (HTHL) launch vehicle with a lifting surface, which enables banking maneuvers that can manipulate the orbital Right Ascension of the Ascending Node (RAAN) that the space plane achieves. This means that the space plane is capable of advancing or delaying its time of launch, while still achieving a similar orbital RAAN. This effectively increases the launch window even if a precise orbit insertion is necessary. <br/><br/>This thesis answers the question what the fuel-optimal ascent trajectory is for a space plane that would extend its launch window. In order to answer this question, the full six DoF equations of motion have been defined to simulate the ascent trajectory of a space plane. Additionally, a robust Guidance and Control system is developed that can use the nonlinear translational and rotational equations of motion. <br/><br/>For several launch times, ranging from two hours earlier to two hours later than the nominal launch time, the ascent trajectory has been optimized that included a banking maneuver. It was found that at the cost of propellant, it is possible to have a launch time delayed are advanced by as much as two hours, which means that the space plane can manipulate the RAAN by ± 30 degrees. The extra propellant cost can be related to increased drag losses during the banking maneuver.<br","Space Plane; Multi-Objective Optimization; Ascent Trajectory; Launch Window Extension","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The main difference to the general FJSP is that there are changeover times that appear between two sequential operations on the same machine. To solve this extended problem, a hierarchical tabu search method has been chosen. This algorithm makes use of a global selection initialization procedure as well as two neighborhood functions for the assignment and sequencing sub-problems. The objective of this project is to show the effectiveness of tabu search on this version of FJSP compared to a mathematical model serving as a baseline. The initialization procedure performs well compared to the baseline on larger instances while the neighborhood functions worsen the initially found result. This is also the case for a random initialization method which leads to believe that these neighborhood functions are non-optimal and should be replaced which could not have been achieved due to time constraints.","Flexible job shop; Hierarchical; Tabu search; Mixed integer linear programming","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

The results of a comparative assessment of approaches with and without a toolkit indicate that although they can be incredibly effective, toolkits shouldn't replace educating on sources of harm and can even have hazardous consequences when improperly used. We discovered that while fairness toolkits increase practitioners' awareness of several specific sources of harm, such as questionable attributes or data sampling techniques, their greater power lies in fostering discussions about ML systems' propensity to treat individuals unfairly. On the contrary, we observed that these toolkits do not significantly help in the data documentation process, and, from observing our study participants, we also infer a risk of them blindly evaluating and optimizing for undesired outcomes as a result of choosing metrics and mitigations on unfounded or incomplete assumptions.

A possible explanation may be that the confounders didn't have enough influence on some diversity metrics since they were too vague.

This paper addresses whether and in what situations Risk Extrapolation (REx) can tackle this problem of Out-Of-Distribution generalization by exploiting invariant relationships. These relationships are based on features that are invariant across all domains. By learning these relationships, REx aims to learn the concept of the problem we are trying to solve. We show in what situations REx can learn these invariant relationships and when it does not. We translate the definition of an invariant relationship into a homoscedastic synthetic dataset with either covariate, confounded, anti-causal, or hybrid shift. We expose REx to experiments in sample complexity, the number of training domains, and the training domain distance. We show that REx performs better for invariant prediction in situations with larger sample sizes and training domain distance and that if these criteria are met, REx performs equivalently in all four distributional shifts. We also compare REx to Invariant- and Empirical Risk Minimization and show that; REx is less sensitive and thus robust to the shifting of the average distributional variance in the training domains; REx asymptotically out-performs the methods in the more complex distributional shifts.","Risk Extrapolation; Machine Learning; Invariant Relationships; Domain shift; Distributial shift","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","https://gitlab.com/hofland.jeroen/rex-distributional-shift Code","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

The audio data of human communication is a rich source of information, but it is con- sidered privacy-invasive for machines to listen to it. By reducing sampling frequency, it is possible to preserve privacy by making conversation unclear while still being possible to detect if someone is speaking or not. The topic of this paper is to investigate how low sampled frequency audio data hinders the detection of speech. To detect speaking, voice activity detection has been applied, which is a technology in the signal process- ing field that identifies which short segments of audio contain speakings. Two types of state-of-art voice activity detector(VAD) were used for this experiment including a supervised (pyannote) and two unsupervised (rVAD pitch and flatness mode) methods. As a result, the unsupervised methods outperformed the supervised model, where rVAD pitch mode has resulted in the best performance out of all three. More specifically, the unsupervised VAD’s performance became lower as the sample rates decreased while the supervised VAD did not work well at higher sample frequency. rVAD pitch mode at sample rates of 8000Hz or higher was possible to perform at the almost same level as a state-of-art supervised VAD that is trained in a similar data set. Furthermore, it was able to perform as well as a modern unsupervised VAD at 2000Hz or higher sample frequencies. At the sample rate of 1250Hz or lower, any VAD was not able to perform at the same level as a state-of-art VAD. Regarding the privacy aspect, it is observed that human ears detect speaking better than computers, where humans can understand parts or all of the contents of speaking at 2000Hz or higher, which infers that current technology is not enough to detect speech from downsampled privacy-preserving audio. However, there is still a need for further research to verify the effects of the training set and its sample frequencies for the supervised method and also proper scientific so- cial experiments to test the ability of humans of speech detection for reduced sampled audio.","Speech detection; Low sample frequency audio; Voice Activity Detection","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

However, the price of this great leap is the broken countryside losing independence: City-oriented planning has led to increasing urban-rural disparities, which is replacing the agriculture landscape with monofunctional land use and transforming rural area into satellite areas within the poly-centric regional structure. Therefore, how to redefine the countryside and propose development patterns jumping out of the urbanization path has become an urgent problem, yet effective spatial strategies and theory-based practices are currently limited (Magel, 2019).

Although India is near reaching 100% electrification, for many of its citizens, reliable access to electricity is still a major issue. It is not clear how, when, and where the reliability issues arise. Previous studies have not shed light on electricity outages at a granular level. Furthermore, identifying outages is difficult without proper metering. <br/><br/>This research aims to acquire insight into how electrical outages vary during the nighttime in the Uttar Pradesh, one of the states experiencing the most outages in India. Remote sensing data in the form of nighttime radiance, wind, precipitation, temperature, air quality, land cover, and population are used to identify outages, as they have been identified in the literature to be influencing or correlated with outages. Using a Random Forest (RF) classification algorithm, outages are identified in India for the year 2018. The RF is trained on Electricity Supply Monitoring Initiative (ESMI) real-time electricity household senors. RF is cross-validated using multiple strategies to accurate measure the performance and to ensure no data leakage. Using the resampling technique Synthetic Minority Oversampling technique (SMOTE), the performance of the RF is increased for outage classification. RF is used to classify three classes: Never Access, Normal Access, and Outage. The distribution of these three classes is highly imbalanced, with the Outage class being in the minority.<br/><br/><br/>To further validate the methodology, the spatial and temporal sampling was done during cross-validation. Using this method, 91% of Never Access samples were categorized as such, with a precision of 84%. 69% of Normal Access samples were categorized as such, but with 84% precision. The performance of the outage classification is the worst. Nonetheless, 55% of the Outage samples were categorized as such, although with a precision of just 39%. A map is created for Uttar Pradesh showing the results of the rates for each of the classes in 2018 between 00:00 and 02:00 with a spatial granularity of 0.1° x 0.1°. The map indicate that the electricity usage during the nighttime in Uttar Pradesh is in large parts of the state non-existent. The map be used as a precursor for future field work and help policymaker and researchers identify reliability and fairness issues.","India; Electricity Reliability; Random Forest; Remote sensing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","","28.20, 79.80"

Take for instance, climate change, energy transition, loss of biodiversity, and the shortage of public places. Therefore we should rethink flat roofs, and expose their potential. In many different ways, they could contribute to the development of a sustainable and resilient city in the future. Especially, multifunctional, green roofs are able to reduce heat stress, store (temporarily) water, purify the air, enrich biodiversity, and accommodate social functions, especially when there is a possibility to connect all those ‘hidden’, unused spaces in the city. There are already a lot of initiatives in Rotterdam, that come up with all different ideas to fill in the 18 square kilometers of flat roofs we have at our disposal. However, this is mostly about the (re)development of a single plot, a building block, or a street. If we really want to tackle those large urban challenges, we should not only see the potential of a single roof but zoom out and see how at a city scale the roofs could be transformed into a liveable roofscape.<br/> <br/>This thesis explores the potential and redevelopment of flat roofs in the city center of Rotterdam and aims for a whole new flat rooftop network above the existing city. The main research question is: How can the (re)development of Rotterdam’s flat roofs be guided to achieve significant progress towards a sustainable and resilient Rotterdam? By analysing the existing urban fabric, investigating possible functions flat roofs could accommodate in relation to large urban scale problems, and seeing the technical implications and possible limitations, a proposal for a rooftop toolkit and strategy for the city of Rotterdam is formulated. The main research method is research by design. This all to support the growth of Rotterdam in the upcoming years and make the city even more sustainable, resilient and liveable in the future.","Roofscape; Urban Transformations; Sustainable City; Multifunctional Roofs; Resilient City","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

Jobs consisting of operations on a specific enzyme need to be scheduled as efficiently as possible on groups of available machines. The most interesting requirement upon the general FJSP are the sequence-dependent cleaning times a machine needs when it processes two different enzyme types consecutively. This can all be intuitively represented using a weighted disjunctive graph, which ACO uses as its input. The algorithm consists of a number of epochs for which multiple ants create a feasible schedule one operation at the time. Scheduling choices are made using pheromones and an heuristic visibility function based on earliest starting times. Pheromone amounts are updated using both a negative local updating rule and a positive global update for the best ant per epoch. Two hyperparameters, the initial pheromone amount τ<sub>0</sub> and the cutting exploration parameter q<sub>0</sub> are experimentally evaluated. Varying τ<sub>0</sub> does not consistently impact the solution quality nor runtime, while the higher the value of q<sub>0</sub>, the better both measures. Performance evaluation of ACO is done using a provided MILP solver as baseline and the makespan as objective function for a range of different time limits. For the tested instances, ACO shows to significantly outperform MILP, finding good solutions exceptionally fast. Based on this, ACO is an efficient method to solve the production scheduling problem of DSM.","Flexible job shop scheduling; Ant colony optimisation; Algorithmics","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Dynamic programming languages (DPLs), such as Python and Ruby, are often used for their flexibility and fast development. The absence of static typing can lead to runtime exceptions and reduced program understandability. To overcome these problems, some DPLs have introduced optional static typing. Because of the tedious effort of adding type annotations to existing projects, different approaches have been employed to generate type annotations. Static type inference methods are sound in their suggestions, but the dynamic nature of DPLs, combined with insufficient satisfied static dependencies, can cause imprecision. Other proposed approaches used machine learning (ML)-based type inference to predict type annotations. ML-based methods don’t have the limitations of static type inference, however, their performance depends on the training set’s quality and they cannot guarantee type correctness because of their probabilistic techniques. One of such ML-based inference approaches, is the state-of-the-art Type4Py model. Type4Py suffers from some of the same limitations of other learning-based approaches, e.g. it cannot predict types outside of its pre-defined type clusters. To this end, this paper presents hpredict, a tool that combines type prediction of Type4Py’s pre-trained model with static type inference. hpredict runs Type4Py’s learning-based inference and static type inference on different copies of type slots and combines the predictions from both methods. Experiments on the test set of the ManyTypes4Py dataset show that hpredict outperforms Type4Py significantly by 11% regarding Top-10 prediction. The findings of this research, lend evidence that hpredict can increase Type4Py’s general type prediction performance by employing static type inference as well.<br","Type Inference; Python; Machine Learning; Static Type Inference","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

The main objective function used is the makespan of the created schedules. The difference that occurs in the quality of the seven heuristics is examined also when instead the total lateness across all jobs is chosen as objective function. It concludes that a heuristic algorithm allows for the creation of good feasible solutions to complex problem instances for the FJSP variation with changeover times in under 30 seconds and that it outperforms an exact algorithm for the FJSP with changeover for use cases where efficiency is important and runtime is limited.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

It is challenging for existing machine learning models. Several methods have been proposed to solve this problem, and multi-domain calibration is one of these methods. Model selection with the average expected calibration error (ECE) across training domains and naive calibration are two approaches to implementing multi-domain calibration. However, it might happen that neither approach can learn a genuinely well-calibrated model in the multi-domain setting. Hence, this paper intends to evaluate how naive calibration and model selection with average ECE perform in the OOD generalization problem for binary classifiers. We generated many synthetic datasets and set up three experiments to answer this question. Finally, the conclusions based on empirical results are obtained: 1) Although naive calibration can improve the average accuracy across unseen domains (OOD accuracy) and the average area under the ROC Curve across unseen domains (OOD AUROC) for some binary classifiers, it does not work for all binary classifiers. However, at least it does not make the model worse for OOD generalization. 2) On the synthetic datasets we generated, if the number of training domains increases, most binary classifiers' OOD accuracy will also increase. 3) Average ECE is a reasonable metric for selecting a model in the OOD generalization problem and is better than validation accuracy. This is because a strong linear relationship exists between OOD accuracy and the average ECE across the training domains. This linear relationship is stronger than the linear relationship between OOD accuracy and validation accuracy.","Out-of-domain (OOD) generalization; Calibration; Naive calibration; Expected calibration error; Multi-domain calibration","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

We assume an attacker has to train a separate model (the ``substitute model'') and generate adversaries using this independent model. The substitute models are trained with different data distributions: symmetric, cross-section or completely disjoint data to the one used to train the target model. The results demonstrate that an attacker only needs semantically similar data to execute an effective attack using a substitute model and well-known gradient based adversarial generation techniques. Under ideal attack scenarios, target model accuracies can drop below 50\%.

They provide users with meaningful recommendations for items and products. A frequently occurring problem in recommender systems is known as the long-tail problem. It refers to a situation in which a majority of the items in the data set have limited ratings due to which many recommender systems, especially collaborative filtering based methods, are not able to recommend these items, also known as long-tail items. Although popular items are easier to recommend, it has been noticed that long-tail items often generate a significant fraction of the revenue and therefore should also be recommended to users. This paper proposes a modified version of a collaborative filtering based recommender system aimed to reduce the effects of the long-tail recommendation problem (LTRP). The algorithm first splits the data set into the head H and the tail T and clusters the items from the tail. The average rating avg for each cluster is calculated and for all users and their unrated long-tail items, the rating for that item is set to avg with a probability of p. Now the standard collaborative filtering algorithm is run with the newly inserted ratings. The inserted ratings reduce the sparsity of the data set and therefore make it easier to recommend long-tail items. Empirical experiments on the 100K MovieLens data set indicate that the proposed algorithm recommends more long-tail items than the standard collaborative filtering algorithm, thus reducing the effects of the LTRP while maintaining the same or a slightly lower accuracy of the recommender system.","Collaborative Filtering; Recommender Systems; Long-Tail","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

The purpose of this study was to determine which gestures are effective for controlling microtask workflows in terms of health benefits and usability. In an effort to maximize the positive impact on health, a total of 12 gestures were developed for four distinct microtask workflow elements. Then, we incorporated these gestures into a survey to evaluate the subjective perceptions of usability. On the basis of the survey results, we ranked these gestures for each workflow element and proposed three gesture-command dictionaries optimized for maximum efficiency.

These models incorporate context around the requested completion and then return a prediction of code based on the context. To accomplish this, two plugins were made called 'Code4Me'. One for Visual Studio Code and PyCharm. These plugins work with a remote API that requires a segment of 3966 characters of the left and right context at the trigger point. The data collected consists of the inserted code completion, verification of the code completion, the IDE used, the trigger point, and the inference time. To evaluate the data the following metrics are used: BLUE~4, ROUGE-L, Exact Match, Edit Similarity, and the METEOR score. The results point out that developers accept once every 8 suggestions with an Exact Match of 62.5%, and the user evaluated, albeit with limited responses, are favourable towards the model and Code4Me. The accuracy of UniXcoder is lower in a real-world setting than when it is predicting source code.

For ML algorithm's to be implemented and used within fields such as medicine, it is not simply enough that they are proficient and effective tool at solving their assigned task (such as classifying whether a patient has Covid-19 or not).

This black box problem is one of the underlying difficulties that currently prevent the widespread adoption of ML/AI algorithms into these safety-critical fields.

In this paper we will be exploring and investigating the different Model-Agnostic XAI techniques and looking into their individual advantages and disadvantages.

The two toolkits considered were the IBM AI Fairness360 and Microsoft FairLearn. The data collected from the interviews suggests that there could be fewer differences in practices of practitioners with experience and without experience with toolkits, than those with training or work roles in ethics and fairness in ML and those without.

Previous theses in TU Delft have underlined the large potential for the design of these megaliths, but at the same time they have also underlined the strong limitations that derive from the use of commercial software as the tool for it.<br/><br/>The limitations are directly related to the brittle nature of glass which results in significantly different behavior regarding its maximum tensile and compressive allowable limits. This renders fundamental to be able to evaluate both of these criteria during the optimization process. If this is not possible, as it was the case in the previous theses, a secondary (post-processing) phase should be integrated in the process in order to alleviate the peak stresses that may occur in the structure. This increases significantly the time and effort needed for the design and, therefore, it was underlined as an issue to be tackled in further exploration. <br/><br/>This thesis aspires to address this problem with the creation of a customized optimization tool that takes all the structural constraints into consideration and, additionally, integrates the criteria specifically related to the glass manufacturing process, such as the overall annealing time needed. The tool is created in Matlab with the use of Finite Element Method equations in order to develop the structural model. The results of the structural analysis were validated through comparison with results obtained through ANSYS.<br/><br/>The literature review covers a wide scope of topics. Firstly, the glass properties and the casting process are investigated in order to properly indicate the criteria and constraints that arise in every phase. The second part refers to topology optimization. A comparative review of the different algorithmic methodologies is realized and SIMP is selected as the most appropriate for the project. Additionally, the different categories of formulation for the optimization problem – stress, compliance and volume based – are discussed in order to select the appropriate objective and constraints. At the same time, a review of the previous theses is realized in order to indicate which method was used in every case and how the constraints were integrated in the process every time.<br/><br/>In the end two different algorithms are developed based on two different problem formulations; one with compliance objective and a second one with volume objective. The aim is to investigate if the volume objective optimization can be a robust alternative to the classical compliance approach leading to more lightweight structures which at the same time fulfill the criteria regarding their feasibility to be manufactured.<br/><br/>Firstly, the performance of the algorithm in relation to each objective and constraint individually is evaluated though application in a smaller scale benchmark problem. The results showed that all the setups work and, therefore, they can be used for the final design experiments. However, it also indicated that some constraints, such as stress, cannot be applied individually but they always have to be combined with another constraint that guides the optimization in order to lead in a reasonable result. Afterwards, a combination of objective and constraints for each of the two aforementioned formulations – compliance and volume - is tested and applied in the case study example which refers to a slab that serves as a small pedestrian bridge inside the British Museum.<br/><br/>The results validate the estimation that a volume-based problem formulation can offer a robust result which resembles the result obtained from the traditional compliance-based formulation. Moreover, the result in the volume-based case is clearer and sharper and for this reason it was selected in the end for implementation in the final design. The formulation is then used in combination with different glass types, boundary conditions and design domain in order to conclude to the final shape of the slab.","cast glass; topology optimization; mass minimization; Finite Element Method; brittle materials","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","",""

A Dota 2 match is played by two teams of 5 players. The main goal of the game is to destroy the opposing team’s Ancient tower, the team that manages to do so, wins the game. An essential part of a match is the hero selection phase before it starts. There are different ways to select heroes in different game modes, but the game mode that is used for this research is the Captain’s mode where each team is assigned a captain and the captains take turns picking and banning heroes. The main question that this research aims to answer is: “What is the effect of the Pudge hero being picked in a team on the outcome of a Dota 2 game?” Causal inference, a discipline that is concerned with discovering causal relationships using data analysis under certain assumptions about the data is used in this research to measure this effect. More specifically, the g-formula is the causal inference method of choice for this research. The data that is used for this research is gathered through the OpenDota API. After running the correctly formatted data through the g-formula implementation, the effect of the Pudge hero being picked in a team on the game outcome was estimated as -0.2848%. Meaning that, on average, there is a 0.2848% less chance of a team winning the game, if the Pudge hero is in that team.","Causal Inference; DotA 2; g-formula; causal analysis; Data Analysis","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","https://github.com/noyant/research-project-dota2 This is the link to the GitHub repository used for the project. https://figshare.com/s/d0d019862fbe2bc5fbc6 This is the dataset used as part of the project.

One of the main ways to preserve the privacy of the speakers in recorded conversations consists of decimating said conversations, which consists of reducing the sample frequency and the frequency bandwidth of the audio. This theoretically makes the verbal content of the conversation (the words themselves) unintelligible, while still preserving other useful non-verbal social cues such as laughter, pitch modulation and frequency of speech, amongst others. However, this has not been experimentally verified. This research paper addresses this knowledge gap by exploring the performance of laughter detection machine learning models with decimated audio. An existing pre-trained state-of-the-art laughter detection model was employed and its performance was evaluated for a dataset of decimated audio with sample frequencies ranging from 300Hz to 44100Hz.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

RS's enable these platforms to provide tailor-made experiences to each of their customers by strategically utilizing users/items rating data or any other available data. Collaborative filtering (CF) techniques are some of the most popular and successful RS models created. However, CF techniques often suffer from the cold start (CS) problem. In particular, they struggle with complete cold start (CCS) situations in which no user/item rating history is available and incomplete cold start (ICS) situations in which only a limited amount of user/item rating history is available. <br/>In this paper, we explore two models which utilize novel ideas to combat the CCS and ICS problems. The first model (DCF) focuses on the intelligent use of user demographic data to combat the CCS problem. The second model (PIPCF) focuses on the use of a novel domain-specific similarity measure called Proximity-Impact-Popularity (PIP) to combat the ICS problem. In addition to this, we also propose our own model (DPIP-CF) which combines these two ideas in conjunction with some of our own modifications to combat the CCS and ICS problems simultaneously. <br/>We utilize the MovieLens data set which is a commonly available and popular dataset that is often used to test RS's. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate the strengths of DCF and PIPCF in dealing with the CCS and ICS problems respectively. Finally, we also show that our DPIP-CF model outperforms all other models discussed in this paper and is a viable solution to dealing with the CCS and ICS problems simultaneously.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

In this research, EHOP was compared with traditional paradigms under the context of data processing applications. An Excel-like command line application called “MiniExcel” was implemented from scratch. Moreover, “Hierarchical EHOP”, a new structural pattern for EHOP was defined which enforces rules between concepts and produces a readable code structure. The main conclusions of this research can be summarized by the following statements. EHOP produces more modular, readable and maintainable code compared to traditional paradigms. Implementing additional concepts and updates to code is seamless using EHOP, yet the lack of development in EHOP’s ecosystem raises frustrating errors and requires the developer to implement libraries that are usually built-in for languages that support traditional paradigms. Functional programming produces faster running code, but EHOP is more memory efficient.

This goal will be achieved by performing both a qualitative as well as a quantitative analysis of the source code of a text-based game, written in Koka - a state-of-the-art programming language, which supports EHOP.

This paper seeks to address this, by investigating possible solutions to augment any arbitrary 3D scenes for chromostereopsis. We present techniques to apply the effect in real-time to 3D scenes, while maintaining the scene's original shading, lighting, and optionally some degree of original colour. Additionally, we propose concepts for interfaces that allow user adjustment to applying the effect in areas where user studies have shown variance in preferences. These range from curves that determine varying depth precision, to creating custom chromostereoscopic colour maps, and modifying the speed at which the depth-colour mapping changes, for those sensitive to stereopsis.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

Motivating examples as well as counterexamples have been proposed about the performance of IRM. This work aims to clarify when the method works well and when it fails by testing its ability to learn invariant relationships. Therefore, experiments are done on a synthetic data model which simulates four data distribution shifts: covariate shift (CS), confounder based shift (CF), anti-causal shift (AC), and hybrid shift (HB). The experiments exploit IRM’s behaviour with respect to hetero- and homoskedasticity and adaptation of the training environments. We measure the error with regards to the optimal invariant predictor and compare to the non invariant Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM). The results show that IRM is generally able to learn invariance for the CS and CF shifts, especially when the deviation between the training environments is large.

We design an extension of AdaBoost to support adversarial training in a multiclass setting, and name it Adven. To answer the question, we systematically study the effect of six variables of Adven’s training procedure on adversarial robustness. From a theoretical standpoint, our experiments show that known characteristics from adversarial training and ensemble learning apply in the combined context. Empirically, we demonstrate that an Adven ensemble is more robust than a single learner in every scenario. Using the best found values of the six tested variables, we derive an Adven ensemble that can defend against 91.88% of PGD attacks and obtain 96.72% accuracy on the MNIST dataset.","Adversarial attacks; Adaptive Boosting; Adversarial robustness","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

The consequence of this growing energy demand is an increase in greenhouse gas emissions leading to climate change. The irreversible and worrying consequences of climate change have led to various national and international targets. In the Netherlands, national targets are integrated into policy making in 2019, distinguishing between five sectors. This study aims to describe a systematic approach that contributes to facilitating decision-making in the heat transition in the built environment. The approach consists of three steps, considering the system elements of a socio-technical environment. The first step of the systematic approach is formed by an actor analysis, where through an actor identification and categorization the non-rational aspects are mapped. These non-rational aspects, consisting for example of willingness to participate in the heat transition and underlying technological preferences, can be used to determine the social feasibility of a heat transition vision. The second step in the systematic approach is the application of the techno-economic Vesta MAIS model. This model can calculate at a neighborhood level per heat transition vision the national cost and share of energy carrier. In this way, the model contributes to facilitating decision-making at the municipal level. To enrich the technical aspects of the Vesta MAIS model with insights into grid congestion, this study proposes a power flow analysis as the third step in the systematic approach. This power flow analysis enables municipal decision-makers to analyze the impact of the heat transition on the existing power grid at an early stage.","Heat transition; Built environment; Grid congestion; Vesta MAIS; Actor analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

The consequences of this can be mitigated when accurate and rapid predictions are available when the water will arrive at which location. Current numerical simulations take a significant amount of time due to their computational demand, which is not affordable during a calamity where each second can make the difference between life and death. Literature has shown promising results in fluvial flood forecasting by using a deep learning model, which generally takes only a fraction of the computation time compared to conventional models. However, these models have thus far only been trained on static landscapes with changing boundary conditions, which prevents the model’s application elsewhere. <br/><br/>This research explores therefore the possibilities of creating and training a generic non-location bound deep learning model which can predict the spatial distribution of fluvial flood arrival times per grid cell. The architecture of the created deep learning model consists of five parallel encoder-decoders, which takes the elevation, slopes, elevated elements, land roughness, and initial water levels into consideration, depending on the dataset. The model is trained, validated and tested on four unique datasets, which consists of 30,000 flooding samples. The degree of complexity within a sample increases with each dataset number. <br/><br/>The average error for the four consecutive test datasets were 0.91, 1.41, 1.25, and 1.76 hours per cell. The differences in the predicted and the groundtruth are relatively small although the deviation tends to become larger at the end of the simulation, in regions with a strong gradient in arrival time, and in hilly and complex landscapes. <br/><br/>In addition, the model has been tested on various benchmark landscapes to examine specific flow phenomena, as well as a realistic test scenario in the Dutch dike ring 48. The model shows satisfactory performances for landscapes other than those present in the dataset, untill it encounters a feature on which the model was not trained for, such as undershots or irregularly shaped waterways. <br/><br/>This research has shown the potential of deep learning in predicting fluvial flood arrival times on unseen before landscapes. Recommendations for further studies include the use of an active dike breach and a variable flood location.<br","deep Learning; convolutional encoder-decoder; flood arrival time; fluvial floods; Delft3D FM; dike ring 48","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","","51.962767, 5.940658"

Consequently, organizations have to adapt their real estate to new regulations for building performance and their own sustainability goals. The Preference-based Accommodation Strategy (PAS) is a decision-making strategy that aids organizations in finding a Corporate Real Estate Portfolio (CREP) that aligns with the organization’s values. This research aimed to stimulate organizations to improve the environmental sustainability of their CREP by changing the decision-making process. Therefore a sustainability reference model (SuRMo) was developed for PAS and tested on the CREP of Colliers, an international real estate consultancy firm with multiple offices in the Netherlands. In the pilot study, PAS and the SuRMo were used to evaluate three alternatives for a new office space in Utrecht. In an iterative process using the operation research methodology four tests were conducted which compared the outcome of the different decision-making processes. The four tests analysed 1) the current decision-making process, 2) the decision-making process and outcome using PAS, 3) the decision-making process and outcome using PAS with the SuRMo 2.0 and 4) the sustainability performance of Test 1-3 compared to Dutch sustainability goals for 2050. In the three tests the decision outcome resulted in the same office building that performed best in terms of environmental sustainability and matches the governmental goals for 2050. However, between Test 1 and Test 2 the total number of criteria increased from 7 to 37 and from two implicit environmental sustainability criteria to five explicit criteria. The outcome of this research shows that PAS increased the number of environmental sustainability criteria and changed the decision-making process of Colliers from implicit to explicit. The stakeholders expressed the need for the SuRMo because they lack knowledge about environmental sustainability in CREP but concluded that it requires further development for user-friendliness and suitability with PAS. The three actionable conclusions for practise are that PAS should be used in decision-making about CRE with a further developed SuRMo, Green Building Rating Systems should be used for sustainability in CRE decision-making instead of greenhouse gas emissions and project developers and investors can use the explicit outcome of PAS to adapt the supply to the demand on the real estate market.","Sustainability; Corporate Real Estate; Decision-making; Preference Function Modeling; Preference-based Accommodation Strategy; Reference Model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Waste is a natural process, a pervasive material, an invaluable resource; a crucial element in the way human society views, orders, and designs its spaces. The issue of waste is a modern urban invention and a controversial topic for both global culture and urban ecology, and stems from the consumptive habits of modern society and the throwaway culture that promotes the disposability of products. The assumption that the product is more important than the materials that make it up is particularly prevalent in complex everyday items such as electrical and electronic equipment. The waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) stream is the fastest growing waste stream in the world. These complex products, made mostly of glass, plastic and metal, but also of valuable resources such as rare earth metals are destined to be landfilled and if lucky, to enter the recycling loop. Ironically, recycling, a waste practise touted as ""the"" solution to the waste problem regardlessly encourages consumptive habits and ultimately supports the interests of the same system that creates the waste problem. On the other hand, the issue of urban waste arises from the processes of contemporary urbanisation, economic change and rapid population growth, and spans technical, environmental, social, economic, and political layers. Agglomeration of problems across the layers of waste ecologies results in delays in their spatial synchronisation and waste ecology produces waste landscapes, which are the infrastructures of waste streams and their consequential landscapes. <br/><br/>The municipal waste stream is not the largest; however, it generates the most waste landscapes in the city and therefore an important issue for urban life. London has long joined the global attempts at transforming ""take-make-waste"" habits and the linear, fixed, closed systems into flexible, complex, circular ones. However, the delay in transforming the monofunctional structures of industrial waste processes into circular multifunctional infrastructures of resource recovery still results in vast, polluted sites of accumulated urban waste. Waste collection, treatment and disposal processes continue to be harmful to the environment. Waste landscapes remain industrial in structure and image, seen as disruption to urban life, and therefore, appear as a strange non-city fabric. The metropolis continues to rely on waste landscapes, producing even more of them and pretending to contribute to the socio-environmental condition of the city. <br/><br/>The research aims to find ways to catalyse an interception in urban waste ecology and generate alternative pathways for material flows in the city. The results of the graduation project prove that waste materials can be reclaimed within the city by linking waste flows with other urban flows and generating opportunities for waste landscapes with new programmes and values. As a proof concept, this coupling is realised for WEEE stream and collaborative work spaces of arts, crafts, and technology, which illustrates a creativity-based alternative to materials recovery in the city. <br","urban material ecology; waste ecology; waste landscapes; recycling; material recovery; WEEE stream; disassembly","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Architectural Design Crossovers","",""

Innovative methods of cognitive mapping and 2,5D model game are tested in the research respectively for inquiry and design testing, the two key participatory stages. The research outcomes include locals' initial perceptions and remembrance of the site. The key findings are the common ground and reasons in their scenario preferences, which lead to the final redesign on creating Sensitive Surface, Inclusive Core, and Attentive Home. In this way, the redesign meets locals' functional, spatial, and psychological demands, thus being well perceived and inteprete by them. Locals would like to come to the site, meet others, and enjoy themselves. The isolated building would then be transformed into a great joint in the community, maximising the social and community values.","Heritage & Architecture; Redesign; Participation; Social Values; Vacant Heritage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","",""

Because of its increasing productivity, the earliest technologies are quickly adopted in spaces of economic activity. Traditionally, the place to work was centralized so employers could keep an eye on their employees and often also because the home environment couldn’t provide a reasonable place to work. But through the disruptive decentralization of the internet, work activity was partially released from its geographical constraints. During this time of Remote Working employees saw increasing productivity levels. However, some negative side-effects were introduced that limited the remote desktop. As digital developments continue the full disruptive power of the internet has not yet been met.

This project is contextualized in an urban proposal that aims to regenerate the south part of the Sappi factory, by creating new connections and bringing the isolated site back to the city. The building, situated directly on an inner harbor, aims to activate the waterfront by the introduction of a kayak clubhouse. A hostel, on the other hand, will accommodate visitors and keep the site alive 24/7. <br/><br/>Gleaning, in the context of architecture, suggests a careful reading of the existing and learning to respect the existing. This approach has resulted in a highly site-specific design. Together with the existing Maasboulevard and the Affuitenloods building, this proposal provides a series of open spaces situated on different levels with varying publicness. They contribute to the recreational and informal life in the city.<br/><br/>The project is developed based on the theme of the ‘edges’ and a study of the ‘edge conditions’. In this study, two types of edges are mainly addressed: the facade or the building edge, and the waterfront, an edge that separates the land and the water. During fieldworks carried out in Maastricht, many appropriation and informal use have been observed in these spaces on the edges. The spatial characteristics of these spaces are being studied and the findings are then translated into the design proposal.","Glaneur/Glanuese; Urban Architecture; Waterfront Regeneration; Recreation; Edge condition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","50.856168, 5.692248"

Opposing concepts to be regarded as forms of reductionism, implemented by power structures as control tools, that create, at a first level, a sense of nostalgia (or else, condemn), while producing, at at deeper level, public apathy, political pessimism and nihilism due to the experience of violence, impotency and passivity that the conflict causes. This manifests in a general unproductive approach towards existing (valuable) architectural objects, trapped in their being but filled with potential for new forms of appropriation and re-activation, new forms of becoming. <br/><br/>Laguna Vere has been framed as a symbol of the Soviet era, of International competitiveness. Laguna Vere was also a vibrant public space in the city center. It was open, green, and crowded. One could learn how to swim, how to hang out, and build networks there. It was a displace of bikinis and bare bodies, a cinema, a theatre. <br/>Its status has deteriorated over time to one of physical abandonment and mental forgetfulness, which has been exacerbated by the city’s most recent privatization processes. Within its transformation dynamics and life cycle, the architectural object currently appears static, inaccessible, impermeable to external influences, and devoid of any link with the (public) context.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, no single moment in Laguna Vere’s evolution should be regarded as prominent, as either one thing or another; rather, it should be considered as a continual flux, an assemblage of singularities resulting in multiplicity. <br/>All of the above-mentioned moments in time and space may be found as traces in Laguna Vere’s current state, and as a result, the current state also bears suggestions about the future, about what it could be but is not (yet). <br/><br/>In this thesis I am looking for traces; where /when to search for them and how to keep tracing? How could bodily experience, as a tool for perception and analysis, be used to problematize the state of an abandoned space and foresee a possible future?

To assess tree effects and find suitable tree setups in urban areas, Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulations can be used.<br/>To handle trees in CFD simulations, the implicit tree modeling approach, i.e, the porosity model, is widely used where finite volume cells that roughly account for trees are marked as porous zones. Some studies have also attempted to model trees as obstacles rather than porous zones, which can be referred to as an explicit tree modeling approach. The difference between these two approaches deserves further study. Also, for practical purposes and lack of information, the geometric features of trees are usually oversimplified or even ignored in CFD simulations.<br/>This thesis investigates the difference between implicit and explicit tree modeling approaches and analyzes the impact of tree Level of Detail (LoD) and shapes on the flow structure. For comparative analysis, several numerical test cases with different urban complexities, tree modeling approaches, tree LoDs, tree shapes, Leaf Area Density (LAD) values, and wind directions were used for CFD simulations.<br/>The results show: (a) the implicit models always allow some of the wind flow into the porous cells no matter how high the LAD values are, resulting in smaller wind acceleration on the lateral sides of implicit tree models; (b) for the idealized street canyon and realistic urban geometry test cases simulated in this thesis, the velocity magnitude differences between the LoD2 cases and the LoD3 cases are rather limited, with maximum differences in the order of 0.5 m/s; (c) differences in tree shapes, LAD values, and wind directions will change the effects of tree modeling approaches and tree LoDs on wind. For instance, the case using an isolated explicit LoD2 conifer tree model has a different wake flow pattern from other explicit cases. Also, with the inflow direction perpendicular to buildings, the higher the LAD values, the larger the velocity magnitude difference between cases using LoD2 tree models and those using LoD3 tree models.","CFD; Tree; Level of Detail; Wind; Modeling; OpenFOAM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

They play a significant role in the history of the development of London, especially in the ‘long’ 18th century. Marketplaces have passed the test of time, reflecting on the socio-economic and urban changes and are still in use nowadays, to quote Ken Jones “we are what we consume, and our consumption priorities describe our society”. What makes them so successful is their inclusivity and the ability to accommodate the changes in the fast-paced urban environment.<br/>The changes the 21st-century cities are facing need urgent response. They have to densify in order to accommodate the growing urban population, the new developments bring an additional layer of the threat of the homogenisation and detachment of the new inhabitants from the public realm, as well as gentrification and connected with that relocation of locally established communities. The research analyses the inherent qualities and the essence of marketplaces and searches for similar characteristics in other places in the city, and theoretical works to propose an overview of possibilities to create public spaces that are responsive and inclusive towards their current and new inhabitants.<br/>Firstly, the paper analyses the past and present state of retail in London with a concentration on retail markets, learning how they operate, what traits they represent, and what role they play in the city. Further investigation looks at the importance of those places for local communities and the ways it is manifested, as well as examples of both successful and failed regenerations of the public realm concerned with community values. Understanding them showcases the ways of possibility to go against the current of changes<br/>proposed by the new developments. Lastly, theoretical references showcase how did the designers previously approach the topics and unique, combined characteristics of the marketplaces that came to light during the previous analyses. This comprehensive analysis creates an overview of the possibilities in the designer’s vocabulary to respond to the fast-paced changes in the urban environment.<br/>The research serves as a base for a design project for a neighbourhood public space in the borough of Tower Hamlets. The proposal highlights the values of the existing community and looks into ways to combine them with the new developments in the neighbourhood. The design combines the reuse of existing buildings in a post-industrial context as well as proposing a new development for the neighbourhood.","London; marketplace; public space; integration; creative industry; reuse; post industrial landscape; adaptability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Architectural Design Crossovers","","51.5446, 0.0257"

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","To reduce emissions from civil aviation, research is being conducted in lean premixed hydrogen combustors as part of the APPU project at the TU Delft. Next to mitigating CO2 emissions completely, these technologies have the potential to also reduce NOx emissions greatly, allowing for the future of civil aviation to become sustainable. However, the swirling flow of such combustors and the high reactivity of hydrogen lead to increased flashback propensity which can damage the combustor and the engine all together. To counteract this, a concept called Axial Air Injection (AAI) is under investigation. In this technique, an air jet is injected in the mixing tube on its centreline, in an attempt to push the flame more downstream to prevent flame flashback from occurring. The effect of this concept on flashback propensity has been investigated on an axial swirl-stabilized methane combustor, though a parametric variation of swirl intensity and AAI level. The flowfield inside the combustor of each operating point has been visualized by conducting both non-reacting and reacting PIV, which has given insight in their intrinsic differences on flashback propensity for such a combustion system. The results have shown that the non-reacting flowfields prove to be a good indicator of flashback propensity in reacting flowfields for low and high levels of AAI. For in between AAI values, the interaction of heat release, swirling flow and AAI creates a larger deviation which has been shown to be dependent on the presence of circumferential vorticity in non-reacting conditions. It is envisaged that these experimental results will contribute to the body of knowledge in the hydrogen combustor development as part of the APPU project.","Swirling flow; Lean premixed hydrogen combustion; PIV; Vortex breakdown; Axial air injection; APPU; Flashback; Axial swirl generator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-06-30","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Advanced Propulsion and Power Unit (APPU)","51.988610, 4.376159"

Many residents of the Grenfell tower did not just become homeless or lost personal belongings, approximately two-thirds suffer from post-traumatic stress. Such layered and systemic disparities in the built environment as well as their consequence are often obscure due to systems’ complexity and dependency on external influences. Disparities and potential effects remain largely hidden.<br/><br/>Disparities have been found to be particularly present on six planes: sound, reflection, social, exchange, recreation, and accessibility. Together the disparities on the planes form an assemblage of disparity. The asymmetric condition of disparities depends on the degree of affluence and deprivation of the analysed territory or machine. Disparities express themselves as asymmetric membranes, which can be both material and immaterial. To a largely extent they determine the accessibility to the membrane’s territory – which may or may not perpetuate existing disparities.<br/><br/>The intent of the design is to address the existing dichotomy and polarity between territories of affluence and deprivation, to challenge asymmetric membranes that perpetuate deep-rooted disparities. The middleground acts as its own agent, its own territory, that provides continuous impulses challenging existing disparities. The middleground itself, ironically, also consists of a sequence of asymmetric membranes. These membranes, however, intend to address and potentially disrupt the disparities found on the six planes. <br/><br/>The middleground aims to challenge the trends of perpetual inequalities, fragmentation, and exclusivity. Designing the middleground as a multiplicity of membranes creates a sequence of spaces that mediate in varying degrees between public and private. This proof-of-concept intends to show how the middleground approach can promote inclusivity on the various planes considering the multiplicity and complexity of disparities.<br","Asymmetry; membrane; disparity; Deprivation; territory; assemblage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Architectural Design Crossovers","Heterogeneous London","51.4654595, -0.1941679"

This research describes the development of an SH­UHPFRC mixture, using Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE) fibres. The benefits of using this material as a strengthening material were analysed using a numerical model and the environmental impact of the SH­UHPFRC was evaluated. During the material development the effects of different material types and the applied ratios were considered. The flowability of the mixture, compressive strength and tensile response were tested to determine the mixture design. The effect of different cement types and amount of superplasticizer played a significant role in the increasing of the workability of the mixture. The effect of using UHMWPE fibres over steel fibres was investigated, as well as the effect the amount of UHMWPE fibres had on different properties. The material properties of the material research were implemented in a numerical model using ATENA software, representing a strengthened reinforced concrete (RC) beam subjected to a three­point bending test. In addition to the modelling of a RC beam strengthened with SH­UHPFRC, a parameter study was executed to determine the effect of increased strain capacity in the strengthening material. This was done by adjusting the tensile stress­strain relation in the material model. Three levels of strain were tested and the capacity and cracking behaviour of the strengthened beam were compared. The environmental impact was evaluated using the CUR Groen Beton calculation tool. The mixture design of SH­UHPFRC was compared to that of relevant concrete types. The environmental impact per volume is high for SH­UHPFRC, but the mechanical properties are superior which leads to a lower required volume to achieve similar mechanical results. Comparing a strengthened beam to a RC beam demonstrated the contribution of SH­UHPFRC, proving that, including the environmental impact, SH­UHPFRC could outperform NC as a strengthening material. The developed mixture granted a compressive strength of nearly 120 MPa, a tensile strength of 8.9 MPa and a tensile strain capacity over 2%. The use of this material for the strengthening of a RC beam lead to an increase in shear capacity of 78%, following from the numerical model. Evaluating the environmental impact, the use of SH­UHPFRC overcomes the use of NC to strengthen a shear­deficient beam. It is recommended to conduct further research on specific aspects of the material optimization of SH­UHPFRC. For the numerical modal the resemblance to practice could be improved and the range of parameters expanded. The environmental impact of a beam strengthened with SH­UHPFRC proved to be lower compared to an RC beam with equal shear capacity, showing the benefit of this superior material. An analysis of the full life cycle of an element strengthened with SH­UHPFRC could be done to get a better estimation of the environmental effect of using this material for strengthening purposes over NC.","concrete; strengthening; UHPC; Strain hardening","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Concrete Structures","",""

(mentor); Quist, J.N. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The CE concept is a booming theme, and the attention on this subject is increasing every year. However, the increasing attention on this theme has not yet been translated into practice within the infrastructure sector to a sufficient degree. While much literature has been published on the topic of CE, no analysis on the identification of barriers and strategies for circular infrastructure assets was conducted prior to this study. To provide a theoretical framework for this thesis, all literature focusing on CE barriers and strategies for the construction sector is systematically analyzed. This theoretical framework consisted primarily of barriers and strategies that were attained from studies on circular buildings (including residential buildings, commercial buildings, and other types of building property), as this theme was most common in the current CE literature. To extend the knowledge of CE, and gain insights into the key barriers and potential strategies for circular infrastructure assets, an in-depth single case study was performed at Schiphol Airport. The view of practitioners and experts within this field was obtained to get a clear overview on the barriers and strategies present in this unexamined sector. According to these practitioners and experts, numerous key barriers and potential strategies within the economic, organizational, sociological, regulatory, technical, and environmental categories are present. The analysis of the interviews resulted in the identification of 24 barriers and 20 strategies for increasing the circularity of infrastructure assets at Schiphol Airport. It was noted that some of the identified barriers and strategies were mentioned more often during the interviews than others. The outdated and conservative nature is strongly interconnected between the most mentioned barriers. They share aspects of outdated institutional factors (strict guidelines &amp; certification requirements) and conservative behavior. Furthermore, the CE approach's unreadiness (low virgin prices and a lack of financial incentives) is frequently the reason why this approach is not yet profitable and, as a result, is not widely used. Although the circular approach is technically feasible, these restrictions withhold the CE from thriving for infrastructure assets. That said, multiple strategies for the enhancement of circular infrastructure assets are identified as well. Commonly stated by the professionals and experts in the field was the enhancement of communication. According to the participants of the interviews, the existence of an information gap between the stakeholders involved in the processes for infrastructure asset construction and maintenance needs to be cleared. In addition, the method of allocating materials to infrastructure assets must be reconsidered. Experts commonly address that by supplying a limited variety of materials and imposing a limit on these materials; the designer is forced into circular thinking. Meanwhile, this thesis partly confirmed previous authors’ analysis of what CE barriers and strategies are for the broader construction sector. The reason is that some barriers and or strategies are applicable to the CE concept in general. For instance, the lacking CE awareness, which forms a great barrier to the implementation of circular infrastructure assets, is present in all industries in which circular novelty plays a part. Thus, it can be stated that, in line with other industries within the construction domain, the infrastructure sector is not yet able to become fully circular due to the existence of numerous barriers. However, by exposing the existence of these barriers, as this study aimed for, these barriers will be given more attention individually, which in turn will lead to a better understanding of how to tackle this issue. Furthermore, the strategies resulting from this thesis will allow for a better, clearer understanding of overcoming these barriers.","Circularity; Circular Economy; construction sector; Infrastructure sector; Barriers; Strategies; Infrastructure assets; Case study; Airports","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Therefore, the existing quay walls require reinforcements. An effective way of reinforcing the structure are underwater anchors, requiring holes in existing sheet piles at the location of significant bending moment. Since this is a new area of expertise, the influence of the hole is still unknown. This report discusses a developed finite element model to study the influence of hole weakening of sheet pile and studies the influence of hole weakening on the sheet pile resistance and behaviour with the discussed model. <br/><br/>The 3DSSI model includes soil modelled by the subgrade reaction model (spring model) the steel sheet pile is modelled with shell elements in the finite element software DIANA FEA. The model includes both physical nonlinear and geometrical nonlinear behaviour and captures the soil-structure interaction. Also oblique bending, which is an existing phenomena of older, existing double U-sheet piles, can be captured with interface elements in the 3DSSI model. Nowadays, sheet piles are also designed using the subgrade reaction model and the sheet pile is modelled as a beam with the appropriate stiffness. The 3DSSI model is able to illustrate the 3D behaviour of the sheet pile, without having to model the soil with solid elements as well. This is beneficial with respect to calculation time. <br/><br/>With the 3DSSI model, the hole weakening of sheet piles can be studied. The influence of different parameters on the sheet pile resistance and behaviour is studied. The parameters studied, based on literature findings, are: hole diameter, hole location (level of the hole in depth), hole spacing (hole centre to centre distance in width), hole in-pan (compression zone) or out-pan (tension zone), sheet pile cross-section class 2 and 3 and oblique bending. <br/><br/>The influence of hole weakening on sheet pile behaviour and resistance is studied by finding in the parameter study for each case the load-displacement curve and from this load-displacement curve, the stiffness is derived. The load-displacement curve and stiffness curve include both steel and soil behaviour. <br/>Resulting from the parameter study, the holes significantly reduce the sheet pile resistance and behaviour. The cases with holes in tension show less reduction in resistance and stiffness reduction. The hole diameter is also influencing the results, but the influence of hole location and hole spacing is relatively small. The failure modes are for holes in compression zone is plasticity around the hole and local buckling in the webs. For holes in tension zone, the failure mode is also plasticity around the hole, but also local buckling in the compression flange. For cases including oblique bending and holes in tension zone do not show local buckling in the compression flange, but in the compression web, due to the inclined neutral axis caused by oblique bending.<br/><br","Sheet pile wall; hole weakening; subgrade reaction model; DIANA FEA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Bidirectional flows are created in the network with the integration of renewable technologies. The electricity network and system operators face many new challenges created due to renewable energy sources. Renewable energy sources are characterized by an intermittent and stochastic character which affects the power production from renewable energy technologies. Thus, the produced energy may pose challenges to the grid when it is higher than demand since the excess power is injected into the grid and it causes overvoltage problems.<br/>BESS can contribute in facing the problems created by renewable energy technologies. They offer environmental benefits, they contribute to the integration of renewable technologies and they enhance grid’s reliability. These factors have as a result an increase in the integration of batteries in the electricity network. This research has as a goal to develop a control and coordination method for multiple BESS in a low voltage distribution network in order to address overvoltage and undervoltage issues caused by high penetration of PV units. There are many control strategies used in order to control the increasing number of batteries so that normal operation of the energy system is sustained. The main control strategies are centralized control, decentralized control and distributed control. <br/>In this thesis study, a coordination control strategy of multiple BESS was developed to address the network's voltage violation issues caused by the high penetration of PV units. The coordination control strategy is based on a consensus algorithm that determines each battery's contribution to the network. The goal of this control strategy is to maintain the voltage within the limits. When a battery is not available due to a state of charge limit violation or maintenance, the amount of power that this battery would contribute under normal operation is distributed equally from the neighboring batteries until the battery becomes available again. This control strategy is a combination of distributed control, as it entails communication between neighboring batteries which share information together, and local control. The developed coordination control strategy is compared to a decentralized control strategy, which is widely used in distribution networks in order to control the contribution of batteries. Moreover, one of the batteries is emulated in the laboratory in order to examine the behavior and contribution of the battery, with the coordination control strategy implemented, in real-time application in comparison to the simulation. <br/>The findings of this thesis study contribute to the research of mitigating voltage limit violations caused by renewable energy technologies by demonstrating the effectiveness and benefits of the proposed control and by providing a comparison of the proposed control to a decentralized control strategy, commonly used in distribution networks for controlling the contribution of BESS, for voltage regulation. Furthermore, the laboratory results contribute in the potential implementation of the proposed control in real distribution networks.<br","BESS; PV Unit; Low Voltage; Distribution; coordination; overvoltage; undervoltage; RES; MATLAB/ Simulink","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The drawback of rough volatility is usually the time needed to compute a volatility surface. We compare three major rough volatility models and compare their ability to fit to the market volatility surface. We implement the rough Bergomi, rough Heston and lifted Heston models <br/>and introduce a fourth model by taking a Nelson-Siegel parameterization for the instantaneous forward variance curve in the rough Bergomi model. We then minimize the volatility surfaces of the models to that of the market and compare these results through minimization time, fit and hedging possibilities. We find that for both Bergomi models, a single volatility surface is seven times faster to compute than for the lifted Heston model, which in turn is five times faster to compute than for the rough Heston model. Minimization times for the rough Heston models are comparable, however significantly higher than for the rough Bergomi models. We also find that the rough Bergomi model is under-parameterised, this is however fixed by the Nelson-Siegel parameterization, which has a minimization error in line with that of both Heston models. Finally, hedging specifically against a parameter rarely improves the outcome, although a hedge against the instantaneous forward variance curve is consistently good and can improve the error between only a delta hedge by 25-50\% throughout all models.","Rough Volatility; Rough Heston Model; Rough Bergomi Model; Volatility Surface; Fractional Brownian Motion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

The water board within which the city is located began to consider new possible water management practices, due to the unsustainability of the current ones. This study aims to investigate how a change of the current paradigm can improve the current approach in water management, shifting from a linear to a water management circular approach, and from command-and-control to adaptive. Starting from the case scenario of Breda, the study considers how through the reuse of management wastewater treatment plant effluent and stormwater, and the application of sewer mining units, it may affect the circularity and adaptability of the system. Then, based on Breda's experience, an attempt is made to investigate the concepts of circularity and adaptability. \\To be able to understand the current water situation and approach in the city of Breda, a water balance for the year 2020 was drafted. The water balance for 2020 for the city of Breda shows a positive value of 50 mm/year. The definitions of circularity and adaptability for a water management system were determined, and for each of the concepts a framework has been developed, to assess the level of circularity and adaptability before and after the interventions. Then, a workshop with local experts in the field was organized. Different strategies of interventions were proposed to them, in order to evaluate their suitability. Then, a final strategy was formulated, where wastewater effluent is employed as irrigation water for agriculture in the south of the municipality, stormwater discharge into wetlands to recharge aquifers and three sewer mining units in the rural area of Breda. These interventions showed a positive effect on the water system, since the volume of water stored in the system has increased, giving an overall better performance of the circularity and adaptability indicators. Moreover, the final strategy shows a better water balance of 100 mm/year. This research aims at creating a better understanding of concepts like circularity and adaptability. The study shows that there is a potential for re-using water to enhance the overall performance of the water system under certain conditions.","Water management; Water recycling; Circularity; Adaptability; Drought; Water shortage; Climate Change; global warming; Uncertainty; Sewer Mining; wastewater effluent; Wetlands; stormwater","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management | Urban Water Engineering","",""

Subsequently, the fitted models were analysed using the Friedman test, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and other metrics. The results indicate that a power law applies in most cases. However, a universal model has not been found, as the best model differs between classification and regression tasks, even though they belong to the power law family.

This has been achieved by running PSM on synthetic data that upholds the unconfoundedness condition, and then comparing these results with measurements obtained from running the algorithm on data with confounding features with varying contribution to other variable values and hiding these features individually or in progressively higher numbers. These results are also then compared to Linear Regression, a generic machine learning algorithm, for the sake of comparison of performance. The results obtained point to the observation that when hiding variables that only contribute to the main effect, treatment effect or treatment propensity calculation respectively, PSM performs with the same error no matter which of the three effects the hidden feature affects, making them equivalent in their error contribution. Additionally, it has also become apparent that in all experimental scenarios used in this work, PSM performed very similarly to Linear Regression and did not seem to offer any advantages over the latter in these specific situations.","Propensity; Causal Inference; Causality; Machine Learning","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

These systems are often grouped with humans in order to take advantage of the unique abilities of both the AI and the human.

While there has been much research concerning the topic of human trust, there is a lack of work done concerning the trust that an artificial agent has toward its human partner. Given that a human must appear trustworthy to an artificial agent in order for that agent to trust him, and that demanding and offering help are important parts of a collaboration, the following research question has been formulated : How does an artificial agent asking a human for advice or help affect that human's trustworthiness ? To answer this research question, an experiment was conducted through an urban search and rescue game using the MATRX Software. Through this game, participants had to collaborate with a robot partner in order to accomplish the task of finding and rescuing 8 victims and delivering them to the correct drop zone. The participants were divided into a control group, who worked alongside a basic rescue robot, and an experimental group, which had a help-seeker robot as a partner. The help-seeker robot differed from the basic robot in its ability to ask the participant for advice, such as asking which room it should search for victims to rescue. Following the experiment, no significant results indicating a positive or negative effect on human trustworthiness by the help-seeker agent's behaviour were found.","Collaborative AI; Human-Computer Interaction; Trustworthiness","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

The goal is to construct a schedule that minimises the total duration (makespan) of the project while satisfying all resource and precedence constraints. RCPSP-Log extends RCPSP by introducing two types of precedence relations OR and BI. OR relations allow a successor to be scheduled when at least one of its predecessors has finished. The BI relation prevents two jobs from running in parallel. The RCPSP is known to be NP-hard, thus the same holds for this extension.<br/><br/>To find solutions to the RCPSP-Log, activities can be assigned a priority value based on a heuristic function. The heuristic function makes use of the critical path method to calculate the latest finishing time (LFT) of an activity. By using the heuristic greedily a feasible sub-optimal solution is generated for a problem instance, which is then used to reduce the size of the instance's CNF encoding.<br/>A maximum satisfiability (MaxSAT) solving algorithm is used to search for a variable assignment for the CNF encoded problem and to prove whether it has an optimal makespan while satisfying all precedence and resource constraints.<br/><br/>The computational results of encoding and solving RCPSP instances from a well-known dataset with both the standard and the reduced encoding show that there is a clear advantage to using a heuristic algorithm, in terms of the time needed to find optimal solutions, to provide a starting point to the SAT solver.","RCPSP; RCPSP-Log; NP-Hard Algorithms; Heuristics; Encoding; SAT solver","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","https://github.com/MelleSch/RP_Code_Results_RCPSP-Log A repository containing the code of the heuristic solver, SAT encoder, and results","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

To achieve this, many different models were proposed, one of which is the causal forest. Causal forest is made up of a random forest, with a different estimation function in the leaf node, which means it suffers from the same problems, like being easy to overfit. The reason why honesty was introduced was to ensure mathematically that forests do not overfit as easily. This research however, only provided preliminary results and no real testing was done in terms of causal inference. In this paper three scenarios are tested where a comparison is made between a causal forest with and without honesty. Based on the results it seems that honesty does indeed help for trees to not overfit. However in a general setting it hurts the model as it only trains with half of the available data. This makes honest causal forest less accurate in general settings where there is not a lot of training data. In a setting where a large amount of data is provided it seems that honesty does not change the performance, meaning it creates a theoretical guarantee against overfitting with no repercussions for the performance.","Causal Inference; Causal Forest; Honesty; Causality","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","https://github.com/MatejHav/causal-methods-evaluation Repository used as the codebase for the obtained results.","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

One recent method for doing this, which provided promising results, is the DragonNet (Shi et al., 2019), which utilises neural networks in order to estimate average treatment effects in populations. The performance of the model, however, was not tested on datasets which contain low amounts of overlap between the treated and non-treated subpopulations, which makes it harder to accurately estimate treatment effects. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to investigate the performance of the DragonNet when used on datasets with (near) overlap violations. This has been done by looking at the mean absolute errors and variances of the estimated treatment effects and comparing these to other models. The results showed that the performance of the DragonNet becomes significantly worse compared to other models when large portions of the population suffer from low overlap. Additionally, the variance of the results also increases in these cases, making the results less reliable. From the obtained results, it can be concluded that it is best to choose another model for treatment effect estimation if relatively large amounts of overlap violations are suspected.<br","dragonnet; causal machine learning; overlap violations; Causal Inference","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

The splitting of tasks is introduced to try and find project schedules that require less overall time to complete. This paper proposes a satisfiability (SAT) encoding for the RCPSP while also allowing tasks to be split. A SAT solver is used to solve the encoded problem instances and compared with the results of a heuristic algorithm. The comparison shows a lower rate of solved instances but found results are in almost all cases more optimal and proof of optimality can be provided.

An interesting question that remains is how the behavior of an agent influences human trustworthiness in a human-agent collaborative setting. The research presented by this paper contributes to the understanding of this area. It investigates a specific behavioral trait using the following hypothesis: friendly behavior of an agent improves human trustworthiness. Here, trustworthiness is broken up in the constructs: ability, benevolence and integrity. <br/><br/>An experiment has been conducted using a collaborative Search and Rescue game. The following behaviors of the participants have been measured: <br/>- Ability: speed and effectiveness;<br/>- Benevolence: communication, willingness to help, agreeableness to advice, responsiveness;<br/>- Integrity: truthfulness.<br/>Furthermore, a likert scale has been used to measure the participants' own perception of their trustworthiness. The experiment is conducted with 20 participants in the control group, where the agent spoke in a neutral manner, and 20 in the experimental group, where the agent instilled empathy, stimulated collaboration, encouraged the participants and was affectionate.<br/><br/>The research has shown a significant improvement in the experimental group only for communication and willingness to help. This gives some indication that a friendly agent only slightly improves the trustworthiness of a human. However, the research has some limitations that might also explain the lack of significant results. Firstly, it is unclear to what extent the measures truly measured the constructs of trustworthiness. Secondly, to create a friendly agent, theories from organizational and social psychology are used, which are mostly focussed on human-human relationships, instead of human-agent relationships. Finally, Some confounding variables may have had an impact, like lag in the game and the participant not properly reading the agent’s messages.<br","Trustworthiness; Artificial Intelligence; Collaboration","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

By rewetting the peat layer, the anaerobic conditions needed to maintain the peat are created. This calls for a different type of built environment in order to prevent the loss of our carbon sink. The study location of this project is Westergouwe in Gouda, which is designated for the building of housing and the soil contains our beloved peat soil. To still gratify the big housing need, a design is made of the neighborhood Westergouwe combining the urban environment with the goals of preserving and growing peat, in an ecologically responsible way. This project answers questions through literature research like: How can carbon be stored in the soil, vegetation, and in the urban environment? How can you build on peat soil without destroying it? And what is the urban ecosystem? Also, an analysis using mapping, expert interviews, and literature research is done of the polder system surrounding Westergouwe, of other environmental problems, and of suitable biotopes within this vision. After the design, is looked at how this design could be implemented in phases and which stakeholders would be involved. This type of design requires long-term planning. Throughout the process, the involvement of local and national governments is key to realizing this design. To transfer the knowledge maintained in this project, a pattern language is made and a method is abstracted. This project is not only applicable to Westergouwe, it could be relevant for a lot of places where peat is present in the soil. But not only that, because of the finiteness of the polder system, this type of design could be relevant for the whole of the western Netherlands. The author hopes that more research is done to continue the project’s search for a landscape-based urban environment that mitigates and adapts to the climate and that this project is used as a framework for further research.","carbon capture and storage; nature inclusive; peat soil","en","master thesis","","","","","","© 2022 Lotte van Oevelen","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","","52.002583, 4.673111"

Our older generation is held responsible for this national problem, but why? Deliberate occupation of the ‘oversized’ family home would be the easiest conclusion, but puts a heavy weight on this part of society. If these empty-nesters are not relocating, as is apparently expected of them for having an abundance of living space, what does this say about their preferences of the living environment? Listening to this generation for the sake of letting this operation of flow in the housing market succeed, is of utmost importance and priority. Instead of creating living environments focused on one generation or target group, the task within this research is to find a way to design inclusive and accessible living environments. Thereby, stagnation could be avoided in the future by this particular cause. After all, a mixture of different generations in the living environment is preferred both by older residents as by the general population. Within this task for diversification of the living environment for the sake of inclusivity, lies a hidden gem: a catalyst for the renovation task. By 2030, insulation of existing dwellings becomes mandatory in Europe for the sake of a climate-neutral society by 2050. When revitalizing existing living environments by means of inclusivity and quality, the climate task could fit perfectly within this picture. Especially these existing living environments are a very important subject, as with this renovation task the Dutch built environment could and probably will visually change tremendously in the upcoming decades. Therefore, the valuation by stakeholders of the current appearance and functioning of living environments up for renovation, are important in the face of physical and emotional heritage. As a large percentage of the Dutch housing stock will be insulated in the upcoming 30 years, these values are of great importance to prevent any loss of potential heritage. Enlarging the lifespan of these living environments by diversification, inclusivity and a high quality of living can therefore be achieved, as is the case for the renovation design of Bijlmerplein, an urban, residential center in Amsterdam. It turns out that it does pay off to take into account stakeholder valuations instead of wrapping the building in a blanket, because renovation can be revitalization rather than insulation.","Heritage & Architecture; Aging; Renovation; Housing; Energy transition; Post-65; Inclusive design; Society; Accessibility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","","52.3138291, 4.9507795"

The Chinese government published new policies to encourage regeneration of the land stock resources as affordable rental housing targeting young people. This study aims to explore how urban regeneration can benefit young graduates’ livability. Specifically, it investigates the possibility to regenerate urban villages as affordable rental housing provisions. In this context, affordable rental housing tackles spatial inequities and should be located in opportunity-rich areas.<br/>To test the assumption that urban villages can be regenerated as affordable rental housing, spatial analysis on multiple scales was conducted and four well-located urban villages were chosen as cases to study. The villages were evaluated based on the indicators from young graduates’ demand analysis, and different governance models were analyzed to explore the possibilities for regeneration. The results shows that the conflict between the private interest in densification and public interest in open space is the main challenge for regeneration, and not only the spatial intervention but also the operation mechanism need to be proposed.<br/>These results suggest that encouraging spontaneous regeneration by combining top-down and bottom-up strategies may be an approach for future regeneration as well as a chance to legalize the informal village settlement. This requires not only the efforts of the village collective but also the support and active participation of the public sector. By improving the public space network and doing some experiments on strategic projects, the regeneration strategy can be tested and applied to other well-located urban villages in Shenzhen, providing more affordable housing options for young graduates.<br","urban regeneration; livability; young graduates; affordable housing; urban village","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Complex Cities","","22.5333, 113.9304"

(mentor); Ibrahimli, N. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","3D building models play an important role in many real-world applications. Different models are suitable for different application scenarios based on their levels of detail. LOD3 models with facade details are crucial for many applications, such as virtual reality and urban simulation. Currently, 3D building models with lower LOD are largely available, but the number of LOD3 models is very limited. Most LOD3 reconstruction methods depend on manual operation, which is very time-consuming. How to automatically reconstruct the detailed facade for building models has remained a problem in computer vision. The problem can be seen as an image processing problem, but how to convert the 2D results into 3D smoothly should also be considered. <br/><br/>In this project, we proposed a method to automatically reconstruct the detailed building models based on the Faster R-CNN. The method starts from a set of street view images, and the results are models with facade elements. A 3D point cloud can be extracted from the images using SfM and MVS, and the camera parameters can also be recovered. We take advantage of the high-quality facade images and parse the facades to detect their bounding boxes. The bounding boxes can match pretty well with the rectangular shape of the facade elements. The 2D facade elements can be added to the 3D building model based on the camera parameters. The process is very efficient and automatic. The regularity of the facade elements will be reserved, making the result more convincing. Our method includes four main steps:  (1) coarse model reconstruction, (2) facade image selection and rectification, (3) facade element detection and regularization, and (4) detailed facade reconstruction. <br/><br/>Experiment results show that our method can produce reliable building models with facade details for many different situations. It can work for both the multi-face building blocks and the street side buildings. Our test shows that the window detection performance is pretty good. The object detection is extremely fast, and the whole pipeline is lightweight and efficient. In theory, the method can also be extended to reconstruct large-scale city models, which means it has broad application prospects.<br","Facade; LOD3; Object detection; 3D Reconstruction; Photogrammetry; Computer Graphics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

However, TH also has several drawbacks, including the formation of recalcitrant compounds, which are anaerobically non-biodegradable and even inhibitory to the downstream AD. Melanoidins produced from the Maillard reaction have been regarded as a representative of such compounds. Theoretically, the production of melanoidins increases with increasing TH temperature.<br/>This study collaborated with TORWASH®, a patented TH technology developed by TNO, aiming to characterise the recalcitrant compounds derived under TORWASH® conditions from 180 - 210 °C. In addition, we investigated the effects of anaerobic pre-digestion on the TH performance, attempting to increase the biogas productivity of digestate. Moreover, we also sought pretreatment methods that could mitigate the production of recalcitrant compounds. By reviewing the studies of Zhang et al. (2020) and other researchers in this field, we found that acidic pretreatments could be the solution. Then, we assumed that the addition of acetic acid and CO2 gas could limit the progression of the Maillard reaction. A laboratory simulation of the TH process was performed on waste activated sludge (WAS) at 180 - 200 °C and anaerobically pre-digested WAS at 180 - 210 °C. The following TH tests with acidic pretreatments were only conducted on WAS at 190 °C.<br/>We found that the production of recalcitrant compounds (soluble humic substances) increased with increasing reaction temperature, corresponding to increased UVA254 and colour formation. Proteins were primarily hydrolysed or denatured during TH, and competition for carbohydrates between the Maillard and caramelisation reactions could occur at 190 °C and above. In addition, TH disintegrated high molecular weight DOM &gt; 1 kDa into low molecular weight DOM &lt; 0.1 kDa, and stronger sludge disintegration occurred at higher reaction temperatures. Moreover, BMP decreased after anaerobic pre-digestion but increased after TH treatment. The liquid fraction of pre-digested WAS could reach an equivalent degree of anaerobic biodegradability as that of WAS when applying a higher reaction temperature.<br/>All acidic pretreatments applied decreased the production of soluble humic substances by 10 %, corresponding to a 13 % decrease in UVA254. CO2 pressurisation at 10 bar could effectively reduce the formation of fulvic-acid like and humic-acid like matter, compared with the untreated sample. The effect of 20 bar CO2 was less pronounced than that of 10 bar CO2, whether or not the samples were pre-added with HAc.","Thermal hydrolysis; Anaerobic pre-digestion; Waste activated sludge; Acidic pretreatment; CO2 pressurisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-06-30","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

According to Schafer (1993), there are only two ways to solve this problem: 1. a global energy crisis, which would eliminate the greatest sources of noise pollution; or 2. research into soundscape atmospheres and a focus on an auditory landscape (Schafer, R., 1993, p.181). The second choice seems to be a more optimistic one.<br/>In this handbook, I will look at the role of noise pollution in the everyday lives of urban dwellers. The main focus here is the urban landscape, psychological well-being, and the relationship to sound perception. Urban planners place too much emphasis on vision, with the other senses playing a limited or non-existent role.

The research begins by reviewing the major policy and project progress in the field of flood mitigation. It turns out that most countries rely heavily on engineering facilities for flood control to hold back floods, ignoring the uncertainty caused by climate change and urban expansion, which is not a long-term effective solution to the flooding problem.<br/>Given the literature review of flood resilience, the result shows that it remains largely unpracticed in contemporary urban planning and design, mainly manifested in the insufficient participation of spatial planning science in flood risk management. Based on Dutch policy systems and planning approaches, the project will evaluate existing flood risk management frameworks, develop mechanisms for stakeholder engagement, explore the most efficient flood adaptation strategies, and provide guidance on how to establish urban flood resilience using design tools and planning approaches. Finally, areas along the Meuse and inland will face climate change with greater confidence.","flood resilience; Flood risk management; spatial planning; Stakeholder engagement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Transitional Territories","","51.1913202, 5.9877715"

Plant growth modelling in particular would enable the analysis of plant structure and behaviour in a customizable, widely applicable and non-destructive manner. Although many data-driven plant reconstruction methods exist, it remains a complex problem due to the intricate branching systems of trees and the need for balancing model soundness with adherence to the often incomplete input data. Modelling plant growth currently proves difficult as well due to the large number of factors involved in the growth process and the level of prior botanical knowledge and/or detailed field data that is often required.<br/><br/>This work uses an automatic MST (Minimum Spanning Tree)-based reconstruction method to obtain tree skeleton models from LiDAR input data. Multiple scans of the same tree, gathered at different years, are related to each other to improve and expand upon the reconstruction. A procedural model is used to simulate the growth in the tree tips using a lobe-based approach and a region-growing algorithm. The growth-based models provide a temporally informed reconstruction that is visually, geometrically and topologically sound. Establishing correspondences in the main structure between timestamps can assist the reconstruction of the tree at a time for which the input data was noisier or incomplete, as well as provide an estimate of the tree's structure in between known data points. This type of reconstruction can be used to both model and study the growth behaviour of trees, for multi-temporal visualisations, and to provide more informed tree models for reconstruction purposes.","Trees; LiDAR; Reconstruction; Modelling; Modeling; Vegetation; Point Cloud; Tree Growth","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

Witnessing the decay of the city excusably provoked the pessimism of the locals as it made them conscious of the fact that their life and pride are degrading. The negative labels associated with decay inevitably seized the general definition and cognition. However, deterioration can only be understood as one of the superficial readings of the phenomenon of decay. As depicted in many arts and literature, decay does have its only poetics, aesthetics and intrinsic values that embellish and complement the urban environment and memories. Meanwhile, the degeneration of architecture with symbolic values, be it an intentional or inadvertent incident, would implicate significant political messages and ideas to the society. In the case of Trieste, the meanings of this natural (and occasionally artificial) process are still to be explored and discussed. Is there a possibility that decay could be considered a constructive phenomenon that can sublime as a form of regeneration for the ageing city? The project would then be an experiment that attempts to embrace the material processes, aesthetics and the spatial and programmatic potentials informed by the phenomenon of decay. It searches for alternative answers to the preestablished architectural typologies, meanings and purposes through rethinking on the current preservation approaches and alternative possibilities in dealing with ruins and abandoned buildings in Trieste. As a result of the quick and efficiency-oriented manufacture in the industrial past, architectural obsolescence brought in new artificial materiality and ways of decomposition to the discourse of decay, which are unprecedented in the pre-industrial time. The expansion of the definition of decay implies the misfit of conventional treatments on modern ruins in the post-industrial era. Delving into the phenomenon of decay may introduce a different set of aesthetic/tectonic languages and spatial qualities to the decaying waterfront of Trieste.","Decay; Ruination; Abandonment; Obsolescence; Reuse; Post-industrialism","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","45.636187453161995, 13.76978401897307"

Therefore the following question rises what suitable feature detection, feature extraction/description, and transform model estimation methods can be used to align sketches to their corresponding painting. This paper provides a proof of concept by taking a manual feature detection, and a histogram of orientations as a feature description.

In this paper, conventional machine learning algorithms are used to classify reading activities, captured by eye tracking devices. Multiple data pre processing methods and filters are used to extract fixations out of the raw data captured by the eye-trackers. Out of these fixations, a total of 16 features are used to classify activities. Using the optimal configurations found, a 0.99 user dependent and a 0.76 user independent score is obtained. All obtained results are compared to results obtained by peers performing similar research, who use either a different data set or deep learning instead of conventional machine learning. The papers using deep learning had a vastly strong performance for all user dependent evaluations, but performed poorer in the user independent evaluation. Overall, conventional machine learning performed better on user independent evaluation, where this paper obtained the best results for user independent evaluation, most likely due to the fact that Japanese reading material was used, which has very distinctive reading directions.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

By shedding light firstly on the specific material properties needed, the method of glass foaming is chosen to be investigated, as the means to provide an open porous network that can incorporate large amounts of waste into its recipe.<br/><br/>An experimental approach has been designed to explore the parameters related to the mixture, manufacturing process affecting the glass foam’s microstructure and potential biofilm formation by producing a total of 22 samples in the Glass lab in Stevin lab, TU Delft. These specimens were not foamed at once, but gradually being tested first of all, microscopically, to reveal the porosity network and secondly, with a series of quick tests related to their hydraulic performance, providing feedback for the next batch of samples regarding the most promising recipes to be further explored. All the samples were tested for their water absorption, evaporation rate and frosting resistance, while only the higher-scored specimens were put under test for moss-growth and compressive strength.<br/><br/>Apart from the experimental analysis, the next steps towards a product development were also explored by setting the bioreceptive design principles for manufacturing the meso-scale surface. Limitations in adjusting these guidelines to the way glass-foam is produced are addressed with possible solutions as suggestions for further experimentation. In addition, an application catalogue was composed as schematic recommendations to showcase the potential of bio-host glass. Combining this idea to the material science, these applications were also approached from an engineering view to analyze the material properties’ specific demands per product. This tool, can prove to be beneficial both in the hands of the future designer and material researcher to have a starting point on what needs to be further developed, depending on the chosen product out of bioreceptive glass-foam.<br/><br/>Taking the most immediately feasible example of a façade tile, based on the findings of the aforementioned analysis, during the last part of this project, a methodology for designing and implementing the new material into the urban environment is proposed. By informing the design of the macro-scale with weather data, precipitation levels can be exploited, in order to provide the maximum water content for the benefit of bioreceptivity.<br/>Therefore, the novelty of this thesis, aspires by providing a holistic approach, based on the knowledge obtained both in the literature review and the conducted experiments, to stir not only bio-growth on our cities, but also innovative thinking and exploration on ways to combat the increasing landfill waste.","glass foam; Microstructure; bioreceptivity; recycling; glass; Building Envelope; product development; Facade design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","",""

In experiments, we validate that this method can significantly improve the aesthetic quality of generated images regardless of the dataset size and training length, however the use of smaller datasets comes with a cost of reduction in the image diversity and novelty in the output images. The aesthetic bias towards certain contexts can also deteriorate the diversity and affect the model evaluations. On the other hand, no significant relationship has been found regarding the training length, however this could possibly be due to instabilities that happen during the model convergence progress.","Artificial Intelligence; Generative Adversarial Network; Crowdsourcing; Aesthetic experience; Human Centered Design","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

Using a mixed-methods analysis of data, gathered from participants after using Sam, six themes were identified that could provide an insight into these eases and difficulties. The identified themes were conversations feel unnatural, conversations feel natural, clarity towards the user, comfortable to talk, ease of replying and conversations felt impersonal. Recommendations were given for each team on both what to possibly improve and what to leave unchanged. Though users were positive about talking to Sam in general, there still was room for improvement.","mHealth; Conversational Agents; Perfect Fit; AI Acceptance; Thematic Analysis","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

Standard techniques like collaborative filtering exploit user similarities to find the recommendations assuming that similar users are likely to be interested in the same items.

Recent studies indicated that simple RS could outperform the state-of-the-art RS. Therefore our paper contributes by analyzing the performance of a novel approach to RS - collaborative filtering that uses a total variation graph regularizer. We show that total variation can outperform its predecessor collaborative filtering by reducing the root mean squared error by 4.68%. However, further experiments with top-n recommendations indicated that traditional collaborative filtering could recommend more relevant content than the total variation, which is supported by a 2.20% increase in precision. The results indicate that total variation alone does not add more information to the RS to show noteworthy improvements to existing traditional baselines. However, building on discoveries that even some of the state-of-the-art RS cannot outperform well-defined baselines, a 4.68% increase in accuracy reveals the potential of RS supported by graph regularization.<br","recommender system; graphs; total variation; collaborative filtering; graph recommender systems","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

Equality saturation is a method of superoptimization using rewrite rules and e-graphs. A rewrite rule defines a piece of code that can be rewritten as another part while keeping equal behavior. This is added to an e-graph, a data structure which is able to express a lot of equal programs efficiently using e-nodes and e-classes. Egg is a general equality saturation superoptimizer developed in Rust, which has been the basis of multiple extensions. This research first aimed to validate claims made by the creators of egg which stated that rebuilding improved equality saturation. Secondly, the research aimed to evaluate the performance of egg when supplying a different amount of rewrite rules. The research found that egg indeed does improve equality saturation, with an 88× speedup for a part of the algorithm as claimed by the creators, but a claim of 21× overall speedup is an overestimate, as an overall speedup of between 16.4× and 17.4× was achieved. The second part shows that providing egg with extra unused rewrite rules slows the algorithm down, although the slowdown seems to decrease when the size of the program increases. The second part also tried to draw a conclusion on adding rewrite rules which will be applied indirectly via multiple other rewrite rules, called implied rewrite rules. Two tests indicated a speedup, but another indicated a slowdown. This means it is unknown if adding implied rewrite rules is beneficial, as no general conclusion could be drawn. Therefore, egg seems to benefit from removing unused rewrite rules, and might benefit from adding implied rewrite rules.","superoptimization; equality saturation; egg","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

A promising technique to circumvent this problem is tabular data synthesis (i.e., the generation of fake tabular data that statistically resembles the original data). However, the state-of-the-art tabular data synthesis model, CTAB-GAN, fails at robustly imitating global data dependencies and underperforms when column orders get permuted. CTAB-GAN internally uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) which limits the model’s performance due to a strictly non-global data perspective during iterative training phases. To address this limitation, this paper proposes FCT-GAN which leverages the Fourier Neural Operator to learn global dependencies in the frequency domain. Specifically, it enhances CTAB-GAN by replacing the CNN of the discriminator with a four-layered two-dimensional Fourier Neural Operator. As a consequence of FCT-GAN’s global nature and cross-column relation robustness, it outperforms CTAB-GAN and additionally offers the column permutation invariant property. The evaluation of FCT-GAN on five datasets shows that the generated data, remarkably resembles the real data and reveals an increase in accuracy, by up to 19% for five machine learning algorithms independent of data column order, compared to CTAB-GAN.","GAN; Data synthesis; Tabular data; Fourier space; Global dependencies","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

Battery depreciation is predominantly stimulated by cyclic degradation and thus incurred costs are compared by simulating degradation curves for different battery storage systems in terms of chemistry and capacity. Costs are calculated by applying battery models to the control algorithm proposed by Norbu et al. (2021), which factors in cyclic degradation using the rainflow counting algorithm.

(mentor); van der Spoel, W.H. (graduation committee); Huijbregts, Z. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In this thesis the passive humidity control of indoor air is laid under review. This is primarily interesting for museum rooms, where strict requirements apply to the indoor air humidity. Passive humidity control is promising to contribute to stabilizing the relative humidity levels in a room. <br/><br/>Besides, the use of passive humidity control can potentially reduce energy demand for (de)-humidification, and reduce HVAC dimensions as a consequence. This work has zoomed in on the (de)-humidification of air lead through a packed bed with silica gel beads. Silica gel is very promising to use as a buffer material for humidity control as a result of its high hygroscopic capacity, or slope of sorption isotherm.<br/><br/>The work started with uptake rate measurements on different silica gel samples, referred to as Experiment 1. This has yielded adsorption and desorption isotherm between 20 and 80 %RH. The obtained isotherms provide insight in the sorption capacity of different samples, as well as the presence of sorption hysteresis.<br/><br/>Samples with promising sorption and desorption behaviour were selected to include in an experiment with a packed bed. In this experiment, referred to as Experiment 2, silica gel was contained in a packed bed (column) and exposed to cyclic input: alternating high and low levels of relative humidity, using a step function. Both short (1h/1h) as well as long (8h/16h) cycles are executed in the experiment. In both types of experiments, significant dehumidification and humidification of air in the packed bed was measured.<br/><br/>Next to experiments, a numerical model of the packed bed is developed. The results of this model are compared to experimental data from literature and to the experimental data obtained in Experiment 2. The model proves to be able to simulate the course of both temperature and humidity of outlet air exiting the packed bed in a reliable way. The main discrepancy between model and experimental results is found in the response time of the model: it reacts faster to changing inlet compared to measurements. Furthermore the model is sensitive to the inputted isotherm polynomial, RH(w). This polynomial describes the equilibrium of gaseous water in the air and adsorbed liquid water in the silica gel. This equilibrium applies at the interface of air and silica gel surface.<br/><br/>Experiment 2 has shown silica gel is able to both adsorb and desorb water in the humidity range of 40 to 60 %RH. An important observation in the long runs of Experiment 2 is that more water is adsorbed than desorbed in the Ąrst cycles. Two issues can be mentioned to explain this: the samples can experience ŠprimaryŠ hysteresis: some water is permanently retained in silica gel during the Ąrst adsorption/desorption cycle. This is a plausible explanation for the difference in primary and secondary isotherms. The other potential explanation is sway-in behaviour: it takes some time before the effect of initial conditions is eliminated in a cyclic experiment. In this case, it is possible that some water is stored in the deeper layers of a silica bead. The moisture uptake and release by silica gel converges to an equal value.<br/><br/>The performance in buffering moisture is expressed in the Moisture Buffering Value (MBV) in [g/m3/%RH]. This MBVτ accounts for the time period of the expected humidity fluctuations. The maximum, or theoretical, MBV∞ is derived from the equilibrium isotherm. For a given time period of the expected humidity fluctuations, the part of the hygroscopic capacity of silica gel that is effectively used is expressed as:<br/>ξeffective = (MBVτ / MBV∞) · ξtheoretical (1)<br/><br/>The MBVτ is determind based on experimental results in this project. The numerical PGC model can serve as a tool to simulate MBV (and ξeffective) for different geometries of the silica gel container and different humidity input.<br/><br/>Concluding, silica gel is well able to reduce Ćuctuations in relative humidity of indoor air. It is important that the silica gel is well reachable by indoor air. Uniform utilization of the silica gel will increase the effective part of the (theoretical) hygroscopic capacity, ξeffective in [kg/m3], of the silica gel. It is best to avoid long lengths of silica, since the effectiveness of ŠupperŠ silica gel is reduced.<br/><br/>Relative humidity fluctuations can occur either due to changes in absolute humidity (hygric loads) or due to temperature Ćuctuations in a room. If relative humidity fluctuations are due to changes in absolute humidity, performance of the packed bed could be improved by cooling the silica during adsorption (dehumidification of air) and heating during desorption (humidification of air). Energy demand for temperature control of the silica gel should be limited, to not mitigate the profits in energy demand for passive humidity control.","passive; indoor climate; moisture buffering; museum","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

We propose a workaround for the latency through tactile simulation, which can bypass the requirement by having the user interact with locally simulated force feedback instead of real ones. A real-time material estimation method is required to create such a simulation, as it needs material information such as friction and tactile texture. We, therefore, investigate whether material is estimable from point cloud scans since it provides readily available environmental data. We also explore how friction and tactile texture could be extracted from the material. Past material estimation methods rely heavily on point intensity; however, most existing point clouds do not have intensity information. Therefore, we study whether mocking intensity information could be sufficient, exchanging it with grayscale. The results demonstrate that without point intensity, the material estimation method can only discern object colour and not material properties. This finding implicates the importance of intensity and suggests future exploration of the viability of material estimation with intensity data for indoor objects.","Tactile Internet; Point cloud; Material Properties","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

However, the current state of microbiome analysis represents a significant challenge for machine learning algorithms. Datasets of microbiome sequences are often characterized by a regime of large dimensionality and relatively few labels, making it difficult for a model to discriminate features from random noise and avoid overfitting. It is, therefore, paramount to reduce the dimensionality of the input data while preserving their structure and information for a model to properly learn from them. K-mer frequency vectors and learnable representations through encoders are some of the embedding methods that have been proposed in literature to reduce the dimensions of the input space for machine learning algorithms operating on biological sequences. This work aims to compare how various embedding techniques influence the performance of a downstream disease detection task from microbiome sequencing data. In particular, the research shows that k-mer frequency vectors lead to better classification metrics (AUC = 0.88) compared to NeuroSEED embeddings (AUC = 0.76) on euclidean space. The work also presents how the classification problem formulation is critical to improving the overall disease detection performance.","Microbiome; Machine Learning; Disease detection","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

To test the feasibility of using these deep learning models, this paper answers the question: Can a long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) be used for gaze-based activity recognition?

While traditional, permissionless blockchains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano are very popular, they are currently unable to provide trust and privacy on the network. To solve these issues, many new, permissioned blockchain technologies have been implemented, including Hyperledger Fabric. Although Hyperledger Fabric has proven to be highly successful in providing trust and privacy through the use of identities, channels, and private data collections, one of its major drawbacks is the lack of a flexible and scalable access control system. Currently, access control decisions have to be built into each smart contract individually, which can cause many vulnerabilities and prevent access policies to be updated dynamically.<br/><br/>This research aims to answer the research question “How can secure access control in Hyperledger Fabric be guaranteed by combining multiple ID’s, attributes, and policies with the components that regulate access control?”. To answer this question, the access control system currently used by Hyperledger Fabric is first completely analyzed. Next, a new implementation is proposed that builds upon the existing solution but provides users and developers with easier ways to make access control decisions based on combinations of multiple ID's, attributes, and policies. This solution is then implemented using the smart contract technology of Hyperledger Fabric, which allows it to easily be deployed to existing Hyperledger Fabric networks. Finally, the performance impact of this proposed implementation is analyzed, and new areas of research are proposed that can potentially be explored in future papers.<br/><br/>At the end of this research, it was concluded that it is possible to combine multiple ID's, attributes, and policies with the help of Hyperledger Fabric's smart contract technology. Furthermore, it could be seen that the performance impact for real-world applications is negligible compared to the insecure case of always providing access to a resource without performing access control.","Blockchain; Access Control; Hyperledger Fabric","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

Therefore, the latter perspective needs to be thoroughly studied as well. This paper has investigated how an AI directing the human can affect human trustworthiness. So far, the directability has been studied as a notion on its own without being linked to trust or its effects on human-AI relationships. For this research, subjective and objective measurements have been used to assess the effects of an AI directing the human in joint activity. In order to quantify the human trustworthiness and assess the possible changes, an experiment has been carried out where participants played a Search &amp; Rescue game developed in the MATRX software. The human's trustworthiness has been calculated using the ABI model and a questionnaire.

In such approach, only the basic relationships among different organizations and places are being constructed, meaning that this top-down study could not truly reflect ones’ potential experience in the city. To go beyond this limitation, I seek for an approach that aims to construct a sensational understanding of the city from an outsider’s point of view, which is an outsider of the city as well as a strange outsider from the typical outsiders that study through scientific approaches. Through the sensational understanding, what could happen in the city and what the city could be like could be defined. I studied Thessaloniki through Archaeology of Nostalgia. Nostalgia refers to a process of recalling a sensational experience of an individual, which defines ones’ intimate relation between objects and experiences beyond the logical relation of functionality. Archaeology, on the other hand, refers to the study of material culture, like of mementos, to reveal the potential experience associated with different objects. Based on the series of Archaeological speculations, it reveals different potential experiences that are bound to the objects in Thessaloniki, in particular the various situations, interactions, tensions, and visions, hence defining a sensational interpretation besides scientific interpretation. The research starts with speculating the postcards, suggesting the idea of an imaginary reality of the city, which provides the basic ground to study the city away from the limitations of reality such as the location and time. Also, it leads to the understanding that each object suggests multiple experiences that one may have, such as one could see a fountain as a ruin, a public facility, religious object, etc. In order to generate a more comprehensive interpretation of the city, additional objects from the reality are introduced in each phase of archaeological speculations by association, like a segregated situation could associate the segregated old train station. Furthermore, the additional objects also suggest multiple experiences, which allow more possibilities for speculation. From the above concepts, I further developed the main drawings and the Modi Operandi models based on intuition, which resulted in an unpredictable combination of objects and the deconstruction of reality. Through a sequence of speculation, interplays of the different experiences that are embedded in various objects, potential situations, interactions, tensions, and visions have been revealed in the drawings. An imaginary reality of what could have happened in Thessaloniki emerged as a sensational interpretation of the city. This exercise could be a medium to rethink reality in terms of urbanism, usages of space, and architecture, etc. It also questions the approach in understanding the complexity of a city, and the archetype of Thessaloniki and different objects in what they should be.","Archaeology; Nostalgia; Parade","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Borders and Territories","",""

A virtual coach does not cost as much time and money as a real coach and would thus be beneficial in combination with a virtual smoking cessation application. Therefore, the reasons for preferring to use a questionnaire or virtual coach were studied in this research. Through three questionnaires, 500 participants have indicated their experience with a virtual coach Sam, helping them to prepare to quit smoking. Based on questions about their preference for a virtual coach or a questionnaire, seven themes have been identified. Most of the themes were connected to making the activities proposed by the virtual coach more appealing and therefore the intervention more effective. All in all, the most important aspects of accepting a virtual coach for smoking cessation had to do with the proposed content by the virtual coach.","Virtual coach; Guided intervention; eHealth; Chatbot; smoking cessation support","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

The simplified problem is converted into a fixed point problem by considering a Poincar´e map which can be solved using Brouwer’s fixed point theorem.

Today computational practices in architecture are being used to control indeterminacy and achieve the optimal instead of embodying it into practice.

One of the methods to improve the performance of these machines is active vibration control(AVC) which can help to achieve faster transient responses. One of the ways to achieve this is better controllability which means more actuators to control more modes. These actuators are mostly Piezo transducers in AVC and each group of actuators needs a high voltage amplifier. At some point, the number of amplifiers will be limited by factors such as volume or mass, so if the group of actuators can share an amplifier, that would be beneficial. This can be achieved with time-division multiplexing(TDM). This method in combination with AVC is researched in this thesis. The most important aspects are performance comparison to conventional systems without multiplexing. First, some simulations are done, to show that the TDM is a feasible solution, secondly, a setup is built to check performance and validate the simulations.","Tdm; Multiplexing; Avc; Active Vibration Control; Piezoelectric actuators","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

De werkloosheid in Rotterdam-Zuid is groot. Het probleem is zo groot, dat al in 2011 een nationaal programma (Nationaal Programma Rotterdam Zuid, NPRZ) werd opgestart, om aandachtswijken sterker en veerkrachtiger te maken. De Tarwewijk in Rotterdam-Zuid is zo’n aandachtswijk; werkzaamheid, opleidings- en inkomensniveau zijn laag. Om de achterstand in te kunnen lopen moeten opleidingsniveau, arbeidsparticipatie, woonkwaliteit en de wijkeconomie omhoog.

De nieuwe maakindustrie moet toekomstgericht zijn (circulair, ‘customer made’ en kleinschalig). Er is behoefte aan kleinere, flexibel inzetbare ruimtes en gedeelde voorzieningen. Gemeenschappelijk gebruik van machines en werkplaats maakt de ruimte betaalbaarder en stimuleert de samenwerking. De schaalgrootte/omvang en de logistiek moeten passen binnen het netwerk/weefsel van de Tarwewijk. De programmering moet aansluiten bij de doelgroep; een samenspel van werk en leren met begeleiding. Lokaal ambachtschap, waarbij talenten, praktische kennis en vaardigheden gestimuleerd worden zijn belangrijker dan opleidingsniveau. Er moeten mogelijkheden zijn voor het geven van cursussen en workshops. Het programma moet inspirerend en vernieuwend zijn (circulaire economie, vermindering van emissie, gebruik van nieuwe technologie). Horecagelegenheid moet zorgen voor verblijven.

That is why this research will focus on building a dependency graph for Debian's package manager and finding out which are the most widely used packages. What separates this research from previous related works, is the addition of a time component to the graph. This will be in the form of a timestamp of the release date for each version of a package. This allows for extensive traversal of the graph, which can also be based on time periods. By doing so, no transitive dependencies should be missed.

Secure, long-distance communication is vital to the safe and reliable operation of industrial feedback control. Utilising public networks as a medium is often cost-effective at the risk of a security breach. Current industrial feedback control systems generally utilise end-to-end encryption to communicate control signals and gains securely. Data has to be decrypted for processing. Homomorphic encryption allows for manipulation of encrypted data. This eliminates the need for decryption to update controller states and calculating control effort. Partially Homomorphic Encryption supports either multiplication or addition of encrypted values, whereas Fully Homomorphic Encryption allows for both. Besides being flexible, Fully Homomorphic Encryption schemes are thought to be quantum safe. Unfortunately, Fully Homomorphic Encryption schemes are computationally expensive limiting practical applications. This thesis presents an enhanced version of the of the popular Fully Homomorphic Encryption scheme by Gentry. The encryption scheme is enhanced through the introduction of three alterations. New notation is introduced that streamlines its description. The main functions that compose the encryption scheme are all replaced with analytical equivalents. The so called reduced cipher is introduced. Rewriting the encryption scheme using the improved notation, analytical functions and reduced cipher leads to a more computationally and memory efficient implementation. The alterations make the encryption more suitable for implementation on Field Programmable Gate Arrays which decreases compute time. Such an implementation is presented and used to demonstrate the efficacy of the enhanced encryption scheme.","Fully Homomorphic Encryption; Feedback control; FPGA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","","52.001889, 4.371667"

A more socio-economically diverse population partly contributes to this. Gentrification makes wealthier residents move into the neighbourhoods in a short period of time. Yet, it causes a decrease in affordable housing and a chance of the disappearing of physical and social neighbourhood identity. Which means that current, less wealthy residents no longer feel attached to the place and that wealthier population groups want to settle in increasing numbers. This demonstrates unsustainable urban development by creating a re-segregated neighbourhood. <br/><br/>This thesis examines if and how urban design can contribute to a socially sustainable way of urban development for the improvement of liveability and the creation of a stable socio-economically diverse population with a preserved and reinforced neighbourhood identity. By research and design three important phases of the course of gentrification related to urban design are established. The urban approach to these phases forms the starting points for redesign: Stabilise the amount of social housing for socio-economically diverse inhabitants, create vibrant, liveable and stayable public spaces designed for slow traffic and preserve or reinforce the typical economic program of small-scale enterprises with affordable products. These are placed in current, upgraded axes with potential for liveliness and in developable public spaces with a reduced liveability. Fitted into current broken program routes and future urban development in the vicinity creating resilient urban design. The design is a hypothesis for improving social sustainability based on urban design. Because of this focus, much of the problem of (extreme) gentrification is left aside. Policy-making on urban renewal and responding to trends in housing requirements play a major role in these unsustainable urban developments.","liveability; neighbourhood identity; socio-economic diversity; sustainable urban development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","","51.914543, 4.438194"

Visiting a museum is about the visitor. Without them, what would be the point of putting a collection on display? Exhibitions are only as relevant as they are experienced to be. In line with this thought, the graduation project presented in this thesis centres on design for museum visitor experience enhancement. Specifically, the usefulness of digital technologies in allowing visitors to experience a museum in new valuable ways is focused on as an emerging key driver for museum experience design. A conceptual framework was proposed for (re-)designing museum exhibitions to expand the visitor experience, enabled by technological add-on features. The applicability of this guiding framework by exhibition designers in the field was illustrated with a proof of concept, developed for the case of a fictional museum exhibition on pre-Columbian adornment artefacts. These results were achieved through a design process consisting of phases of contextual research, practical research, development, evaluation and discussion. In the contextual research phase, the involved stakeholders were identified and described, and studies were conducted on the principles of museum experience, the potential uses for digital technologies in enhancement, the role of gamification in effectuating visitor participation in tech-enabled learning interactions, the state of the art of digital technologies considered for the development of add-on features, and finally the financial confines and dependencies to development typical for the museum sector. The practical research activities, these being an observational study in a museum and a generative session with museum visitors, served to validate prior findings and complement these with additional insights gathered. The proposed conceptual design framework and corresponding proof of concept would be developed through a bottom-up 'Research through Design' process, iteratively building upon knowledge acquired through progressive development. The proposed designs would be evaluated with the involvement of target stakeholders, contributing to further validation of the proposed designs as well as additional considerations for concept design processes. Further recommendations for development of the proposed designs and for exhibition design more generally, as well as the limitations of the study presented in the thesis, are presented as a follow-up. The project was concluded by stating the need for the proposed framework to be used by exhibition makers in real-life design settings in order to learn more about potential adjustments to the framework to better support exhibition design processes.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Music marvel is a building where visitors can discover music in different ways. It includes two concert halls, a large recording studio and spaces where artists can rehearse or teach. In the design, the concert halls consist of a small one (150 people) to give starting artists a chance to perform. Then there is a large concert hall for more famous artists which, depending on the set-up, can seat 800-1500 people. The large concert hall is a new type of concert hall in which transparency and versatility are the two most important characteristics that distinguish it from the rest of the halls in the Hague and its surroundings. It is a hall that is focused on amplified music but where the performance has no limits due to the hall. The hall is characterised by its supporting structure, which also makes its experience unique. <br/><br/>This makes for a building that brings the various themes in the world of music under one roof.

AI-assisted monitoring could provide support to anesthesia assistants in their task of patient monitoring, by making predictions on the future occurrence of deviating events in the vital parameter values of the patient. As AI-assisted monitoring would come close the profession of anesthesia assistants, this explorative, qualitative research investigates the attitude of anesthesia assistants towards the use of AI in their task of patient monitoring. Furthermore, it investigates the motivational factors that are important for their motivation in their monitoring task as well as the expected impact of AI on their motivation. This design-based research subsequently describes how these results are incorporated into the development of an educational module about AI and motivation for anesthesia assistants. Gaining as well as giving insight in the motivation of anesthesia assistants is important, as their motivation is of impact on their professional behaviour while their decisions and actions are directly related to the safety of the patient. <br/><br/>Through literature research and semi-structured interviews, it was found that among anesthesia assistants there is little knowledge on the possibilities of AI at the OR, but that their attitude towards AI-assisted monitoring is positive as long as only suggestions are given. Only two out of eight anesthesia assistants are cautiously positive towards the possibility of AI to automate the monitoring process. Furthermore, it was found that the motivational factors of autonomy, relatedness, competence, self-efficacy, and self-actualisation are all important to very important in the motivation of anesthesia assistants. Overall, none of these factors stands out in being most or least important. The expected impact of AI on these motivational factors among anesthesia assistants varies from negative to positive and is highly dependent on the form of AI-assisted monitoring. As various forms of interrelatedness between all these motivational factors are identified by the anesthesia assistants, specific to their working practice and environment, the impact on one motivational factor might indirectly also impact others. <br/><br/>These results on attitude and motivation are incorporated in the design of an educational module for anesthesia assistants. The module consists of two parts. One part regarding AI-assisted monitoring and one part regarding the motivational factors that are important for their motivation and the impact of AI on motivation. Design requirements by the anesthesia assistants, as well as an expert validation by an anesthesia educator, are used to finalise the design of the module. This module can help anesthesia assistants to develop awareness and understanding of how AI-assisted monitoring, in the form of giving suggestions, can support them in their patient monitoring task. Furthermore, it helps them to develop awareness and understanding on their own motivation and the impact that the use of AI-assisted monitoring may have on their motivation, guiding them towards becoming deliberate professionals.","Artificial intelligence; anesthesia monitoring; Operating room; Patient Monitoring; Attitude; Motivation; Design-based research; deliberate professional; educational module","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences | Science Communication","",""

Aging society, political changes within the healthcare system and the perception towards aging have led to my graduation topic: Bridging the gap – connected by meeting. The cur-rent way of building for elderly is focusing more on individuality and practicality which is leading towards segregation between elders and the society and therefore do not meet the needs and wishes of elders who want to live in a more included and selfreliant environment. Therefore, elders feel neglected by authorities, family and distanced from society. This is partly resulting in social isolation for some elders while they still have the will to participate in society. The feeling of isolation must be counteracted. For this reason, it is my goal to develop a new housing concept where elders feel more engaged with the social network in the neighborhood. The design must ensure that elders feel encouraged to go outside, or at least have a view on activities around the building to meet others from within their private zone. Because during the interviews I often heard that elders (mainly 80+) who are less mobile and more home bound have a great value the space around their house. The design of a new housing concept does not solve all the problems, the urban network around the building must be considered in the design as well. By creating an environment where people meet each other, look after each other and elders are seen as equals and can participate in this social network. A community where elders can live happily in old age.","interaction; visual perception; encounters; elderly; elderly housing; community","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

This is done by connecting new facade elements to the existing building as a second skin. While preserving the existing typology of the buildings and emphasizing the current rhythm and small ornaments of the portico houses. The script tries to implement different sizes, because then it would be useful to renovate several porch houses at the same time. This creates more variation within the different facades and makes the total renovation time shorter and more cost-efficient. The script could potentially display the total number and dimensions of the various new facade panels, which would speed up the fabrication and assembly process.","renovation; Computational Design; retrofit walk-up apartments; modular facade","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","Architectural Engineering","52.090556, 4.369722"

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The Erasmus Medical Center (EMC) campus is working on an intensification of functions for the new Masterplan of 2050. Since densification is only possible vertically due to the enclosed location, there is an increase of 5000 employees and only 650 physical parking spaces, leading to lessened accessibility by car. Simultaneously, vehicles are restricted from the city itself to make Rotterdam more livable by taking away car lanes and decreasing speed. While moving through the city, recent patient journey research shows, that patients are worried until they reach the main entrance and do not feel relieved by the current way of traveling towards the Erasmus MC. These findings lead to researching which mobility scenarios are possible and suitable for inclusive accessibility to the future EMC Campus and how spatial interventions can relieve stress during the last mile in Rotterdam and arrival at the masterplan site. <br/><br/>This is done by assessing perceptions on urban stress and restoratives and digitally researching scenarios by the use of personas. Personas are created to react to mobility aspects, resulting in a multi criteria analysis. The motivations summarized are basic needs, personality lifestyle preference, disability, and stress and restorative level. A procedural model in Houdini of the mobility network of Rotterdam, including future scenarios, is used to assess the behavior of the created personas traveling towards the EMC Campus by calculating the weighted sum per route. The output of the simulations shows the taken route, the chosen mode, and the stress and restorative level at arrival from specific personas. The most suitable and preferred routes based on the 4 motivations show significant differences in stress and restorative levels. Spatial aspects in the city influence mental health and design requirements can be advised to minimize urban stress. Previously collected city restoratives and urban stressors are being evaluated by 65 participants in an online survey. Doing stressor and restorative spatial implementations in the simulation shows how personas prefer different routes to potentially improve their wellbeing. Design requirements of the Masterplan can be based on how certain personas perceive the environment differently from others. For people approaching the building by car, it could be more beneficial for the stress and restorative level to have a more monochrome facade and for people approaching the building by slow traffic to have a fine grain facade. The digital model gives a perspective on where the individual personas approach the campus, which influences the master plan differently from all angles. What do persona based design requirements on urban stressors and restoratives derived from digital simulations mean to the design of our future cities?","Travel behaviour; Multi Criteria Analysis; Procedural Modeling; Urban Stressors; Restoratives; Personas; Mobility; Healthcare","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","","51.9100181, 4.4659629"

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","When I first visited the site of the project, the Binckhorst in The Hague, I noticed the scatteredness of the place. Everything is disconnected and hard to be reached by foot or bicycle. In fact, most functions are oriented to cars, trucks, and industrial machines. What is particularly interesting, however, is that there are a number of hidden activities. Especially in the southern part, the Binckhaven, there are many creative places to discover, for example artists at work in their studios or the first indoor surf pool in Europe. In my eyes, it is a shame that most people only see these places passing by on Binckhorstlaan and few take the time to explore Binckhorst. At the moment, many places are being demolished and replaced with high-rise buildings for residential use. While I agree that it is necessary to build a dense residential neighbourhood to meet the high housing demand in the Hague, a place to gather should be provided from an early stage to create an attractive and safe environment for these new residents. Otherwise, there is a risk that they will be isolated in their homes, leading to loneliness and an anonymous and boring neighbourhood. In the “Music district“ people can connect over music by practising their own music, performing in front of neighbours and friends, and going to concerts together. The spaces around the buildings are conceptualized as an integral part of the design, resulting in a mix of different urban moods in the interstitial spaces, such as a lively street, a recreational waterside boulevard, a calm inner courtyard, and a plaza for outdoor events and gathering. Therefore, the building is not monofunctional as a concert venue but serves as a public meeting space with multiple shared spaces indoors and outdoors. This will lead to a future-proof activation of the neighbourhood and a resilient community. <br/>The Music District is located at the entrance of the Binckhaven. By building bridges over to the other canal side, the existing activities there will become accessible for pedestrians and bicycles. Combined with new functions, and several other cultural districts, the music district will form the “Cultural Hub Binckhaven”, for which it is the catalyst. By connecting to an existing building, I preserve the current industrial character of today's Binckhorst but create a completely new identity, with an orientation to human scale instead of machines. This is unique to Binckhorst and could be applied elsewhere to realize liveable neighbourhoods in former industrial areas that can be found in many European cities. With the right mix of uses, these areas have great potential to become lively and active centres for the city's residents. My research presents strategies to successfully achieve these goals by introducing music as a medium for forming identity and culture. The identified factors can be used for designing a music building that activates the community and public life in a sustainable way, also applicable in a wider scientific context. As a result, it will be possible to counteract anonymity in a densely populated area, strengthen a new neighbourhood, and provide spaces for everyone. <br","music building; concert hall; public building; timber construction; neighbourhood activation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","","52.064747, 4.343092"

Profit-oriented schemes of capitalism through subordination and functionalization has led to the marginalization of hinterlands and, in the end, will eventually lead to exhaustion. <br/><br/>After 66 years of lignite extraction, the industry is planning to phase out coal combustion. With the economy highly dominated by mining, this decision has had an extensive impact on the region. To understand it, as well as the events that have led to the current state of transition, the essay examines it through temporalities – interwoven timeframes. <br/><br/>The design proposal cuts through various scales, indicating a new direction for the region with a collection of three interventions of different temporalities, scales, and materials, relating back to the context of the place, ecology, socio-economic forces, and the people. <br/>It states that the hinterland should remain in the state of flux, but in a more balanced, and less profit-oriented manner. It embraces the process of the transition, that naturally affects both the environment, as well as the architectural interventions. It focuses on identifying points of intensification, integrating the necessary steps into existing conditions, as well as looking into what change it would bring over a long period of time. <br/>Proposed interventions highlight certain aspects, their influence is acupunctural, highlighting certain moments as points of intensification. By doing this the project touches a particular place at a specific moment, becoming a point of ignition. However, this is the first step. In contrast to the paradigm of speed of the technological acceleration, the effects of future transformation will be slow and subtle, requiring the active and sustained engagement of long-term partnerships between the inhabitants, and public sectors, with much greater attention to various visible and non-visible layers. Therefore, the project is a small gesture that suggests the direction in which the ongoing continuum of the hinterland should evolve.","urbanization; hinterland; mining; extraction; delignification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Borders and Territories","",""

The applied QM-MD method was described rigorously, and used to investigate the compound distribution and dynamics at the interface, relative to a fully classical MD simulation. Polarisation effects were observed to bring about a significant increase in the attraction between cations and the cathode. Moreover, local polarisation of the cathode was found to immobilise adsorbed cations, and induce an increased orientational preference of the nearby water dipoles. The secondary goal of this thesis was to explore to what extent neural networks are able to replicate SCC-DFTB calculations of the electronic charge density on a metallic electrode. Using a computer vision approach, qualitative evidence was obtained indicating that neural networks can be used to replicate SCC-DFTB predictions on periodic metallic surfaces.","DFT; DFTB; MD-simulation; simulation; Computational; Polarisation; Deep Learning; Neural Networks; electrode-electrolyte interface","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","MSc Thesis",""

In order to lower the volume of outflows and effectively control pollution, a reduction of raw material use throughout the economy is required. A shift from a linear to a circular economy plays an important role in achieving global climate goals. In a circular economy materials are kept in use for as long as possible so that the need for virgin materials is as little as possible. From a perspective of a circular economy material stocks in urban areas can be considered as ‘natural resources’. These in-use stocks can be described as the urban mine, a concept that is defined as the systematic reuse of anthropogenic materials from urban areas such as buildings and infrastructure for example. Although using the urban mine is desirable, knowledge about stocks and flows of the potential urban mines is limited. One of the infrastructure stocks that has not been assessed yet is the infrastructure of the urban water cycle in the Netherlands. The Dutch urban water cycle as assessed in this study consists of the drinking water production sites and supply network as managed by the 10 drinking water companies, the sewage network, gully pots and a large part of the sewage pumping stations as managed by the municipalities, and some of the sewage pumping stations, transportation pipelines and wastewater treatment plants as managed by the 21 water boards in the Netherlands.

They are well-studied and have been standardized since 1994. In 2002, Johnson et al. introduced the notion of homomorphic digital signatures, allowing one to perform computations on signed data. These signatures are especially useful for linear network coding, a technique used to improve throughput and resilience of networks, and in verifiable cloud computing. However, homomorphic signatures are not standardized and less well-studied, which creates a challenge when choosing one of the published schemes. Moreover, most schemes remain unimplemented, and it is insufficient to compare their theoretical performance for real-world applications. Those schemes that are implemented are not directly comparable since they use different instantiations of the same primitives or they are implemented in different programming languages.<br/>In this thesis, we set out to find out how we can assess the performance of homomorphic signa- ture schemes. To this end, we have implemented eleven pairing-based linearly homomorphic signature schemes. All signature schemes have been implemented on the BLS12-381 curve to constitute a fair comparison. We assess the performance of the signature schemes based on their signing, verifying and combining performance, as well as the sizes of their keys and signatures. Furthermore, we analyse the impact that additional features such as supporting a multi-party setting have on the performance of a signature scheme. Based on our exper- imental results, we make recommendations for three types of applications: For constrained devices, the scheme Li20 is the most suitable due to its compact signing key and efficient sign- ing operation. For network coding, which requires fast verification, fast combining, and small signatures, we also recommend the scheme by Li et al. Finally, for a multi-party, privacy- preserving scheme, we recommend the scheme by Sch18 and Sch19, which preserve input privacy of homomorphically combined signatures. We find that we can assess the perfor- mance of a homomorphic signature scheme based on the speed of the signing, verifying and combining operation. Our implementation is publicly available.","Homomorphic Signatures; Digital Signatures; Pairing-based; Applied Cryptography","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

KD has proven to be an effective technique to significantly improve the student's performance for various tasks including object detection. As such, KD techniques mostly rely on guidance at the intermediate feature level, which is typically implemented by minimizing an L_p-norm distance between teacher and student activations during training. In this paper, we propose a replacement for the pixel-wise independent L_p-norm based on structural similarity (SSIM). By taking into account additional contrast and structural cues, more knowledge within intermediate feature maps can be preserved. Extensive experiments on MSCOCO demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across different training schemes and architectures. <br/>Our method adds only little computational overhead, is straightforward to implement and at the same time it significantly outperforms the standard L_p-norms. Moreover, more complex state-of-the-art KD methods using attention-based sampling mechanisms are outperformed, including a +3.5 AP gain using a Faster R-CNN R-50 compared to a vanilla model.","Knowledge Distillation; Deep Learning; Computer Vision; Autonomous driving","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Implementing a behavior preserving refactoring is a time-consuming and error-prone task.

Image data has three types of location information: absolute location, relative direction, and relative distance. Various position embeddings methods have been used to introduce location information to the ViT model. Some existing methods are absolute position embeddings, relative position embeddings, fixed sinusoidal position embeddings, and learnable Fourier position embeddings. However, it is unclear what type of location information can be encoded by different position embeddings methods. This paper investigates this question by conducting fully-controlled experiments and feature-level analysis on synthetic datasets. The results suggest that the relative position embeddings cannot encode absolute location information, which leads to inferior performance. All the position embeddings approaches that we test can encode relative location information. However, they have different levels of relative location bias. The learnable absolute position embeddings do not contain any relative location bias and therefore need more data to learn. The fixed sinusoidal and learnable Fourier position embeddings are relatively better, but they also have minor drawbacks. The fixed sinusoidal position embeddings are not trainable, while the Fourier method does not have much bias on relative location information. We propose to make the fixed sinusoidal position embeddings learnable and use pretraining tasks to improve the Fourier method. Our two new approaches show promising results on the testing datasets, and they are competitive compared with a similar approach.","Computer Vision; Vision Transformer; Position embeddings","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

Recent approaches to function prediction rely on unsupervised deep learning models, through which protein sequences are represented as real-valued embeddings that can be used as input to a machine-learning model. This study aims to evaluate embedding models in the context of protein function prediction on bacteria, which are organisms less commonly included in these types of benchmarks. To this end, we generated embeddings with four recently developed embedding models, and predicted protein function using a nearest-neighbor search in the embedding space.

By finding these unintended consequences, we can deal with them accordingly or avoid them, as to not cause any problems with our fairness metric that might make our negotiation process less fair or cause any undesired behaviour. Edge cases are searched for in a small-scale experiment by implementing the difference principle from the 'Justice as Fairness' notion by John Rawls into the negotiation process. The negotiation has two agents, and the behaviour of one of the agents is changed to adhere to the difference principle. By using these agents in automated negotiations with different domains, the behaviour and outcomes of these negotiations between two agents will be checked for any abnormalities that could be considered an unintended consequence. From this, we conclude that agent implementing fairness has a smaller available bidding space which leads to a staler negotiation process. Furthermore, the outcomes show that not always an optimal result is found. However, no unintended consequences directly related to fairness were found. Since finding edge cases is an exhaustive process, which can be compared to finding bugs in a computer program, the research done is not proof that the Rawlsian notion of fairness, or any kind of fairness for that matter, has no other unintended consequences. The research in this paper can be used as inspiration for further research into the edge cases of fairness in automated negotiation, and to have a general idea as to what unintended consequences Rawlsian fairness brings.","Automated negotiation; Fairness; Negotiation; Edge cases; Unintended consequences","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Self-tapping screws are popular tools used in timber engineering. The axial withdrawal strength of self-tapping screws could be used in timber structures as an active or passive application. An example of an active application is the use as a fastener in wall to wall connections. An example of a passive application is the use as reinforcement perpendicular to the grain, to prevent cracking along the grain. Existing methods to calculate the withdrawal strength of self-tapping screws are mainly based on tests done on softwood. Some screw manufacturers offer calculation methods for the use of their screws in hardwood from temperate regions in so called European Technical Assessments (ETAs). But the Eurocode and the ETAs offer no calculation methods for high density tropical hardwood species. Tropical hardwood species are generally used in The Netherlands for hydraulic and outside structures such as lock-doors, bridges, weirs and jetties. Tropical hardwood species are used because of their strength and durability in outside conditions. There are no well-established methods to calculate the withdrawal strength of self-tapping screws in tropical hardwood perpendicular to the grain and the purpose of this thesis is to gain more knowledge on this topic. The central question of this thesis is: What is the withdrawal strength of self-tapping screws in tropical hardwood species perpendicular to the grain and is it possible to develop a verification model for engineering purposes?<br/>To find answers to the main question first a literature review has been conducted. Literature on timber anatomy, self-tapping screw properties and available calculation methods have been reviewed. This is followed by a literature review on possibilities to drive self-tapping screws into high density woods. This is problematic because screws could fail already during insertion or cause splitting of the timber. Screw modifications such as cutter tips could be used to reduce the insertion moment, but also pre-drilling of the timber could be done to avoid torque failure of screws or the splitting of timber. The literature study is finalized with an investigation to the influence of material properties on the withdrawal strength. Tropical hardwood species are often used in outside or wet structures so literature on the influence of moisture content has been investigated. In research done by Ringhofer et al. [22] it was found that if the moisture content increases above 12 % the withdrawal capacity significantly decreases. Pre-drilling of the timber helps to insert self-tapping screws more easily into timber, but this also removes material and could therefore reduce the withdrawal strength. Research done by Brandner, Ringhofer, and Reichinger [5] found that if the pre-drilling diameter is smaller or equal to 80 % of the nominal screw diameter pre-drilling had no influence on the withdrawal strength. The mentioned research however has been done on temperate hardwood and the question is whether this is the case for tropical hardwood as well. According to EN 1995-1-1:2011 pre-drilling is necessary if the characteristic density of the timber is larger than 500 kg/m<sup>3</sup>. With increasing timber density the withdrawal strength also increases (Hubner, Rasser, and Schickhofer [13]). Regarding the screw diameter, with increasing diameter the withdrawal strength (f<sub>ax</sub>, MPa) decreases as was found by for example Hubner, Rasser, and Schickhofer [13]. With increasing diameter the withdrawal capacity (F<sub>ax</sub>, kN) also increases. With increasing effective length of self-tapping screws inserted in wood the withdrawal strength (f<sub>ax</sub>, MPa) does not increase or decrease (Xu et al. [30]). The withdrawal capacity (F<sub>ax</sub>, kN) however increases, a linear relationship between the effective length withdrawal capacity can be observed in research done by Xu et al. [30].<br/>Findings in the literature study were the basis of how the test series were designed. EN1382:2016 describes how to test and determine the withdrawal strength of screws in timber. This standard also gives rules on the dimensions of the test piece. The width of the available tropical hardwood pieces was to small according to EN1382:2016 which states that a minimal edge distance of 5d has to be used. Methods from the EN 1995-1-1:2011 and ETA-11/0030:2020 from Rotho Blaas have been used to make a selection of screws that will be used in testing. The goal is to have withdrawal as main failure mode. The following screw diameters have been selected: 6, 8 and 11 mm. The diameter 11 mm screw has been tested in a pre-testing series with pre-drilling diameters: 0,7d and 0,8d; with insertion depth 90 mm; Also three tropical hardwood species with the highest density were selected to test the limits of the materials. It was found that the smaller edge distances did not cause any problems. Further because of pre-drilling no damages occurred on the timber or screw, and there were no problems during screw insertion. No significant difference in withdrawal capacity was found between pre-drilling 0,7d and 0,8d so this was changed to pre-drilling 0,8d and 0,9d in the main test series. Also screw failure was observed for insertion depth 90 mm, this was changed to a maximum of 70 mm in the main test series to make sure screw withdrawal is the main failure mode.<br/>For the main test series 6 tropical hardwood species were used (Kanda, Lati, Longhi, Tali, Limbali and Mukulungu), and also the softwood Spruce as a reference material. The diameter 6 mm, 8 mm and 11 mm screws were used with pre-drilling diameter 0,8d and 0,9d. Conditioning of the wet test pieces has been done by putting the timber blocks underwater. On every test piece or timber block four tests were done: two withdrawal strength tests (according to EN 1382:2016) and two stiffness tests (according to EN 26891:1991). Also the insertion moment was measured. After testing the density of every test piece was determined together with the moiture content.<br/>The main test series provided a broad range of data. The following was measured: the density, the moisture content, the withdrawal capacity, the insertion moment and slip modulus. All results can be found in annex A. The test piece geometry was not according to EN 1382:2016, in general larger edge distances were required. Nevertheless did this not lead to any problems, no cracks or screw failure occurred during the insertion of the self-tapping screws nor was it any problem to insert the screws at all. This had all to do with the pre-drilling diameters of 0,8d and 0,9d what was used. Because of this very low insertion moments were measured. Also during and after withdrawal tests no significant damage was observed. Even in extreme situations that were tested during pre-testing there was no evidence that a larger edge distance was needed. In the analysis it was found that with increasing density the withdrawal strength also increases, this is in line with literature. It was also found that the species does influence the withdrawal strength, as was found by calculating the withdrawal strength to density ratio per species. With increasing screw diameter the withdrawal strength decreases as was found in this analysis, and also in line with literature. Only in the case of pre-drilling 0,9d for the diameter 8 mm screw this was not the case when comparing it to the diameter 6 mm screw, this probably was a result of pre-drilling accuracy. Regarding the influence of pre-drilling it was found that on average the withdrawal strength is reduced by a factor of 0,68 when the pre-drilled hole is 0,9d instead of 0,8d. In literature it was found that the effective screw length does not influence the withdrawal strength. No clear influence of effective length has been found, except for screw diameter 6 mm and 8 mm when pre-drilled 0,9d. The diameter 6 mm and 8 mm screws are HSBH screws with a larger inner diameter and it might be that the withdrawal strength is not optimal for these types of screw when inserted in 0,9d pre-drilled holes. During testing wet and dry pieces were tested. It was found that the moisture uptake rate is very different for the various tropical hardwood species that were tested. It was also found that as expected the withdrawal strength is negatively influenced by an increased moisture content. First of all it has to be mentioned that the scatter in data is larger when compared to the test data from withdrawal tests, this has to be taken into account. In the analysis it was found that with increasing density the slip modulus also increases. Also the timber species influences the slip modulus just like in the case of the withdrawal strength. No clear influence of screw diameter was found on the withdrawal strength. Just like for the withdrawal strength is the slip modulus influenced negatively when pre-drilling 0,9d has been used instead of 0,8d. This negative influence increases with increasing diameter. With increasing effective screw length also the slip modulus increases, this would be expected and was also found in the test results. Also a higher moisture content has a negative influence on the slip modulus, this was also as expected. A larger influence was observed in the case of timber species with the highest densities measured (Tali and Mukulungu), while for these species the lowest moisture content was measured in wet conditions compared to other species.<br/>Finally two models have been proposed to better predict the withdrawal strength of self-tapping screws perpendicular to the grain in tropical hardwood. For the first model withdrawal strength $f_{ax}$ parameters are determined per species, per timber condition and per pre-drilling diameter. The second model is one formula based on the density, screw diameter and effective screw length for all tested tropical hardwood species. Both proposed models show a good fit to the test data. ","Tropical hardwood; timber engineering; self-tapping screws","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

This technique makes use of a thin beam which can irradiate each spot at millimetre precision. It is a very promising technique, especially for more radiation sensitive areas, e.g. lung carcinogenesis, as it can spare more healthy surrounding tissue compared to conventional radiation therapy due to proton’s physical property of the Bragg peak: this is the explosively release of the particles’ energy at a certain point in the beam path; a minimal energy loss is obtained before this peak and no energy is deposited after this Bragg peak. In the PBS, interplay is a concern. The interplay effect is defined as the interference of the moving beam and breathing induced tumour motion. Hence an inhomogeneous dose distribution occurs which differs from the planned dose. In the interplay effect different parameters are involved, which can be divided into beam and patient parameters. <br/><br/>The HollandPTC developed a Quality Assurance tool for assessing the interplay effect in lung treatment plans in which a first order sinusoidal function is utilized. However, a sine function is not reflecting the daily variation in target motion and also beam delivery fluctuates over time. By implementing variations into our QA tool, a more realistic interplay assessment could be obtained. A previously done literature search provided us insufficient information regarding beam and patient parameters describing variations over time, hence we did our own research. In this thesis, an investigation was done to analyse the variation in beam and patient specific parameters. <br/><br/>For the machine parameters, the variation in Energy Layer Switching Time (ELST) and Beam On Time (BOT) was determined for the VARIAN ProBeam 4.0. Three clinical lung plans which contained in total nine beams, were irradiated on an array of ionization chambers multiple times over multiple days. The output files were analysed regarding the ELST and BOT. For each beam 15 measurements were done, a total of 135 measurements were executed over a period of two weeks. We found variations in ELST between energy layers, but also within an energy layer variations in ELST was observed. The within day and day-to-day variations were comparable. Regarding the BOT, this variable strongly depends on the planned dose. Looking at each individual beam: variations between energies are found; no variations within an energy layer was found. By dividing the measured dose of all output files within an energy layer by the corresponding BOT, the dose rate for each energy was obtained. The dose rate was low at low energies and gradually increased towards the higher energies. <br/><br/>Patient parameters were also investigated regarding the tumour motion pattern: the variation in amplitude, period and degree of asymmetry was investigated. In three lung patients, the breathing signal was recorded for 1.5 minutes utilizing the Anzai belt. Five measurements were done: two measurements for two patients and one measurement for one patient. The obtained signals were analysed in terms of amplitude, period and degree of asymmetry for each breathing cycle. Each cycle was fitted into the Lujan’s model, hence a value for each of the three variables were observed. For our group the amplitude variated between 6 and 12mm and the period variated between 2.5 and 4.5 seconds. The degree of asymmetry was most likely to be 1. We found significant interpatient variation, mainly for the amplitude and period. <br/><br/>In this analysis, we found that the ELST mainly depends on the step size of the degrader and slit movement. Unfortunately, no hard conclusion regarding the variation within an energy layer could be stated, probably the data transfer systems of the beam line are involved in this variation. Developing a prediction tool for assessing the ELST seems appealing, however more data in different energy ranges should be obtained. Regarding the BOT: this time was more or less dependent on the planned dose. Variations measured for this parameter were caused by inaccuracies of our measurement tool itself. <br/><br/>Regarding the patient parameters, significant differences are found between patients’ respiratory signal e.g. the tumour motion strongly depends on tumour characteristics. Hence, we advise to analyse the tumour motion pattern patient specifically. <br/><br/>In this thesis report the first insights towards the fluctuations in the relevant parameters were determined. The retrieved information can be used to optimize the interplay QA tool, to get a more realistic interplay assessment in the plans.<br","Proton therapy; Pencil beam scanning; Interplay effect","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Technical Medicine | Imaging and Intervention","",""

The energized mass refers to a measure of the normalised kinetic energy of all the fluid that is affected by the movement of the body. <br/><br/>The method was tested on five different experimental cases, pertaining to three different models: a sphere, a cyclist and a skater.

(mentor); Quesada Mañas, J. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Various different challenges are being faced in the space industry, concerning the increased difficulty level of missions that are planned, down-scaling of the satellites and especially considering the toxicity of fuels used in the spacecraft. To systematically tackle these problems, requirements are set for a ‘CubeSat’ sized satellite for which a sustainable and environmental friendly power and propulsion system has to be developed. Many ‘green’ propellant options are there to deliver the power, of which mainly Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2) is considered a suitable option, because of its high energy density and reaction products being only water and oxygen. Besides being used in the propulsion system as propellant, the H2O2 could then also be used as fuel and oxidizer to generate electric power in an additional system.<br/>The exothermic decomposing liquid is currently under investigation to provide thrust and electricity using catalyst materials, which experiences degradation of performance over time. Therefore, different long-lasting solutions have been experimented with, based on thermal decomposition of the H2O2 and improved electro-reduction methods. This way, a green solution would be present to undertake various missions using small spacecraft that need around 1N of thrust, while simultaneously delivering up to 60W of extra power during its operation. Multiple Proof of Concept (PoC)’s were therefore developed to understand the processes and acquire the voltage, current and temperature data, generated and required by the systems. The energy required for ignition of the H2O2 using various resistance wires was recorded visually and with thermocouples. A drop test study was done for better understanding first, after which a safe injection setup was constructed where different conditions could be looked into. Various fuel cell structures were tested in a different experimental setup before this, to try and reach the extra power the thermal ignition requires. A demonstration of the various ways this system could be optimized was then done, mainly by changing input parameters. Cooperation of the systems was looked into by combining them and checking feasibility of incorporation in a CubeSat. Several electrochemical related properties prove to have large effects on the power density and potential and a maximum of 4.5mW was reached. Similarly, the ignition conditions of the propellant will have to be looked into more, since the 24.8W currently needed for small mass flow rate decomposition, is excessive already. <br/>This makes the incorporation in a combined system design difficult, but worth investigating, because of the many possibilities it brings forth. Based on the study performed so far it is concluded that providing enough sustainable electrochemical power for an efficient thermal decomposition is challenging, but feasible. The required conditions and achieved results with H2O2 will be presented in this research as well as recommendations to future work on this upcoming field of study. Utilizing a second propellant such as ethanol would be the next step in upgrading the system performances and lower the ignition energy required, whilst increasing the electrical energy obtained from the fuel cell.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-06-22","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Colorectal cancer (CRC) benefits from early detection, and many studies find correlations between disease presence and abundance of species in samples of the microbiome. However, these studies are hard to reproduce and even harder to build diagnostic tools from, and one of the major factors for this is the inherent bias in the datasets that were collected, the so-called batch effect. <br/>To investigate the extent to which batch effect impacts the generalization of binary classifiers, we performed a benchmark of eleven batch correctors: four existing tools, three transformations and three encoders, assessing the subsequent performance of seven supervised binary classifiers using a leave-one-dataset-out (LODO) validation method. In addition, batch effect was measured through both visual (tSNE) and numeric (linear models) methods before and after applying each of the correctors, and the performance at different dataset counts was measured. <br/>Batch effect was shown to be present in the shotgun metagenomic data, being reduced by some correction tools while being strengthened by others. Evaluations using AUROC showed that combining datasets without correction improved generalization, even at an equivalent number of samples. When combining batch correctors and different classifiers, the performance over the baseline did not improve significantly. Contrary to its popularity as batch corrector, the performance significantly worsened when using ComBat before training each of the binary classifiers.<br/>Thus, even though batch correctors reduce batch effect within our taxonomic count data, they do not significantly improve classification performance when generalizing to separate datasets. We can thus advise against focusing on choosing a batch corrector when building tools for predicting diagnosis of CRC and instead aiming to improve the pool of datasets to learn from.<br/>The code for reproducing the results and figures in this work have been made available at https://github.com/AbeelLab/ngs-batch-evaluation  <br","bioinformatics; metagenomics; batch effect; batch corrector; binary classification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Earthquake prediction is the field of seismology concerned with predicting the time, location, and magnitude of earthquakes within a small time frame, usually defined in terms of minutes or seconds before an event. Such predictions can have a large impact on minimizing the damage caused by these seismic events, by providing early warnings to the affected population and allowing them to respond appropriately. Although the methods used to predict earthquakes are often limited to larger magnitude events, predicting micro-earthquakes is also an important task, especially in locations that are more vulnerable to seismic shocks. Concentrations of localized micro-earthquakes can also hint at larger future seismic events, and their location can be used to locate moving fault lines underground. Deep learning methods perform particularly well in this context, due to their ability to quickly identify patterns in large volumes of data, and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks are very well suited to handling time-sequenced data such as the seismic waves used in earthquake prediction problems. In this paper, an LSTM network is trained to predict micro-earthquakes three seconds before the event, using seismic recordings from the New Zealand dataset: the goal is to find the optimal size of these recordings and understand how different values affect the model. Our results suggest that larger recordings do not provide any benefit in performance and that high levels of accuracy can be reached with smaller samples. This means that in the context of micro-earthquake prediction, primary waves can be easily detected in short recordings, and are likely to travel close to shear waves. This can be attributed to the low strength of signals that micro-earthquakes generate, as they will travel shorter distances than major earthquakes.","Deep Learning; Earthquake Prediction; Long Short-Term Memory Network","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

These so-called in-between spaces represent a threshold between polarities, such as inside and outside or private and public. The Harbour Police Station in Rotterdam consists of three buildings and has multiple inbetween spaces, which include several entrances, doorsteps, windows, dormers, balconies, and a fenced perimeter. Since the new program will be more publicly oriented, the in-between spaces of the redesign need to attract passers-by, rather than obstructing them. Based on literature, archival drawings, personal observations and questionnaires, the influence of the materiality on the perception of in-between spaces is analyzed. Accordingly, the human perception of a building façade, entrance or window that attract passers-by can be expressed through perceptive descriptive qualities such as friendly, inviting, and pleasant. The research shows that this is influenced by the warmth, openness, and lightness of the in-between spaces. A warm materiality is perceived as pleasant and comforting and it indirectly excites to go inside. Furthermore, either big or many openings will create a more transparent building, that matches with public functions. Namely, the function should be clear on the outside. In line with this, an open façade and enough lighting contribute to a better visibility and draw attention to the building and its interior. Accordingly, it is particularly important that one can easily understand where and how one can enter. In summary, the materiality of the inbetween spaces contributes to the experience of the appearance and the perceived function of the building. In the case of attracting buildings, the inbetween spaces should be represented by clear accessible entrances, multiple or large windows, and warm colours, materials, and lighting.","In-between space; Perception; Materiality; Harbour Police Station; Public Plinth","en","master thesis","","","","","","At the time of writing, Daphne Fahrner was a graduation student at the University of Technology in Delft, the Netherlands.

Originally almost entirely covered by the Atlantic Rainforest, a rich tropical biome that stretches through most of the Brazilian eastern coast, the basin is now mostly covered by urbanized landscapes, associated with spaces of intense production. First heavily altered by the coffee economic cycles during the 19 and 20th centuries, the Basin has since then been deprived of most of its natural ecological conditions and has lost its ability to regulate and support ecological cycles in this region of southeastern Brazil. Since the 2000s the basin has been going through a process of specialization in the plantation of sugar-cane by extensive monocultures, mostly for biofuels production (alongside the rest of the hinterland of the State of São Paulo). The sterilization of the land and changes in land-use patterns across the region and other neighboring areas by industrial agriculture (such as the Amazon and Atlantic forests) are disrupting to micro and macroclimates, and the effect of such intense exploitation of the soil is already clearly noted in the form of catastrophes. Some of the countless externalities observed in the region are shifting rainfall patterns across the continent, heatwaves, cold spells, wildfires, and issues directly related to health, cause by, among other reasons, the intensive use of pesticides in the latifundia. As the new climate conditions increasingly become a reality, conventional land use patterns must be challenged. Natural resources and the capacity of natural systems to bounce back must be protected. Looking for possibilities of economic stability, in synch with the environment and welfare through the creation of new production systems, distributing the gains and burdens of climate change are among the goals of the project. A literature review, a series of cartographies, and research through design are some of the methods chosen as an attempt to research ways in which the peri-urban landscape of the State of São Paulo can change during the upcoming decades.

The thesis focuses on the Cypriot refugee settlements created from 1976 to 1991, unraveling the formation of the Greek Cypriot refugee community through space. The thesis project questions how community-led spatial planning allows the Cypriot refugee settlements to be transformed into livable environments while preserving the memories of their initial inhabitants. Additionally, the project expands on how the planning process builds a community in a conflict environment and how the right to remembrance is spatialized conceptually while considering the spatial factors which influence the right to remembrance seen in theoretical notions. <br/>Through the analysis of the spatial footprint of the Cypriot refugees, the refugee settlements, aspects of their liveability state, and remembrance of their past are depicted. The refugee community’s and refugee settlement’s current image are illustrated through quantitative and qualitative analysis. These areas’ social consistency, and spatial characteristics, are combined with the actors and stakeholders involved, contributing to constructing and reconstructing the refugee identity. These elements have been used to form the spatial patterns that describe urgencies and critical features of the refugee community building. Moreover, the degree of place attachment of the refugee settlement residents and the factors responsible for their decay and embody the potential to contribute to community building are identified and used for the pattern language. <br/>The spatial patterns formed through the analysis of Nicosia refugee settlements and global reference patterns dedicated to community express the socio-spatial characteristics of the social group, the refugees, their living conditions, and how the life histories of the first generations have or can be imprinted through space. The patterns created represent starting points for synergies and cooperation among actors towards a socially conscious community’s future at the refugee settlements. Spatial patterns related to the remembrance of the refugee community, combined with liveability aspects, aim to summarize the key elements that enable a community-led strategy, resulting in the landscape memorialization of the refugee settlements. <br/>The complexity of the Cypriot refugee case, primarily because of their internal displacement, the unclear future of the refugee properties, and the de facto division of the island since 1974, make the Cypriot refugees a unique, extremely complex, particularly interesting case.","community building; refugee settlements; remembrance; Pattern Language","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Complex Cities","","35.1856, 33.3823"

A typology was constructed from a cross-case study of 6 cases to answer the following research question: To what extent does the type of Social Enterprise and deployed Roles contribute to Incremental Housing? Firstly, type A: technical-led is a socially driven organization adopting roles as an implementer, emphasizing design and material solutions. Their intervention is sporadic, facing challenges such as a limited network, resources, and motivation to achieve goals. Secondly, type B: community-led, is a socially driven organization adapting roles as a catalyst and partner, focusing on the bottom-up process of self-organization and building social networks on a local scale. Barriers faced by this actor are; the lengthy decision-making process among groups and the minor involvement of the users. Thirdly, type C: project management-led; adopting roles as catalysis, implementer, and partner, has an extensive network with strategic allies.

Even in the process of reclamation, nature decides where to fill the earth and coordinates the relationship between land and water.<br/>So the objective of the project is to leverage a nature-based solution taking the concept of biophilia to build up a food landscape infrastructure that connects urban agglomerations and the agriculture hinterlands, synergizing the historical anthropological heritage with the pioneer zeitgeist of Flevoland.<br/>The project takes nature-based thinking as a research principle, while biophilic thinking as a core design principle. Under the framework of Urban Ecology and Eco-cities, the project explores how to integrate ecological or historical identity into a monoculture of agricultural land. <br/>To melt four aspects of landscape reflection with the project, which are perception, process, palimpsest, and scale-continuum, the design site can be delayered as 3 main elements: agriculture, nature, and urban, synthesizing the past, present, and future on a local and site-specific scale.","Biophilic Design; Foodscape; Hinterland Renewal; Landscape as Infrastructure; Landscape Architecture; Climate Change Adaptation; Urban Ecology; Green-blue Infrastructure; Nature-based Solutions; Research by Design; Bottom-up Strategy; Almere Oosterwold","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","Urban Ecology and Eco-cities Lab","51.9965929, 4.3709437"

The Anthropocene has lasted a little over 200 years has perhaps seen the most shift from completely natural systems to requiring an additional man-made system to aid exponential growth of our species. Among earth’s systems, climate is one of the most complex factors determining energy balance of living organisms and determines energy gains and losses from organisms.<br/>India encompasses a wide range of complex territories with rich biodiversity living alongside some of the world’s highest population densities. Historically the Indians have lived and adapted to these resource abundant terrains through traditional ecological practices that aligned with the ecological systems and governed the socio-cultural practices. The current globalised world has been built upon with technological, infrastructural, sociological political and capitalistic growth has wretched devastating effects on the environment that supports us. India being a colonised country and exploited for its resources for centuries still holds traces of it in the infrastructural and production systems, in this case in the Periyar-Vaigai river basins. The region characterised by complex terrain, excessive manipulation of landforms and alteration of its resource cycles especially in water cycles by storing water in multiple dams experiences excess water flows during monsoons, causing flooding on its western slopes and proves to be the only hope for drought prone region on its eastern side. <br/><br/> Governing such complexities lies with arbitrary administrative borders dividing the control between different states and various different departments controls the flow and management of resource which often falls short of preventing catastrophes or just management of resources.<br/>Extreme weather events in the recent past has exasperated the effects in these fragile habitats, thus the project aims to firstly mitigate the risks associated with failing monsoon, further restore the balance of the ecological system in the region. By building back resilience through co-habitation of social-ecological systems, aligned to nature using human knowledge the design aims to place value on nature rather than exploit it. The project envisions the transition from a local adaptation towards building up the system on the regional scale. It deals with primary production, anthropogenic control with respect to grey infrastructure, values and the role of ecosystems in maintain this balance. By synchronising these various systems the projects attempts at bringing back a dynamic equilibrium to this region, through methods like literature reviews, synthetic cartography and research by design.<br/><br","Periyar-Vaigai River Basins; India; water stress; Grey Infrastructure; Primary production; Regenerative agriculture; Co-habitation; adaptive planning; Dynamic equillibrium","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Transitional Territories","","9.529001698424663, 77.14432418742237"

There is an urge to deal with these challenges and develop climate resilient cities. The natural environment is able to adapt to changing circumstances and creating a city as part of nature could contribute to resilience. The city of Rotterdam has lost its connection with nature as the city expanded over the years. As a result, the ecological values of the city environments are low, as well as the awareness among citizens on the values and importance of nature.<br/>By conducting spatial research, this thesis aims to create an evidence informed design strategy for (a certain location within) Rotterdam in which this city is part of nature, using the following research question to guide the project: “How could the citizens of Rotterdam be reconnected to nature, while improving the urban ecosystems, creating a resilient city?”<br/>Three key topics were identified to address the whole scope of a nature inclusive city. Each of the three topics consists of a few criteria, which were defined using literature, that contribute to the research aim. First, the ecological perspective focusses on the natural systems of the landscape. Creating ecological connectivity and increasing the biodiversity and amount of open green space help to strengthen the urban ecosystems.<br/>Secondly, the human perspective consists of creating a connection, both physically and mentally, with nature in order to make it a part of daily urban life. This includes integrating green in the urban environments and making it accessible for residents in order to improve the quality of life.<br/>Thirdly, the climate perspective focusses on tackling issues such as water nuisance, Urban Heat Island effect and risk of flooding to develop a climate resilient city. Making the city part of nature means dealing with these issues in order to develop a climate resilient city.<br/>Using a case study, the urban centre of Rotterdam, research is done on possible interventions to create this nature inclusive city. Using the pattern language approach, all three perspectives are strongly integrated with each other in the design typologies (patterns) which are explained in the pattern atlas and tested on the site. This has resulted in a strategy that consists of a stakeholder analysis and phasing for a specific route, from front door to river, in which is explained how on local scale the city could be transformed into part of nature. The different components of the route: street, boulevard and waterfront, are highlighted using the patterns as design interventions. Furthermore, this is complemented with an exploration on how to implement the concept within the whole city and even region of Rotterdam.<br/>This research shows how, considering the urban ecology, human connection and climate resilience, the quality of life for all living things in Rotterdam could be improved.","City as part of nature; resilient cities; Rotterdam; Urban ecology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

Incorporating structural design in the initial design phases can lead to more efficient and cost-effective structures, but in order to do so practical tools should be available to the designer to deepen the design space and allow them to efficiently explore it. Generative AI models could provide a solution to the problem and expand the design space by learning from the data provided.<br/>This thesis explores such a solution by means of training an AI model (Variational Autoencoder) on an artificial dataset of 2D lattice patterns. To do that, a dataset of 6 unique 2D lattice patterns is created and used to train a simple VAE model. The methodology used in this thesis is to validate if an AI can aid in the exploration of design ideas by providing a larger design space with newly generated data that contain learned features from the dataset rather than through constraints set by the designers.<br/>The results show that the VAE model can learn features and provide a greater diversity of design than the original dataset through newly generated designs. The output of the VAE model in this thesis is then explored for possible integrations into the design process for the early stages of design. For this, the generated patterns that are distinct and unique are identified and applied to a shell structure to explore topology design ideas.<br","Artifical Intelligence; Topology Exploration; Natural Patterns","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

Located between the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, this rich landscape remained forever in the sight of powerful individuals and colonizers who never truly managed to rule the Mayan warriors. <br/><br/>Today, the region is composed of three different states with a complex mosaic of rich biodiversity, fascinating landscapes and important coral reef systems competing for survival against the effects of nature and human actions. For decades, the focus remained mainly on the economic development of the coastal areas without considering the ecological stress and social uncertainty as a result of urban expansion. In the span of merely twenty years, the region was completely transformed following capitalist intentions and we can see the fragile state of the land as a direct result of this. Sadly, the region’s mostly mono-cultural economic practices focusing on tourism services have pushed the locals, from mostly indigenous background to leave their communities and seek job opportunities in the cities created for the new Mayan Riviera. <br/><br/>This set of political, social, economic and natural elements have had enormous repercussions on the physical and social integrity of the landscape, which nowadays is threatened not only by the over-exploitation of resources and climate change, but also by the homogenization and simplification of an ancestral culture. <br/><br/>However, it is in this richness of landscapes, biodiversity and cultural heritage where I see a possibility to think of new ways of co-existing and to imagine new ways of living in sync with our environment.

This research is positioned in larger research on how window openings help define a building’s openness or closeness towards the surroundings and creating a helpful ‘design options palette’ when having to intervene in a building’s openness or closeness. The research concludes that most of the windows present in the oldest building present a high openness, as well as in the 1994 building.

This, in combination with the increasing prominence of participation in the design field, means that citizen participation processes will be used more and more in projects across the country. Participation processes are processes in which citizens work together with local authorities and industry professionals. However, some challenges do exist in the usage of citizen participation for energy transition projects. One of these challenges is the occurrence of participation fatigue. Here, participants of the participation process become exhausted from working on the project and motivating them to still make useful contributions becomes more difficult. In light of this challenge, the research question this thesis aims to answer is the following: “What are the main characteristics and lessons learned from participation fatigue experienced by citizens in participation processes for public energy transition projects?”. The analysis of both qualitative and quantitative empirical data, resulted in the identification of five major categories of causes linked to the occurrence of participation fatigue. These findings were strengthened further through a quantitative analysis. The five categories were: 1) participation fatigue due to actions of and interactions with local governments and instances, 2) participation fatigue due to lack of results or slow progress in the process, 3) participation fatigue due to the intensity of the participation, 4) participation fatigue due to lack of enthusiasm of fellow citizens or organizations/businesses, and 5) participation fatigue due to lack of serious uptake of participants’ input.

Therefore, this research aimed to explore how municipalities can better facilitate collective private commissioning (CPC) to respond to the increasing demand for elderly housing in urban areas. <br/><br/>Literature review and desk research were conducted to create a theoretical framework; and to gain more insights into the concept, demand and useful instruments to facilitate CPC projects. CPC can be defined as a social project development method in which a group of future residents jointly have decision making authority and full responsibility for the use of the land and/or the building, the design and (re)development of their own private and public spaces, and sometimes even facilities, in a transformation, renovation, or newly-built housing project. <br/>Based on the theoretical framework, a qualitative study was conducted to discover the motives and experiences of municipalities when facilitating CPC. Seven municipalities were interviewed to create an overview of barriers and opportunities. These barriers and opportunities were made clear based on the theoretical framework.<br/><br/>The results are presented in the form of a list of barriers and opportunities in relation to an instrument quadrant. The findings support the philosophy behind the quadrant: that more than one quadrant results in effective steering. Therefore, the general conclusion on how to better facilitate CPC projects is: to make use of multiple governance and maximize the soft steering aspects. The opportunities that are identified can help (radical, or soft) to better facilitate CPC projects. <br","Facilitate; Municipality; Collective Private Commissioning; CPC; Elderly","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

This is the first standard for daylight in buildings for Europe. In the Netherlands it will replace the NEN 2057. The determination method for daylight provision for EN 17037 is based on internal illuminance. Additional ambitions for the design quality factors: view, direct sunlight and the prevention of glare have been added to the standard. A sustainable design is all about balancing daylight performance and energy consumption. Large windows will cause the building to overheat and use too much cooling energy. Too small windows will result in low levels of daylight availability and visual comfort. For this reason, it was still unclear whether it is possible to achieve these new recommendations for daylight and at the same time meet the energy requirements for Green building certificates, such as BREEAM and LEED. The main aim of this research was therefore to investigate how much influence the European standard has on the energy consumption of a typical office building and whether the requirements for BREEAM and LEED can still be met. <br/>The analysis shows that the European standard has an influence on the daylight and energy credits for BREEAM and LEED. For the daylight credits this standard has a positive influence. For the minimum performance level for daylight provision for the European standard this is not yet enough to meet the requirements for daylight provision for BREEAM and LEED. For BREEAM and LEED, the variants only meet the requirements if the medium and high recommendation levels for the European standard are met. However, the ASE is often too high for a design that meets the high performance level for EN 17037. It should also be taken into account that when a certain performance level for daylight provision has been achieved for the European standard using method 2 (based on internal illuminance per hour for a typical year) this same variant will usually score lower with method 1 (based on daylight factors).<br/>The energy consumption goes up when the recommendation level for the European standard is higher. When comparing the average energy consumption of variants with the minimum performance level for the European norm with the high performance level, the total energy consumption goes up 8.33 kWh/m2 . These values can be higher or lower with different orientations. To reduce the negative impact of the European standard on BREEAM and LEED, certain parameters for the design can be chosen differently. The most important parameters for meeting the high-performance level and minimizing primary fossil energy consumption is the window-to-wall ratio and width/depth ratio. To find a balance between daylight and energy consumption, the optimal width/depth ratio is between 1.33 and 0.75. The optimum window-to-wall ratio is between 40% and 60%. To reduce the cooling consumption and ASE even more, designers can consider the introduction of overhangs in the façade, or other interventions that reduce the window SHGC. <br","EN 17037; BREEAM; LEED; Daylight provision; Energy consumption","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

Combined with a high temperature, this can lead to water shortage. Due to climate change, this is expected to worsen, as areas become drier and temperatures increase. One of the regions where this problem occurs is the region of North-East Africa. In this region, water stress is expected to increase in the (near) future due to an increase in demand for water and a decrease of the availability. While most of these countries depend on a shared water source, transboundary cooperation is lacking. A regional strategy, to create a common framework, is needed to cope with this regional problem which can strengthen long term resilience. This thesis tries to find which elements are crucial when creating a regional strategy for these regions.<br/><br/>North-East Africa has many regional differences: while the countries Sudan and Egypt are mainly dependent on water from the Nile, Libya lacks freshwater sources and depends on groundwater. Regional differences like this are why it is difficult to create one strategy which addresses the whole region at once. This is why it is important to zoom in and see what local cities or regions specifically need. By zooming in, these local differences can be, together with challenges on a larger scale, form a strategy with which the regional can tackle water shortage.<br/> <br/>The strategy itself contains three main aspects; priorities, outcomes and outputs. The six main priorities can be used to set goals for both the larger and smaller scale for both present and future, and can help decisionmakers link other topics to this common goal. The outcomes are linked to both these priorities, as well as the SDG’s, to improve the connectivity to other future policies and action plans. Outputs in this strategy are directly linked to the outcomes to provide input about how these outcomes are achievable. These outputs, also known as actions, are either spatial or policies. To illustrate the effect and possibilities of spatial actions, the Greater Cairo region is investigated on a smaller scale. This is done by looking into four main types which illustrate the various forms of urban fabric in the city. <br/><br/>The main findings of this thesis are that a regional strategy in arid regions should take into account aspects on both small and large scale, as well as tackling issues in the present and future. Only by constantly switching between scales and time, a coherent and functioning strategy can be created.<br","arid climate; Water shortage; Transboundary basins; regional design; Resilience; Justice","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Complex Cities","",""

To get a better sense of how seismic data can contain this information, we need to look at how long before an earthquake seismic precursor signals can exist. This paper uses an LSTM model to perform binary classification of the task: ”Given the seismic wave recordings of N stations during T seconds, will an earthquake happen after H seconds?” By varying the parameter H and studying its effect on the prediction accuracy of the NN, results suggest that sensitive information is very present in the seismic data 10 to 15 minutes before a low-magnitude (less than 2.5 on Richters scale) earthquake strikes. We aim to open the way for further research about precursor-based earthquake prediction using neural networks, showing that LSTM can be a good option.

In this new system, the building parts of today are used to construct the buildings of tomorrow. Reusing building parts requires knowing the qualities of those materials. However, the current AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) industry does not know what data is required to reuse building components and how this influences processes of modelling and decommissioning parties. Therefore, this research aims to answer the following question: “Which data is needed for circular component reuse and how does this data requirement influence the management of a BIM in new construction projects?” The goal of this report is to construct an ILS (Information Delivery System. Original Dutch name: Informatie Leverings Specificatie) that provides data requirements for reuse of building components.<br/>To answer this question two organisation types are interviewed: linear building organisations and modular building organisations. The linear companies construct projects with a permeant aim whereby building parts are not redeployed in subsequent lifecycles. Modular organisations, on the other hand, construct high-quality modular assets whereby building components and elements are reused a lifecycle. By interviewing both typologies the data requirements and process could be described and compared to construct a new ILS and process. <br/>The interviews expressed the data requirements and structures of both organisations. These inputs are processed and the “Circular Reuse ILS+” and “Circular Reuse ILS+” are constructed. These documents describe data requirements of digital models to ensure that building components could be reused. Implementation of these documents increases the length, complexity, and costs of the design phases since more properties and digital models should be created and stored during these phases. The disassembly phase, contrastingly, benefits from the data and documents prescribed by the ILS+ given that more information is available for the construction of redeployment plans and analysis of the qualities of the released components. During the use phase of an asset, data should be maintained to ensure that it could be reused in future lifecycles. However, the qualities, requirements, definition, and responsibilities of this data maintenance are still unknow. Future research could focus on data maintenance to ensure that all data could be used in a perfect circular world. <br","Circulair economy; IFC; BIM; ILS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

This paper studies the impact of tailoring explanations according to human performance in a well-defined collaborative human-agent teaming (HAT) urban search-and-rescue (USAR) task environment. A controlled experiment was conducted in a between-subject manner, with two different agent implementations, where it was hypothesised that when an agent provides explanations tailored to human performance, the collaborative performance, the trust towards the agent and the individual satisfaction of the human would increase. Results of the experiment confirmed that this is indeed the case for explanation satisfaction, however, not necessarily for trust and performance metrics. The conclusions also included that the tailoring resulted in a decreased collaborative performance. The research contributes to the bigger picture of how tailoring explanations to various factors, would have an impact on the overall collaborative performance and systematic actualisation of HAT.","Explainable AI; Tailoring Explanations; Human-Agent Teamwork; human-agent interaction,","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

EvoSuite is a test case generating tool developed to address this [18]. It can generate test cases for different test criteria - Line Coverage, Branch Coverage, Input Diversity, etc. Branch Coverage puts the focus on covering branches in the code, whilst Input Diversity puts the focus on the use of diverse inputs as parameters in the test cases. The downside is that the user needs to select the best suited test criteria, out of the many that EvoSuite provides, for the classes under test. It is not feasible for the user to manually find the optimal one for the classes under test. This paper aims to shine a light on the effectiveness of the combination of Input Diversity and Branch Coverage as a test criteria. This study presents a machine learning technique to automatically select the best combination of test generation objectives according to static metrics. The model we chose for this task is a decision tree as it directly provides a pattern. Said pattern is a combination of conditions that the static metrics need to hold for the chosen test criteria to be effective. The evaluation of the effectiveness was done one a benchmark of 346 classes taken from SF-110 Corpus of Classes [9] and the Appache Commons. To evaluate the effectiveness of Input Diversity in combination with Branch Coverage, we compared the test criteria to two other test criteria - Branch Coverage and the Default coverage criteria used in EvoSuite. The decision tree models created achieve an accuracy upwards of 90% in the best case and deem metrics such as wmc, dit, fanin and others to be crucial for the effectiveness of Input Diversity in combination with Branch Coverage.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

To prevent the destruction in Binckhorst from repeating in future, a strategy is needed that allows easier transformation of the area and buildings to meet the demands of future stakeholders.

Applying the flexible building strategy offers a possible solution, as it aims to extend the life of a building through its adaptability, and adding a public performance space in Binckhorst will broaden the dynamics of the area, by introducing entertainment as a function. However, the use of this strategy in music halls has been limited, as there are special requirements for structure, space and materials in order for these spaces to perform well. Moreover, the overarching characteristic of today’s flexible buildings is that they are nondescript in their architectural appearance and usage.

This phenomenon is highly subjective, and its detection is really important due to the internal understanding of the human mind that can be obtained. Several methods have been used in order to detect mind-wandering, such as thought probes, self-reports, electrophysiological measures or even eye-based tracking methods, however the detection of mind-wandering solely from sound has not been researched about. Therefore, this study is going to investigate if automatic detection of mind-wandering through sound is feasible. In this work, this question is tackled through a machine learning approach, where a linear SVM model is trained through acoustic features. Two methods of oversampling are considered, due to the high data imbalance between the classes, and these two are evaluated and compared. The approach is evaluated through different metrics, such as recall, precision, F1-score and accuracy, but also a comparison with other techniques is done. Results of this work show that sound as its own is not a reliable way of automatically detecting mind-wandering. These results however, might be implementation specific, as the ground truth values of mind-wandering were created through the means of perceived mind-wandering, and the techniques of random oversampling and SMOTE were also used. These could be causes of unreliability of the research. Future work should should take this into consideration and also apply this approach to a different data set, to assess its feasibility.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

Bias can be observed when an ASR system performs worse on a subset of its speakers compared to the rest rather than having the same overall generalization for everyone. This can be seen by using Word Error Rates (WER) as a metric. Depending on the ASR system in question the type of bias differs. However, techniques have been proposed and shown to succeed in reducing WER, and subsequently bias, by the use of data augmentation techniques for the recorded speech. These techniques perturb the audio in a certain way. Afterward, it is added to a model's training set and the model is retrained with the added data. One such technique is SpecSwap. This paper explores how using SpecSwap affects the WER performance of a hybrid-model ASR system using the JASMIN-CGN dataset's West-Dutch region. For comparison, a state-of-the-art data augmentation technique, VTLP, was also used, which has been shown to be effective in other cases. The experiments both led to a consistent WER increase. Therefore it was concluded that the data provided for the region was too little for the augmentation policy to be effective in any of the subcategories or in the overall performance of the system. However, SpecSwap shows potential in mitigating the widely discussed gender bias in ASR systems by reducing the difference between male and female speakers' WER.","Speech recognition; bias; bias reduction; speech augmentation; WER; SpecSwap","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

This paper focuses on improving ASR performance for NRAD (Northern regional accented Dutch) speech, training on speakers from the region of Overijssel. To achieve this improvement, the corpus data is augmented using Vocal Tract Length Perturbation (VTLP), which entails randomly warping the frequency of each recording using a factor in the range [0.9, 1.1]. The baseline and augmented ASR systems are trained using trigram GMM-HMM (Gaussian mixture model hidden Markov models) through the Kaldi toolkit on the DelftBlue supercomputer. This leads to improvements on word error rates (WER) for all speaker groups and styles, with an overall relative improvement of 14,64% and the biggest improvement observed for male speakers - from 25.15% WER to 19,68% WER. The impact of this augmentation on other accents and non-accented speech is not explored.

This approach is evaluated through different setups, datasets, and other machine learning models: CART, random forests, and XGBoost.

According to their residents, the circulation space can be impersonal and the use of the elevator can be experienced as annoying. Even though this is the place to see and meet your neighbours. It has also been proven that there is a relationship between living in a high-rise and poor mental health of children.

This concluded that design 3 performed thermally as expected but design 1 and 2 performed worse, due to a flaw in the computer modelling. Converting the force to the maximum distributed load showed that all designs could handle the wind load. The materials were also tested on ageing due to UV rays.

EvoSuite is an example of a state-of-the-art tool that synthesises test cases automatically. It uses a genetic algorithm to produce test cases based on given search targets. Previous studies have analysed the performance of single or combinations of targets but have not yet explored the differences between various combinations. In this research, we compare the Weak Mutation + Branch setting to Branch and the Default (combination of eight separate targets) of EvoSuite. We aim to provide insightful information about their differences in branch coverage and mutation scores. Moreover, we discuss machine-learning models that can predict which combination has the highest score (i.e., branch coverage, mutation score) based on characteristics of the tested classes, such as the number of lines of code. Our results highlight that the Weak Mutation + Branch combination outperforms Branch for the mutation score metric and Default for the branch coverage metric. They also show that Weak Mutation + Branch is outperformed by the branch criterion for Branch Coverage and by the Default combination for mutation score. Our findings also cover the performance of the models, having concluded that the Random Forest and Decision Tree classifiers produce the best results and are feasible options for predicting the best combinations from the ones analysed. Finally, static code metrics such as 'wmc', 'loc', and 'mathOperationsOty' often appear as relevant features for our models. We visualise how they influence the most suitable combination of criteria through our Decision Trees.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

In this research, we study the effectiveness of an agent capable of modelling human trust and tailoring explanations to influence it. We achieve this by modifying an existing HAT environment and setting up an experiment comparing a trust and baseline agent. Modelling human trust is calculated through the number of suggestions ignored. When the model estimates low trust, more explanation types are used during communication. Higher trust uses fewer explanation types in order to save time. However, the results indicate no difference between the baseline and trust agent rejecting the hypothesis. A potential cause for the rejection can be found in either a flaw in the agents' design or information overload.","user-aware XAI; human-agent team; trust; XAI; tailoring explanations","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

The classic cen- tralized implementation would involve sending the data to a centralized server where the model would be trained. However, that would involve breach- ing the privacy and confidentiality of the patients and their data, and would be unacceptable. There- fore, Federated Learning (FL), a ML technique that trains ML models in a distributed setting without data every leaving the host device, would be a bet- ter alternative to the centralized option. In this ML technique, only parameters and certain meta- data would be communicated. In spite of that, there still exist attacks that can infer user data using the parameters and metadata. A fully privacy preserv- ing solution involves homomorphically encrypting (HE) the data communicated. This paper will focus on the performance loss of training a FL-GAN with three different types of homomorphic encryption: Partial Homomorphic Encryption (PHE), Some- what Homomorphic Encryption (SHE), and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). We will also test the performance loss of Multi Party Computations (MPC), as it has homomorphic properties.

The comparison is carried out by two programming experiments that each apply one of the programming paradigms to create an HTTP server. The comparison of these programs show that EHOP improves the readability, maintainability and modularity but decreases the performance in response time and memory.

Manual software testing is severely time-consuming, and developers often underestimate its importance. Consequently, many tools for automatic test generation have been developed during the past decade. EvoSuite is a state-of-the-art tool for automatic generation of unit tests. It can produce test suites based on chosen coverage criteria, also known as a fitness function. Previous studies have widely assessed the performance of the different fitness functions available in EvoSuite. However, the combination of various coverage criteria has not been considered. In this paper, we assess the effectiveness of the combination of Branch coverage and Output diversity fitness functions. We compare it to two of the most popular fitness functions in EvoSuite - Branch coverage and the Default configuration (combines eight coverage criteria) to estimate its performance. We developed a machine learning tool that determines which fitness function will achieve better results based on class characteristics. The assessment criteria we consider are branch coverage and fault detection, represented by mutation score. We further examined how the time limit affects the performance of the considered fitness functions. The results have shown that the combination of Branch coverage and Output diversity outperforms the Default configuration significantly in branch coverage but has worse performance in fault detection capabilities. We have also found that the Branch and Output diversity coverage criteria achieve better results when compared with only using Branch coverage in terms of mutation score. Additionally, the static software metrics, especially CBO, LCOM* and LOC, are highly correlated with the performance of the fitness functions and can predict which coverage criteria will achieve better results.","Testing; Software testing; EvoSuite; Code Metrics","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

As this model is able to provide perpetual affordable housing through collaboration between local residents, local authorities and civil experts, the statement could be made that this model develops and maintains housing that is centred around place community to a neighbourhood. This has brought up the idea that CLT might be able to booster social sustainability within this local context. However, the overall concept of social sustainability and the overall impact of the CLT model on social sustainability has both ben limitedly researched. Therefore, the aim of this study is to research the impact of the presence of a CLT on the social sustainability of a neighbourhood by answering the following main research question: How does a CLT impact the social sustainability of a neighbourhood? To answer this question, an operationalisation method based on the innovative Capabilities Approach has been constructed. This operationalisation tool was then deployed to gather information on the impact from a theoretical perspective through a literature review, from an organisational perspective through an expert panel with organisations from the European CLT network, and lastly from the residents’ perspective through a single-case study of a representative case for the classic CLT model. Based on the theoretical and organisational perspectives, the conclusions were drawn that the CLT model has the potential to positively impact most if not all social sustainability capabilities, meaning that the CLT model is able to increase these capabilities for the residents of the CLT. This positive impact, although not as extensive, has also been observed in practice. From the residents’ perspective it was gathered that the CLT model could positively influence the capabilities that have to do with the indicators of accessibility, housing, knowledge &amp; skills, social network &amp; interaction, safety &amp; security, and sense of place, together with participation &amp; democracy. The model is able to do so through implementing frameworks and resources, that could influence social and environmental conversion factors for the better. To be able to provide these frameworks and resources, however, the CLT organisation also needs to have the capability to do so through resources. However, there are limitations to the generalisability of the research findings. This study forms the beginning of a theory on the impact of the CLT model on social sustainability on a neighbourhood level, and further in-depth research is therefore the primary recommendation for future research.","Social sustainability; Collaborative housing; Community Land Trust; Sustainability; Capability approach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

Currently the most reliable way to find social interactions in groups, is to manually annotate the data. Manual annotation takes a lot of time and human resources and as the information stream goes faster and faster, the manual labour cannot keep up. Therefore an automated program to replace this is desirable. One method to automate this, is by looking at the proximity of people, which has been done by Dikker [1]. The results look promising, however they are sensitive to errors. The F1-score (equation 3) is only 0.625 and the precision (equation 5) is 0.696. This means that there are still a lot of false positives. With orientation data one can determine if the people in question are facing each other before they are assigned to be in social interaction. With a view frustum (cone shape) it can be determined who are facing at each other by checking if the cones overlap. This cone can take different sizes, making the view area bigger or smaller. Because the absolute rotation were only used, it was used to find out who cannot face each other. Using the proximity results as a baseline, the impossible orientations were removed. With the goal to reduce the amount of false positives. From the results it can be concluded that a small cone will perform worse compared to the baseline. The bigger the angle of the cone becomes, the closer it gets to the results from Dikker [1]. However, in none of the results it turns out that using absolute orientations improves the current work significantly.","F-formations; Rotation; Social interaction","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

One important part of sharing code is making sure that others who might be interested in it are also able to find it. One way to do that is by adding tags to a repository, which is a feature on GitHub only since 2017. However, many repositories do not have any assigned tags. This can be solved by automatically applying tags to repositories without any. This comes with a problem: what algorithm can complete such a task?<br/><br/>In this study, we attempt to solve this problem using a class of algorithms called Hierarchical Multilabel Classifiers(HMCs). As the name suggests, these are a kind of classifier that can assign multiple labels to one datapoint (repository), but the labels must be organized in a hierarchy. We present 4 different hierarchies and 4 different HMCs to see which combination yields the best results. These combinations are also compared to a non-hierarchical baseline. We find that HMCN-F, one of the HMCs, manages to marginally outperform the baseline with a difference in AUPRC scores of 0,024. While not a groundbreaking result, it is promising, as other methods of creating hierarchies may be able to beat the baseline by a larger margin.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

Nevertheless, the signal is heavily influenced by external factors, which increase in an crowded environment. This paper introduces three different noise reduction filters that try to detect the kind of noise and therefore improve the detection of surrounded devices. Further, this paper looks at the overall impact of proximity on the resulting RSSI values. Knowing this relationship helps to normalize the values and therefore eliminates the need to apply noise reduction. Using a dataset of 48 sensors recorded in a conference setting with a specific designed sensor the low frequency pass filter gets an accuracy score of 81.8 % with a cut-off frequency of 0.07 Hz. It performs best when considering a conversation window of 20 seconds. Here, only 2/3 of the detected groups has to coincide with the actual formed group at a specific timestamp.

The experiments show that SpecAugment does not manage to lower the WER (20.8% overall compared to the baseline model, which achieves 19.5% performance), on the contrary, it even increases the bias for age.

The algorithm is implemented in a two-robot system, where one of the robots acts as the anchor and the other acts as the target. The localization algorithm uses velocity measurements of each robot and distance measurements between robots. Using the change in distance between the robots and the velocity of the target robot relative to the anchor robot, the target robot can be localized relative to the anchor robot. The localization algorithm uses a Kalman filter as a state estimator of the movement of the target robot and a Savitzky-Golay filter to filter the distance measurements. A simulation with Gaussian noise in the distance measurements is performed to display the impact of the filtering methods. Another simulation showed an average localization error of 1.38 meters when the distance measurements are acquired through RSSI measurements, which is comparable to existing RSSI-based localization methods.","Localization; single-anchor; Kalman Filter; RSSI","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

Beirut is a city of perpetual unrest and resultantly under decay. Layers of its rich culture are gradually lost. Yet, culture is one of the strongest elements that unites and ties Beirutians together. Therefore, it should be stored and preserved. Storing of a rather abstract entity such as culture has similarities with storing goods or objects but it also requires a unique approach. The proposed building program: “Post-digital Depot” serves this specific need, as an archive in which material objects are analyzed, restored and translated to a digital medium.","preservation through digitalization; inclusion through digitalization; inclusion through creative culture; digital archive for heritage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Complex Projects","",""

(mentor); Rutten, M.M. (graduation committee); Lanzafame, R.C.

The flood events of 1993 and 1995 occurred in the winter, while that of 2021 occurred in the summer. There are large differences in the characteristics of these floods separated by nearly three decades; not only the seasons differ, but the topography of the river bed and the shape of the flood wave have also changed. Since 1995 dikes and flood-routing measures have been constructed along the river. Although all these projects are not yet completed, the flood event of July 2021 indicates that the Meuse projects are producing the expected results. This research aims to understand the effect of the shape of the flood wave during a high-discharge event, the impact of the different types of flood protection along the river and the interaction between the main river and its tributaries. The main research question is: what are the hydrodynamic differences between the high-waters levels on the Meuse in Limburg in 1993, 1995, and 2021, and how can these differences be explained?<br/>The first step to complete this research was to gather the needed information. The second step is to identify the differences between the different flood events and assessing the impact of the different flood protection measures. The third step is to assess the impact of the different flood protection measures.<br/>After an analysis comparing inundation maps, five flood prone areas were identified and investigated, namely: Maastricht, Bunde and Meerssen, Maaseik-Roosteren, Roermond and Venlo. Flood wave characteristics play an important role: the width illustrates the duration of the event, while the height indicates the maximum water level that can be expected. <br/>Theoretical predictions of flood wave behaviour derived by scenario-based simulations with hydraulic models (i.e., report of peak attenuation, evaluation of the Grensmaas and the tool Box of building blocks) were compared with measurement data, water levels, discharges and inundation maps in order to assess if intended effect of certain measures correspond with the measured effect of the flood events of 2021.<br/>The flood event of July 2021, the amount of water already in the river system, before the heavy rainfall in the southern part of the Netherlands, Ahr-Eifel region in Germany, Luxemburg and Eastern part of Belgium, was only approximately 200 m3/s instead of the 600-700 m3/s in 1993 and 1995. This means that there was a large buffer, before the water level increased to dangerous levels. Secondly, the short duration of the flood event in 2021 compared to 1993 and 1995 the increased role of peak attenuation. The flood routing-measures have helped to increase this effectivity due to the fact that more water could be stored in floodplains, high-water channels and retention areas. <br/>For this event it can be concluded that the duration of the flood event in combination with the already executed flood-routing measures have prevented further flooding. <br","Meuse; Floods; Flood Protection; Limburg; 2021","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The flexibility of the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) format makes it challenging to blindly rely on the data it stores. This is because, to allow its flexibility, the stored data in an IFC file can be missing, incorrect, redundant, or stored in vague ways while the file can still be considered format compliant. This missing reliability is an issue for a format that is so central to the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry. This also severely hampers the chances for automated processes to be applied in the AEC industry. Chances that could reduce the time and cost spend on a construction while enlarging its quality. Prior done research on this subject is sparse. The small subset of this research that covers the ”repair” or reliable extraction of IFC data primarily focuses on idealized situations that do not often occur in practice. Due to the combination of these factors, this master thesis attempts to discover if it is possible to extract reliable data from the unreliable IFC files with an automated method. Because of the large flexibility and broadness of the IFC format, the scope of the thesis had to be limited. This was done by focusing on the extraction/reconstruction of storeys (and their elevations), rooms, and apartments. For these three subjects not only extraction/reconstruction methods have been created, but they have also been implemented in an open source software tool1. To develop reliable processes, the processes have to be based upon reliable data. From the data available in the IFC format, the tangible geometry is considered to be the most reliable. However, not all the other data can be discarded. Only the data that is implicitly stored in the tangible geometry can be ignored without losing information. In practice this means that most, if not all, topologic data and a subset of the semantic data can be ignored. It was found that for the extraction/reconstruction of storeys (and their elevations), a z-value extraction based on created IfcSlab/IfcRoof groups was fairly effective. These groups were made based on their size, height, and location. This process does show a lowered reliability in buildings with complex storey structures. It was found that for the extraction/reconstruction of rooms, a voxelization approach functioned very well. The boolean refinement that followed, which took the shape from a rough voxelization to the precise room shape, showed some reliability issues. Finally, it was found that for the extraction/reconstruction of apartments that rules applied to a created space syntax graph showed promise. The rules that were used were simple, resulting in lower reliability in structures that had more complex room relationships. In conclusion, this research has been unable to give a definite answer to the issues at hand. However, all three the subjects that have been covered showed promising results and can be considered steps towards a solution.","IFC; Automation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Uganda’s capital Kampala, is grappling with the effects of rapid urbanisation fueled by the population explosion that has transpired over the recent years. Due to the continued futility of urban planning efforts, the city’s growth has proceeded with minimal planning intervention, resulting in multiple urban development challenges.<br/>Kampala’s urbanisation is therefore largely informal, a trend that manifests most prominently in the housing sector. The perennial housing shortage has left most urbanites fighting for space within the city’s ever-growing informal settlements, which are typically situated in wetlands and are characterized by a lack of basic services and an absence of social and economic infrastructure. In addition to wetland encroachment, poor waste management and unsustainable settlement patterns, the increased downpour due to climate change has further exacerbated the flooding risk faced by the city. <br/>This research posits that urban flooding, along with other challenges is merely a consequence of unsustainable spatial planning practices. A critical review of Kampala’s planning history traces the underlying issue as that of spatial segregation; a problem with the outcomes of planning, and non-implementation; a problem with the planning processes. Although inherited from colonial times, these issues create and further propel the conflict between formal and informal practices which, more often than not, run parallel to each other.<br/>Thus, the research explores how a new strategic framework that combines both the formal and informal practices can guide towards the successful implementation of future spatial plans. The proposal set forth is to test the Pattern Language (PL) methodology as a tool that can be used to combine the practices. In line with the PL methodology, the research documents, communicates and translates the practices. The outcome is a pattern language of flood resilience practices in the Nakivubo Wetland area, which patterns are then communicated to the relevant stakeholders through a workshop held between the local residents of the wetland communities and representatives from the formal institutions. This results into the pattern field, which is also the framework that combines the formal and informal practices. Lastly, the patterns are translated into design principles that are used to develop a spatial vision for the Nakivubo Wetland area and, through the framework, guide towards its successful implementation.<br","Formal practices; Informal practices; Informal settlements; Pattern Language; Wetland Management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","","0.347596, 32.582520"

Once a small village, Umm Al Fahem developed to be the third-largest Arab city in the state of Israel. It endured several hegemony stages of occupation and mandates, which shaped its socio-spatial systems through the years. The social and spatial features created a system of segregation and inaccessibility within the different scales of the city, mainly reflected in the core of the city. Therefore, given the long history of the city and its constant unplanned spatial growth, and its important cultural familial heritage, the city core gradually became impenetrable to those who do not live in it, socially and spatially.

Those are left-over or side-effect spaces, which have many programs but are not programmed. They emerged over time as a consequence of placing other primal and secondary objects. They become used by different agents in unprogrammed or instinctive ways. Due to their undefined nature, they become places of possibilities, change, freedom, and availability.<br/><br/>The aspect of time plays an important role both in creating them, and in their constant development. Firstly, they are created as a consequence of many layers of elements assembled at different time periods. They form a three-dimensional patchwork of layers of history, human actions, nature’s impact, and urban and architectural decisions. All the different layers leave traces on the site, which have an impact on one another.<br/><br/>Their constant transformation never ends. Those spaces always evolve. Even if the primal elements do not change for a period- new human activities are always emerging there. This is a fundamental aspect of the intervals- they give a sense of freedom and possibility. The agents feel liberated to express themselves and use the space in an undesigned way and sometimes even random.<br/><br/>This thesis focused on first defining and exploring the Interval Spaces and later using them to analyse the Project Site and imply their spatial logic into Architectural Design. A site in Marseille city center was mapped and analysed. It contained ancient ruins from various periods. The design focused on creating a spatial situation that would enable experiencing them in a completely new way. The logic of Interval Spaces was used to create spatiality and the experience for the visitors. This approach helped to create a completely new approach to designing with ancient ruins, but also to create new way of forming spatiality. Lastly, it explored and showed a new way of looking at sites. The site is no longer a modernist tabula rasa where a new project emerges in isolation to what used to be there, but it is a space full of traces of the past, which when taken into account in the new project can only add an enrich it. <br","in between space; spatiality; spatial situation; acient ruins; ruins; city; mapping; drawing; design through drawing; design through mapping; Borders & Territories; interval; interval space; left over; side effect; traces; layers; time; space; body; body moving through space","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Borders and Territories","","43.297680, 5.374596"

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","After software defined networking (SDN) separated the control-plane from the dataplane, P4 was proposed as a solution to be able to program the data-plane. The programmable data plane (PDP) is very useful to alter the behaviour of programmable network devices. The drawback, however, is that without virtualization only one single P4 program can run at a time on the PDP. Compiler based and hypervisor based approaches can be used to virtualize the P4 data-plane to let P4 programs run alongside each other. This increases the flexibility when compared to P4, but can potentially come with added risks. Hypervisor based approaches share resources, while compiler based approaches try to minimize the sharing of resources. This opens up hypervisor based approaches, like HyperVDP and Hyper4, to attacks from a corrupt P4 program. Because of the resource sharing, when one of the virtualized P4 programs in HyperVDP is corrupted, there potentially is a risk that the other virtualized programs also get influenced. This paper will attempt to answer the question; can a malicious P4 program corrupt behaviour of another P4 program while running alongside each other. This will be done by laying out a method to answer this question using HyperVDP. A repository containing the updated source code of HyperVDP will also be created and provided to allow for a stable framework.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

Tremor is a frequent and severe symptom in patients suffering from CIDP. There is limited and contradictory data regarding the effect of tremor on treatment of the underlying polyneuropathy, and on treatment specifically aimed at neuropathic tremor. The pathophysiology of the CIDP tremor is unknown, but there are speculations about both a peripheral and central origin. From previous studies, it is seen that if a tremor’s frequency is substantially load-independent, entrained exclusively by comparable driving frequencies, and only minimally phase-reset by torque pulses, it is considered to be primarily of central origin. A wrist perturbation study using a wrist manipulator was conducted on CIDP patients, with tremors (n=8) and without tremors (control, n=8) to address these speculations, and to understand the characteristics of this neuropathic tremor. The perturbation study involved studying the effects of entrainment perturbations, spring loading via changing the virtual spring stiffness, ramp-and-hold stretches to evoke stretch reflexes, along with the estimation of admittance. The entrainment task showed subharmonic and superharmonic peaks of power spectral densities of EMG in<br/>tremor subjects. Compared to controls, the tremor patients had significantly reduced stiffness, which could be attributed by the loss of muscle strength, and thus the tremor advertently affects muscle activation. No significant difference in M1, and M2 amplitude responses, and reflex latencies were found between the tremor and control group.","Peripheral Neuropathy; Tremors; Stretch Reflex","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Neurological disorders, such as Epilepsy and Parkinson’s, are currently treated using pharmaceuticals. However, drugs have a low specificity and lose their effectiveness after several years. In addition, prolonged drug usage often leaves patients with many side-effects and complications. Development in neuroscience indicate the treatment of such neurological disorders via neuro-stimulation. Currently, research in understanding the mechanisms behind neuronal stimulation is carried out by research institutes all around the globe. There are three modes for neuronal stimulation, electrical, optical and lastly the use of ultrasonic waves. As optogenetics provides a more specific technique in neuronal stimulation and electrical recording can provide high spatial resolution data, it is sought to combine this two modes.<br/>This work reports the development of a monolithically fabricated active implant, with optogenetic compatibility using transfer-free graphene electrodes. To achieve this desired goal, a microfabrication process is developed, which is reproducible and scalable with modern day microfabrication technology. In order to be compatible with optogenetics, graphene electrodes are used, as these are transparent and allow for neuronal stimulation using light. The graphene electrodes are grown on a pre-defined molybdenum catalyst, allowing for a transfer-free chemical vapor depostion (CVD) of graphene. Microelectrode-arrays (MEAs) are developed, using graphene electrodes, that include different sized electrodes and different amount of electrodes. The amount being constrained by the available space on the cortex of a mouse.<br/>The aim of this work was to be able to control or read out these MEAs using electronics developed alongside the electrodes. As graphene is grown at a temperature above the melting point of aluminium, conventional CMOS technology can not be used in combination with graphene electrodes. The process developed, did not include any materials which would be damaged during the graphene growth. The metal gate is replaced by a polysilicon gate and the metal interconnects connecting the active devices and the MEAs are defined after the growth of graphene. Resulting in an active implant which is monolithically fabricated in combination with a transfer-free graphene process.<br/>Monolithically fabricating an active graphene based implant, comes with complications. Delamination of the passivisation layer occurred whilst trying to open contact openings to and from the active devices. This was resolved using a more appropriate chemical etchant.<br/>A fully monolithically fabricated active graphene-based implant was obtained. Electrical measurements showed that the active devices did not behave as expected. Revisiting simulations, it was established that there was leakage of dopants from the gate to the channel. This results in the NMOS devices to be always on and the PMOS devices to have a higher threshold voltage.<br/>However, this particular wafer, had many high temperature steps after the doping of the polysilicon. Reduction of these high temperature steps result in less doping getting into the channel. Alternatively, a thicker gate oxide can be used, to serve as a more robust barrier. A last proposed solution is the reduction of the doping concentration and doping energy of the polysilicon, which would result in less dopant being near the gate oxide interface and thus less dopant leaking into the channel.<br/>There are wafers included in this work with less high temperature steps.

Various car manufactures already have released level 2 autonomous vehicles meaning that the future is not that far away. An essential part of driving is of course detecting and obeying the traffic signs. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) like speed limit detection systems or a more advanced variant the Traffic Sign Detection (TSD) systems are integrated in top-of-the-line car models in order to increase safety and relieve some ofthe drivers workload. These systems attempt to make drivers aware of incoming signs on the road and warn them against possible danger or in some cases even take control over the vehicle. As in many computer vision systems differences in lighting, weather conditions, motion blur, and poor image quality can reduce the effectiveness of these systems. In case of the Traffic Sign Detection systems other challenges arise like differences in sign position and in the condition (dirty, deformed, discolored etc.) of the sign itself. In order to fully rely on such system all these challenges have to be overcome. The goal of this thesis is to enhance a traffic sign detection model that requires relatively low processing power in such a manner that it can compete with traffic sign models that show great results and achieve high accuracy but require high processing power maintaining the ability to operate in real time. The suggested BoBT method increases the accuracy of a model at the cost of inference speed. There is a small difference in precisely localizing the traffic signs compared to state of the art models but in terms of detecting traffic signs the difference is less than a percent with the highest accuracy model. Not to mention that it still outperforms these models in terms of speed.<br/><br","Traffic Sign Detection; SSD MobileNet v1; BoBT","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering","",""

This way, organisations can adopt product customisation while keeping the advantages of mass production. Furthermore, those platforms create supplier networks that enable more efficient retention and exploitation of knowledge, leading to continuous improvement in product development. Firms that in traditional construction compete in IHB collaborate within the platform. However, the integration strategies that the product platform owner utilises to integrate this supplier network are underexplored by academics. In addition, the aspects of the IHB product platforms to be integrated are not sufficiently described. The research fills this gap by complementing existing research and conducting case studies from practice. Two case studies assess supplier networks in the platform, their level of integration and suppliers’ role in product platform development. The place of origin of those platforms differs; one is based in Sweden, and the second one is in the Czech Republic. It provides a broader scope of study and variability of setting. Several objectives and challenges for integrations are discovered in the three strategic levels that influence the strategy formulation. The thesis provides an integration strategy framework for platform owners who strive to establish or strengthen such a product platform. The framework will make it easier for platform owners to navigate ways to build and integrate relationships across the supply chain.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The brief of this year’s studio addresses the National Bank of Belgium located on the border of upper and lower parts of Brussels. The current fortress like megastructure that the bank occupies is imposing power and solidity, but is closing itself completely from the public. With the traditional role of the bank such as printing and storage of currency being relocated outside of the city and finance transitioning to virtual mediums, the National Bank of Belgium seeks to both redefine itself physically and at the same time rethink its role in the society. The future bank is a catalyst of change which would affect the city in various scales - through the future economy, society’s attitude and awareness.<br/><br/>Social equality and justice are among the foundations of the doughnut economy model which the bank and the city of Brussels strive for. However, currently the national bank is merely touching upon this aspects of the model. The national bank fails to positively contribute to the above stated core values, fails to fulfil its mission as a socially responsible and inclusive institution. Moreover, the money-based market system fails to reward many types of critical work—the work of building strong communities, revitalising neighbourhoods, preserving the environment, advancing social justice, and sustaining democracy. Therefore, I asked myself the question what is there to be done to positively influence this model and where is it lacking attention at the moment so the bank could respond to this.<br/><br/>In order to meet these societal, environmental needs, my proposal for the national bank of Belgium is to offer opportunities for fostering more equitable and inclusive economic order alongside with the money-based market within the institution. This way the bank typology goes back to its roots and once again becomes a place of exchange for the public. An exchange of values, knowledge, skills, experience, time. The bank accommodates different alternatives of dealing with the value of things. If we are going to actually rethink the economy in our society, then the idea of fostering alternative banking such as time banking, using local currencies, community banking, community funding bartering in the National Bank of Belgium is already a beginning of putting an emphasis on the fact that there is value in other things apart from money.<br/><br/>The national bank becomes an inclusive space without hierarchies where people are welcomed to express themselves, take part into the alternative banking, protest even by being part of the what might be called a city forum. The project for the national bank aims to engage citizens to come together to form communities and to take part in the micro banking. It becomes a transparent and active institution which fosters other monetary systems apart from the money based one. The national bank becomes an active part of the citizen’s daily life and not just for its employees as it was functioning until now.<br","Interiors Buildings Cities; future bank; national bank of Belgium","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Interiors Buildings Cities","","50.848825, 4.359884"

The numbers of solo dwellers; solo-dwelling elderly; and people living in cities, especially cities with populations under five million, will also increase (WHO, 2018).

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Adaptive proton therapy (APT) removes one of the most significant sources of inaccuracy in treatment delivery, which is using a treatment plan based on an outdated patient anatomy. Adapting the plan throughout the treatment is crucial for delivering an optimal dose to the patient, whose anatomy is constantly changing. This is especially true for proton therapy, where the delivered dose is highly dependent on the range accuracy. Imaging and plan adaptation must be performed online, immediately before the dose delivery, to take maximum advantage of the benefits of APT. The main problem with online APT is that adaptation of the treatment plan takes too long. Therefore, automation of the processes is required to ensure they can be executed adequately in a short time frame.<br/><br/>Deep learning methods have been successfully applied in two processes required for adaptation, namely the definition of structure contours on a CT scan and determining an optimal dose distribution for a given anatomy. Since a treatment plan is dependent on the locations of the different structures, dose prediction methods rely on manually defined contours, which are not available for daily CT scans in APT due to time limitations. This research aims to develop an approach that determines an optimal dose distribution for prostate cancer patients without using manual structure contours.<br/><br/>We use 3D U-Nets for image segmentation and registration as methods for defining the contours on an image. We use another 3D U-Net to predict an optimal dose distribution, which can use predicted or manually defined contours as input. In addition to this, we use two multitask learning approaches that allow one network to perform both contour definition and dose prediction, which makes it possible to share information between the tasks. The first approach is a cross-stitch network that allows two networks to share feature maps if this is beneficial and the second approach is a w-net that consecutively performs contour definition and dose prediction, using the predicted contours for the dose prediction.<br/><br/>The manual contour based dose prediction performed well in the area around the structures, resulting in a test set average 2%/2mm gamma pass rate of 93.4% ± 3.2% and a Dmean prediction error of 0.45% ± 0.36% in the prostate. The average errors for predicting measures such as D95 and V95% in the targets range from 1% to 3%. <br/><br/>The best method for predicting optimal dose distributions without manual contours is to first predict the contours on the CT scan and use those contours for the dose prediction. However, dose predictions based on predicted contours are significantly worse than those based on manual contours, having a 2%/2mm gamma pass rate of 83.8% ± 6.9% and a Dmean prediction error of 0.92% ± 0.7% in the prostate. Their average errors for predicting measures such as D95 and V95% range from 7% to 20%, which makes these predicted dose distributions too inaccurate to be helpful for treatment planning. This shows that dose prediction relies heavily on accurate knowledge of the structure locations, considering the predicted contours have similar quality as those from state-of-the-art methods.<br/><br/>Dose predictions have not improved by additionally learning a network the contour definition task. Using feature maps from other networks via cross-stitch units had no advantageous effect on the predicted dose distributions, mainly because dose predictions not based on structure masks were too bad for it to have any effect. The dose predictions from the w-net did not improve after the segmentation and dose prediction networks were trained together, which could be because the dose prediction loss could not improve the segmentation sufficiently. The main conclusion is that multi-task learning can only benefit related tasks if they can already be performed independently to a certain extent. It is not a substitute for missing information required to perform the task.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://github.com/thomaslandman/Thesis The codes used for this project","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

(mentor); Bracken, G. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","As one of the essential elements in the ecosystem, water often plays a key role in the formation process of the landscape. The polder landscape is one types of hydrological heritage landscape formed by the interaction of water and human beings. However, with the influence of climate change and human activities, the unique polder landscape has been severely challenged recently. This project will take the polder landscape of the Ningshao Plain, which is situated near the mouth of the Qiantang River in middle-east of China as an example to research how the design can protect the cultural landscape and be adaptive to development at the same time.<br/>The Ningshao Plain is one of the oldest polder areas in China. It is a long and narrow plain developed between the mountains and the sea, which is the result of residence creating arable land conditions for agriculture and struggling against sea invasion for thousands of years. Due to the needs of freshwater storage, transportation, and so on, the area eventually formed a landscape with the dense canal network and multi-level water conservancy systems. Although the system can quickly discharge water from the canal into the sea, when extreme weather such as typhoon comes every summer, cities are still often threatened by floods due to their poor surface discharge capacity; the rapid development of urbanization and the deterioration of the ecological environment also further damaged the morphology of the polder landscape, A large amount of agricultural field was replaced by building blocks so some traditional hydrological system has gradually lost its original function and be abandoned. The large potentials of the polder as cultural landscape was neglect.<br/>Therefore, the design objective is to build a resilient framework taking hydrological heritage landscape as the basis to ensure the preservation of cultural history and sustainable development of Ningshao plain. And the design assignments concludes three aspects:1)increase rainwater recycle capacity 2)build a robust blue-green network 3) Rejuvenate water-related public spaces.<br/>According to the guiding theory of this project, ‘Protecting with planning’, the core design strategy is to taking the historical polder landscape structure as the basis of the framework. So this project focuses more on the research of the spatial characteristics and development process of the polder landscape in the Ningshao Plain, and tries to explore the potentials of the polder landscape. Some principles of form and resiliency will be concluded from the site itself during the analysis process, which are the ‘polder grammar’, and will be experimented in the design of different scales. These design principles will also be combined with some other resilient strategies studied from cases. Finally, this project will provide a reference for how resilient strategy can be applied in design in a way of more adaptive to the local conditions and cultures.","Cultural landscape; Polder grammar; Resilient Landscape Framework; research by design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","",""

Co-operative housing tenure could offer these households both affordable housing and support within the housing project with care. For this research I would explore the following question; How can a fourth-wave feminist housing concept with co-operative housing tenure organise social reproduction spaces to support low-income families who need more time for care? The first wave of feminists utilised architecture to realise their ideas for gender equality, but some also maintained the separation between gender and exclusion of lower-class citizens. The second and third-wave feminists managed to further equal access of all genders to domains dominated by men, but they lost the spatial connection as to why women are economically obstructed from financial independence. Now during the fourth wave, there is a crisis of care related to the distance between facilities and housing, the speculation of real estate and the financial disadvantages of women. The conclusion to this research is a housing concept in which a housing and a work co-op offer the residents different spaces and facilities that offer communal and individual care forms and expression.","Social reproduction; Cooperative housing; Gender discrimination; Care","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Advanced Housing Design","",""

Building information modeling (BIM), augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), the internet of things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Digital twins are all becoming more prevalent in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. Greater digitization introduces additional data flows in construction projects that are collected, analyzed, and exchanged. Furthermore, the construction process, procedures, responsibilities, and obligations of the various stakeholders change. Dealing with the large volumes of data and the changing process necessitates a more robust and efficient data strategy than ever before. Tender documents will comprise, in addition to the standard documentation for physical construction work, several new or revised documents or regulations related to digital construction and data exchange. By understanding and controlling data exchange in projects, project advantages and organization-wide success may be realized. Currently, limited research is done in the field of public procurement and data exchange. Comparative case studies, in particular, have received little attention in this area. <br/><br/>Therefore, this thesis addresses the following research question: “How can contracting authorities (re)design the procurement phases to enhance successful data exchange in construction projects?” Through a theoretical study, followed by in-depth interviews and case studies, an attempt was made to gain insight into two important aspects of the tender: (I) the requirements of the product and process concerning data in the demand specification, and (II) the use of selection and award phase. Interviews with experts were conducted to provide external validation. <br/><br/>The research demonstrated that more attention should be paid to data exchange within public organizations, with a specific focus on asset management. The great majority of contracting authorities lack the necessary maturity to deal with the growing data in projects. In the procurement process, accurate data exchange is not or hardly prioritized, because public organizations are uncertain and even unaware of what they want and of the possibilities. As a result, a lot of data is lost during the life cycle of a building. For data and information management to become a component of asset management, a contracting authority must first pay attention to the softer, cultural, and organizational factors and define an associated organization-wide vision. By formulating unambiguous process and product requirements following the vision, it will be clear to market parties what the assignment entails and what is expected of them. In doing so, clients need to collaborate more with each other and contractors to achieve a successful data exchange.<br","Digitalization; Data; Procurement; Procurement law; Contracting authorities; Construction industry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

APIs that do not keep their promise of adhering to semantic versioning, will unexpectedly break their dependents during upgrading of dependencies. <br/> <br/>We have found that these two types of violations do occur in practice. We find that 24% of analyzed artifacts contain breaking changes and 24% of artifacts contain illegal API extensions. Finally, we show that popularity of a method does not have an impact on breaking changes. <br/> <br/>We conclude that semantic versioning can not always guarantee that upgrading dependencies will not lead to incompatibility.

Witnessing an immense progression and a broad innovative boost in the construction field, creating the perfect link between indoor and outdoor environments. <br/><br/>Given the growth of the world’s population and its constant need to improve the way of living, the demand for new flat glass production, and the replacement of the older ones are rising. However, what is happening at the end-of-life of such architectural glass waste coming from the construction and demolition sector? Α significant amount of post-consumer flat glass waste is generated, which is either down-cycled into low-value applications or discarded at the end of the life cycle, aggravating the existing problem of glass recycling whilst resulting in a significant impact on the ecological footprint.<br/><br/>Glass is a readily recyclable material, that can be remelted and reformed indefinitely into articles with the same quality and properties as the original one, nominating it as a perfect candidate in the transition efforts for a low-carbon environment. Even though the glass packaging industry is a successful recycling market, the same is not true for the floating glass industry, which occupies a more complex position. The vast majority of the remaining waste is rarely recycled into the same product, due to the lack of an organized recycling scheme, the incompatibility of different glass recipes, and the contamination rates of glazed products that could lead to risks in the total production line. <br/><br/>Among the down-recycled or landfilled glass, there is a great proportion of high-value float glass, pointing out the large potential in upgrading the glass recycling process from a linear chain to a circular one. The main scientific contribution of this research is the development and experimental verification with the aim of casting technique, not only new design concepts and engineering their fabrication following the design criteria, but also an ideal recycling collection system for cullets coming from the C&amp;D sector while utilizing tools to check the product’s performance and assessing its life cycle impact to the environment.<br/><br/>The casting method, as a more flexible process, that easily shifts between different recipes, and is less energy-intensive than float line, proves feasible for the fabrication of 100% recycled panels out of post-consumer flat glass waste. These findings are introduced by means of closed-loop alternatives that extend their service life, establishing at the same time the foundation for a circular life-cycle of architectural glass, while can assist as guidelines for further exploration. These components are monolithic elements with higher thickness, compared to the conventional thin-walled glass to tolerate a higher contamination rate, intended for building envelope applications. Their format is adopted and explored through a strategic approach of a translucent composite product, which is made out of specific glass waste layering arrangement between different purity grades of cullet in such a manner to form an advantage tensile strength on the recycled panel, which is transferred on the surfaces and reinforces the object.<br/><br/>Grasping the boundaries of glass recycling, which has been continuously stretching, in the last years, only some primary attempts have been made by TU Delft. These are referred on the fabrication of 3-dimensional strong glass components or glass panels emphasizing the aesthetic result always with the method of casting, unveiling the ambitious potential of glass upcycling for the building sector.<br/><br/>Identifying the scientific gap, the focus of this research is the proper mapping of the current situation of glass recycling, and the identification of the most promising glass C&amp;D waste through experimental research by contacting melting and tools that have not been utilized before. The experimental analysis of the new concept concentrates on the development of the composite panel and the thermal shock testing in uneven temperatures, as the strength of recycled glass has already been investigated previously. Additionally, this concept will be assessed for further analysis and understanding of the whole effectiveness of the proposed supply chain of this recycling method, which is carried out for the first time.<br/><br/>The development of the new composite panel and its experimental evaluation displayed strong findings for further exploration. This thesis set-up could be a promising strategy for float glass recyclability but also in this product’s performance, for transcending the main barriers of flat glass refusal owing to either impurities or different glass synthesis, while it is aligned with the 2050 Dutch policy of zero waste in the construction field and the European guidelines linked to the sustainable movement. Recovering discarded glass in cast glass products opens new paths to reintroduce such waste back to the supply chain, as a closed-loop approach.<br","Glass Recycling; construction and demolition waste; Float Glass; Sustainability; Circularity; Embodied Carbon; Thermal Shock; Glass Casting; Upcycling; Closed loop; Cullet","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","",""

Of particular interest in this thesis are the site specific cultural and institutional factors that create national differences. The influence of national context may need to be considered when global workplace strategies are formed in order to adequately address employee needs and preferences. Understanding the effect of national context on employee workplace preferences could foreshadow the acceptance (or lack thereof) of various post-pandemic workplace strategies and allow organizations to implement nuanced and contextualized solutions in the workplace. To answer the research question a literature review, statistical analysis, and expert interviews are completed. A literature review and statistical analysis of employee workplace preference data found similarities and differences in employee workplace preferences across national contexts in this sample. The preference for hybrid working was found across national contexts, while specific preferences relating to workplace components and facilities and services often varied between contexts in this case. Although the data reflected significant differences in employee post pandemic workplace preferences across the national contexts surveyed, it remains inconclusive if these differences can be attributed to national context or a myriad of other factors. In order to understand how workplace strategy may accommodate and better understand national context’s effect on the workplace, nine experts were interviewed. From the interviews a number of recommendations were formed to promote nuanced workplace strategy that responds to national context: 1) convey the benefits of accommodating employees to core organizations; 2) promote flexibility in global workplace strategy; 3) inform workplace strategy by gathering employee sentiment through quantitative and qualitative means; and 4) form workplace strategy with a multidisciplinary team.","workplace strategy; national context; employee workplace preferences; post COVID-19","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

The waterway was initially created to strengthen the king’s power and to stimulate the economy, by creating a connection between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic. In the second half of the 19th, the competition from the railway, followed by the impacts of WWⅠ and WWⅡ caused the decline of the trading role of the canal. Finally, at the end of the 1980s, the freight transport on the canal definitively stopped. <br/>“The South Canal is clearly an exceptional example of a designed landscape” (Heritage, 2022), says UNESCO World Heritage, this grant water system shows the most innovative water management achievement of the time. The construction of the canal combines ingenuity and aesthetics by taking advantage of the natural water flow and the geographical and architectural elements of the land it crossed. Next to that, a wide range of specialized knowledge from Roman tradition to the latest scientific development was used in its construction. The project had brought enormous benefit for the region and the whole country of France. Today, the canal provides a unique perspective to review the relationship between artificiality and nature, modernity and the past.<br/>However, the canal faces difficulties to adapt to its role of a landscape icon that attracts worldwide tourism and has difficulties to keep its role as a source for irrigation. In fact, the Canal du Midi is a rigid, long, quite narrow water structure, with many waterworks that need constant maintenance and have limited accessibility. Therefore, to overcome marginalization, it is essential to identify its values; “aspects of culture which are inherited by the present and which will be preserved for the future” (Upen, Oct 18, 2018).<br/>The thesis proposes a discussion from the perspective of landscape architecture, if and in what way a large-scale historical site can become the spill of a sustainable landscape transformation. Central to the research is the use of the concept of the landscape narrative: Narratives are there in landscapes, intersect with sites, accumulate as layers of history, organize sequences, and inhere in the materials and process of the landscape (Potteiger &amp; Purinton, 1998). And to envision the canal as an element, that can create a more adaptive and robust network to stimulate the sustainable development of the region by using three narratives: water as culture, water as infrastructure, water as nature.","Water heritage; Landscape narrative; Sustainability; Circular system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The studio topic Glaneur/Glaneuse refers to the old ‘profession’ of the gleaners, those people picking up the leftovers of the agricultural harvest and making out of these food for their families. Architects are called to be some kind of gleaners, too.<br/><br/>In these past graduation months, the site (field) has been read and absorbed. The reading process has been guided by the french architecture theories of Clement, Lefebvre and Latour. Gilles Clement, in his ‘Third Landscape Manifesto’, describes how urbanisation creates residues within the city structure, such as vacant industrial areas. ‘THE (NOT) ORDINARY ACADEMY’ project challenges current urbanisation, questioning its environmental, economical and, mostly, social sustainability, attempting to give a new meaning (function) to these residues. For example, the demolition of the existing factory fabric indeed provides more space for specific urban and architectural developments. However, this specificity requires more time, money and energy than the adaptive reuse of these 'third landscapes’, with the risk that city requirements change during their construction. To then mention Bruno Latour’s theories, “...critical attention is shifted from architecture as a matter of fact to architecture as a matter of concern. As matter of fact, buildings can be subjected to rules and methods, and they can be treated as objects on their terms. As matters of concern, they enter into socially embedded networks, in which the consequences of architecture are of much more significance than the objects of architecture.”<br/><br/>In a general and local context where architecture doesn’t engage enough with ‘local’ political and social contexts, the need to re-consider the potential for architects to be influential and transformative agents of (existing) space grows pressing.3 Challenging ‘mainstream’ architecture means fighting norms that shut down other ways of thinking and operating. In fact, in this conflictual environment, many architects find themselves reduced to simple decorative participants improving the marketability of developers’ projects. This critique aims to re-evaluate the potential and influence of the architects in the definition of the urban and social space.<br/><br/>A similar theoretical approach has already been defined by some offices, projects and publications, which suggest other ways of doing architecture to move away from architecture's traditional focus on the look and making of buildings. They aim for a much more expansive field of opportunities in which architects and non- architects can operate and collaborate. These case studies have been presented along with this master thesis to show a transformative intent to make the status quo better: the means are varied, from activism to pedagogy, publications to networking, making stuff to making policy.4<br/>Spatial production belongs to a much wider group of actors. In this ecosystem of actors and events, the intention of the research is to narrate the conditions in which an on-site architecture office can ACT as a device to challenge and/or inspire the ongoing developments, investigating in which way this alternative could provide more sustainable solutions with a different urban strategy. The purpose is to assemble a gradual re-appropriation and re-configuration of the leftover buildings whose functions won’t be overdetermined, allowing a continuous transition of activities that will increase the value and awareness of these spaces and their potential. More practical, the project is an attempt at how a fast deliverable architecture could be given back to the city with the least and mostly needed intervention possible, all done in the name of presenting a new way of looking at how buildings and space can be produced. How?<br/><br/>The non-overdetermination of the building’s function is based on a simple change of connotation of the existing artefacts (being there spaces, structures or objects) allowing different conditions to happen while this transition is happening, also after the architect leaves the site.<br/>As written in the studio description, “architecture grows out of existing conditions and resources.” In fact, the design assignment – as will be presented in the common urban plan – aims to discover and develop the scenario between a vacant industrial site – in its built and unbuilt matter – and the possible opportunities that its vacant spaces can offer, as evidence of the possible cohabitation of public and private domains. In this way, the project detaches from the ordinary academic architectural ‘utopia’ and looks forward to a more realistic approach with given realistic social, political and architectural conditions, defining the architect’s role not anymore as consequential, but rather influential.<br/>Evoking “mixed feelings” (thanks Paul) is a way to express the complexity of this process. As Enrique Walker writes in the foreword chapter of ‘Without Content’ by Kersten Geers, (referring to architects) “...they stage a conversation, and situate their work within it. They forge alliances. They establish sources. They delineate sensibilities. They define positions. They declare programmes.” And, as shown this afternoon, they curate.","architect's role; spatial appropriation; urban politics; non-overdetermination; adaptive reuse; matter of fact; matter of concern; ephemeral; change of connotation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","",""

Multiple villages have been destroyed. Villagers lost their loved ones, houses and income sources. According to climate scientists, the wildfires will occur more often due to hotter summers. This emerges the question on how destroyed villages in wildfire risk areas will be rebuilt in a new wildfire resilient way, involving local building skills and knowledge in the Mediterranean region of Turkey. Kalemler village is chosen as the research and design area, because it is one of the most damaged villages and representative for other burned villages in the Mediterranean region. <br/><br/>The current rebuilding plans do not involve wildfire resiliency and there is no worldwide research on how to rebuild villages in a wildfire resilient way. Looking at Turkish villages on the national scale, Turks always historically provided themselves with self-built dwellings made of earth, stone or wood. This shows the opportunity to reintroduce earth as a building material in an innovative way, since earth is a directly available and non-combustible building material. Also, it is free when excavated on site, endlessly recyclable and has many other building benefits. Rammed earth is implemented as the new earth construction method for the village. It contributes on the scales of community and building construction as the research outcome on how innovation of vernacular façade earth construction methods could contribute to a wildfire resilient rebuilding strategy for burned down villages in the Mediterranean region of Turkey. <br/><br/>This project results in Kalemler as the wildfire resilient village of the future, tackled on five scales from the wildfire resilient rebuilding strategy: community, village, building typology, construction and landscape. This translates into a wildfire resilient village rebuilding plan, including a community centre, an independently working water and energy collection and distribution system. This system consist of a water tower, infrastructure points and walkable village walls. Furthermore, it translates into a growing wildfire resilient village house design and building guidelines for local self-builders. The growing village house typologies take the regional earthquake risk into account as well. All in all, this project involves the locals, respects local culture, harvests local materials, innovates local skills and knowledge on self-building with earth, and combines earth construction with innovative wildfire resilient solutions. Kalemler becomes a fusion village, where tradition meets innovation.","Wildfire resilient rebuilding; Wildfire resiliency; Wildfires; Earth construction; Rammed earth; Harvest; Climate change; Local building skills and knowledge; Water collection; Self-building; Village scale; Mediterranean region Turkey","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","Architectural Engineering","36.866816, 31.359148"

Currently available methods to reduce the effects of epilepsy are either ineffective or require expensive and invasive surgery. A new method has been found that can suppress epilepsy without the need of surgery, called Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation (t-VNS). Detecting epileptic seizures is important for this method, as the stimulation should only be used during a seizure. Traditionally, detecting epilepsy is done using scalp-Electroencephalography (EEG), which requires a controlled environment and is hard to use in day to day life. Recently, advancements have been made in ear-EEG, which allows for EEG outside a controlled environment. This study focuses on detecting epilepsy using ear-EEG. Ear-EEG was simulated using scalp-EEG channels close to the ear. After low-pass filtering and downsampling the results were obtained using features obtained from the Wavelet Transform (WT) and Fourier Transform (FT) in combination with several Machine Learning (ML) models; these being a random forest, a Support Vector Machine (SVM), and a Neural Network (NN). Furthermore PCA was also applied to the features, with a threshold of 0%, 95% and 99%. The results clearly show that using the WT outperforms features from the FT. Furthermore, out of the three models, the NN consistently has the best sensitivity for detecting seizures. The best sensitivity was achieved using WT features with a NN and a threshold of 99% for the PCA. The accuracy and sensitivity are 99.3% and 83.5% respectively, which is comparable to previous ear-EEG based research detecting epileptic seizures.<br","EEG; epilepsy; BCI; Seizures","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Engineering","A brain-computer interface inside your earphones",""

These households with too much income to qualify for social housing but not enough to buy a home tend to squeeze into the free rental market increasingly. Housing specifically targeted at this group is known as intermediate housing, which is provided at a cost above social rent but below market rates. In previous years, very few houses for this target group were developed due to the reluctance of the market to develop these homes due to lower profitability and strict regulations that made it difficult for local governments and social housing associations to build and distribute intermediate housing. <br/><br/>This study's primary goal is to reduce the inequality gap in the Dutch housing market by designing a national government housing policy. As a response to the shortage of affordable housing among middle-income households, it has been proposed that more social enterprises should become active in the housing sector as well as in other industries which solve societal problems by combining economic mission and societal impact. Social housing enterprises can explicitly address the shortage of affordable housing for middle-income households, unlike commercial ones that are solely concerned with profits. Furthermore, these newly developed Social Housing Enterprises are not subject to strict rules regarding the distribution of housing to middle-income households. As a result, they might be able to address the housing shortage.<br/><br/>The research question is ""How can national government policy trigger social entrepreneurship initiatives focusing on delivering affordable owner-occupied housing?"". For this research, a qualitative approach has been taken, in which primary and secondary data are used. The primary data came from ten semi-structured in-depth interviews, and the secondary data came from the literature review. In general, the national government's involvement increases the likelihood of individuals engaging in Social Entrepreneurship and its formation. The result showed that government support for removing barriers to social enterprise creation was the most important factor driving social entrepreneurship. Governments can lower barriers to social enterprises in the provision of intermediate housing by giving formal recognition, improving access to markets and finances, providing in-kind resources, and strengthening skills to trigger social entrepreneurship initiatives focusing on delivering affordable owner-occupied housing.<br","Real Estate Management; Housing Policy; Social entrepreneurship; middle-income households; Affordable Housing; Intermediate Housing Tenures; owner-occupied","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","Graduation laboratory",""

Consequently, chosen strategies cannot truly ensure long-term sustainable development due to the emergence of new challenges and bottlenecks. As a result, the primary goal of this master’s thesis is to investigate an alternative and extended assessment method capable of re-evaluating the current energy strategy proposition, as well as its primary systems and other energy technologies. <br/>This study focuses on the implementation of nuclear energy in densely populated urban areas, as this technology has been deemed unsustainable by many previous evaluation methods. Nonetheless, it is regarded as an interesting technology due to its numerous potential benefits and relatively high energy density. The Netherlands currently has three designated nuclear energy reactor sites, one of which is in the highly developed Rotterdam-The Hague metropolitan area (MRDH). This region is known for its limited land availability and flexibility, which makes the energy transition even more difficult. As a result, the area has been chosen as the thesis’ primary research location. A well-founded comparison between various technologies deemed sustainable can be made by re-evaluating the proposed regional energy transition (RES). Both large-scale system transitions and individual technology studies can benefit from this approach. <br/><br/>The study focuses on determining the challenges, bottlenecks, and benefits of the energy transition. Several transition strategies, including the current proposal and various nuclear energy scenarios, are investigated to evaluate these key strategy parameters. A computational system analysis is performed per strategy to analyse the effects of a given energy system. Several important uncertainty factors that influence the outcome of energy systems, such as climate change and consumption behaviour trends, have been added to the python-based simulation. This research method enables a fair comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of various energy generation strategies and techniques. Finally, nuclear energy can be re-evaluated in a specific region. <br/><br/>The implementation of nuclear energy sources in the region is beneficial in several stages of the energy transition period, according to the results of dynamic energy system simulation and evaluation. Both strong and light nuclear implementation in the region are viewed as more sustainable than the current transition strategy. The technology’s high energy density allows for significant reductions in low energy dense renewable sources, significantly reducing the required land for energy applications. Furthermore, the technology reduces transitional investment costs, O&amp;M costs, and, as a result, energy prices. Furthermore, because of its low potential for new bottlenecks and challenges, energy affordability can be maintained after 2050, whereas renewable-focused strategies","Nuclear energy; Gen-IV reactors; Energy; Electricity production; Heat production; Energy simulation; Python evaluation tool; Life cycle Assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","Double degree in Material Science and Engineering and Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

(mentor); Geurts, E.H.M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In recent years, Barcelona has been a pioneer in the implementation of PRO-Housing Right policies. Unfortunately, these measures can be considered too radical and not necessarily efficient in a long-term scenario. Private landlords are at the center of this challenge, being that they are the stakeholder that might potentially be the solution and negotiate a balance between the two sides of the coin. On the one hand, a housing rental real estate market is shown that depends on the owners and investors, so its stability is dictated by the interest and the ttractiveness it has. Cases such as Real Estate Investment Trusts are the financial <br/>mechanism that allows indirect investment to come to the city and higher tax collection that is reflected in the infrastructure of the city. On the other, big private landlords such as opportunistic private equity funds are responsible for managing the properties and, therefore, responsible for the conditions of the tenants. Which, in recent years, have been affected the adequacy of the house. In this way, the question that will guide this research arises, what are the challenges between real estate management models and securing housing rights for low-income tenants in Barcelona? Articles, policy documents, and annual reports will be investigated to explore the investment practices of different companies (to be defined). To establish a complete view of the local investment practices of the SOCIMIs studied. The research will be divided in three sections fallowing the logic of the research questions.","Private lanlord; Housing Rights; Financialisation; Real Estate Management","en","master thesis","","","","","","Aalbers M B (2016) The Financialisation of Housing: A Political Economy Approach.

The preservation of biodiversity is an important issue. Research shows that part of this biodiversity is largely dependent on the buildings and vegetation in the city and to help this biodiversity we need to build as nature-inclusive as possible.<br/><br/>There is a wide range of nature-inclusive options that can be applied to make a building and its surroundings more nature-inclusive. The application of nature-inclusive aspects in the design of new buildings is easy and relatively inexpensive due to the blank canvas. However, the aspects are more difficult to integrate into existing buildings. Especially in the case of monumental buildings, where several parameters have to be taken into account. For monumental buildings, it is currently unclear whether, and if so, what needs to be taken into account to make them more nature-inclusive.<br/><br/>The study seeks to answer the following question: ''How can Dutch monumental buildings in an urban context be redesigned to be more nature-inclusive?'' This research is validated with a design. This results in the following<br/>How can the monumental building Koudenhorn in the urban context of Haarlem be redesigned to be more nature-inclusive while retaining its heritage value?<br/>The monumental Koudenhorn building is situated in the urban context of Haarlem. It was built in 1768 as a deacon's house and is currently used by the police. It is a building with a story and many values. At present, the building and the plot show a limited degree of nature inclusiveness.<br/><br/>The research question is answered with a toolbox and three decision trees divided into the categories: flora, water, and fauna. The decision trees provide insight into which nature-inclusive options could be applied to a case and which aspects would need to be adapted to enable implementation. To fill in the decision trees, certain case analyses were carried out. The decision trees were filled in for the monumental part of the Koudenhorn building. This showed which nature-inclusive options are applicable and on which specific elements. Eventually, 17 of these options were applied in the design. The toolbox contains a clear description of what the nature-inclusive option entails, the extra points of interest and an optional design. This toolbox was then used to integrate the application in the redesign of the Koudenhorn building.<br","Nature-inclusivity; Nature; Biodiversity; Possibilities; Toolbox; Decission trees; Redesign; Monumental buildings; Koudenhorn; Haarlem; Nature-inclusive","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","",""

(mentor); Kuipers, H. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","This thesis is about the adaptation of the design of the ReSpire cooling vest for female soldiers for in a military operational context. For cooling, the principle of ventilation by air and evaporation of sweat was used to extract heat from the body. The objective of this project was to design a version of the cooling vest which would fit the female soldier and provide an effective level of cooling. <br/>In the recent past, incidents have occurred in the Defense Department where soldiers have been affected by heat stress and have suffered severe consequences, even fatalities. As a result, research has been initiated to find a way to cool soldiers during the performance of their operational tasks. It was determined that by means of a cooling vest that can be worn under the ballistic protection, the soldier can be cooled effectively and appropriately within the requirements of the equipment. <br/>With the Ministry of Defense’s intention to recruit more women into the various branches of the military, the need has come to make the cooling vest suitable for use by female military personnel. <br/>Due to physiological differences between men and women, the design had to be changed to ensure that airflow would be effectively directed across the body. This was primarily due to the difference in regional sweat distribution, as evaporation of liquid sweat is necessary to achieve the required cooling capacity. <br/>To create an appropriate fit for the shells, the physical differences between men and women were examined, as well as the body shape variation among women. Also, what and how in previous research has been determined what causes discomfort with equipment in female military personnel. In addition, a virtual anthropometric model was developed. In addition, a virtual anthropometric model was developed to determine the appropriate dimensions and shape for the shells. <br/>From these findings, a design vision has been dictated with a schedule of requirements for how the final design could fit, but also provide sufficient and effective ventilation. <br/>In the ideation phase, inspiration was drawn from the sports apparel industry how to design for shape variation and what appropriate principles would be for the ReSpire-F design. For various aspects of the shells, it has been identified what possible adjustments could be made and how these could be merged into workable solutions. These are clustered and formed into concepts, which are then weighed. Physical prototypes were made of the selected ideas, which could be tested for airflow distribution and wearing comfort. To assess wearing comfort, tests were performed on mobility and perceived discomfort, which was determined by means of the Locally Perceived Discomfort scale. <br/>From the observations and results of this test, a chest shell design has been selected that should be suitable for different female military personnel, because it takes into account the deformation of the body under pressure and encloses the shape in the circumferential direction. <br/>For further development, the design allows for optimisation of the configuration of the airducts, in order to improve the effective distribution. <br","military; cooling; inclusive design; Human Performance; Personal cooling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The Port of Rotterdam experiences large amounts of siltation from the upstream rivers in its basins and canals every year. Furthermore, container vessels increase in size every decade and therefore require a larger navigational depth. These two factors cause the yearly amount of dredged material to increase. Currently, mainly trailing suction hopper dredgers are used to remove the large amounts of sediment, but these vessels come with high costs and operational time. A more time and cost-efficient dredging method is therefore desired.<br/><br/>A potential solution to the increasing problems of costs and operational time by dredgers is the technique of water injection dredging. To make this technique as efficient and effective as possible, this thesis has the objective to measure and analyze flow and sediment properties for different parameter settings of water injection dredging and find the optimal parameter settings of this dredging technique on mud from the Port of Rotterdam. Large-scale experiments have been conducted in the water-soil flume of Deltares, where a jetbar was trailed (or run) over a bed 27 meters long and 0.5 meters deep of port mud while injecting it multiple times with water.<br/>A positive correlation is observed between the production rate and jet momentum. The production is related linearly with the jet momentum using the Vlasblom equation combined with a non-dimensionless empirical fitting parameter per run per traverse velocity.<br/>What is remarkable is that the intrusion depth by the jets increases with ascending runs while the jet parameter settings stay the same. The data shows that the difference between the mass flux by the density current and the mass flux stirred up by the jets when the sediment concentration of an undisturbed bed is assumed, increases between runs when an increased intrusion depth between those runs is observed as well. This indicates that the volume penetrated by the jets contains a smaller amount of sediment than was initially assumed, thus is disturbed by the previous run and is therefore decreased in strength. This decrease in strength results in a larger intrusion depth during the run itself in comparison to the previous run. <br/><br/>The influence of the SOD of the jets is analysed by comparing runs with a SOD to runs without a SOD but with similar remaining jetting parameter settings. When a SOD is applied, the jet pressure applied to the bed is outside the flow development region and therefore the jet pressure decreases with distance from the jet nozzle. The mass of sediment stirred up by the jets, for a SOD of 300 mm, is lower in comparison to a SOD of 0 mm. The density current transports relatively more sediment, however, when a SOD of 300 mm is applied. So, if a large amount of sediment needs to be stirred up, and therefore a large intrusion depth is required, no SOD should be applied and when large horizontal transport by the density current is desired, a SOD outside the flow development region of the jets should be used.<br","Water Injection Dredging; Fluid Mud; Port of Rotterdam; Dredging; Rheology; Non-Newtonian Fluids; Experimental Research","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","PRISMA II",""

However the lack of connectivity within the neighbourhood has become an ever more prominent problem for its growing residents and workers. Gemeente Amsterdam has proposed the construction of 7 new bridges in Buiksloterham to improve the local connectivity while staying rooted in circular and sustainable goals laid down in the green masterplan, Groenevisie 2020-2050. As such, the thesis proposes the construction of a novel timber structure embodying the circular vision of design for disassembly, using renewable and bio-based materials. The bridge will also serve as a landmark for the community, symbolizing the potential of timber architecture in the digital era.<br/><br/>Furthermore, as digital technology ushers in the 4th industrial revolution, the growing complexity and inter-dependencies in computational design of structures and buildings is no longer sufficiently represented in static plans (Helm et al., 2017). Since the inception of digital technology into timber fabrication processes in 1980s, it has transformed hand-tools to multi-axis machines, enabled further by parametric models, to produce highly varied components without lost in efficiency (Buri &amp; Weinand, 2013). Despite the high degree of automation in fabrication, the assembly of these structures are still largely manual (Helm et al., 2017), limited by the scale of the components, machines involved and transportation required. <br/><br/>Should the digital information of fabrication and assembly be directly transmitted to the robots and implemented, this would allow for a seamless workflow (Bachmann, 2009) without the intermediary manual process where digital information and assemblage efficiency could be lost. Tapping on the strengths of robotic systems in processing large amount of data, having high level of precision as well as being capable of taking over dirty, dangerous and mundane tasks, this presented the opportunity for integration of Human-Robot Collaboration into the construction system (Reinhardt et al., 2020).<br/><br/>Therefore the focus of this thesis aims to develop meaningful and productive Design-to-Build workflow involving HRC in the construction process of a timber bridge structure in Buiksloterham, Amsterdam.","timber structures; Human-Robot Collaboration; Bridge design; Digital Design; Digital Fabrication; Timber Construction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","","52.391308, 4.901628"

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The Port of Rotterdam (PoR) is the largest port in Europe and in order to maintain its status, it would need to expand. For the expansion, an extensive survey of the subsurface is needed for the construction of new port areas and its geotechnical structures. As part of designing the geotechnical structures, the subsurface is often modelled as multiple homogeneous soil layers. However the soil properties are in reality heterogeneous and spatially variable. The spatial variability of a soil property is characterized by a mean, a standard deviation and the scale of fluctuation. The scale of fluctuation is the distance over which a soil property is significantly correlated and it is limited to the soil layer of that soil property. Therefore the change in the geological layering of the soil because of external depositional factors such as river, sea and wind can influence the scales of fluctuations and the resulting geotechnical design.<br/><br/>The objective of this thesis is to look at the spatial variability in the vertical direction of the Pleistocene sand from the Kreftenheye and Boxtel Formation in the Port of Rotterdam and see if the river Meuse has any influence on the spatial variability in the vertical direction. An additional question is asked if the spatial variability has any influence on the computation of the pile base capacity for a single foundation pile and what are the implications of the answer to that question. To answer these questions, four sites in the Maasvlakte, Botlek and Pernis were selected and the cone penetration tests (CPTs) taken at the twelve sites were used for this thesis. An empirical method which uses CPT data to identify soil layers was used to identify the Pleistocene sand layer in the CPT data. The first part of the thesis uses the cone resistance data of the CPTs to estimate the spatial variability of the sites. The second part of the thesis focuses on the additional research question by using random field theory. Per site, the mean, standard deviation and vertical scale of fluctuation θ<sub>v</sub> were used to generate simulations of cone resistance data. For each combination of standard deviation and θ<sub>v</sub> 500 simulations were carried out. For each simulation the pile base capacity was computed with two CPT-based averaging methods, Koppejan method and LCPC method. The coefficient of variation of pile base capacity is used to measure the uncertainty of the computed pile base capacity.<br/><br/>The results show that the range θ<sub>v</sub> values are: 0.26 – 2 m in the Maasvlakte, 0.24 – 1.76 m in the Botlek and 0.14 – 1.18 m in Pernis. In terms of the mean θ<sub>v</sub>, you see a gradual increase from the upstream area (Pernis) to the downstream area (Maasvlakte). The increase is from 0.27 – 0.63 m in Pernis to 0.64 – 0.80 m in Botlek to 0.84 – 1.86 m in Maasvlakte. However, it is not clear if this is due to the Meuse or due to the existence of sublayers in the geological formation or due to some other factor. Further investigation is needed before a conclusive answer can be given. The answer for the second part is that as long θ<sub>v</sub> is significantly larger than the pile diameter <i>D</i> (θ<sub>v</sub> ≥ 4<i>D</i>), it does not influence the uncertainty of the computed pile base capacity. However, the mean and standard deviation of cone resistance does influence the uncertainty of the computed pile base capacities. Finally, it is observed that spatial variability does not play a role in the uncertainty of the computed pile base capacity if the coefficient of variation of the cone resistance c<sub>v</sub> (q<sub>c</sub>) is small (c<sub>v</sub> (q<sub>c</sub>) ≤ 0.15). The implication for the uncertainty of the computed pile base capacity and therefore the pile design is that one can afford to have a less accurate description of the spatial variability from using fewer CPTs if θ<sub>v</sub> ≥ 4<i>D</i>. The same holds true if c<sub>v</sub>(q<sub>c</sub>) ≤ 0.15.<br","spatial variability; CPT; Port of Rotterdam; scale of fluctuation; Pile foundation; pile base capacity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","",""

This results in new difficulties compared to conventional metals during operational life. Especially, the material properties of two different materials can cause side effects, which are unwanted in a structure, for example thermal stresses. Many reports have been written about the difference in damage inflicted by thermal fatigue stresses compared to mechanical fatigue stresses. However, the environmental conditions and stacking sequences used in these reports are extreme and not common in aviation. This thesis focuses on the effect of combined thermal and mechanical fatigue load on the structural integrity of a laminate, but with realistic operations mechanical and environmental loads.<br/><br/>In-service F-16 data has been used to get a proper indication of the order of magnitude of mechanical and thermal forces applied on an aircraft during operations. These conditions are applied to a semi-quasi isotropic coupons, which were dominant in the 0 direction, to simulate a more common laminate for an aerospace structure. The residual transverse shear strength, residual bending strength, and stiffness are measured after a mechanical and/or thermal fatigue load has been applied to test specimens. <br/><br/>Results show no clear reduction for any of the measured material properties. The main differences in results can be derived from size differences in test coupons. However, all results are within the scattering region of the reference values. Thus, it can be concluded that the structural integrity of a laminate will not be affected negatively by a combined thermal and mechanical fatigue load, if the conditions match the used operational circumstances.","Thermal Stresses; Thermal Fatigue; Thermoset Composite; semi-quasi isotropic laminate; Composite Material; Material Properties; Environmental Conditions; Mechanical Fatigue","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

As the financial resources often come from governmental agencies, it is public money. For the reason that achieving societal impact comes with its challenges, it is important that the recipients can provide accountability of what is done with the financial resources. This is done with the use of a monitoring and evaluation system, which is often required by donor agencies as a mean to provide accountability. Monitoring and evaluation systems involve a variety of actors. The system can have a variety of uses. In development cooperation they are mainly used to provide accountability towards donors and to learn how the cooperation can be improved. However, there is not always a good balance between those two uses, as the focus often lies more on accountability, which could cause missed opportunities to improve the effectiveness of the cooperation and therefore the societal impact. Therefore, this research focuses on the actor interactions in water and development cooperation and how the monitoring and evaluation systems influences the societal impact.

Although important for the design of such infrastructure, current literature fails to investigate potential emission reduction as a result of implementing electric GSE in mixed fleets with conventionally fueled GSE. Therefore, this work presents the development of a capacity model that quantifies the performance of sustainable refueling service infrastructures, consisting of partially (or fully) electrified fleets and charging points, in terms of annual CO2e emissions. Using future flight schedules as input, this algorithm models the activity of electrified refueler fleets taking charging downtime and forecasted airport growth into account. Model outputs provide insights in future fleet size, fleet mix and charging infrastructure requirements on a tactical level to achieve carbon emission goals for refueler fleets on a strategic level. As capital investments have to be made to electrify refueler fleets, the effect on the Total Cost of Ownership for ground handlers is investigated as well.

It was most commonly used in the form of a window, which is a flat glass panel. Glass has natural optical properties and is resistant to weather, making it ideal for use as a facade material. Glass’s novel applications in the built environment have led us to go beyond its 2D application of flat glass panels to a solid, 3D component, as seen in recent projects such as Maison de Hermes in Tokyo and Crystal House in Amsterdam.<br/><br/>Currently, there are two approaches in glass blocks: load-bearing solid glass blocks with poor thermal properties and hollow glass blocks with optimal thermal properties but no structural performance. Can we combine these approaches and develop a glass block with good load-bearing and thermal properties? Research on Hybrid glass blocks is one such topic that investigates the potential of this unique concept. A hybrid glass block is the combination of solid and hollow glass blocks designed as a single product with good thermal performance and load-bearing capacity.<br/><br/>The existing research on this topic is promising and noteworthy for further development as it conceptualises the rudimentary design guidelines for the system. The output of the existing research is oriented towards the design development of the novel hybrid glass blocks, ideation of the production methodologies, and validation of their thermal performance. Thus the scope for further research and development is actual prototyping of the design concepts, validation of the structural performance, and qualitative analysis. It is observed that the shape of the hybrid glass blocks impacts the structural-thermal performance, production methodology, and desirability of standardisation. Thus, to develop this product a thorough investigation and exploration are necessary.<br/><br/>The research first focuses on developing design guidelines for the innovative hybrid glass system. A product development methodology is formulated to guide and aid the design process of the hybrid glass block systems. Various design concepts are explored in-depth for each design problem based on their relationship with the structural-thermal performance, manufacturing, and assembly process and are then assessed through a set of design criteria to develop a final design concept. The final design concept is further refined based on manufacturing standards and challenges. The final design is then detailed and implemented in the Academy of Arts, Maastricht (case study), and various assembly strategies for dry stacked cast glass systems are formulated.<br/><br/>To validate the design a prototype manufacturing is done by using a kiln casting method. The prototyping challenges, observations, and decisions aid to assess the practicality of the design. A hybrid method of numerical and experimental validation is considered to evaluate the design based on its feasibility for application in the building industry. This research proves to be a guide for developing hybrid glass block systems and provides them with a design development, manufacturing, and evaluation framework to design, develop and assess their concepts.","hybrid glass block; cast glass; shape exploration; interlayer; Dry assembly; production methodology; Reversible connection; recycle; product development; design considerations; challenges; cross-section study; load-bearing; thermal performance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","",""

(mentor); Kleijn, C.R. (mentor); den Ouden-van der Horst, D. (graduation committee); Vermaas, D.A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Due to climate change, the sea temperature is rising. This temperature change has an effect on the phytoplankton population. Phytoplankton is responsible for more than 50 percent of the oxygen production on earth, and is therefore crucial for life on earth. In this report, the research question is: is the temperature increase of the water important for the development in space and time of the plankton population in a 2D model of a coastal area of an ocean?<br/><br/>To investigate this, first a 2D model for a coastal area of an ocean is formed. As a basis for this model the 0D model of Steele and Henderson is used to describe the predator-prey model for zooplankton and phytoplankton. Due to this model a repeating pattern in time arises, which is called a limit cycle. This predator-prey<br/>model is expanded to a 2D model by applying convection (v) and diffusion (D) to it, representing the current and dispersion in the water. The chosen parameters and boundary conditions are inspired by the coastal area of the west coast of Portugal.<br/><br/>To evaluate the effect of the water temperature rising, first, the effect of diffusion and convection are studied by answering the following questions: is the convection important for the development in space and time of the plankton population in a 2D model of a coastal area of an ocean? And: is the diffusion important for the development in space and time of the plankton population in a 2D model of a coastal area of an ocean?<br/><br/>The diffusion is dominant in the direction perpendicular to the coast. Due to the diffusion the limit cycle of the predator-prey model is suppressed. Its range gets smaller until the plankton population is completely constant for D &gt; 2.5 m^2/s. This critical value is included in the realistic value of D, which varies from 1 to 2000 m^2/s.<br/><br/>Due to convection, the limit cycle corresponding to the boundary condition occurs in the direction parallel to the coast, making every point in the domain steady state. The higher the velocity v corresponding to the convection is, the less oscillations in phytoplankton density there are in the domain, thus the larger the wavelength of the oscillation is. For v &gt; 0.06 m/s the current is so fast that the predator-prey model has little time to develop before it reaches the right boundary, making the left boundary value more important. This critical value is included in the realistic value of v, which varies from 0.03 to 0.28 m/s.<br/><br/>The model experiences both diffusion and convection more or less equally when the Péclet number vH^2/DL≈1, resulting in D/v≈50 m. If this number is significantly larger than 50 m, diffusion dominates the solution. If the number is significantly smaller than 50 m, convection dominates the solution.<br/><br/>Now the main research question can be answered. By increasing the temperature of the water the growth rate of phytoplankton increases. Due to this increase, the timescale of the predator-prey (τpp ) decreases. The value of D and v for which the predator-prey model and diffusion and convection all influence the solution<br/>equally depends on the timescale with the factor 1/τpp . A smaller time scale means that the predator-prey model contributes more to the model. However, this change is very small in comparison to the scale of the realistic values. In conclusion, in the formed 2D model the temperature increase of the water is not important for the development of the plankton population in space and time.<br/><br/>The results of this report are influenced by the assumptions and approximations made. In this study, several processes, both physical and biological, are described with constants and simplifications. Improving the models of these processes is left for further research.","Plankton; Predator-prey; Transport Modelling; Temperature dependence","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

While this has brought a rocketing economy and improved citizens’ average living standards, it does not come without any expense. Such intensive urban sprawling and industrialization in China has added up a great risk to upcoming climate challenges, especially bringing about water issues such as flooding, water pollution and drinking water scarcity that are closely linked with citizens’ safety, well-being and future prosperity. Though many policies and initiatives have been proposed to mitigate these water issues, few of them can solve the issues systemically.<br/><br/>Hence, with the Lake Chao Basin as a backdrop, the project aims at tackling these water issues from the perspective of systemic design and thus proposes a 'water- oriented urban development'. Through the maximization method, a pattern language for 'water-oriented urban development' is constructed. This set of pattern language not only provides solutions to address the main problems regarding water quantity, water quality and water safety in the region but also is targeted at bringing about a systemic change in the area by intervening on deep leverage points.<br/><br/>To illustrate the implementation of the pattern language, a multi-scale framework for the Lake Chao Basin is created, with the vision for Tanchong River Basin 2030 as a strategic project. It shows how the implementation of the pattern language could reshape the landscape on different scales, engage various stakeholders and promote a sustained commitment to the water system among citizens. This will also provide transferable knowledge to other areas on how the patterns could be integrated into the future urban development process and contribute to the sustainable water system. <br","Systemic Design; Urban Metabolism; Flooding; Water Pollution; Water Scarcity; the Lake Chao Basin","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","","31.56,117.60"

There is a necessity to create 845.000 new homes due to its growing population by 2030 (NL Times, 2020). According to prognosis (Capital Value, 2020), the housing shortage is greater than recently estimated and will continue to grow. Especially in Groningen, where the Police office building is located, the need for housing is one of the greatest in the Netherlands (Dutch review, 2021).<br/>In Groningen, the housing crisis influences rising property and rental prices. Consequently, it affects young people or families who cannot afford to buy property while students cannot find a place to live in general (Dutch review, 2021).<br/>The transformation of the National Police in the Netherlands in 2013 brought new possibilities for urban redevelopment in particular city areas. Those possibilities could help tackle previously mentioned problems. Around 700,000 m2 of current real estate of the National Police will be divested in the upcoming ten years (HA Lab, 2021, p.5). Around 30% of real estate objects owned by the police in the Netherlands need to be redeveloped considering renovations or functional adaptation. <br/>Building more houses is one of the ways to tackle the housing crisis, but it is crucial to understand that there is a possibility to transform an existing building into housing instead of solely building new ones. The design proposal for Vacant Police heritage in Groningen city aims to cope with previously mentioned social and economic problems. It is important and urgent to understand that adaptive reuse of the building can significantly influence life in the Netherlands. <br","Housing crisis; Material crisis; Groningen; The Netherlands; Heritage; Adaptation; Circularity; Reuse","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

(mentor); Kuzniecow Bacchin, T. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The relation to energy is what carries humanity through every new spatial possibility. The context of the European Green Deal that triggers decarbonisation of many industries and faster energy transition to the latest technologies of renewable energy production is only one among many past and future transitions. All in all, it brings different conditions of possibility to think of energy as a spatio-temporal project. The relevance of space is brought forward when the scaling-up is also a spreading around, highlighting the potential not only in the agglomeration zones but mainly in its interdependence with operational landscapes. These areas must be invested with a renewed understanding of the distribution of renewable energy technologies in landscapes, realising its potential for socio-ecological connectivity and becoming a new backbone of urbanisation that can mediate alternatives for the state of climatic instability. In this direction, the Rhine basin is the location to investigate the relation of energy landscapes in the fossil-fuel age, anticipate the potentials and limitations of the ‘energy transition’ and speculate on the current and future energy modes. The project draws from territorial analyses, energy policy and technical documents and ecological perspectives to build a conceptual tool, introducing transitional landscapes that surpass current dichotomies between the urban and rural, conservation and industry, nature and economy and society. It develops a platform for common grounds where energy landscapes become temporal and spatial “stepping-stones” towards connecting and restoring landscapes towards just coexistence between natural processes, habitats for humans and fauna &amp; flora amongst current and future modes of energy production. Eventually, it could serve as a background for developing policy instruments for rethinking European integration and networks beyond the typical infrastructures in Europe, becoming an alternative way of understanding territorial and regional integration.","energy landscapes; operational landscape; urban networks; energy transition; Rhine Basin","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","",""

(mentor); Bilow, M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Glass is one of the oldest building materials used in the building envelope. Its attractiveness to architects, designers and users is mainly due to its fascinating ability to combine two otherwise contradictory functions; to separate and protect the interior from the exterior environment while at the same time allow for openness by letting daylight penetrate the space.<br/><br/>Apart from the apparent and basic function of transparency, glass, if properly designed, can fulfill almost any role in a building structure, from insulating a facade, to taking building loads besides its own weight and the imposed wind forces. Especially in terms of a building’s thermal performance, the assembly of single glass panes into insulated units is a colossal advancement for the building sector towards more sustainable structures since it allows the creation of fully glazed facades with minimised thermal losses.<br/>However, the use of insulated glass units while improves greatly the energy conservation of glass buildings, it neglects to account for the impact of this assembly procedure on the waste streams the materials used create once their service life is over. Currently, there is no provision for extending the life-time of IGUs by the means of reuse, refurbishment or recycling and consequently they end up being discarded in landfills after a limited time of use.<br/><br/>For this reason, it is crucial to design an alternative IGU that abides by the laws of circularity, meaning the use of design approaches with an end-of-life plan for new products used as construction elements. Such a circular approach could greatly benefit the transition from a linear to a circular economy which is indispensable for the building sector since it accounts for a large amount of construction and demolition waste that end in landfills every year. The pollution from these wastes could be significantly reduced if the products applied were initially designed to be used in a circular way instead of having a single-life character.<br/><br/>The current master’s thesis focuses on the exploration, through detailed design, of the different ways in which an insulated glass unit can become more circular without compromising its transparency. The term circularity here refers to a design that tackles the end of life of the unit by facilitating its remanufacture in case its thermal performance starts decreasing; the reuse of parts of it or of the whole unit, and the recycling of the glass panes when neither reuse nor remanufacture are an option. Moreover, the aim is to create an IGU that is as transparent a possible by minimising the optical result of the current IGU edge seal connections.<br/><br/>In order to create a circular IGU, firstly, contaminating factors on the glass surfaces that could hinder their recylcability should be avoided. Secondly, a reversible way of connecting the different glass panes that comprise the IGU is opted for. Currently used IGUs have edge seals that consist of an element called a spacer bar and sealing elements that ensure the structural stability of the unit and prevent the air and moisture diffusion to the cavity. The element that connects the glass with the spacer bar in the current IGUs is a strong structural adhesive of black colour that cannot be removed without contaminating the glass. This is precisely the element that this thesis aims at replacing through an alternative connection design that enables the reversibility of the unit and the reduction of the optical impact of the edge seal.<br/><br/>The design exploration phase led to a final design that achieves the initial goal using an innovative alternative connection that replaces the spacer bar and secondary seal of a typical IGU with two cast glass elements each fused to the edge of the float glass panes. The connection of these cast glass elements occurs with the use of a simple mechanical clamping element, a metal spring clip that can be easily applied and just as easily removed. The small dimensions of this clip and its application internally between the float glass panes ensures the reversibility of the edge seal as well as its improved optical result.<br/><br/>The final design remains in a research stage proposal and further testing would be necessary regarding its thermal performance, its structural rigidity and the assurance of its good weather sealing. However, this research through design exploration concluded to a feasible, in theory, design that achieves the initial goal.","Insulated glazing unit (IGU); Circular design; Reversible Glass Connections; Reversible connection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","",""

The architecture practices that firms did in China have enriched their company portfolio as well as increased their international reputation. For years, being a foreign company in China had natural advantages because of huge market demand and kind clients. However, after China has experienced crazy urbanisation, with strong influence of global architecture, both the government and the citizens desire to address their emphasis on traditional culture and localised architecture. Since then, foreign firms lacking an understanding of Chinese culture have encountered development bottlenecks. Meanwhile, the rise of local enterprises and the influx of enterprises from other countries have also increased the development pressure of Dutch architecture firms. Facing the current challenges, Dutch architecture firms operating in China urgently need to improve their localisation strategy to adapt to the market changes and enhance their competitiveness. <br/><br/>This research accesses and integrates the existing literature, thus establishing the theoretical framework that guides the empirical analysis. Through multiple case studies and interviews, this qualitative research aims to systematically understand the localisation strategy of Dutch architecture firms in China. The localisation performance of three firms with different levels of reputation are investigated. The findings suggested that the localisation level and firm performance are relevant while also influenced by other factors, such as reputation and branch office’s function.

The complexity behind pursuing sustainable goals brings several challenges to the feasibility and financing of projects since private actors are mostly profit-driven and therefore, their business rationale tends to collide when taking decisions that link private profit and public values. The existing criteria to assess sustainability, mostly at an urban level, and the difficult quantification of these criteria into potential benefits for developers have been traditionally determined as seeming incompatible. Therefore, a deeper understanding of how sustainability is impacting the decision-making of area developers is required to achieve the right balance between long-term sustainability and short-term profitability.<br/><br/>In that sense, there is an existing gap between sustainability assessment methods and decision-making processes that needs to be filled to ease the transition towards a broader definition of value into the business rationale of developers. In that line of reasoning, market-driven rating tools for sustainability assessment represent an opportunity to analyse how their use is impacting the urban redevelopment management, providing empirical examples of how the gap with decision-making processes can be minimized. These findings, aims to evaluate the implementation of BREEAM-NL Area in The Netherlands and add knowledge on how the use of it as a methodological framework can have an impact in the decision-making process.

The need for such a sub-module stems from the similarity of frames in a video. To aid in reducing the computation time of the content based video search engine, the Keyframe Extraction Module reduces the amount of frames by discarding frames that are similar in information. Determining what frames can be considered similar is one of the main challenges, as there are many ways of assigning values to how much frames differ. In the past decades, many research has been done on keyframe extraction and video summarization and many methods are proposed to form keyframe selections, varying in what is considered salient information and varying in computation time. The most challenging part of the design is that there is a time constraint present, which called for a proper analysis in what methods are suitable. After all, this limitation when creating video summaries is often not a large topic in research papers.This report will cover Shot Detection techniques along with various Keyframe Extraction methods that can be categorized in clustering, visual content, fixed selection and uniform sampling. Furthermore, evaluation methods like the Fidelity measure for the performance of particular methods are also addressed, as determining how well a keyframe selection is is not trivial. It is concluded that out of the techniques analyzed, a combination of VSUMM clustering and histogram matching along with histogram-based shot based detection with a CFAR threshold and pre-sampling is most suitable for the general case under a time constraint.

The impact of this is analysed in terms of land use, CO2 emissions, Water use, Energy demand and Architectural, Social and Educational impact. The proposal positively affects all of the mentioned subjects except for energy use. The use of energy is increased by 7%. That can be compensated by sustainably harvesting energy. The proposed community can have a positive environmental effect and could become a new main housing typology.<br/><br/>Design: Globally we will face water and food stress. The agricultural industries contribute 26% of all greenhouse gas emissions. 4 sub categories of these emissions are land use, meat and dairy consumption, transport and supply chain, and crop production. Besides this, food waste contributes significantly. I therefore propose to eliminate the supply chain by designing a building that produces food and houses the people that consume it. The design consists of a Plant Factory, 4 glasshouses and 100 housing units that house about 200 people. The building is self-sufficient in water, food and almost self-sufficient in energy consumption. Shared spaces are added to provide residents with a space for gathering, and learning about food production, consumption and preparation. A market and educational center are added on the ground- and first floor so that the building can become an attractor for neighbors. Here they can also learn about the value of food, and how to become self-sustaining too. Lastly, the green roof is added for additional leisure activities as well as learning about healthy and sustainable food growth practices.<br","Food production; Food; Crops; Housing; Dwelling; Co-housing; Shared kitchen; Experience; Glasshouse; Greenhouse; Plant factory; Plant-based","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","52.417588, 4.873080"

These electrodes are being designed for the development of an in-ear brain-computer interface (BCI). <br/>The electrical properties of biological tissue are referred to as the conductivity σ and permittivity ε and denote the ability for a material to conduct and trap electric charge respectively. These properties are frequency dependent and particularly for EEGs, a frequency range of 1-1000 Hz is of interest (with some added leeway). Wet skin hereby has a conductivity of around 0.1 Siemens to 0.2 Siemens in the 1-1000 Hz frequency range whereas the permittivity ranges from 5.7 * 10^5 to 5.2 * 10^5. Different agar and agar/NaCl solutions are created to try and obtain solutions with the mentioned electric properties. Specifically, NaCl is added to improve the conductivity and obtain a non-linear frequency response similar to that of human skin. The electrical properties of the phantoms were verified/measured using the parallel plate method. This method is essentially sandwiching a material under test (MUT) (in this case the fabricated gel-like agar and agar/NaCl solutions) between two conducting plates. This method is most suited for measurements in the lower frequency spectrum.<br/>The skin phantom consisting of 3.04 mass fraction weight (wt.%) agar and 0.539 wt.% NaCl shows the closest similarity to the conductivity of wet skin. Namely, a conductivity of ~ 0.1 Siemens to 0.45 Siemens in the frequency range of 1-1000 Hz. A decrease of 0.250 wt.% NaCl will most likely achieve the desired conductivity response of 0.1 Siemens to 0.2 Siemens in the frequency range of 1-1000 Hz. The skin phantom consisting of 3.00 wt.% agar and 1.02 wt.% NaCl showed the permittivity closest to that of wet skin, but might have been a noisy outlier. Its permittivity ranges from 10 * 10^6 and 7.5 * 10^6. This is still a large error margin from the desired 5.7 * 10^5 to 5.2 * 10^5. Additional fillers like glycine or Al powder need to be added to the solutions to obtain a permittivity close to that of wet human skin. Multi-day and difference in applied pressure measurements are performed to check the sensitivity and reproducibility of the phantoms. Applied pressure hereby has little to no influence whereas a longer life-span of the fabricated phantom shows a drastic decrease of the electrical properties of the phantoms after day 1. The changes then seem to settle. Worth mentioning is that the change is only drastic when the solution has a high conductivity. This is generally not the case for solutions with conductivities close to wet skin.","tissue phantom; agar; BCI; EEG; ear phantom","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

SOLAR will be tested based on three performance metrics: the mean average precision, the recall and the extraction time per image. The performance will be evaluated based on a selection of videos and images from a dataset provided by Dr. Andrea Nanetti from the Engineering Historical Memory project. For this dataset SOLAR achieved a mean average precision of 83 %, a recall of 85 % and an extraction time of 0.73 seconds per image. To conclude, SOLAR is specialised in detecting and describing landmarks due to its pre-trained model, but for a more general case the backbone model should be trained differently which will increase the accuracy. Future work could also include speed improvement by looking at object detection methods.","Image Retrieval; Features; Descriptors; Video search","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","ttps://github.com/aron-hoogeveen/ibvse Link to the codebase (GitHub)","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","Bachelor Graduation Project",""

(mentor); Van den Berghe, K.B.J. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In recent years, more and more attention has been paid to the wasteful use of raw materials, which leads to major nature and environmental problems. To address these issues, initiatives have been shown by all kinds of stakeholders, in the form of agreements, legislation and action plans, for a transition to a circular economy (CE). This transition is crucial, especially in the construction sector, due to the high level of waste and the use of raw materials. Literature review shows that localization can create local jobs and economic incentives, but also non-economic motives, such as inclusion and engagement. On the other hand, supply chains, business relationships and sales markets have actually been scaled up to a global level in recent decades. Therefore, a shift to a local approach is needed as well as a shift to a supra-national approach to facilitate the CE. Although this may seem paradoxical at first, this process is also known in the literature as 'glocalization'. Much research has been done on CE on multiple scales, however there is insufficient knowledge about the various components addressed by the concept of 'glocalization’, especially on inter-firm networks and how they deal with the paradox of glocalization in realizing a CE in the construction sector. The aim of this research is to shed light on how inter-firm networks, which consist of multiple types of business relationships, deal with shifts that take place in the field of institutional and regulatory arrangements and economic activities both to the supra-national and local scale. The research is done through literature research, which provides qualitative, and a case study on the concrete industry, which also provides qualitative data. The case study was investigated through semi-structured interviews, after which these were analyzed using coding tools. On this basis, the paradoxes of glocalization have been formulated and it has been analyzed how the companies and organizations within the inter-firm networks deal with these paradoxes. Although the research shows several limitations with regard to the data and synthesis, it can be concluded that the inter-firm networks exhibit different attitudes, which can be categorized as proactive, reactive and inert, towards the paradoxes of glocalization. Furthermore, the research shows that different attitudes to the paradoxes of glocalization can drive changes in the inter-firm networks, such as business expansions, new partnerships between companies that have similar activities, and new partnerships between companies that have different activities but are working on one resulting product.","inter-firm networks; glocalization; circular economy; construction sector","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

Furthermore, 80% of insurance payouts to wind farms come from cable repairs and maintenance. Cable tracking is part of the wind farm cables maintenance scheme. Surveys are required for localisation and determining the depth of burial of the cables. Conventional surveying methods have shortcomings when it comes to localising offshore buried power cables, which can be resolved by using electromagnetic methods. From the measured magnetic field created by the cable, its position and burial depth can be inverted. Forward modelling the magnetic response of cables improves the understanding of their electromagnetic behaviour in one dimensional complex submarine environments. Maxwell's equations are the cornerstones of understanding the behaviour of electromagnetic fields, forming the basis of the models. Implementing numerical modelling packages like Empymod accommodate for boundary conditions in one-dimensional layered media to more accurately investigate the magnetic response of electric cables. Land measurements show that Empymod's numerical models can model cables in the accuracy range of 2-15% depending on the distance. New numerical model analyses show the influence of water depth, underlying layers, depth of burial, geometrical complexities and adjacent cables on the magnetic field. Surrounding resistivity contrasts together with changes in water depth change the measured magnitude of the magnetic field by up to 10%. Geometrical complexities have large effects on the magnetic field, sometimes completely changing the expected response. Therefore, twisted and irregularly shaped cables can pose problems when inverting for their position during surveys.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Geophysics | IDEA League","",""

For this, each layer of the building gets its own sound cluster, namely: 'vibrant', 'harmonic' and 'silence'. The various functions are subdivided into the sound zones in which it fits.

In these cases it is often necessary to investigate the cause, manner and time of death, which are investigated by forensic pathologists and the Police. To determine the time of death, the post mortem interval (PMI), the time passed shortly after death, should then be determined. <br/>Wilk et al. (2020) developed a new method to determine the early PMI (3 – 72 hours). An input parameter in this method is the Thermal Conductivity Coefficient (k-value) of the textile layers surrounding the deceased. A method to determine the k-value of textile layers at, or around, a crime scene is needed. Therefore, this study aimed to design and develop a Thermal Conductivity (TC) measurement device for textile layers at a crime scene. <br/><br/>A functional decomposition chart of the device and a morphologic overview were created to design a suitable concept which was used for further development of the final prototype. SolidWorks was used to perform heat transfer simulations that were required to make the right design decisions and subsequently a final design and prototype were developed. Tests were performed to assess the performance of the prototype in terms of device configuration, accuracy, precision and measurement time. Furthermore, the effects of moisture content of the sample and sample compression during measurement on the calculated k-value were investigated. <br/><br/>A Guarded Hot Plate (GHP) based prototype was developed: Therminus-K2. This prototype was equipped with a back heater and four guard heaters to ensure one dimensional heat flow from the main heater through the sample towards the cold plate to eliminate other heat flows. Therminus-K2 obtains a precision of &lt; 5% in TC measurements within 30 minutes. A steady-state measurement is achieved within a maximum of 7 minutes. Increasing the moisture content (2 states: dried and wetted) in the sample resulted in an increase in determined k-value (205 – 415 %). However, the uncertainty in sample thickness measurement was high (up to 16.7%) and complicated measurement of the sample compression effect on k-values. <br/><br/>Therminus-K2 delivers precise and fast TC measurements of textile samples: impressive results considering the simple components that were used. The future development of Therminus-K2 should focus on improving sample thickness measurement and improve user friendliness in order to make the device suitable to use in PMI estimation at actual crime scenes.<br","Thermal Conductivity; Measurement; Post Mortem Interval; Time of Death; Textile; Crime Scene","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-06-17","","","","Biomedical Engineering","Therminus",""

As a result, they tend to forget the true function of music, which is to provide a mental escape for the audience. Therefore it becomes paramount for future projects to consider a migration from an exterior iconic character to an introverted oasis for musical performance. This notion establishes a degree of transposition in the experience of a visitor, a passage between the public realm and the specific main function of the building, which can be referred to as liminality. Layering phases of separation, transition and incorporation can be used as a strategy in architectural route design to construct a liminal odyssey. Finally to conceive the greatest sense of escapism within the musical oasis, parameters of intimacy and visual relations play a significant role. Nevertheless, other parameters can be used, depending on audience personality, which is related to musical genre.<br/>Another aspect of designing for escapism is to create a world specific to music. To achieve this, the architecture should be a complete opposite to the organisational and contextual rules. In spite of this contrast, the building will still have to respond to the surroundings in a way that is characterised by its own architectural language. Only then will it become a fluid visitor route free of all limitations, purely based on the people and their liminal odyssey in anticipation of attending a concert.<br","music building; liminality; liminal space; escapism; transition; architectural route","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Public Building","AR3AP100, Public Building: Music Marvel","52.06938,4.33305"

Rotterdam’s continuous increase of real estate prices is a case in point: despite its high share of social housing, today Rotterdam faces a shortage of affordable dwellings for lower income groups. How can collective housing design promote social inclusion and reduce the ecological footprint of its residents? To answer these challenges, the TU Delft master level housing design studio operates under the “what if” scenario of a cooperative economy for a neighborhood in Blijdorp. Inspired by the cooperative housing designs in Zurich, such Kalkbreite (2014), the studio conceives of housing laboratories that offer shared spaces to the surrounding neighborhoods and the entire city. Its overarching goal is to relate design, non-speculative housing models and participatory governance. How can a housing project function as a socially inclusive, ecologically sustainable, and economically viable neighborhood operating under the premise of long-term non-speculation? How does this approach impact on the understanding of design knowledge? This graduation project transforms an existing building, the Emmahuis, into a neighborhood center and housing complex that combines owner-occupied maisonettes with a housing cooperative for intergenerational co-living. Besides a collective roof terrace for the residents, the ground floor offers a multitude of shared and collective facilities such as community workshops, open office areas, a public library, and commercial shops. These facilities provide a meeting point for the residents and a micro-centrality for the Blijdorp neighborhood, aiming to amplify a sense of collectiveness among different income and interest groups.","Architecture; Master thesis; Dwelling; Advanced Housing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Advanced Housing Design","","51.92598376547359, 4.461030999847439"

(mentor); van Oosterom, P.J.M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Urbanisation and a lack of available construction land has led to the increased development of underground space which can contribute to the development of the urban areas by providing space for the construction of (infra)structural objects and networks necessary for a city to function and provide services to its citizens. The main challenge in developing the underground space is registering the RRRs of the underground objects into Land Administration Systems (LASs). Registering the RRRs of these underground objects in 3D can facilitate a better understanding, as well as a more efficient registration and clear visualisation of the RRRs. <br/>To register the objects below the surface in a 3D LAS, 3D physical data as well as 3D legal data need to be registered and integrated into one model. BIM/IFC models can be (re)used as input data to register the 3D physical data. To register the 3D legal data in an efficient way, the ISO 19152:2012 Land Administration Domain Model (LADM) standard can be applied. The motivation for linking the BIM/IFC models with the LADM is that the geometry of the BIM/IFC models can be reused from design for the registration of the legal spaces in LASs or that BIM/IFC models can serve as a technical encoding for the exchange of data in LASs and thereby connect the workflows from the (AECOO) community. In this research the mapping of the basic classes of the LADM to IFC entities is presented to support the linkage of these two data models. <br/>Research to investigate the implementation of the LADM in a 3D LAS, with the use of BIM/IFC models as input for 3D objects on the surface such as apartment buildings and infrastructure objects has been carried out. The result of this research was that the RRRs of objects on the surface can easily be determined by applying the legal information from the enriched BIM/IFC model. No research has been done in implementing the LADM in a 3D LAS, with the use of BIM/IFC models as input for 3D objects below the surface. This research will therefore complement the earlier related work, thereby supporting the modelling of legal information of all 3D objects, below as well as on the surface. <br/>To solve the challenges that currently prevent the implementation of 3D objects below the surface in LASs and to harmonise the different (technical and semantic) requirements for LASs a standardised workflow was developed and is presented in this thesis. The standardised workflow shall provide more insight into the modelling of the legal spaces of 3D objects below the surface, stimulate the exchange of data across the AECOO community, and promote the use and development of 3D LASs.<br/>Two case studies were conducted, where objects (pipes) from the sewage system and a tunnel were used. The tunnel was a BIM/IFC model, while the sewage pipes were converted to an BIM/IFC model. The models from both cases were stored according to the LADM standard in a 3D LAS, represented by a 3D database and a 3D geospatial visualisation platform. The main results are that the technical part of the proposed workflow supports the registration of 3D underground objects in 3D LAS and that for underground objects the legal spaces from the 2D parcels that are extruded to 3D volumetric parcels, are sufficient enough to describe the RRRs of the objects.<br","3D Land Administration System; Underground objects; LADM; BIM; IFC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

Now the amount of traffic is increasing again and so is the noise disturbance. For this research specifically the optimizing task of distributing of arriving aircraft over the IAF is addressed, as often the shortest transition routes from an IAF towards the runway go over densely populated areas, but flying via another IAF results in longer flying times and thus more CO2 emissions. A tool that is able to quantitatively make a trade-off between noise and emission is required to provide a basis for the distribution of aircraft over the IAF. In this research the feasibility and effects of using an expanded version of the aircraft landing problem to create the IAF Selection Optimization tool is studied, including the effects of different settings for the tool. As a case study Amsterdam Airport Schiphol is used, as it is a busy airport that lies close (11km) to the city center of Amsterdam. In this paper first the methodology of the IAF Selection Optimization tool is explained, and afterwards the working of the tool is discussed by running various scenarios for three different days from 2019 at AAS. For all scenarios an optimal and feasible solution was found by the tool, based on the input variables selected for each scenario. It could therefore be concluded that the IAF Selection Optimization tool provides a means to optimally distribute aircraft based over the IAF based on a quantitative trade-off.","Initial Approach Fix; IAF; Mixed Integer Programming; MIP; Aircraft Landing Problem; Air Traffic Control; ATC; Amsterdam Airport Schiphol; AAS; Noise; Emission","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","52.310500, 4.768300"

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In 2018 the InSight mission was launched with the main objective of providing accurate 3D models of Mars’s interior. This was done by placing a seismometer on the surface of Mars to measure seismic activity. In 2021 three studies were published, one dedicated to the Martian core, one to the Martian mantle, and the last one focused on the Martian crust. Based on this seismic data, Khan et al. [2021] obtained a lithospheric thickness between the 400 and 600 km. The average Martian crust was found to lie between 24 to 72 kilometers. A restrictive range of crustal densities between 2700 to 3100 kg/m3 was used. The mantle extended up to 1560 km below the surface of Mars. The core is molten and has a radius of 1830 km. Before seismic data was available, the method to learn more about the interior of a planet was to study the topography and gravity data. This is still, on Mars, the only way to get a global picture of the subsurface. Only one seismometer is currently available on Mars, making it difficult to currently obtain full planet 3D maps from seismology alone.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to study the lateral density variations within the Martian lithosphere. The lithosphere is the planet’s outermost shell, defined by its rigid mechanical properties. It is thought that the lithosphere of Mars consists of the crust and the outer part of the mantle. In previous research, the density of the Martian crust is most often taken as uniform. However, density variations exist at a small scale and potentially even at the largest Martian scale [Beuthe et al., 2012]. The thesis project aims to study these density variations within the Martian crust and upper mantle.<br/><br/>To study the lateral density variations in the crust and mantle, the MRO120D gravity data and MOLA topography data are used as input. The crust-mantle boundary is created based on thin shell isostasy [Qin, 2021]. A lower boundary of the lithosphere is chosen to be equal to 500 km. A mantle plume underneath Tharsis is added, based on the findings from van der Tang [2021]. This plume reached from a depth of 800 km up to a depth of 900 km and was centered around [110◦W 3◦N] and had a density variation of 400 kg/m3 with respect to the surrounding mantle. An inversion was performed from which the density of both the crust and the mantle was obtained. In this calculation, two assumptions are made. First of all, it is assumed that the mass of each column is equal. The second assumption is that the obtained gravity for the column can be split into 2 point mass sources, one corresponding to the mass of the crust, located in the center of mass of the crust, and one corresponding to the mass of the mantle, located in the center of mass of the mantle.<br/><br/>A reference planet with Te = 400 km, C = 105 km, ρc,ref = 2700 kg/m3, and ρm,ref = 3800 kg/m3, resulted in the smallest density differences within the crust, as well as the smallest gravitational tensor residual. When these input parameters were used for the inversion, a final density difference of approximately 1000 kg/m3 between the crust and mantle was obtained after the inversion. A mean crustal density of approximately 2750 kg/m3 and a mean mantle density of approximately 3750 kg/m3 were found. The density variations in the crust varied from -424 up to 618 kg/m3 around the mean crustal density and -228 and 133 kg/m3 around the mean mantle density. The optimal elastic thickness obtained through the inversion lies between the 450±50 km and the uniform crustal thickness between 100 ± 10 km.<br/><br/>For the large impact craters, high crustal densities were found compared to the mean crustal density of Mars. Densities for Hellas and Utopia lay between the 3200 and 3345 kg/m3, and for Isidis Basin, a slightly smaller impact crater, a crustal density of around 2870 kg/m3 was found. These large crustal densities, together with the large elastic thickness and density difference between the crust and mantle, resulted in the conclusion that the large impact craters may be compensated using a different isostasy method. For this study, the crust-mantle boundary was obtained by applying the flexural response function to the crust-mantle boundary obtained using Airy isostasy. A boundary based on Pratt isostasy, instead of the thin shell isostasy boundary used currently, might be a better fit for the larger impact craters. The volcanoes outside the Tharsis region were found to be well compensated using the thin shell method, and small densities were found compared to the volcanoes in the Tharsis region, as well as what has been found in previous literature. The smaller densities for these stand-alone volcanoes might have to do with the compensation of these volcanoes due to the curvature of the planet, which is taken into account with the thin shell isostasy model. The literature analyzed in this study used different isostasy methods. By studying the possibility of different isostasy methods for different regions on Mars, the current model could be improved further.<br/><br/>This study showed that it is possible to use gravity inversion to gain insights into the lithosphere of a planet. With these density differences, the Martian power spectrum could be fitted up to spherical harmonic degree 40. But, due to the resolution of the current gravity model, it was only possible to calculate the Martian density difference at a larger scale. To also be able to study the density differences at a smaller scale, higher resolution gravity data needs to become available.","Gravity; Inversion; Mars; Lithosphere; Isostasy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The interaction between the rear propeller slipstream and the horizontal tail has been likened to the interaction of propeller-wing configurations seen on larger regional aircraft. The DEAC intends to study this interaction through ground-based high-speed taxi-tests before any flight tests. By doing so, tests are conducted in a safer and more accessible environment without the need for re-certification, albeit, with changes to both testing environment and aircraft operational settings. This numerical study focused on evaluating the feasibility of such a testing approach to help gain an insight and better prepare for experiments. RANS CFD studies were performed on a simplified self-designed and developed half-airplane half-propeller model of the aircraft in ground-run configuration and free-flight configuration. In this stead-state simulation, the propellers were treated as actuator disks and had a specified constant pressure rise. Vortices being shed from the fuselage and interacting with the tail were discovered. The uncertainties due to the chosen simplifications, the neglect of twin contra-rotating propeller swirls, and the fact that the formation and evolution of the wake vortices, and their interaction with both the rear propeller and the horizontal tail are inherently unsteady effects, precludes a definitive conclusion. A more detailed numerical model is required to address the situation and evaluate the feasibility of this approach.","CFD; propeller-wing interaction; Ground Effect; Reynolds number effects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Dutch Electric Aviation Center",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The urban challenges of today are plentiful. A million houses need to be built in the next decade, urban development needs to allow for climate adaptation and contribute to the energy transition. It needs to ensure sustainable economic growth potential in a circular and social economic fashion. The active forms of land policy that where standard to the Dutch government prior to the economic crisis of 2008 however are no longer applied in the same level of frequency. Neo-liberal influences have over time shifted the top-down government-led planning approach, to one where private parties need to be incited if there are particular planning questions to be solved. Yet, even when confronted with fragmented land ownership, or the necessity of integrating non-economic-efficient development functions, through facilitative forms of land policy, the government still has a task to shape the environment. Achieving the urban ambitions above is very costly, especially when integrative development is necessary; and without active forms of land policy or heavy forms of public private partnerships, the government can no longer mobilize the incomes gained from land management. According to former studies, it is possible to achieve integrative added value in urban development where private law agreements embody the value capturing arrangements. Little to no study has yet been conducted into how such agreements can do so in the Dutch institutional context, for which reason this thesis has addressed this apparent literature gap through the following research question: How can public parties increase the potential of their value capturing strategies within facilitative land policy using private law agreements in projects of area redevelopment? Through an explorative case study approach, initial lessons -rooted in empirical data- are drawn and abductively translated to formulate more tangible insights. The end product therein is the proposition of an initial theoretical understanding, and to present what Glaser and Strauss would call a ‘running discussion’. <br/><br/>Value capturing within facilitative land policy in a technical sense takes places through agreed-to contributions in the anterior agreement, be they monetary or in-kind. From both literature as well as the case studies conducted it becomes apparent that it is the process preluding the actual agreement that makes possible more integrative forms of value capturing, through for example negotiation or a market-oriented redesign of the anterior process. These more integrative forms however are not necessarily to be understood in a solely financial sense. This thesis proposes to couple the concept of value capturing with the policy mode in the new actionable definition ‘facilitative value capturing*’, and to therethrough see value capturing within a facilitative context as an active exercise of attaining public spatial policy objectives. In conclusion this study proposes to use the definition of facilitative value capturing as a starting point, from the contention that even when public parties cannot or will not take a more risk-bearing role to the development, they still ought to take a proactive role towards achieving their spatial objectives, as they have an inherent responsibility to shape the environment, and facilitative therein needn’t equal laissez faire. <br/><br/>*Facilitative value capturing: ""Maximising the way in which the area development contributes to public spatial policy objectives through (synergetic) negotiations, transfer of operational risks or anterior process design.""<br","Value capturing; Area Development; Land policy; Dutch municipalities; Anterior agreements; Developer contributions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

The importance of this combination is found in the importance of the two of them seperately. Climate proofing neighbourhoods is necessary when considering climate change which will only increase rain water nuisances. Improving livability is important as it has an influence on people’s and especially children’s future prospects. Combining both measures in a fruitful way provides more financial means, is more sustainable and is more pleasant for inhabitants. <br/>The Schilderswijk is and represents a multicultural, low income, low livability neighbourhood that is densly built and well located. Furthermore it has a reputaion bigger than itself that had to be dealt with. These place specific characteristics are researched by mapping, literature and observations. <br/>Livability is researched in a broad sense relying on a framework based on ecology in which three types of livabililty are distinguished: perceived livability, apparent livability and presumed livability. Within these three types the following aspects are considered to measure livability: 1) Health and security/safety 2) Material prosperity, income inequality, inequality in happiness 3) Social relationships 4) Control on amount of social interaction and control on physical environment 5) Contact with nature. Livability is researched by looking at data and statistics, performing fieldwork in which behavior was observed, mapping, literature and with the help of interviews. <br/>Rain water nuisances are researched by looking at data, literature, mapping as well as fieldwork in observing how they occur. <br/><br/>It was found that the following solutions have a positive effect or provide opportunities in creating positive effects on both livability and rain water nuisances in the Schilderswijk:<br/>Kitchen gardens in combination with rain barrels,<br/>Water squares in combination with sports or playgrounds,<br/>Delftse stoep with the boundary condition of partly replacing paved surfaces by (semi)-permeable ones,<br/>Car free streets where one can make space for greenery and activities such as playing or relaxing,<br/>Built-in trampolines in playgrounds, the space underneath can act as a temporary water buffer,<br/>Fountains can give identity to a place, create a more pleasurable microclimate and can partly be temporary water buffers,<br/>Water playgrounds provide a socializing place for children and parents, while at the same time the height differences can be temporary water buffers and educate children on water issues,<br/>Sport fields with infiltration boxes underneath,<br/>Nature playgrounds, and finally<br/>Parks with added functions and zoning in terms of height differences.<br/>Specifically for the Schilderswijk, the reputation is one of the major issues. Solutions can be found in connecting the Schilderswijk more to the city center and train station, making a quality out of the unique retail offer by making themed shopping streets and giving a new swing to the name of the neighbourhood by introducing street arts. Especially street art can also have an added positive effect on livability in a multicultural neighbourhoods as it allows inhabitants to show off their culture and create places to be proud of. <br","Livability; rain water management; Schilderswijk","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","",""

Fire-based emergencies in a building are dynamic environments that can be simulated to better understand, analyse, and contribute to safer and smarter buildings. While different spatial representations exist, <i>voxels</i> provide a structured, flexible and efficient 3-dimensional grid for applications like analysis, classification, surface reconstruction and simulation. Furthermore, voxels implicitly contain topological and spatial relations that are relevant for 3-dimensional events such as evacuations in a rapidly changing building, with a fire spanning multiple floors.<br/><br/>Voxels can suffer from the problem of scale and resolution, where high resolution voxel scenes take up a lot of memory space. For this, there are solutions that make more efficient data storage for voxels possible. These include but are not limited to: the regular voxel grid, the sparse voxel octree, directed acyclic graphs and the use of space filling curves. Finding the shortest safe path for the evacuees is a challenge, especially if the area is dynamic, and there are other actors that have to share the space. Many different pathfinding algorithms exist, each with their own speciality, such as A*, any-angle pathfinding algorithms like Theta* and incremental algorithms like D*-Lite. <br/><br/>In this thesis, we look at whether voxelised indoor spaces can form the basis for evacuation simulations with multiple actors in a dynamic situation. We do this by comparing both the voxel data structure and pathfinding algorithm combinations in a dynamic evacuation simulation application. The comparison is done by looking at the quality of the paths, if the algorithms are able to adapt to a dynamic situation and the performance of the paths, both in computation times and memory load.<br/><br/>These experiments reveal that a time-aware variant of A* is able to outperform the other algorithms, when applied on a sparse Morton grid. Additionally, it shows that the use of a sparse Morton grid is preferable to implementing a full octree or the use of a non-sparse regular voxel grid for dynamic multi-actor voxel scenes. Finally, the experiments show that dynamic events can be added into pathfinding algorithms by separating walking the path from finding the path, and using a data structure that is time-aware.","Voxels; Pathfinding; Dynamic; Evacuation planning; Indoor; 3D","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

HA’s draw up their investment forecasts yearly for the next 5 years to construct, improve or maintain homes and other real estate investments. Since 2013, the realization rate of new construction plans by HA’s, which is the comparison of forecasts (dPi) against realized plans (dVi) decreased due to HA’s not realizing new build homes within the time they propose to realize them in their forecast plans. HA’s currently use valuation methods which assist them to mitigate emerging risks that affect new build plans of HA’s. However, valuation methods have been found to focus on indexable risks and capture financial loss while excluding time effect of risks. This means that new build investment forecast as currently conducted yields inaccurate results and are considered too optimistic. Forecasts that are too optimistic lead to disappointments from tenant organizations and municipalities, reduced financial guarantees from lenders, long waiting times for tenants and affects financial feasibilities which rely on accurate prediction of time to completion of projects. <br/>The aim of the research is to explore how new build plans can be made more realistic by accurately predicting the delivery time of investment forecasts. The study results in the identification of risks that lead to delay of new build investment plans and their subsequent indicators. The risks include long permit procedures, long land acquisition processes or lack of land positions to build, long tendering procedures, contractor related delays, rise in construction costs and lack of capacity at municipal level in dealing with development projects. The indicators of risks which statistically significantly predicted project time are construction costs, change in input price index of material and labour costs as of date when decision was made to tender, municipal location, and type of construction i.e., on empty ground or existing site that needs demolition. The project indicators can be used by HA's to accurately predict project time via stochastic decision tree models (SDTA) that rely on multiple linear regression (MLR) and Monte Carlo simulations (MCS). Supervisory bodies can also use these to gauge realism of new build investment forecast.<br","Housing associations; new build; Stochastic Decision Tree Analysis (SDTA); Multiple linear regression (MLR); Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS); systematic and unsystematic risks; investment forecast; delivery time","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","","52.132600, 5.291300"

These motion planners are able to calculate a motion plan to execute a safe grasp, while taking environmental constraints into account. In human-robot interaction, a well known problem is that humans are uneasy with the arm motion the robot executes, because the motion plan lacks parametrization of variables which would account for the impression of legibility. In this study we develop a method which allows for teleoperated learning from a single demonstration that is perceived more legible by humans. The operator uses the Geomagic Touch haptic device to demonstrate a movement of the robot’s end-effector. Modeling a motion path from a single teleoperated demonstration is achieved using Dynamic Movement Primitives. The effectiveness of the teleoperated LfD module has been demonstrated both in simulation and on a TIAGo robot in a variety of poses. An experiment is conducted in which a state-of-the-art motion planner was compared to the proposed LfD method and the ability of human participants to predict the goal object of the robot. Using the teleoperated LfD method, the ability to predict the goal objects increases significantly and the human is more confident in making the prediction (P = 0.0102 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively). This means that with the learning method a more legible grasp was generated than with the state-of-the-art motion planner.","Learning from demonstration; Legibility; Teleoperation; Human-Robot Interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Flipse, S.M. (graduation committee); McCune, J.S. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Personalised medicine represents an increasingly used practice using a patient’s biology to guide their treatment. The implementation of personalised medicine possibly increases the quality of health care and life of the patient by minimising side effects and increasing effectiveness. Personalising medicine can be implemented through a platform which facilitates model-informed precision dosing (MIPD), including various models describing the pharmacokinetics of a specific drug. To make MIPD become clinical practice, wider interdisciplinary collaborations, for example, between pharmacometricians and pharmacists should be studied to learn about their communication and collaboration when using a MIPD platform, and to generate data evaluating the cost–benefit of MIPD in healthcare to motivate professionals to use a MIPD platform. Barriers to implementing these MIPD platforms into clinical practice are not thoroughly studied. However, the functionalities of the MIPD platform should align with the needs of the practitioners as they have to base their dosing regimen on that MIPD platform. As an exemplar for identifying barriers and facilitators of MIPD and corresponding MIPD platforms, this study focuses on the alkylating agent busulfan. Busulfan was chosen because it has a narrow therapeutic index, which often necessitates dosing to a target plasma exposure, while the use of MIPD is beneficial compared to the current clinical practice. Thus, busulfan dosing highlights the importance of using MIPD to improve patient outcomes. Identifying the barriers and facilitators of the MIPD platform, and the interdisciplinary collaboration between pharmacists and pharmacometricians will hopefully give insight on how to stimulate their collaboration and the use of MIPD. This research, therefore, aimed to explore and describe 1) the obstacles in the interdisciplinary collaboration between pharmacists and pharmacometricians, 2) why MIPD platforms are not widely used in clinical practice and what practitioners would need to implement these platforms, and 3) what pharmacists and pharmacometricians need to establish an effective interdisciplinary collaboration using a MIPD platform and thereby create a learning environment. Through conducting a literature research and interviews, collaboration and technology acceptance aspects were studied more in-depth to define the problem and subsequently explore ideas to address this problem. Both disciplines perceived building a connection and keeping their own expertise as important in their collaboration. They also needed their roles in the collaboration and the MIPD platform to be clear in terms of knowing what to expect from the other and how to handle the MIPD platform. Because of these perceptions and needs, we proposed two ways to improve the collaboration and the MIPD platform to subsequently contribute to establishing a learning environment through the MIPD platform. Those two implementations are: 1) the implementation of an introductory course where the disciplines collaborate through the introduction, and 2) tailoring the MIPD platform into two discipline-specific portals, which are based on their skills and tasks. The implementations were tested in interaction through conducting a focus group where pharmacists and pharmacometricians were asked to rank codes retrieved from the interviews on their relevance based on hypothetical scenarios, representing real-world cases. Pharmacists and pharmacometricians perceived connection and trust as important aspects of their collaboration and did expect these to be sufficiently stimulated through the implementation of the introductory course. Regarding the MIPD platform, they perceived the efficiency, in terms of easiness and time-effectiveness in use, as its most important aspect. Thus, efficiency should be ensured in the development of the MIPD platform. To adopt the MIPD platform, it should cover a lot of different patients highlighting the extensive research necessary when building the models within the MIPD platform. To stimulate the implementation of MIPD platforms and the collaboration between pharmacists and pharmacometricians using the MIPD platform, further research should focus on introductory MIPD courses,the MIPD platform design, and including other disciplines in the collaborations around MIPD and MIPD platforms.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences | Communication Design for Innovation","",""

The European project NOVIMOVE researches the inefficiencies and suggests solutions. One of the solutions for reducing waiting times in ports is the placement of Modular Mobile Terminals (MMTs). The focus of the research will be on the ports of Rotterdam and Antwerp. In this research assignment, three questions are addressed. The first question is: What are the criteria that a potential location must meet to be able to place one or more MMTs? The second question is: Which potential locations for the placement of MMTs in the ports of Rotterdam and Antwerp provide the highest time savings compared to the situation without MMTs? The last question is: What are the most suitable locations for MMTs based on the combination of the pre-defined criteria and the expected time savings? In order to be able to give answers to these questions, qualitative research will first be carried out on the basis of predefined criteria. Then, a quantitative research is done with a static time-saving model. The results of both the qualitative and quantitative research indicate that for the port of Rotterdam location 1 is the most suitable for the placement of MMTs. For the port of Antwerp, location 1 and location 2B are identified as the most suitable. Based on this investigation, a conclusion can only be drawn based on the qualitative and quantitative results.

Unfortunately, each modality suffers from its own application specific limitations, typically being difficulties in distinguishing different materials or tissues from each other in the case of acoustic wave fields and a low spatial resolution in the case of electromagnetic wave fields. To exploit the advantages of both imaging modalities, methods to combine them include image fusion, usage of spatial priors and application of joint or multi-physics inversion methods. The latter can be based on empirical relations between acoustic and electromagnetic medium properties or on structural similarity. In this work, two joint inversion algorithms based on structural similarity are presented. To account for the structural similarity the error-functional of standard Born inversion is extended with an additional penalty term. This additional term is either based on the L2-norm of the cross-gradient (CG), i.e. the cross product of the gradients of the acoustic and electromagnetic contrasts or on the L2-norm of the gradient difference (GD), i.e. the difference between the normalized gradients of both contrasts. To test the proposed methods, two synthetic models are considered; one with the gradients of the contrasts pointing in the same direction and one where the gradients point in opposite directions. Results show that the GD constraint significantly improves the resolution for the electromagnetic reconstruction compared to separate BI. The mean square errors (MSE) of the reconstructed profiles for the separate BI are 0.12 for the acoustic and 0.51 for the electromagnetic case, and for the joint GD inversion, 0.09 for the acoustic and 0.46 for the electromagnetic case. The joint GD inversion fails when using the model with the gradients of the contrasts pointing in opposite directions. The joint CG inversion does not enhance the reconstructed images, but shows similar performances for the different models.

The three distinct challenges of underwater acoustic communication are the low and nonuniform propagation speed, frequency-dependent attenuation and time-varying multipath propagation.<br/>To cope with these challenges, physical layer communication systems allow the selection of communication parameters based on environmental conditions and constraints. This is also known as link adaptation. In this thesis, the frequency-repetition spread-spectrum (FRSS) physical layer is studied. Various channel parameters are used to classify the optimal FRSS format. Furthermore, different machine learning classifiers are implemented to solve the classification problem. It is determined that the output signal-to-noise ratio provides enough information to switch effectively between transmission formats. Among the implemented machine learning classifiers, the decision tree strikes a good balance between performance and computational complexity. It is shown that a small performance gain can be achieved when custom channel parameters are extracted from the estimated impulse response and the equalizer error sequence using a deep neural network.<br/>Optimizing the equalization process is another method to better cope with difficult environmental conditions. Various adaptive filter algorithms are implemented for the decision feedback equalizer used in the FRSS receiver. The optimal algorithm parameters are found by means of algorithm unrolling. It is shown that the standard least mean squares algorithm cannot be outperformed by various other optimization algorithms that use linear or non-linear filters.<br/>The Watermark channel simulator is used to study the performance of the link adaptation and equalization optimization solutions for a wide range of underwater channels.<br","underwater acoustic communication; FRSS; link adaptation; adaptive modulation and coding; machine learning; neural network; equalization; optimization; wireless communication","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Artificial Intelligence Technology","",""

It has the power to transfer the listener to a different world. The first few notes of Brahms allegro amabile (op.120) instantly brings one in a state of presence, whereas Mahler’s fifth symphony’s adagietto or Wagner’s Lohengrin prelude slowly invites the audience in a trance of reverie. It’s something that touches and engulfs the soul each time it enters the inner ear. Pieces that are an assemblage of rhythms, tensions and proportions form a certain expression. To listen to and be embossed by such expressions of life is something that we do every day. We listen to music, read books, watch movies, go to museums and immerse ourselves with culture from all over the world. All of these things combined make us who and what we are. They serve as incubators for new ideas. When you work in the creative field, everything you do is connected to who you are, therefore making you a part of the past.

The reason why RRAM has not seen mass adoption yet is due to its defect-prone nature. The resistance of RRAM can assume any value within its operating range and its resistance can be divided into five states instead of the regular two logic states. Conventional test techniques are incapable of detecting unique faults due to their inability to distinguish between all five cell states, resulting in a large number of test escapes. Therefore, new test methods, such as Design-For-Testability (DFT), need to be developed to reduce the number of test escapes and ensure customer satisfaction. This work proposes two new DFTs: Parallel-Reference Read (PRR) and Closed-Loop Write (CLW). The PRR DFT is a replacement for the regular read circuit, which enables the detection of all five cell states, while the CLW DFT is an addition to the regular write circuit, which introduces feedback during the write operation. From these two DFTs, the PRR DFT is selected for further development and its design is validated. From the validation, it is concluded that the PRR DFT can detect all five cell states. Moreover, under process variations, the PRR DFT will provide the correct output in 95.90% of the cases. Furthermore, the PRR DFT improves the overall resistive-defect detection capability by 14.79% when compared to a regular read circuit. Finally, the PRR DFT offers 100% identified fault coverage while only requiring 4N write operations, 5N read operations and an area overhead of 14N<sub>c</sub> transistors, where N and N<sub>c</sub> are the total number of cells and the total number of columns in the RRAM array, respectively.","RRAM; ReRAM; OxRAM; Testing; Test development; DFT; March test; Defects; Faults","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

It operates on a ‘take-make-dispose’ model due to which key issues such as resource scarcity, waste generation, and environmental pressure occur. The circular economy has been attributed to the need to utilize waste flows more effectively, thereby reducing raw material demand. By 2050, the Dutch Government aims to transition to Circular Economy and organize the building industry in a way to ensure sustainable construction by use, reuse, maintenance and dismantling of objects. <br/><br/>Remanufacturing is a strategy of the circular economy that supports this approach. It is a process of returning a used product to its original performance with a warranty that is equivalent to or better than that of newly manufactured product. It is an important component of resource efficient manufacturing as it reduces the dependency on virgin materials.Through research, it was observed that the principles of circular economy are well established theoretically but lack guidelines that make them applicable in practice. Therefore, the thesis focuses to find out “how” remanufacturing of building products be implemented as a strategy to accelerate the progress towards a circular built environment. <br/>The project develops a remanufacturing canvas and list of criteria through literature study of successful examples of remanufacturing such as Xerox, Caterpillar, Canon, Philips MRI Systems and Davies Office furniture. Further the proposed canvas is validated through a case study of the building De Satelliet of DNB complex to investigate their remanufacturing potential of EoL façade elements which were disassembled with an intention of giving a second life. <br/><br/>The study includes crafting guidelines for the remanufacturing of EoL façade elements. Remanufacturing as a strategy was evaluated through assessments based on Cost, Embodied energy, and thermal performance of the façade elements. The results from the assessments were in favour of remanufacturing. However, it was concluded that while remanufacturing depicts the power of smaller loop and follows all the principles of circular economy, it is important to note that remanufacturing process shifts a large amount of responsibility from a customer to the manufacturer. There is always a risk of creating more impact than virgin production and hence decisions must be supported through results from calculations of embodied carbon and LCA.<br","Remanufacturing; Facades; Circular strategies; second life; Renovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-12-31","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","",""

BIM technology can facilitate energy renovation projects by following circular design principles. A BIM library can offer most of the benefits of standardization, which is a crucial aspect of a successful circular design. The study's main research question was: “How can a BIM components library facilitate the design of a circular standardized façade renovation system that meets the energy-saving measures and it is adjustable?”It was intended to design a circular components library with BIM software that could provide the designer with the necessary information to help the design process of energy façade renovations. The library consists of standardized components and their different configurations so that the final façade system can be adjustable to different buildings. The library can provide the designers with all the information regarding the components' energy performance and circularity level by creating several evaluation indicators. The main focus of the design was the management of the data and the structure of the BIM library. The findings of the thesis are based on the research of the existing frameworks and guidelines and the “research by design” of the BIM library. The main stages of the thesis were the analog design of the circular standardized façade system and how it can be flexible, the digital design of the façade system with the creation of the BIM library, the validation of the design and the function of the library through the application to the case study building. The BIM library can facilitate the design process by:• Providing easy and quick accessibility to the different circular components of the façade system. • Grouping and organizing the components’ families of the library according to their function and relevance with other components of the system. • Providing information regarding energy performance and circularity with the evaluation indicators. • Counting the different components of the system and their different configurations. This can effectively contribute to the standardization of the system, the minimization of material waste and time, and it will improve its overall circularity level. This thesis provides a pragmatic perspective of the BIM library design and application and an instructional process for the user. It can be used as a starting point for these types of renovation projects. Further research and applications of the BIM library should follow this thesis approach. Also, changes need to be made to the data structure of BIM to improve the efficiency of the proposed library.","Circulair economy; energy renovation; BIM technology; BIM library; components; Facade design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","As the global population rise, climate conditions get more and more unpredictable, natural resources deplete; cities need to take action in order to sustain healthy living conditions as well as to ensure food safety. Currently, cities are solely dependent on external sources and suburban areas for natural resources and food as well as waste management. This linear metabolism results in cities consuming 60-80% of natural resources and producing 50% of waste globally. (Tsui et al., 2021) This problem can be overcome by introducing urban farming into cities by utilising waste and underused space as a resource for urban food production. Waste can be circulated in the city in order to generate a network of waste producing functions and farms. <br/><br/>There are urban farming systems which can digest waste and produce supplements for urban food production. However, the quest of choosing an urban farming system based on existing vacant spaces and waste flows is a complicated task. The complexity is a result of variables in the equation which may effect decision making such as different systems, waste types, vacant space characteristics as well as the size of spaces and the quantity of available waste. Moreover, in sites consisting of numerous vacant spaces and waste sources decision making is even more complex and laborious. If human designers were to perform this task then they would need to iterate countless times for each vacant space, each waste source close to it and each potential urban farming systems. However, when it comes iterating and repeating the same steps, computers are explicitly faster, time-efficient and error free. Therefore a decision making tool which can assist designers to choose urban farming systems based on existing conditions can be a practical resource. <br/><br/>This paper investigates how to integrate urban farming into cities by utilising under-used spaces and existing waste sources via using a decision making tool. The design rules and the methodology are formed based on literature review regarding different farming systems, varying waste flows and computational approaches. A prototype of the tool is generated and tested on 2 case studies in order to showcase the potential of such an approach combining food production with waste management. <br","Urban Farming; Decision Making Tool; Waste As A Resource; Urban Farming Systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","",""

(mentor); Stoter, J.E. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In recent years, there has been an exponential growth in the need for 3D spatial information, particularly 3D models representing the geographic information of the urban environment. The existence of a comprehensive integrated 3D model representing the condition of the underground utility networks in accordance with the above-ground city objects is crucial in the ever-increasing infrastructure demands. To acquire such models the related spatial information (geo-information) is required. This information and its quality determine the quality of the models since it describes the functionality, physical properties, semantic details of the urban features as well as the between them relationships (if exist) and interconnections. Currently, there are available various 3D models that, however, are limited in the representation of objects at a city level, with the corresponding underground information about the utility networks supporting cities’ functionality being restricted and/or underdeveloped. Although the modeling of underground utility networks is under development, there are available models that allow for the mapping of the existing information to predefined schema. However, these models have some limitations that restrain the display of the integrated condition with the above-ground city objects as well as they do not support (completely) the interdependencies between networks of different uses. <br/>This thesis focuses on how to develop a three-dimensional model of underground utility networks integrated with above-ground objects, in order to utilize the model in real-world scenarios (disaster management, cost-effective <br/>routes). These networks concern sewage networks (and the stored sub-networks), while the objects are related to the buildings of the study area. For the research, vector datasets were used, related to the existing underground utility networks of a limited area of the Delft University of Technology campus, as well as network elements related to them. For the examination of the proposed model creation, a methodology was developed that could constitute a general approach for relevant applications, considering the condition of the available vector datasets of the similar and/or relevant content. <br/>This methodology is divided into seven stages that concern the preparation of the research and data collection process, the statistical and spatial analysis of their <br/>content, the integration and cleaning approaches to reconstruct invalid information, and the creation of a relational database to store them. Finally, based on the results from these steps model, routing analysis and functionality were implemented to examine the effectiveness of such model in real-world scenarios. According to the results and limitations that arose, suggestions for the harmonization of the data are addressed as well as future application proposals.<br/>Experimentation demonstrates that the developed methodology lead to the creation of a model that, although it represents a simplification of the existing geographical information, it can successfully be used for the implementation of the proposed case studies (disaster management, cost-effective routes). However, taking into account the poor quality of the input data, the model necessitates improvements in order to be used out of the box for other applications, as well as to verify its compliance with available standards supporting the mapping of the including information.","Underground utility networks; PostgreSQL; PostGIS; Routing; pgRouting analysis; OGC standards; Utility Networks ADE; KLIC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

The goal of this track was to create a music building in the Binckhorst, The Hague, that not only provides a space for musical performance, but does something greater, by contributing something to the location, city or music as a whole. The Binckhorst is a former industrial site that is in full transformation by the municipality to a lively urban area. The old industrial character of this site often gets lost in the process. At the same time, as has come forward from the site and manifeso research, what the Binckhorst is lacking is exchange. Both old and new projects are often walled off or turned inwards, and don't contribute to the site as a whole. The same is the case for the Binckhorst in the city of The Hague. It is where the municipality put all the functions it did not want elsewhere, and the location has barriers on all four sides, giving the people of the city and surroundings no reason to go there. The design brings this exchange back in the form of musical exchange. From case study research, four functions and their interrelations were derived that contribute to musical exchange. The four functions are performance space, practice space, workshop spaces and meeting space. In practice, these functions together lead to buildings becoming musical incubators, bringing forward musical interaction and musical talent. The design combines these functions in different ways to create different scenario's of musical exchange. It does this by re-using containers found throughout the Binckhorst and transforming them into modules with different musical and auxiliary functions. These modules can be rearranged in any manner within the space of a re-used canopy from BAM, the square that is created in front, an old craneway, and the waterfront of the old Binckhaven. The containers are moved and stacked using the old harbour cranes, and moved by using transport casettes. With this modular system many different configurations are possible. The design illustrates the possiblities of this system with three variants that play into the capabilities of the building, missing concert capacities in the city, and the ambitions of the municipality as mentioned in the Popnota 2017. Material re-use, circularity and the identity of the site are important themes in the project. The majority the building consists of re-used materials, sourced from the Binckhorst. Wherever this was not possible, mainly circular alternatives where used. The building is assembled in such a manner that is can be taken apart again. By re-using materials from the Binckhorst, using the characteristic elements of the site, and incorporating elements in the Binckhorst lost in redevelopment, such as street art, the identity of the Binckhorst is preserved and shown in the design.<br/><br","MUSIC; Circularity; Re-use; identity; Redevelopment; public buildings; Music Marvel; modular","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Public Building","Music Marvel","52.067833, 4.344778"

In this thesis, we studied the design of a goal-setting dialogue for a virtual coach to motivate people in the context of physical activity. The dialogue was designed to support people in setting SMART goals and to raise their self-efficacy. Part of the design was vicarious experiences in the form of examples of people who successfully achieved a physical activity goal. We gathered these examples and fit a model to predict which examples to show to a user during the conversation with the virtual coach. An experiment was conducted to evaluate whether there was an increase in users' self-efficacy after the conversation with the virtual coach, how motivating the given examples were, and users' attitudes towards the virtual coach. The results indicated that users' self-efficacy was lower after the interaction with the virtual coach.

The low-temperature readiness is assessed based on heat balance and air temperature simulations. Computational Fluid Design within the software is used to determine the effect of the renovation measures on the draught rate and radiant temperature, as these aspects are critically affected by the lowering of the radiator's supply temperature. Additionally, the effect on radiant asymmetry is measured in the software program Stralingsverloop. The outcomes of the study regarding low-temperature readiness indicate the differences in effectiveness of the measures for the different typologies. The study on thermal comfort shows the posibilities for optimizing the thermal comfort through the integration of renovation measures, in particular through the installation of balance ventilation and high performance glazing.

Studies have shown that cities are responsible for major energy use and waste emissions. In dealing with the growing environmental problems, people have to look to the cities they live in. Today, urbanisation is still accelerating worldwide which heralds a potentially huge opportunity to improve the environment by increasing the energy sustainability of cities.<br/><br/>To address the energy sustainability of cities, policymakers and urban planners are looking for ways to control energy consumption in buildings. Faced with a large number of urban buildings and complex climate factors, the measurement of building energy consumption has to be done with the help of relevant simulation software. Luckily, software and data formats associated with the calculation of building energy consumption have matured over the years through the efforts of academics and research institutions. This largely helps to solve the complex problem mentioned above. However, these elements still need to be optimized and improved. In this thesis, the research will focus on one of the urban energy simulation software CitySim, the 3D city database 3DCityDB and the 3D city model data format CityGML. Although it is currently possible to rely on these elements for urban energy simulation, the whole simulation process is complex. The main reason for this problem is the number of data extractions, data conversions and data storage required throughout the whole process. Also, the lack of proficiency in data formats, software usage and data storage can be a difficult problem for potential users. Therefore, this research will focus on developing a python-based interface to achieve the goal of well connecting the entire urban energy simulation process.<br/><br/>This approach simplifies the process of urban energy simulation from the preparation of a complete database related to urban energy simulation, to the full process of data extraction, conversion and simulation in python, to the final storage of simulation results back to the database. In addition to this, several user-friendly customised operations are also developed in python. In this way, I hope to help more users to conduct urban energy simulation analysis conveniently.<br","Urban Energy Simulation; CitySim; 3DCityDB; 3D BAG 2.0; Python","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

(mentor); van Ham, M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Vechtzoom-Zuid in post war neighbourhood Overvecht experiences multiple problems, the modernistic layout does not fit our society, the social cohesion is low and the inhabitants have a lot of social-economical problems. Shopping centre 'De Klop' is located in the centre of this neighbourhood, and experiencing a lot of problems as vacancy, nuisance and neglect. Due to its important location within the neighbourhood, spatially and socially, all the problems of the neighbourhood come together in the centre and, vice versa, the centre has a major impact on these problems. Therefore this research answers the following research question: 'How can modernistic shopping centre de Klop in post-war expansion neighbourhood Overvecht be transformed into an attractive centre that increases the social cohesion of Vechtzoom Zuid, while coping with transitions affecting shopping centres over the next 30 years?' <br/><br/>The research consists of multiple parts. The first part shows how the design of a centre can increase social cohesion in a neighbourhood. This can be done in three ways: Firstly, by making the centre overall more attractive and thereby increasing the use of public facilities. Secondly, by introducing new green spaces, where people can recreate and meet each other. And thirdly, by adding new housing in order to make housing career within the neighbourhood. <br/><br/>The second part shows the original ideas behind the neighbourhood, what changed in current society and what is the core problem within the design. The neighbourhood was built based on the ideas of CIAM, and the ‘Wijkgedachte’, but the changing composition of the population and social idea of top down collective social community caused problems. The collective spaces aren’t used as they are supposed to be, making the area unlively. The barriers caused by the car, and the repetition of buildings make the shopping centre unrecognisable resulting in even less liveliness. Therefore with the transformation of the centre the aim should be to make new, recognisable and accessible collective spaces, that are not yet to be found in the neighbourhood.<br/><br/>Lastly it is researched how a shopping centre should be designed in order to be adaptable to societal changes in the future. The centre should be densified, new slow routing has to be implemented and the transformation should consist out of different vast materialised spaces, functioning as a condition for multiple ways of shopping and commerce where the extremes are fun shopping and run shopping. <br/><br/>The answers of these three parts lead to the objectives and a design goal for the transformation of de Klop: Create new flexible and accessible collective spaces as a condition for a safe and recognisable heart of the neighbourhood where current and future residents can find a motive to visit and meet each other. Resulting in a transformation proposal that creates new flexible central spaces along a slow traffic line, breaking through the zoning of the Modernistic layout.<br","centre; Post-war neighbourhood; transformation; scenario based design; social cohesion; Overvecht","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","","52.119242, 5.099943"

This kind of community in urgent need of renewal contains three aspects: spatial, social and the process of renewal. This study regards these three aspects as the main line running through the whole research, and studies the current space situation, residents' life and the problems in the existing renewal process of migrant laneways.<br/><br/>Pattern language is the main analysis method and design tool of this research. By sorting out the patterns in the migrant laneway, these messy spaces are standardized. In addition, pattern language can be used to increase public engagement. This study introduces a new co-design toolkit: pattern buffet. This toolkit helps residents and designers co-design their communities. Work efficiency and program feasibility can be increased while public engagement is being added. More importantly, the result of this design with public engagement is more sustainable and inclusive.<br/><br/>At the social level, this study also proposes a soft strategy to help migrant workers better integrate into the city. The authors reskill these residents towards the opportunities found in a social trend: the senior care industry. While vacancies in the industry are being filled, migrant workers can get longer careers and higher wages to integrate into the city.<br/><br/>Therefore, this thesis develops an approach which enables the urban dilapidated areas to be regenerated in a co-design way. This regeneration framework is very new in the Chinese context. Pattern language, as the most important tool in this study, has been examined for its role and function.

The pandemic caused a sudden shift in the work environment, and quarantines and lockdowns in particular, brought about much change. Since changes in society affect employees’ preferences and needs regarding the future work environment, existing research on employees' preferences and needs regarding the work environment in such an exceptional pandemic context may be questioned. Through a literature study, three exploratory interviews, 22 in-depth interviews, a survey and a focus group this qualitative research examines how employees who were forced to work from home as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic envision their future work environment, and what the role of the homebased work environment is in this. This information can be used by the organizations to respond to the<br/>preferences and needs of their workforce when thinking about their future work environment. This research approach, in particular, may be employed by organizations in this process, as well as housing developers when thinking about the future house or real estate consultants when advising companies on their future work environment. <br/><br/>From the literature study and the empirical study it is clear that working from home has left an incredibly positive impression on many employees. The pandemic certainly affected how, when and where employees prefer to work. The research found that the home-based work environment - the house, the employee, the activities, and the support facilities - affects the employees’ preferences and needs regarding the future work environment. Consequently, the future work environment includes the homebased work environment, and organizations anticipate a hybrid work environment in the future. It was discovered that other than the resources and facilities, it is important to take into consideration the principles of breaking with the past, health and well-being, communication, control and customization, social cohesion, flexibility, organizational policy, and technology when envisioning this future work environment.","COVID-19 pandemic; post-pandemic; future work environment; home-based work environment; preferences and needs","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

Hydrogen can be produced using technologies that do not emit CO2 or other greenhouse gasses (“green H2”). Hydrogen can be transported in big quantities and long distances unlike electricity and can play the role of a clean fuel. The emerging hydrogen economy, which will be accompanied by the gradual phase-out of fossil fuels, will significantly impact ports around the world. Ports can and should play a pivotal role in this “energy revolution”. Apart from import and export services, ports often include industrial clusters, they provide servicing and refuelling to visiting vessels and connect major trade routes.<br/><br/>This study aims at understanding and providing insights on challenges that the above-explained transition will create in a port environment focusing on hydrogen. Firstly, a favourable policy environment for hydrogen projects in the ports and maritime sector is a key topic that this study will address. This is included as a conclusion in many reports and port conferences. Secondly, the questions related to terminal planning and area requirements of hydrogen terminals remain unanswered as large scale hydrogen projects do not exist yet -with many being under development-, and thus this research will try to shed light on area calculations of hydrogen terminals. Thirdly, and lastly, terminals operators, investors and policy makers will need to make decisions on the preferred hydrogen carrier and location for various hydrogen projects that will be developed in the near future. Therefore, a method of comparison of different alternatives is required, especially when terminals are planned next to existing liquid bulk terminals.<br","Ports; Hydrogen import terminal; hydrogen; Ammonia; Multi-criteria analysis; LOHC; safety; Storage; Supply Chain","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-06-16","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

This paper introduces a physics-based reconstruction method that uses a known sail rest shape combined with this point cloud data to reconstruct the sail configuration at the time that the measurement was taken. By using a physics-based sail model and the knowledge that the sail is subject to gravity and wind forces together with a known sail rest shape, we can create plausible reconstructions even for areas in the sail where fewer to no markers are placed. Using measurements that were taken before this reconstruction method was proposed in combination with an approximated sail rest shape and material properties, our reconstruction method was approximated to have an average reconstruction distance below 1cm for a 2.5m by 4.5m sail. Taking new measurements following our proposed guidelines in combination with having a more correct sail rest shape and better knowing the sail material properties is very likely to yield even better results.","Sailing; Reconstruction; Simulation; 3D-markers; physics-based; Sail; Shell","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","A transition towards a sustainable food system needs to happen to ensure people can live a healthy life on this planet. Picnic as a retailer in the food system is the bridge between producers and consumers of food products. Many people hold values which are in line with the food transition, which means they care for others, the environment, and their health. During the purchase of food however, these values are not always acted upon. This can be described as a value-action gap. There is an opportunity for Picnic to support customers in closing the value-action gap for food-transition friendly grocery shopping.<br/><br/>There is a knowledge gap around what the values are that are important to Dutch customers when online grocery shopping, and which hurdles are present in the service of Picnic to foster the food transition. An exploratory study amongst Picnic customers shows the hurdles are formed by a lack consideration, confidence, and information. Furthermore, other values can be more important and there can be hesitancy towards change. To overcome these, dedicated moments should be created in the shopping journey to consider values. The design statement therefore is:<br/><br/>I want to design an experience for Picnic customers who have values in line with the food transition but do not fully act upon them, by providing them with a moment to reflect and adapt so they can become proud of their actions.<br/><br/>To design an experience for Picnic customers that allows for the desired behaviour, an iterative design process is used. During this process, four design guidelines are uncovered: interventions for reflection on food decisions should be controlled, specific, goal-oriented, and quick. <br/><br/>The final proposed intervention is a Betere Boodschappen functionality, where customers get control over their shopping environment. They reflect on their values through answering three questions and based on those answers get personal suggestions for functionalities that can help them pay more attention to their values. A mixed method study, consisting of a quantitative between-group study and qualitative interviews, is used to test the effect of the intervention. There is a positive significant effect on behaviour and behavioural control over buying sustainable groceries. Customers furthermore indicate that doing better groceries is made easier for them through the functionality, and the store feels more personal. A plan for implementation of the functionality in steps is proposed, and recommendations are made to others designing for transitions inside a business.","Values; Online groceries; Sustainable consumer behaviour; Food transition; Perceived behavioural control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

FBs larger than five centimeters have the highest chance to damage or obstruct the oesophagus.<br/>Goal: This study aims to design a gripping instrument for the removal of a 7.5 centimeter long, hard FB with a diameter of 15 millimeters inside the oesophagus.<br/>Problem Analysis: The available endoscopic devices are divided into micro and macro shape grippers. The macro shape grippers are most suitable for large objects, but they have reduced grip or an unreliable deployment. A questionnaire held among endoscopists underlined the need for new endoscopic instruments to remove large objects from the oesophagus. Seven functional requirements were made for the design of an endoscopic removal device.<br/>Conceptual Design: Sixteen different working principles, of which eight are applied on the inside of an object and eight on the outside an object, were proposed for the removal of objects from a narrow space. With four technical requirements, these 16 principles were tested, after which ten principles remained that were tested on three clinical requirements. A final seven principles were all elaborately tested on four different object shapes, which lead to a macro shape gripper concept with multiple barbs.<br/>EndoBarb Development: A barb was designed with two legs to avoid sharp parts. The dimensions of a single barb were determined by the maximum barbs available in the biopsy channel, four. The legs of the barbs were equally distributed along the FB. Furthermore, the handle for the EndoBarb was designed.<br/>EndoBarb Evaluation: Parallel and serial barb deployment of the EndoBarb was evaluated with a human-machine experiment with novices and experienced endoscopists on success rate, workload and preference. Serial barb deployed was found to be more successful and preferred by most participants, with minor differences in the workload.<br/>Discussion: The EndoBarb is a flexible instrument, which has to be made stiffer to increase the success rate.

At the same time real time experiments can take place as the faculty of ecology and biodiversity are in the building. A special root with experimental walls is placed on the façade of the building to provide a space for material innovation regarding among other nesting boxes. As designing for nature can be unpredictable the new intervention is fully modular and flexible for future upgrade and change, thus making the building future proof.<br/>The new added façade is made almost exclusively of timber modular components and local ecofriendly materials. It serves as a place for discussion, interaction and testing new materials and ecological processes. As the first seen building of the campus, it should mediate the profile of the whole campus. Biodiversity and ecofriendly design are some of the most important priorities of Utrecht University. This nature inclusive façade can act as a biodiversity hub for animals and humans. The building gives nesting, breeding and foraging opportunities for birds, bats, and insects. These spaces are transformed into labs and farms to create a healthy circle of life with 0 waste. The nest is used by the animals and in return they provide guano for fertilization of the trees of the campus, feathers for insulation and most importantly pollinate the local plants. These open labs and farms can be accessed by scientist, entrepreneurs, students, and visitors.<br","Biodiversity; modularity; second life; ethical farms; ecology; Circularity; Nature inclusive design; ecofriendly materials; urban biotopes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","52.0855437481077, 5.169325155561625"

This study aimed to analyse the accuracy of four different transpiration models, Penman-Monteith, Stanghellini, Priestley-Taylor, and Takakura for the calculation of tomato transpiration inside a soilless greenhouse. By addressing this knowledge gap the outcome of this study provides a step towards more autonomy in vegetable horticulture. During the summer a three month experiment was conducted in a Venlo-type soilless greenhouse in The Netherlands. The air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and net radiation were measured inside a tomato greenhouse. Hourly transpiration data measured using a combination of sap flow sensors and lysimeters, was compared to the four different models. The Penman-Monteith and Priestley-Taylor models, intended for outdoor use, had a similar accuracy as the Stanghellini and Takakura models that are developed for Venlo-type soilless greenhouse. When comparing the models error range to the average hourly transpiration, it is found that the models are not accurate enough for irrigation scheduling. A model sensitivity analysis illustrates how changes in net radiation, temperature, humidity and wind speed affect modelled tomato transpiration. A recommendation on methods to improve model accuracy is made.","Transpiration; Greenhouse; Modelling; Evaporation; Penman-Monteith; Stanghellini; Takakura; Tomato; Microclimate","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

So far, we have been following a linear economy model which follows a concept of “take-make-use-dispose” and causes a significantly large burden on the natural environment. For this reason, transition to a circular economy is important in order to keep the resources in the economy for as long as possible, and thus reduce this burden. With a rising building stock reaching its end of life, the number of renovations in the coming years will increase significantly. They are expected to reach 35 million in 2030. The main focus of these renovations will be to make buildings energy efficient. While we have been successful in reducing the operational carbon of buildings, there is still scope to reduce the embodied carbon. This is also the main motivator for circularity goals.<br/><br/>It is estimated that the façade may account for between 13 and 17% of the total embodied carbon associated with a building. There is however not a strategic process to designing a circular facade. The methodology followed is the research-through-design methodology.<br/><br/>This project develops a design framework through studying existing literature, taking into account existing examples and pilot research projects - Circl Pavilion, CRL. The process uses the 10R strategy - particularly the cases of Reclaim, Recycle, Reuse, Reduce. This is then applied to the case of Building 22 at the TU Delft campus, and 4 options are developed. The evaluation through a life cycle assessment and building circularity approach is conducted on the platform OneClickLCA. It was found that for a circular design, material selection is very important. Overall materials with a lower embodied carbon should be selected. Moreover, materials with a higher volume of reused content should be prioritized first and a higher volume of bio-based content should be prioritized second. There is also a need to document and create more technical information for circular materials.<br","Renovation; Facades; Circularity; Circular strategies; Design process","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","",""

During the analysis of the building and site it became clear that it fell under a particular typology. Huis ‘t Velde was known as ‘havezate’, a specific type of castle which provided privileges and political rights. It was an ensemble of estate and buildings that evolved over time and was used as fortified house. Many similar buildings are seen across the region and seemed to have various similarities. Often, those havezaten were not publicly accessible, resulting in nescience of the typology among many people. The term ‘havezate’ was often even replaced by ‘kasteel’ or ‘landhuis’, while the definition was not identical. These analysis resulted in the following research- and design question:<br/>How can fourteenth-century havezaten from Het Kwartier van Zutphen be characterized to formulate a building typology and how can this be made experienceable to the public in the re-design of Huis ‘t Velde?<br/><br/>Since the current use of Huis ‘t Velde does not make the typology experienceable, the whole estate and buildings will be re-designed to be publicly accessible. By attracting people and allowing them on the estate and inside the buildings they can become acquainted with the characteristics of the typology and take in the atmosphere that makes it so special. Huis ‘t Velde will host a hotel, with restaurant and wine tasting area, combined with some rental rooms, a shop and various outside spaces like a flower-, vegetable- and monumental garden. The majority of the (spatial) interventions are based on the conducted individual research into havezaten in the area around Zutphen. The results are combined into a design toolbox with interventions to use to make the characteristics of a havezate (more) experienceable to the public.

By requiring all future constructions to utilize the integration of energy efficient services into the building as well as emphasize the reduction of embodied energy in building materials, the nZEB goals for existing buildings has continued to be a challenge. Within the Netherlands, large estates of post-war housing require the renovation for improved energy efficiency to meet the thermal performance set by the directive, however the low renovation rate of buildings has limited progress thus stunting the major shift towards a more sustainable existing built environment.<br/>In the completed renovation projects, petroleum based materials have been utilized in most cases for insulation and particleboards. This raises the question of if the shift towards a more sustainable built environment that meets nZEB goals should still be utilizing materials that no longer meet the rationality of sustainable practices.<br/>Through the use of Bio-base Materials, renovations have the potential of not only decarbonize aspects of the entire renovation project but also shift towards following a circular economy design approach. By replacing the traditional construction materials, bio-base materials have the possibility of large scale integration in the built environment through a modular panel renovation approach. Specifically focused on agricultural bio-base materials, allow for the possibility of acknowledging the four steps of circular design, origin, composition, assembly, and future. Within the framework of the circular design approach, it was acknowledged that the origin of agriculture bio-base materials have limitations of scalability as well as have the potential of damaging the local ecosystem and land use designations through the increased pressure for cultivation of bio-base materials from agricultural waste flows.<br/>Although bio-base materials are inherently more sustainability sourced than traditional materials, by designing a controlled environment agriculture process for bio-base materials has been a radical and novel idea within the research for the guaranteed harvesting of bio-base material as well as integrated Water Energy Food Nexus concepts. By reducing water consumption of the bio-base materials in a Controlled Environment, as well as the by-product of grains, and increased efficiency, the application of the circular renovation design of the renovation elements acknowledges major parts of the WEF Nexus on a local and regional scale.<br/>A Controlled Environment growing bio-base materials for renovation application is designed for the future resilience of the agriculture bio-base material industry as well as enables positive impact on a local social scale and suggests that the shift towards decarbonized built environment and material elements must require a considerable and radical shift in order to meet the sustainable future goals of 2050.","bio-based materials; Renovation; Facades; NZEB; post-war housing; Controlled Environment Agriculture; Circular Economy; WEF-Nexus; Circular Design Strategies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

This alters the perspective on biogas as source of renewable electricity, heat or fuel to biogas as platform molecule able to couple the renewable hydrogen and bio-economy domain. The research shows that concept of third-generation upgrading relies on a technologically feasible, environmentally benign and economically sound production process. In this respect, the adoption of the concept of third-generation upgrading is supported via the valuation of the bio-carbon dioxide as scarce renewable carbon-containing molecule and valuable carbon sink. Therefore, the concept of third- generation upgrading should be supported via regulatory commitment, market creation, policy mechanisms and infrastructural changes. In this way, biogas can act as an invaluable source of bio-hydrogen and bio-carbon dioxide, spark system integration and stimulate energy security.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Semantic segmentation of aerial images is the ability to assign labels to all pixels of an image. It proves to be essential for various applications such as urban planning, agriculture and real-estate analysis. Deep Learning techniques have shown satisfactory results in performing semantic segmentation tasks. Training a deep learning model is an expensive operation, while most of the time manually labelled images are required. Additionally, a bottleneck in semantic segmentation projects concerns the annotation of images. Consequently, synthetic data, which consists of images from a virtual world that simulates the real world, can be used as training data for segmentation tasks to improve the classification results. Therefore, this thesis aims to create a pipeline that generates synthetic images with semantic segmentation labels to be used in an existing deep learning model and discuss how the generated synthetic data improves the semantic segmentation of aerial images. In this research work, an existing model (FuseNet), which in previous works achieved satisfactory results, is trained with solely synthetic data and a mix of real data in different training and testing scenarios to classify true ortho imagery from Haaksbergen, Netherlands and Potsdam, Germany. In addition, a benchmark of domain adaptation techniques is performed to close the domain gap between the synthetic and real imagery. The semantic maps include building, road and other classes. Experiments are performed to test the performance of the synthetic data using 1) Different 3D models of the virtual world, 2) Different quantities of synthetic and real training data, 3) Different cross-geographical scenarios, and 4) Different domain adaptation techniques. The assessment is based on the (mean) intersection over union (IoU), F1 score, precision and recall and an extensive visual assessment. The virtual world is created through a pipeline in CityEngine using procedural modelling techniques and then rendered in Blender to create the training dataset. The results show that the synthetic data has a mIoU of 0.48, which is lower compared to cases when solely real data (0.75) are used, when the segmentation is performed in the same training and testing area. In addition, the 3D models partly affect the segmentation results. When using a mix of real and synthetic data, the results are maintained to a mIoU of 0.75. On the contrary, when training and testing in different areas, the use of synthetic data seems to improve the results on average by 21.5, 12.5, 1.5 and 2 percentage points on the mIoU, IoU for classes building, road and other respectively. Additionally, domain adaptation techniques such as Cycle GAN and Cycada improve the performance of synthetic datasets by 4 percentage points. Overall, this thesis shows that when the domain difference between the training and testing datasets is big, the addition of the synthetic data helps to improve the performance of the semantic segmentation of aerial images. Synthetic datasets improve the segmentation results by using a mix of existing labelled imagery from different geographical regions when a project lacks labelled imagery. In contrast, when labelled imagery is present in the same testing area, the real training data obtains robust results, thus the addition of synthetic data does not improve the segmentation results.","Synthetic Data; Semantic Segmentation; Deep Learning; Aerial imagery; Domain Adaptation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Risk-based and probabilistic reliability design methods are starting to be integrated into the daily geotechnical engineering practice, as shown by the current draft of EN1997 (Eurocode 7), which explicitly allows Reliability-based verification of limit states. The semi-probabilistic design methods in EN1997 are a compromise between ease of use and accuracy of the achieved reliability levels. In contrast, EN1990 (Eurocode 0) requires accurate full probabilistic design targets. An assessment to investigate if the semi probabilistic methods from EN1997 comply with the EN1990 reliability targets is therefore necessary since the link between the norms is not explicitly established. <br/>In this study, pile foundations serve as an example to assess compatibility between the EN1990 and EN1997. The deterministic Dutch pile design approach by van Mierlo &amp; Koppejan (1956), CPT based design method, is adapted to the semi probabilistic model pile recipe in the EN1997 draft. This thesis assesses what reliability levels are achieved by the model pile design method in draft EN1997 considering the axial bearing capacity and how these compare to the reliability targets in EN1990.<br/>Methodology: To assess the performance of the model pile method from EN1997, the design outcome from the semi-probabilistic model pile method is compared to fully probabilistic quantification methods of the resistances and loads. Two probabilistic quantifications are used in the assessment, a Bayesian and a Student-T model. The achieved reliabilities are assessed with both the First Order Reliability Method (FORM) and Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS). Additional insight into the influence of different parameters is provided with sensitivity analysis and the calibration of partial factors. The assessment was applied in two case studies located in the Netherlands. <br/>In both case studies, the EN1997 designs resulted in reliability levels in good agreement with the reliability targets stated in EN 1990. This suggests an agreement between the semi-probabilistic and the full probabilistic models if sufficient CPTs are used. In both case studies, EN1997 designs accounted for more model uncertainty than the probabilistic models suggest, thus partial model factor (γRd) in EN1997 may be conservative. EN1997 covers spatial variability and uncertainty due to limited observations with the correlation factor (ζ, a factor that transforms calculated to representative values, and the partial resistance factor (γRc). The coverage of uncertainty with these two factors seems to be rather low, especially for situations with few CPTs available (less than 10), although the results seem to depend strongly on the degree of spatial variability in the CPT field. In the case of homogeneous soil conditions between observations, EN1997 design methods led to over-conservative designs for low numbers of observations. If the variability between limited observations (less than 10 CPTs) was high, designs are assessed to be less reliable than EN1990 requires.<br/>Overall, the results suggest good agreement of the semi-probabilistic design methods from EN1997 with the reliability targets defined in EN1990, for designs based on sufficient observations. The sensitivity analysis and isolation of the resistance uncertainty showed for the two cases that the uncertainty of the resistance has the dominating influence on the reliability of the piles, suggesting a low impact of complex stochastic load models. The latter finding suggests that probabilistic treatment of the resistance may be sufficient for assessing pile reliability in practice, while design values could be used for the loads.","Eurocode 7; EN1997; Probabilisitic Analysis; probabilistic assessment; Pile foundations; EN1990; Eurodoe 0; Monte Carlo; FORM; CPT; Koppejan","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) are useful tools to manage rainwater and reduce pollutants in urban environments. Their use, as sustainable solutions, can mitigate the effects of climate change and urbanization. The existence of different definitions of performance is one reason for delaying more implementation of SUDS. Deciding on the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) is one of the objectives of this thesis. WaterStreet, the chosen study area, is a living lab that permits the implementation, presentation, and testing of newly designed SUDS with the goal of facilitating their entrance into the market. WaterStreet could benefit from using sensors to provide the KPIs and other indicators of performance, but the sensors already implemented do not achieve that objective fully. So, the objective of this thesis is, to develop a comprehensive set of KPIs that describe the performance of SUDS and propose a monitoring network to measure the performance of SUDS implemented in WaterStreet. <br/>To achieve that objective, information on the study area’s characteristics, like soil types, design of SUDS, and groundwater levels were gathered to find how water flows in, out, and around the study area including the SUDS. Additionally, the key stakeholders were determined with a stakeholder analysis, and literature was researched on the important indicators used to reflect the performance of SUDS for water quality and quantity. Interviews were performed to include the view of the key stakeholders on the indicators found in the literature. The two approaches explained above provide the data that need to be monitored on WaterStreet. Criteria for the quality of data that would be provided by the sensors are set, before concluding on suggestions. The suggested sensors and their limitations are based on results of published studies and reports.<br/>Based on the findings of this thesis a distinction between the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Indicators of Performance (IP) is made. In the first category, the indicators of overflowing volume, duration, and frequency are included along with rainfall and overflow from upstream drainage areas. In the second category the indicators, infiltration in the soil and through the first layer of SUDS, and storage in the soil and system are included. Both categories of indicators are suggested to be monitored in the study area of WaterStreet to increase the value of WaterStreet as a living lab. Indicators for water quality are not concluded due to the lack of information on the existing pollutants and their removal and remobilization mechanisms. Reduction of Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and Total Phosphorus (TP) are two possible indicators that are also considered as a proxy in Germany. Changes in pH and temperature are two indirect indicators that are found to affect the reduction and remobilization mechanisms and are therefore important to consider as well.<br/>An acoustic disdrometer to measure rainfall, a sonar pulse sensor to measure groundwater levels, divers in an observation pipe in the system to measure the water level in the system and the infiltration in the soil, and lastly divers in a controlled volume downstream of the SUDS to measure the overflowing water downstream the SUDS, were the proposed sensors. The disdrometer and two of the sonar pulse sensors are already installed on WaterStreet while it is suggested to put divers in the individual systems and two more sonar pulse sensors. For the indicators, overflowing water from upstream and the rate of water entering the SUDS research on the runoff coefficient and the use of water balance are suggested, respectively.<br/>An important consideration in this thesis is the characterization of hydraulic isolation from the top and bottom of the system, allowing the interpretation of the data from monitoring, to represent only one system’s response. Suggestions to include a controlled volume to capture the overflow downstream of the SUDS and a drainpipe to ensure a drainage depth of 0.5 m, are made, to help ensure hydraulic isolation from top and bottom respectively. Based on this study, only half of the systems placed on WaterStreet are isolated, not considering the possibility that the groundwater table can get even higher resulting in even fewer systems isolated. Additionally, from analyzing the hydraulic response on the SUDS in WaterStreet, it was concluded that all 5 studied systems out of 8 total were being over-dimensioned, meaning that the storage in the SUDS would not be full even with rainfall of once in 100 years. From the same analysis, it was also concluded that the infiltration through the first layer is the prevalent overflowing mechanism of 3 out of 4 studies SUDS. Both the previous findings are important to realize a hydraulic response to rainfall proportionally to real implementations. This is an essential consideration from living labs because they try to bring lab and real implementation closer. Lastly, pollutants to be used as KPIs for water quality performance of SUDS should be researched more based on the principle of not shifting problems downstream.<br","SUDS; Monitoring; WaterStreet","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Extreme precipitation can be characterized by the tail behavior of precipitation probability distributions.The tail contains the most extreme precipitation events and tells something about both the magnitude and frequency of these events. Here the heaviness amplification factor is used to represent the tail behavior. This research determines the most important hydro-climatological controls of the heaviness amplification factor. The study area is the entire world, where Antarctica and the oceans are not taken into account. A pre-defined set of 17 controls divided into four groups is used. The four groups are: general climate condition, geography, land cover and climate variability. The relation between the heaviness and the controls is determined with multiple linear regression, where the standardized controls are used. Since multiple linear regression is applied, multicollinearity might be a problem. This term refers to the occasion where independent variables are correlated to another independent variable or a linear combination of variables. This could lead to erroneous and unreliable results. To deal with this problem, three elimination methods are applied. This first method consists of a correlation analysis, where two controls are highly correlated if their correlation coefficient is higher than 0.9. The control with the lowest regression coefficient is eliminated. This is followed by another regression analysis with all the remaining controls, where controls with a low regression coefficient are also eliminated. The second method applies an iterative regression procedure, where in each iteration the control with the lowest coefficient is eliminated until three controls remain. The last method calculates the variance inflation factor, which is a measure for multicollinearity. It removes the controls with the highest variance inflation factor if higher than 10, until none of the controls has a score above this limit. The described analysis is done for the entire world, but also for 44 IPCC climate reference regions. The conclusion of the analysis is that the most important controls for the heaviness belong to the general climate condition and the climate variability. In total, 13 of the 17 controls occur in a top three for at least one region in one or more of the elimination methods. The most important control is precipitation variability which is in 57% of the regions in the top three based on the results of methods 1, 2 and 3. Each region gives a different top three or at least a different order of controls. The heaviness is calculated based on the outcomes of the multiple linear regression. The R-squared ranges from 0.2 to 0.8, with an average value around 0.3. This suggests that the controls explain about 30% of the variance. The average error for the world between the data and the calculation of the heaviness is 0.11. When the heaviness of a single region is calculated, the absolute error between the data and the calculation of the heaviness reduces from 0.12 to 0.10 when using regional coefficients. This result leads to the conclusion that regional processes do play a role in the behavior of extreme precipitation. This makes it less appropriate to define a global set of most important controls. None of the three elimination methods is able to solve the problem of multicollinearity completely. On average, 35% of the controls have a opposite sign between the correlation and regression coefficient.","Extreme precipitation; Heaviness amplification factor; Tail behavior; Hydro-climatological controls; Multiple linear regression; Multicollinearity","en","master thesis","","","","","","Double degree in Water Management and Environmental Engineering","","","","","","Water Management","",""

These systems require a bounded and predictable time response on incoming events and execute all input and output (IO) tasks simultaneously. To ensure this concurrent behavior, the different IO devices are synchronized to achieve a common time notion. The implementation of time notion in systems can differ and therefore<br/>various types of synchronization exist, e.g. in-band and out-of-band. In-band synchronization utilizes the general communication channel to distribute time information, contrary to out-of-band synchronization which uses an external wire to transfer the time signals. As the in-band type implies the synchronization transactions flow together with the general traffic, the synchronization mechanisms are often implemented in the interconnect protocol. This integration limits the choice for a feasible synchronization protocol as this choice is dependent on that of the interconnect due to restricting communication requirements of RT applications. Current synchronization protocols are often limited to sub-microsecond (μs) latency variations and/or partially rely on an out-of-band principle. The goal of this master thesis is to find a solution that is able to achieve in-band synchronization with nanosecond (ns) range jitter. The proposed design is optimized towards nanosecond-scale jitter, by taking implementation challenges of Precision Time Protocol (PTP) into account, and is separate from the choice of interconnect. PTP is an existing synchronization mechanism which retrieves the differences in time notion (offsets) across multiple devices while accounting for transmission latency to each individual device. The implementation of PTP can result in limited performance in terms of jitter. The design focuses on minimizing this jitter with increasing the accuracy and robustness of the PTP synchronization algorithm by improving the precision of timestamps and filtering the calculated offsets for outliers. The synchronization mechanism was evaluated through simulation and validation in hardware. This master thesis presents a Proof of Concept (PoC) that can be implemented into real-world RT systems. It consists of two devices synchronizing to one reference device using the proposed synchronization mechanism. The PoC achieves down to 7 ns jitter, which was not reached by feasible existing in-band synchronization yet.","Synchronization; PTP; Real time; Time synchronization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-06-15","","","","Computer Engineering","",""

This is especially useful in scenarios where the goal is not to predict a variable, but to explain what influences that variable. However, the methods that have been created thus far do not focus on specific domains and only give scientific relations between variables. In the case of a production process, there exist a multitude of related variables, constrained in different ways, thus requiring a more sophisticated method than those which are universally applicable. The target of this research is a bottle filling machine at a large carbonated drink manufacturer, of which a great amount of data has been stored. The product quality, in this case the amount of CO2 in the filled bottles, is subject to high amounts of fluctuation, leading to a lot of waste. To further contextualize the problem of bottle filling, an artificial dataset is created to serve as a basis for visualization and evaluation. Using literature on carbonated drink filling, multiple hypotheses were then formulated, independently from the thesis company, as a target for the evaluation process. To address the problem of determining what factors influence bottle CO2, a methodology is proposed which aims to provide explainable quality prediction of production process output, while using available domain knowledge to increase the plausibility of explanations. The methodology makes use of counterfactual explanations for tree ensembles and process state forecasting to show how a process state can be changed to yield better product quality. Evaluation on the artificial and real datasets show that the methodology is able to effectively predict the amount of CO2 in a bottle, while giving changes to the current process state which improve the product quality. It is also shown that the results produced by the methodology are in line with the formulated hypotheses. Bottle CO2 is influenced greatly by temperature changes in the filler and these temperature changes are caused by flow of cooled lemonade through the process. As these flows are dependent on the filling speed, irregular filling is suspected to be the root cause for the bottle CO2 fluctuations.","XAI; Production process; Process forecast; Quality prediction; Explainable AI; Explainability; Bottle filling; Carbonated drinks; counterfactual explanations; time-series forecasting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

(mentor); Hrachowitz, M. (graduation committee); de Roode, S.R.

Especially Brazil is subject to an alarming rate of forest loss, which will remain a factor in the coming decades. In addition to deforestation, there is an increasing amount of hazards like floods and mudslides. These hazards result in major damage to human life and nature. This research analyzes the relation between deforestation and river discharge for observed data, a simple conceptual model and complex model WFLOW for 30 catchments subject to deforestation in Brazil. These three studies use satellite data provided by \cite{GEE} to determine annual cumulative deforestation per catchment. In the study with observed data the relation between deforestation and data from CAMELS-BR \citep{CAMELS2020} is researched by analyzing annual values of two discharge driven parameters: Runoff coefficient and recession coefficient. The second study consists of a simple self-made conceptual model. In this second study, the relation between recession coefficient $\alpha$ and annual deforestation is analyzed by calibrating the model per year for parameter $\alpha$. Lastly, a study is conducted on the performance of WFLOW in catchments subject to deforestation. During this study, several input parameters are changed to observe the response of hydrological processes in WFLOW.<br/><br/>The study with observed data shows both increasing and decreasing trends in coefficients for several degrees of deforestation. Literature shows that landcover type after deforestation is a major factor in the interpretation of these results. However, a lack of quality annual landcover data prevents better research in the non-masked impact of deforestation on discharge. The results of the simple model study show no significant relation between deforestation and recession coefficient $\alpha$. The simplicity of this self-made conceptual model is the weak and strong point of this sub-study. The simplicity makes the results less suitable for analyzing the exact impact of deforestation on discharge, but it is useful for observing general signals and is easily scalable to different catchments. The simulated discharge by WFLOW show a steep overestimation of discharge during peak flow in comparison to observed discharge by CAMELS-BR. Therefore it is not possible to analyze how WFLOW reacts to deforestation. Instead, an in-depth analysis on the cause of this poor performance is conducted by analyzing timeseries for hydrological factors like unsaturated zone depth. The results of this analysis indicate the overestimation of discharge is caused by a lack of outflow from soil layers. In addition, the difference between the Budyko framework of different data sets used in this research, show that uncertainty in quality of input data is a plausible factor on the output of WFLOW.<br/><br/>In conclusion it is observed that deforestation does not necessarily lead to higher runoff coefficients and recession coefficients for measured data in this study area. In addition, the conclusion of the simple model study is that no significant relation between deforestation and recession coefficient $\alpha$ is observed for this conceptual model. Finally, the performance of WFLOW is considered too poor to analyze the impact of deforestation on discharge. The root of this poor performance is considered to be a combination between lack of groundwater modelling and uncertainty on the quality of input-data.","WFLOW; Deforestation; Runoff ratio; Recession coefficient; Discharge","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Within this studio, the Touch &amp; Feel research line, studies the materiality of buildings and the essential values these material attributes represent, in regard to the possibilities for adaptive reuse. With this approach in mind, I started my graduation project with a focus on the possible heritage values the police station conveyed. An extensive study into the work and influence of the architect of the police station, Berghoef, substantiated the heritage value of the police station (see ‘Understanding Berghoef’). The subsequent value assessment of the station showed which attributes of the police station most clearly convey its value.<br/><br/>Various building and site analysis indicated that a possible future use of the police station was education. The ambition of University College Roosevelt to expand, meant an interesting opportunity for a new life for the police station. The required program however, did not fit within the existing building. This encouraged to look beyond the initial project scope and see how the adjacent vacant supermarket could be incorporated in the design. It resulted in a plan where the redesign of the police station is a driver for the redevelopment of larger piece of city as small-scale campus. <br/><br/>It meant that a large part of the plan would be new buildings. To find out how to link them to the existing building of Berghoef, an inventory of existing redesign strategies, several case-studies into redesigned Berghoef buildings and many design experiments were performed. Simultaneously I explored how the police station is an example of many modest valued buildings in our country and how to redesign them for a sustainable future. The conclusion, as substantiated in the paper: ‘The quality of modest valued buildings’ is that when redesigning unlisted twentieth century buildings, three factors are of equal importance: Heritage value preservation, meeting contemporary demands and sustainability. By preserving the attributes which most essentially convey the heritage value of the building, and taking more freedom to do interventions which allow a sustainable new use, this can be achieved. A side note on this conclusion is that this approach worked well for this building because the heritage attributes were the façade and floors. These are elements which are easy to preserve in case of a new use. Other attributes are perhaps more related to functionality of a building. In this case the new use has to find ways to adapt to this. <br","Vacant Heritage; Redesign; Berghoef","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","Vacant Heritage",""

This is especially true for space telescopes (James Webb), where size is directly correlated with performance. A solution to this is on-orbit assembly, however some enabling technologies are insufficiently developed. One of the most important factors is the design of standardized interfaces for modular designs (only three existing designs). This thesis proposes a mechanical interface design - including data and electrical transfer - meant to allow the assembly of a modular platform (including all spacecraft subsystems except the mirror segments) upon which a support layer and a mirror layer can be built/assembled. The design presents a unique mechanism allowing for assembly outside of the platform plane direction, thus allowing disassembly of a minimal amount of modules in the event of servicing. Three different iterations of the design were considered, and simulations for both the assembly and assembled state have been performed in ANSYS. To compare performance with existing interfaces, a scaled down model was simulated. The results of the preliminary simulations show a performance increase of at least 200% for each load case. A physical prototype was manufactured and tested, however destructive testing was not performed.","Interface Design; On-orbit assembly; Space telescope; FEA Simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The circular economy (CE) has been embraced in the architectural discourse as one of the most powerful, innovative, and viable business strategies to achieve sustainability in the built environment. However, architectural firms are still struggling to translate the concept into their business models (BMs) (Urbinati et al., 2017; Accenture, 2014; Khan et al., 2020). <br/><br/>Scholars argue that in order for firms to reorganize their strategies, resources, and structures to those that are free from linear constraints, new dynamic organizational capabilities (particular kills, processes, and organizational activities) are required (Lacy &amp; Rutqvist, 2015; Khan et al., 2020; Bauwens et al., 2020). However, most research on the subject has been developed from a practice-oriented perspective and/or has been primarily focused on large profit-driven organizations, rather than smaller creative firms driven by strategic goals beyond financial revenues (Lu &amp; Sexton, 2006; Bos-de Vos et al., 2017). <br/><br/>Through semi-structured interviews and qualitative data collection with stakeholders in four architectural firms operating in the Netherlands; the research addresses the limited academical research on this field by exploring the Dynamic Capability Approach of the firm as a BM transformation know-how strategy in favor of CE. <br/><br/>The findings indicate that the dynamic capabilities approach is undeniably beneficial for CE implementation among architectural firms. In this regard, the research identifies 15 microfoundations of sense, seize, and reconfigure dynamic capabilities that architects and entrepreneurs can implement to transform the way they create, deliver and capture value. Furthermore, this thesis concludes that architectural firms operate on the basis of a BM portfolio with CE embedded at the project-based level. Finally, the findings suggest that CE has had limited impact in the value proposition of architects but has increased the complexity of their value creations and delivery components, ultimately leading to trade-offs and creative strategies to capture value and ensure the firms survival in still transitionary markets. <br","circular economy; architectural firms; business models; sustainability in the built environment; microfoundations; Dynamic Capabilities; Dynamic Capability Approach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

To provide a football player or their coach with insight into their performance during a game, or their technical development over time, many methods are available such as camera setups and smart vests. However, to provide a more direct and biomechanical approach, this thesis utilizes sensors placed in the insoles of a player’s shoe. These sensors are equipped with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), providing very direct insight into the accelerations and rotations of the player’s feet. Additionally, external impact on the feet can be detected, such as after a jump, a tackle by an opponent or a ball touch. To provide the player with information about covered distance, speed and ball touches and possibly many more metrics, the raw data from the sensor needs to be processed. Various methods can be used to provide the different metrics, ranging from custom algorithms to Machine Learning approaches. <br/>This thesis provides an approach using neural networks to detect ball touches in real-time on these insole sensors. This approach combines the challenge to classify the ball touches correctly with the additional challenge to do so on a constrained embedded device, an Arm Cortex-M4 microcontroller. A development flow is set up using the TensorFlow framework. Recorded data can be used to develop and train a neural network model, after which the model is converted and optimized to be deployed to the sensor. <br/>Several neural network models and settings have been benchmarked both on classification performance and resource usage. The final approach to this classification task samples the data from the IMU at 500 Hz, detects ball-touch candidates and creates a window of samples, which is then fed to a one-layer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. This model achieves an accuracy of 95.8%, while the implementation on the sensor uses 64.9 KB Flash, 5.0 KB RAM and has an execution time of 8 ms per classification.","Embedded; IMU; Football; Neural Networks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-06-01","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Due to the changing role of the private sector in the Dutch land development process, real estate developers are increasingly involved in realising the interests of the direct surroundings of their redevelopment projects. To incorporate the seemingly unprofitable space-use in their project, developers increasingly opt for mixed-use real estate. The chosen mix of space-uses directly impacts the business case and the area. However, the relationship between these two is unclear, leading to the formulation of the research question: How can mixed-use generate value for both the area and the redevelopment business case? <br/><br/>The aim of this research is to make explicit the mutual value generated by the mix of space-uses in redevelopment projects. It attempts to fill this knowledge gap through analysis of literature, exploratory interviews with field experts, and an embedded multiple case study. The non-holistic case study method consists of the individual descriptive analyses of three cases, among which two phenomena are studied as units of comparison: added value to the area; and added value to the business case. These phenomena are substantiated through literature and compared among the cases through a cross-case analysis. The exploratory interviews provide context for the interpretation of case results. <br/><br/>The study identifies several benefits of mixed-use and the incorporation of particular space-uses. However, many of the benefits for the area do not end up with their investor. Moreover, assessing the extent of the benefits is difficult as they cannot be measured quantitatively, and stakeholders interpret their value differently. Additionally, mixed-use real estate falls outside of the asset classes of investors, and investor attitude towards the product type varies due to identified risks, but benefits in return are not assessed appropriately. <br/><br/>By broadening the business case alternative value streams can be included using which the business case profits from the additional space-uses. Meaning qualitative benefits are also considered. The benefits from mixed-use can be categorised in primary, secondary and even tertiary value streams. The first of which is the direct impact of the additional urban function through compensation of the investment costs. The secondary value stream is based on the indirect value added through synergies between urban functions, increased marketability of the primary space-uses, and loosened project constraints. Furthermore, the study finds that some of the benefits for the developing party actually lie outside of the business case, thereby providing a tertiary value stream of positive exposure of the firm and strengthened relationships with public parties. <br/><br/>What results is a comprehensive understanding of the mutual character of benefits that result from incorporation of a mix of space-uses in real estate objects. Their opportunity to generate value is not mutually exclusive to either the area or the business case, as project value is based on the vibrancy of the area it is situated in. <br","Mixed-use; Real Estate; Added Value; Area Development; Developer; Investor; Space-use; Land-use; Placemaking; Corporate Social Responsibility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Microchips are made from circular silicon discs called wafers and are manufactured with photolithography. A critical step of a photolithography process is when a wafer with a photoresist is placed on a wafer table (WT) and exposed to light to form patterns that build up components of an integrated circuit (IC). The dimensions of the IC are in nanometer scale and are becoming increasingly smaller. Any changes to the wafer table can contribute to alignment issues or increase overlay between successive exposures and is dependent on interaction with the wafer backside.<br/>Common wafer backside materials are silicon, silicon oxide and silicon nitride, which are hydrophilic, so they readily interact with water and adsorb it from the atmosphere. Furthermore, their surface conductivity is highly dependent on the relative humidity (RH) of the air. Additionally, silicon oxide and silicon nitride generate surface charge from single-wafer wet spin tools that are a part of the critical toolset for advanced IC fabrication.<br/>In the presence of water, a charged wafer backside can conduct unwanted current through the surface. The occurrence of this phenomena can affect both the performance and yield of the components that the wafer backside comes in contact with during photolithography.<br/>This thesis studies reducing the charge generation and surface conductivity of a hydrophilic silicon and silicon nitride wafer backside by depositing hydrophobic self-assembled monolayers (SAM) with silane coupling agents. They are less likely to form surface charge and have lower surface conductivity. The hydrophobic monolayers that are studied are deposited from hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) and a non-disclosed fluorinated molecule, called F-SAM. HMDS is already used in photolithography on the wafer frontside to promote adhesion to the photoresist and fluorinated molecules are known to be hydrophobic, inert and with high electrical resistance.<br/>This surface modification tackles both the water content on the surface and the charging via single wafer wet-spin tools. The monolayers are characterized in terms of surface chemistry, surface free energy, wear resistance, zeta potential, surface charge and conductivity. Lastly, the charge diffusion is measured when a wafer is put in contact with a wafer table in an experimental setup, where the discharge current is registered.<br/>The outcome of this study shows that modified surfaces are found to be homogenous to a sub nanometer level and uniform. Compared to typical silicon nitride wafers, the surface conductivity is lowered by a factor of 1000 and is not affected by the RH. This results in the total measured charge diffused to a wafer table to be reduced by at least a factor of 17. As a conclusion, modified surface can be considered a promising option in reducing any unwanted current leakage from a wafer backside to surrounding components.","ASML; Wafer; Monolayer; Hydrophobic; HMDS; F-SAM; Charge diffusion; Surface Conductivity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-06-14","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

In the Mexican context, a shift in urban governance has facilitated elements of a networks approach, which places community participation as central to upgrading interventions, to coexist with a historically dominant hierarchical approach. Community participation involves dwellers in the process and is a means for community empowerment, but its validity is put into question as expert-driven and technocratic approaches persist. Therefore, informal settlement upgrading finds itself at a crossroads at which the formal and informal governance systems and hierarchical and networks governance approaches converge. This thesis focuses on identifying factors of government-led upgrading programmes that enable community participation to promote a process of empowerment; taking the Campana-Altamira Initiative in Monterrey, Nuevo Leon as a case study. In this research, community participation covers a broad range of activities and is seen as a means for community empowerment, defined as the ability to gain access to resources, democratically participate and gain a critical awareness of reality.

It investigates the impact of rapid urbanization amidst a conflict that strained vernacular-water relationships and evolved over centuries. These local ties of a water-based community called Haenji were the strength and richness of Srinagar City’s heritage. But the situation now is one of abandonment with conflict-created distrust at Jhelum, resulting in a ‘dying water culture’. The Planning gap with vernacular persists due to a top-down planning culture that has proved to be inefficient for the condition of Jhelum and its wetlands to the 2014 catastrophic floods.<br/><br/>The city of Srinagar was analyzed spatially to reveal typical case study wetlands to read this planning and vernacular gap. This followed a field visit and interview with experts regarding the shifting planning perspectives, post-2014 floods towards resilience as presented in the Srinagar’s Master-plan 2035. The analysis led to set of resilience principles and a strategy toolkit that helped develop three Resilience Themes for the City vision.

The design strategy here aims at a model of vernacular sustainable neighborhood guarding its waters through relationships built on diversity, adaptability and trust. <br/><br/>This thesis proposes a revival of vernacular socio-ecological bonds at River Jhelum in the city of Srinagar, suggesting that sustainable living with water necessitates the inclusion of vernacular practices that evolved to adapt best to surroundings. Theoretically, this borrows from the concept of socio-ecological resilience.

Rapid technological advances have significantly altered the way humanity interacts with its surroundings – with a sedentary lifestyle becoming more common – while climate change and ecological degradation threaten to do unrepairable damage to our urban ecosystems. These trends will – without drastic change – ultimately lead to increased social isolation, more people living an unhealthy lifestyle, an uncomfortable urban microclimate, and a lack of resilience regarding environmental shocks and stresses.<br/><br/>This study aims to determine how urban green – with its different qualities and attributes – can be applied to mitigate these potential future effects and develop a future city that is more liveable, resilient, and biodiverse. In this context, urban green can be defined as all urban land covered by vegetation of any kind – irrespectively of size, function, and ownership.<br/><br/>To effectively research the diverse benefits of urban green, a case study approach was applied, in which the city centre of Schiedam was selected. Additionally, the following research question was chosen: ‘’How can the implementation of urban green in the inner city of Schiedam contribute to resolving issues related to ecological degradation, climate adaptation, social isolation, and vacancy in an integrated and inclusive way?’’<br/><br/>Literary research and case study reviews were conducted to assess the different ways urban green can be implemented, with their subsequent benefits. Furthermore, spatial analysis was conducted to gain a better understanding of how the aforementioned problems are manifested in the case of Schiedam, together with how the literary findings can be implemented in a real location.<br/><br/>The research showed that a multiscalar development strategy is required in order to utilise the concept of urban green to its full potential. On the scale of the inner city, five distinct types of pocket parks were developed that each focus on a specific target group. The goal of these park types is to minimise the barrier for people to come outside – giving them a high-quality social green space for whatever purpose they need within a five-minute radius. Furthermore, pocket parks contribute to creating a continuous ecological network, as well as provide environmental benefits.<br/><br/>On the street scale, an objective evaluation method was developed, which can be used to assess the current social, environmental and ecological quality of any street type. Additionally, an intervention toolbox was developed that provides the necessary tools to redevelop the street types accordingly.<br/><br/>By utilising the different potential qualities of urban green through a multiscalar development approach, the future inner city of Schiedam will become a rich, biodiverse urban territory that promotes social interaction and a healthy lifestyle – all while being resilient and climate adaptive.","Urban green; Pocket park; Greening approach; Climate adaptation; Healthy lifestyle; Schiedam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","","51.916901,4.399674"

It has per goal to implement a tool that will orient the user toward a set of possible “best performing” designs. The aspects of interest in this trade-off exploration are the global warming potential, time of fabrication and construction, structure performance, and envelope repercussion.<br/>Being able to funnel different design options at the early stage is a fundamental step in reducing the climate impact of our buildings and structures. The implementation of such a tool comes along with the effort to further integrate the different actors of the AEC industry to produce leaner and more efficient buildings.<br/>To do so, the research divides the different design features of gridshells into parametrizable blocks of code. Each block is explored to generate a wide design space and produce the necessary data to track the desired performance traits. All together a working tool is assembled and its relevance is tested. For that, a graphical interface between the tool and the user is also developed to provide a quick and easy way to identify those trade-offs. The tool limits itself to the coarse structural part of the gridshell with a diamond grid and symmetrical shapes. It proposes to use wired line designs drawn at a schematic stage as a general base for the use of the tool.<br/>The result is a working prototype that constitutes a quick and reliable way to assess the “best performing” designs to undergo the next stage of design. It proposes a new way to look at how to connect both the early stage of design and the late prefabrication construction stages.

(mentor); Pesch, U. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Economic growth, especially after the financial crisis of 2008, has been declining in many OECD nations. Declining economic growth has negative effects including a lower rate of productivity growth, stagnating standards of living, increases in income inequality etc. Many economists believe that stagnating fixed business investment is one of the key causes of the observed secular decline in economic growth. Hence, it is important to understand what drives business investment and how we can improve it, thereby, improving the economic growth. Thus, the objective of this thesis which is to understand the determinants of fixed investment that affects economic growth is important not only for policy-makers but also for corporations, shareholders, and workers. <br/><br/>In this thesis, we have analyzed the determinants of stagnating business investment in the European economies of the Netherlands and Germany using an accelerator-type model augmented with variables that measure financial constraints, business environment, labour market and network sectoral regulations. Our results show that fixed business investment as a share of GDP in the Netherlands is mainly affected by demand growth, financial constraints, uncertainty and energy prices. In case of Germany, fixed business investment is mainly affected by unemployment rate, term spreads, energy prices and regulations of the network sectors. We see that while demand is found to be statistically significant in explaining decline in business investment in the Netherlands, it is not found to be statistically significant in case of Germany. We found that business investment can be stimulated by increase in demand, real net profits of the firms, network sector regulations or by a decrease in uncertainty, energy prices, term spreads and unemployment rates considering both the Dutch and German economies. Increase in fixed component of intangible investment or decrease in level of financialization can also help in boosting business investment for these two economies. <br/><br/>Based on the empirical findings and literature, we looked into what lessons we can derive from a policy-making perspective. We believe that expansionary macroeconomic policies can most likely help both the Dutch and German economies to stimulate business investment. Finally, this thesis also addresses various reflections in terms of scope for further research. For instance, inclusion of firm-level variables in empirical analysis or using different measures for robustness checks are some of the aspects that can be reflected upon and used in future research.","Investment; Secular Stagnation; Business investment; Economics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

The spatial configuration and experiences within the building are staying the same during its lifespan. If our cities, environments, technologies, economies and even our own ideas, activities and (musical) preferences change constantly, why do we construct and design architecture still as something that is fixed, rigid, pre-established, and permanent? Can we create architecture which generates freedom and is open for interpretation, therefore responding to unforeseen activities? For the design of the music building, a framework is designed, which is indeterminate in its functions. The framework derives from a characteristic crane rail located in the Binckhorst, The Hague (Netherlands), which functions as the ''backbone'' of the whole project. It can be appropriated and used by different groups and (sub)cultures and host various activities. The framework is flexible and can grow over time in which there is not one particular end-result created.

Therefore, regeneration strategies focus on transplantation of neural stem cells or differentiated neural cells. In order to make such a treatment effective, it is important to understand the mechanisms that enable cell differentiation. It is well known that besides biochemical cues, also mechanical and geometric properties of the cell environment, such as topography, curvature and stiffness, can influence the process, which has been studied mostly in 2D. In order to conduct relevant cell studies in vitro, it is therefore important to mimic the 3D structure of the in-vivo cell environment. Many different approaches have been adopted to create scaffolds for neuronal cells, such as freeze-drying, electrospinning and stereolitography. The main drawbacks of these methods are the limited resolution and the constraints in terms of achievable geometries. Two-photon polymerization overcomes these problems by using a laser to polymerize a photosensitive material in extremely confined volumes, achieving a submicrometric resolution. In this study, we fabricated 3D microscaffolds made of an acrylate polymer called IP-Dip by employing two-photon polymerization in order to study the effect of curved versus straight lattice geometries on the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells into neural progenitor cells. First, feasibility studies were carried out with HeLa cancer cells and the effect of curvature on these cells was investigated on 2.5D structures. We established a workflow for conducting these experiments from the fabrication up until the analysis. By employing confocal imaging, image stacks were obtained and then analysed to obtain the volumetric cell occupancy of the scaffolds and identify the location of the cells within the scaffolds. We concluded that mESCs could successfully grow and differentiate within the 3D scaffolds without a specific preference for a curved over a straight lattice structure.","Two-photon polymerization; scaffold; neuronal differentiation; 3D; mechanobiology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-01-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Micro-optics and Optomechatronics","",""

Events that can lead to such waves include dike and dam breaches, storm surges and impulse waves. Dutch history is familiar with a number of coastal dike breaches but also river dike breaches have occurred, resulting in dam-break waves reaching far inland. Beyond the Netherlands, propagating walls of water could occur when dams of water reservoirs collapse. More specific knowledge of the hydrodynamic behaviour of dam-break waves is necessary in the battle against water. <br/>The impact of a dam-break wave can be reduced through a better understanding of the currently poorly understood link between bed roughness and wave hydrodynamic properties. The objective of the present study is therefore to study experimentally the effect of bed roughness on the hydrodynamic properties of dam-break waves, on both dry and wet beds. The approach was to generate dam-break waves through a lift-gate and a reservoir with a depth d0 = 0.4 m and to measure the water levels over time in the downstream channel. 7 different bed roughness configurations were made (range of ks = 0.6 to 48 mm) in addition to smooth bed reference test. Dry bed tests were performed, 5 wet bed tests with an initially still water level (h0) (range of h0/d0 = 0 to 0.125) were performed. The analysis focused on wavefront celerity, inundation depths and roller length which are used to characterise the hydrodynamic properties.<br/>Visual observations showed substantial differences in wavefront behaviour between surges and bores as well as between smooth and rough beds. Validation of the generated waves was done by successfully comparing the reconstructed water levels over the flume length with a new approach.<br/>Results showed that an increase in bed roughness resulted in a decrease in wavefront celerity for surges and that the initially still water level can work as a lubricant for bores. The initial still water level is dominant over the bed roughness when h0 &gt;0.5ks.<br/>The maximum water level increased with increasing bed roughness for surges, while bores showed an opposite behaviour. Increasing the initially still water level reduced the relative maximum water level for rough bed configurations. <br/>In the present study, only some test configurations revealed the presence of a plateau height. If there was one, an increase in bed roughness showed a decrease in plateau height for bores with h0/d0 = 0.125. Three sections in the h0/d0 range with different plateau height behaviours were noticed. <br/>The roller lengths were determined with the wavefront celerity and the plateau height. No trivial relations were found for the influence of bed roughness or initial still water level.<br/>Overall, this project revealed some interesting behaviours that need to be further investigated in the future. It is recommended to conduct a full quantitative analysis once precise values of the bed roughness configurations are determined. Nevertheless, these results present some preliminary, yet interesting, findings that will contribute to a better understanding of the behaviour of dam-break waves over rough bed. <br","Bed roughness; Dam-break waves; Experimental tests; Wavefront celerity; Plateau height; Roller length; Maximum water depth; Visual Observations; Facility validation; Hydrodynamic properties; Steady flow test; Lift gate","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-06-14","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Assessing the impact of these vibrations to the structural integrity of the radar is crucial for drafting appropriate maintenance plans and therefore, the development of a new tool is required, which will be capable of evaluating the fatigue lifetime of the radar system.<br/><br/>This thesis examines a 5.7-meter-long radar antenna, supported by a lattice tower with a height of 20 meters, located in Rijkswaterstaat’s test environment in Stellendam. Although the lattice structure and the radar system are coupled, they are treated separately in this study. Firstly, a Finite Element Model of the tower is developed in ANSYS, where the radar is represented by an added mass at the top floor. The aim of the model is to identify the vibrations of the structure under the influence of the incoming wind. The stochastic description of the turbulent wind is taken into account in the evaluation of the wind loads and a random vibration analysis is performed, resulting into the response of the structure in the frequency domain.<br/><br/>Furthermore, a second, simplified Finite Element Model of the radar system is built in ANSYS. Time series of the fluctuating wind velocity are generated and the wind load acting on the radar is approximated by the aerodynamic force in the along-wind direction, considering also the rotation of the radar antenna. In addition, the previously obtained response of the lattice structure serves as input for the radar model, representing the vibrations induced to the radar due to the motion of the structure below. The output of the model is the occurring stress response, which is subsequently used to assess the fatigue damage of the radar antenna.<br/><br/>The results show that the development of stresses at the bottom surface of the antenna mainly occurs at its central area. Given the assumptions used throughout the thesis, the motion of the lattice tower is found to be the governing loading condition for the resulting stresses and the magnitude of the motion significantly influences the fatigue damage of the antenna. Finally, the fatigue lifetime appears to be very sensitive to the construction materials used for the radar system. These results should be verified by future measurements in order to improve the suggested models.","Random vibrations; Fatigue assessment; Wind forcing; Finite Element modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-06-14","","","","","",""

Ventilative Cooling is “the application of the cooling capacity of the outdoor air ﬂow by ventilation to reduce or even eliminate the cooling loads and/or the energy use by mechanical cooling in buildings, while guaranteeing a comfortable thermal environment”. The effect of Day and Night ventilation strategies on the indoor environment of two common typologies of midrise apartments seen in the Netherlands was evaluated. The project investigated window and stack ventilation using dynamic energy simulations coupled with airflow network (AFN) modelling. EnergyPlus airflow network model was used for simulations with Grasshopper and Rhino as the user interface. Honeybee and Ladybug plug-in for Grasshopper translated the model into the EnergyPlus-readable input format. Various performance indicators were used to evaluate the apartments' comfort and cooling. These included temperature limit exceedance hours, GTO hours, Cooling requirements reduction ratio, Climate Potential for Natural Ventilation (CPNV), Natural Ventilative Cooling Effectiveness (NVCE) and Climate Potential Utilization Ratio (CPUR). Ventilative cooling simulations yielded favorable results. There was a significant reduction in the peak temperatures and GTO hours within the rooms when the windows were opened, compared to when they were closed. Out of the tested two typologies of apartments, the number of hours when the temperature exceeds 28°C reduced by 50-70% when the windows were fully opened in typology 1 apartments and was reduced by 36-70% in typology 2. GTO hours reduced by 70-80% when the windows were opened for ventilative cooling in typology 1 apartments and reduced by 55-60% for typology 2 apartments in comparison to when they were closed. Apartments with the capability of cross ventilation performed better than those with only single-sided ventilation. The cooling effectiveness of the existing building designs was also evaluated. The results showed that there is room for improvement of design to utilize the site’s potential for natural ventilation. When passive stack is used along with the opening of windows in an apartment, there was a slight reduction in temperature when compared to using only open windows for the same apartment. However, the reduction was not very significant. The findings are presented in a comparative and quantitative manner, providing valuable insight into the relevant field.","Ventilative cooling; Grasshopper; Honeybee; natural ventilation; midrise building; EnergyPlus; Airflow Network Modelling; Window ventilation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

Other interference could originate from unintentional sources (e.g., radio signals from a malfunctioning radio tower) or intentional sources such as a jamming or spoofing device. The latter is what this thesis will focus on. This thesis consists of two parts. The first part is about jamming and elaborates on the impact of seven different forms of jamming on two types of GNSS receivers, a time-worn receiver and a cuttingedge receiver. The cutting-edge receiver has as option to turn on Interference Mitigation (IM). The performance of both receivers is the roughly the same in case the IM is turned off on the cutting-edge receiver. However, when the IM is turned on the cutting-edge receiver clearly is more resillient to the jamming signals. In the second part of the thesis various types of spoofing are discussed. Due to time and hardware restrictions it was not possible to perform synchronous spoofing, which is an advanced form of spoofing.

Design for disassembly methods are applied and a unitized profile is designed, that incorporates a primary and a secondary timber frame, a structural silicone bond and a double-glazing unit from laminated heat-toughened glass panes.

A general problem is that notions about gender are strongly embedded within the design of the built environment. To be specific: gender relations in public space are normatively coded as masculine and heterosexual. Whereas masculinity is understood as a man who is dominant and refuses to acknowledge vulnerability. The multitude of masculinities are mostly subordinate in the patriarchal urban environment as well.<br/><br/>The largely residential neighbourhood Gaasperdam in Amsterdam’s South-East will be studied in greater depth to address and illustrate the spatial consequences. To be more specific, this thesis expands on the following research question: How can we reshape heteronormative spaces in Gaasperdam to facilitate legitimacy to diverse masculine identities?<br/>To answer this question, a research-by-design approach is used to identify the challenges at hand and propose various spatial design interventions. In addition, the use of personas is critical for imagining and addressing different demands and appropriations of space.<br/><br/>This research made clear how the current built environment of Gaasperdam does not facilitate interactions between different masculinities, while these are very essential. Therefore, this thesis proposes to increase the diversity of public spaces in Gaasperdam, which safeguards individual needs. Secondly, more space for collective use should be developed which allows diverse masculinities to interact. The insights of this thesis are valuable to research fields which focus on spatial issues, such as urban design, urban planning, and architecture since it offers design principles to reshape our built environment to include diverse gender identities.","Masculinities; Heteronormative space; Urban Design; Gender Inequality; Amsterdam (Netherlands)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","","52.298242726527235,4.972504754332841"

(mentor); Peeters, D.M.J. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Over the past decades, fibre-reinforced composite structures have been increasingly adopted into mainstream manufacturing over conventional metals owing to their higher performance attributes, such as superior strength-to-weight ratios. Composite structures offer the unique advantage of tailoring reinforcements in correspondence with design load cases. This allows for more efficient and better performing structures.<br/>Traditionally for composite laminate structures, the design space and freedom were vastly influenced by the accumulated experience in design and certification, as well as available flexibility in manufacturing processes; the available degree of freedom in aligning fibres dictated the design freedom available. With the advent of advanced processes such as automated fibre placement (AFP), reinforced tows can now be placed with more freedom and accuracy; even allowing for tows to be steered during deposition. These are called variable stiffness composite laminates. Fibre directionality within these laminates can be tailored to achieve an optimal load redistribution, thereby increasing its structural performance.<br/>Novel additive manufacturing such as Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) allow for more complex geometries to be manufacturable in a variety of materials. Such a process can allow more design space and freedom in existing optimization frameworks for designing variable stiffness laminates. Many reinforced thermoplastic materials can be processed using FDM. Short fibre reinforced materials are very readily available and can be used on all commercially available FDM platforms with minimal changes.<br/>This research culminates the three key aspects in engineering – design, material, and process. First, a suitable design framework is chosen, which in combination with added the design freedom by virtue of a novel process such as FDM, is used to design laminates optimized for buckling performance. Additional design freedom is afforded to the optimization framework by means of relaxing the manufacturability constraint – which restricts the maximum allowable curvature of each individual path within the laminate. Secondly, these laminates are manufactured using short fibre reinforced thermoplastic material, for which the shear-induced alignment of the material is analyzed to predict the effective mechanical properties under the parameters used for printing the laminates. Lastly, to validate the effect of additional design space on the effective performance of these laminates, a suitable experimental protocol is devised and used. For the optimized laminates, two cases for maximum allowable steering curvature are considered – one low and one high, and an effective quasi-isotropic laminate is used as a benchmark for comparison. Finally, all the laminates are tested under compression and analyzed. The increase in buckling performance of optimized laminates corresponding to increase in allowable steering is verified, as well as insights are drawn from the processing and experimentation to suggest future recommendations.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Current motion prediction approaches can be categorized into object-centered and object-agnostic methods and are primarily based on deep learning. The former relies on a human-engineered pipeline of object detection and tracking, of which the errors can accumulate in the motion predictions. The latter does not rely on this pipeline; however, it lacks the ability to learn object representations causing blurriness and object disappearances for longer-term predictions which forms a safety hazard. This thesis proposes two methods to improve the performance of the object-agnostic sequence-to-sequence Occupancy Grid Map (OGM) prediction networks, trained on the Waymo Open Perception dataset. The first method uses inter-pixel loss functions, i.e. the SSIM and Sinkhorn losses, instead of the ubiquitously used per-pixel losses, to train the PredRNN++ Occupancy Grid Map (OGM) prediction network. Inter-pixel losses take into account the spatial relations between grid cells during the evaluation of OGMs, whereas per-pixel losses evaluate each grid cell’s value independently. The quantitative results demonstrate that using inter-pixel losses can improve short term predictions with a prediction horizon of T = 5 for the Mean Squared Error (MSE) by 4.3%, Image Similarity (IS) by 7.8%, Average Precision (AP) by 0.3%, metrics. For the longer term, T = 15, the predictions improve for the MSE by 5.0%, IS by 20.5%, AP by 0.1%, and Accuracy by 0.6%. Furthermore, the use of inter-pixel losses reduces blurriness and object disappearances. The second method is based on multi-task learning. By training the PredRNN++ to perform the prediction task together with the semantic segmentation task on the predicted OGMs, it is expected to learn object representations which it uses to improve the prediction quality. The quantitative results show that multi-task learning does not improve the OGM predictions. However, some qualitative results show that multi-task learning reduces blurriness and object disappearances.","Motion Prediction; Deep Learning; Loss Functions; multi-task learning; Occupancy Grid Map; Sinkhorn Loss; Structural Similarity Index Measure; Semantic Segmentation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering | Cognitive Robotics","",""

Low blood oxygen levels of a person, which can be unnoticeable, are potentially a precursor of COVID-19. Contact based methods for measuring blood oxygen saturation could spread the contagious disease. Therefore, this paper investigates non-contact RGB camera-based peripheral oxygen saturation estimation by remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) methods. The novel aspects of non-contact oxygen saturation that we are looking into are: (1) Applying SpO$_2$ predictor neural networks to rPPG signals obtained from facial regions, instead of the less practical hand based skin regions. To be more specific, we show in a facial based setting that in the relatively uncontrolled environment the traditional Ratio-of-Ratios pulse oximetry principles fail. In the leave-one-participant-out experiments, the RoR method achieved a correlation of $-0.05$, whereas neural networks showed the capability of dealing with the inherent challenges of the PURE dataset by achieving a superior correlation of $0.64$. These challenges are lighting variation due to subtle head motion and clouds alternatively blocking the sun. (2) The first end-to-end neural networks for SpO$_2$ estimation are introduced by replacing traditional hard pixel region-of-interest selectors, which assign equal weight to each selected pixel, with convolutional soft-attention masks. (3) By using an adapted version of a recent heart and breathing rate estimator network, called DeepPhys, we indicate that the current state-of-the-art is far from optimal. This is done by comparing the window-based constructed end-to-end neural networks with Adapted DeepPhys, which is based on single frame differences. Finally, our research\footnote{Code available on \url{https://github.com/jimkok9/oxygenSaturation}} shows that non-contact facial based SpO$_2$ estimation by RGB camera remains a difficult task. However, as our results indicate, more sophisticated deep learning model might become a viable diagnostic tool for this task in the future.","Neural networks; rPPG; Oxygen Saturation; SpO2","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) are positioned relative to an underwater acoustic positioning system: Ultra-Short BaseLine (USBL). The accuracy is affected by refraction artifacts, caused by the variations of the sound velocity in the water column. Accurate positioning would require continuous measuring of the sound velocity profile (SVP) which is unpractical and preferably to be minimized. It requires alternative or inversion methods to obtain SVP information. In this thesis, two inversion methods are introduced: HISOM (Hull In Situ Ocean Model) and OMBES (Overlapping MultiBeam EchoSounder). <br/><br/>HISOM analysis whether the SVP can be approximated via other sources: 1) a constant profile based on the in situ surface (ISS) sound velocity, or 2) a profile derived from ocean model data in combination with the ISS sound velocity. These simplifications inevitably introduce a refraction error but for fallpipe ROVs operating at small incident angles (e.g. θ&lt;6°) this error may be within acceptable margins (e.g. threshold of 0.2 m). The applicability is assessed by estimating the horizontal refraction error with a ray-tracing technique using daily-mean SVPs, derived from freely-available ocean model data. A spatiotemporal quantification for the North Sea yielded maps of sea areas where SVP measurements are necessary, and areas where constant surface SVPs suffice. The latter are the shallow parts of the North Sea (&lt;80 m), where the error is always smaller than 0.2 m. For deeper locations, the gradients of the SVP cannot be neglected. Then, the model-based SVPs can be used with or without the use of ISS sound velocity data. Comparing a collection of observed SVPs in the North Sea revealed that these daily-mean model-based SVPs are accurate enough for the positioning of fallpipe ROVs at least up to 370 m depth.<br/><br/>OMBES uses the synchronous overlap in depth measurements between two dual-head multibeam echosounders (MBES). In previous studies, the overlap is obtained by sailing two adjacent tracks with one MBES on a ship. Here, we propose to use two MBESs deployed on the same ship, thereby reducing the uncertainty of the ship’s motions that affect the quality of the depth measurements. The mean sound velocity can be inverted by mathematically minimizing the depth differences in the overlap. This technique completely minimizes the refraction error with frequent updates of the inverted mean sound velocity on the flight. Subsequently, the mean sound velocity can be used to locate ROVs that operate close to the seafloor in shallow water (&lt;80 m), even for large incident angles (e.g. θ~65°). Simulations showed that the best performance of the inversion technique is established when maximizing the distance between the multibeam heads, and by inward-tilting one or two heads. Practically, it means the deployment of MBESs on either side of the ship, rather than one pair of MBESs at mid-ship. <br/><br/>With increasing access to reliable ocean data, HISOM methods can potentially be run on ocean forecast model data to assess where and when refraction artifacts become dominant for fallpipe ROV positioning. This automatic assessment tool supports the SVP measuring strategy in subsea rock installation projects. OMBES can potentially be used as monitoring tool by comparing near real-time updates of the inverted mean sound velocity with the measured SVP. This data-driven decision tool can assist when to take an additional SVP. OMBES also improves the accuracy of multibeam bathymetric surveys by automatic collection of SVPs.","Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV); Ultra-Short Baseline (USBL); sound velocity profile (SVP); sound velocity inversion methods; dual-head multibeam echosounder; sound velocity bias; underwater acoustic positioning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

The contribution to climate change of the airline industry requires urgent changes in innovation to be sustainable. At the organisation, innovation is multidisciplinary, and needs of cross-divisional activity. The innovation team is the team responsible for overseeing the innovation processes that actually take place in the different divisions. <br/><br/>In 2019, the innovation team started to be aware of the opportunity of innovating as an ‘ecosystem’, with frequent transfers of knowledge and cross-divisional synergies. After several efforts, the assignment of this thesis stated the need for a digital product that can interactively represent the actors involved in the different ecosystems within the company. The assignment came with an implicit set of assumptions and a research phase followed to provide better understanding of the context of the assignment. <br/><br/>A number of insights were gathered as a result of the research phase. First, it is not only understandable but imperative for organisations to innovate in networks given the competitiveness and complexity of the current business environment. Second, employees at the organisation, as a result of the activity of the industry, are partially focused on execution and barriers among departments have raised. Third, the culture at the organisation shows formality and structure, valuing efficiency and with productivity residing in the individual and in the respective department.<br/><br/>If the innovation ecosystem concept is to be supported by the innovation team, efforts should address the inefficiency of lateral collaboration. Moreover, the efforts should influence the different areas of the organisation, such as the shared values, systems or staff. Apart from the insights gathered from the research phase, this thesis developed a set of practical interventions that aim to foster collaboration while facilitating the implementation of the innovation ecosystem.<br/><br/>The first intervention comes after the redefinition of the original assignment. Designing a tool that represents the actors can help, but only if matched with interventions in other areas. After an iterative design process, a tool that allows the actors within an ecosystem to see others’ involvement was built using Power BI. The second intervention required a reorganisation of the knowledge-management system used for innovation. The intervention provided a new information architecture and layout for knowledge to be easily retrieved, and presumably collaboration within the ecosystem fostered. Finally, the last intervention identified a set of cultural brokers who can connect groups of employees with an innovation purpose. Studies on social networks and innovation show the brokers own a competitive advantage within the networks: they are more creative and can help bridge structural holes. Brokers can be nurtured when a cross-divisional need exists and the innovation requires to close the gap.<br/><br/>Finally, after developing the interventions, the innovation team is recommended to define the governance of the ecosystems in place. Defining governance will help align expectations towards collaboration and knowledge sharing from the stakeholders involved, and is a first crucial step before continuing with implementation efforts after the thesis. Once governance is defined, the organisation is provided with guidance on how to continue with implementation tasks, by starting a pilot project and including a manual of the designed tool to assist users during their learning.<br","Innovation; Ecosystem; Collaboration; Systems; Organisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Additionally, prolonged exposure to excessive levels of noise has a negative economic impact.<br/>The rapid development of urban areas makes the effect of noise pollution even worse. However, architects and urban designers who define the shape of a neighbourhood rarely give attention to this aspect. Decisions regarding the sound environment are often taken in the latter stages of design when the least design exploration is possible. Moreover, environmental acoustic involves complex urban physics which makes it more difficult for designers. <br/><br/>Therefore, in this master thesis, a parametric simulation workflow is developed which can predict the traffic noise in the early phases of design. The approach would be easy to use for architects and urban designers to overcome some of the main drawbacks of traditional practices. <br/><br/>The project followed five-step processes of research, development, validation, testing and optimization. To better understand urban noise, atmospheric acoustics, and how buildings affect sound propagation, a literature review was conducted. The parametric workflow was then created using Grasshopper, the visual scripting plugin for Rhino3D, in conjunction with other plugins such as Pachyderm and Ladybug.<br/><br/>After development stage, the parametric workflow is validated against on-site measurements and Geomilieu (environmental noise calculation software). Further, the simulation results from the design stage demonstrate that the tool can include urban microscale features like building shape, façade extrusions and materiality which can have an impact on reducing the traffic noise levels. It is found that the building shape of the lower levels may amplify or quieten the sound on upper levels. Façade extrusions have the least impact but variations in their positions and sizes may influence the results. It was further predicted that the green façade has a great potential to reduce reflected noise and lower the values inside the courtyard.<br/><br/>In addition, the findings of the optimization study show that the workflow may be used with other performance criteria and help to explore design solutions. Overall, the workflow can help identify the relationships between design aspects and acoustic performance in the early stages of design by taking into account simplifications and restrictions such as edge diffraction.<br","Traffic noise; Parametric Design; Acoustic Simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

The shipping industry is responsible for 2-3 % of the global Greenhouse Gas emissions and Heerema Marine Contractors (HMC) identified floating solar as a promising solution to reduce the emissions, of their crane vessel Sleipnir, during operations. This study is the starting point of a technical feasibility study as a temporary energy supply for Sleipnir. The design is strongly focused on the temporary deployment and limited occupied deckspace during transit. Current floating solar systems are commonly designed for permanent deployment as supporting structure for rigid glass photovoltaic (PV) panels. Furthermore, modular constructions are used to limit the transportation costs however they are not designed for temporary deployment. A new PV innovation is flexible lightweight films which allow a more flexible supporting structure. A flexible thin sheet can be spooled on a drum to make temporary deployment possible. The influence of the wave loading on the coupled hydrodynamic behaviour is evaluated since wind and current loading are predictable based on previous research. <br/><br/>The structural design parameters of the thin sheet and drum are designed to mimic the excitation motion since wave structure interaction has been minimized to reduce the mooring force. Therefore, the draft must be low and the characteristic length related to the bending stiffness of the sheet should be smaller than the excitation wavelength. The draft of the drum should be low to have a natural heave frequency higher than the excitation frequency. <br/><br/>The coupled hydrodynamic response for head loading is evaluated with model tests in a towing tank. The concept is scaled according to Froude to ensure the surface waves, which are gravity-driven, are properly scaled. Regular waves are chosen based on the workability wave spectrum of Sleipnir. The roll and heave response over the frequency domain is indicated by analyzing the stable response at certain frequencies. The motions of the drum are obtained with the use of object tracking based on video recordings. The force within the connection of the system was measured with a force transducer whereas the mooring force was measured with a newly developed 3D-sensor. <br/><br/>It turns out that the heave motion of the system mimics the excitation motion over the wavelengths resulting in small drift forces. Significant rotations of the drum were observed for the longer wavelengths leading to water pumping over the sheet. The overturning moment is driven by the dynamic pressure over the drum diameter and the measured force in the connection generates a counteracting moment. The connection force is proportional to the buoyancy required to submerge the sheet and the acceleration of the free-floating sheet. <br/><br/>The feasibility of an OFPV concept for Sleipnir is demonstrated but the rotations have to be reduced by lowering the natural roll frequency. The drum dominates the coupled hydrodynamic behaviour compared to the sheet. Either the dimensions of the drum should be lowered or the thickness of the sheet must be increased. Decreasing the drum diameter is favourable over a thicker sheet since that would increase the characteristic length. Another option is to adjust the geometry of the drum to a shape where increased water displacement is required for the roll motion. <br","Floating Solar; VFFS; VLFS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Exploration methods place more emphasis on gaining knowledge of the environment quickly, but do not actively search for victims. A new method based on active inference is introduced with the aim of combining exploration and exploitation behaviour within one framework. The active inference model is based on a graph representation of the environment, formulated as a POMDP. The framework is built up by incrementally more difficult cases. The first case allows a mobile robot to navigate a known graph to search for victims. The second case assumes a partially unknown graph. Uncertainty about the existence of unvisited nodes is included in the predictions. The final case adjusts the model to the agent's point-cloud- and camera sensors. The framework is then used in a simulation environment, showing how it can be implemented in real-world scenarios. To do so, the active inference framework is combined with techniques from information gain exploration. This thesis shows that active inference can be used in large unknown environments to carry out search and exploration.","active inference; mobile robot navigation; graphs; exploration; exploitation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

The key to their unique properties lies in the microarchitecture of the material rather than the material itself. For advanced applications in the realm of prosthetics, such as form matching, aperiodic metamaterials have been recommended above repetitive ones. In a restricted lattice, metamaterials with disordered microarchitecture have displayed a wide variety of anisotropic conventional and auxetic behaviour. Because of the non-unique and non-intuitive link between the random network (RN) structures and their mechanical responses, their inverse design, which tries to extract the ideal structure according to specified requirements, remains a complex process. The current study looks at the forward prediction of mechanical response and the inverse design of 2D random network metamaterial unit cells for use in aperiodic combinatorial designs. The associated mechanical properties of stiffness and Poisson's ratio in two directions were numerically simulated for the unit cells. The configuration of random network designs that provide the least complicated unit cells with the greatest range of mechanical properties were selected. A dataset of such unit cells and their mechanical responses was then created for training machine learning models. A forward predictor of their mechanical response through a regression model was trained, to accelerate the production of the datasets and assist in the inverse design modelling. It was suggested to model the inverse design issue in a probabilistically generative manner, allowing for an interpretable investigation of the complicated structure–performance connection. A variational autoencoder (VAE) was trained to map complex microstructures into a low-dimensional, continuous, and organized latent space based on their mechanical response. A systematic approach to train machine learning models was investigated based on hyperparameter optimization methods, with cross-validation and a search space that expands over the model hyperparameters and data analysis alternatives. The trained forward predictor and generative model were evaluated, and the reported R^2 values were 0.99 and 0.96, respectively. Compared to numerical simulations, the estimation of mechanical properties through the regressor resulted in a hundredfold acceleration of the process. The trained deep generative model can be an effective tool for expediting the creation of RN unit cells. On-demand inverse creation of metamaterials for both observable and intentionally designed mechanical responses is achievable. To illustrate a practical use of such unit cells, a technique for aperiodic combinatorial design of unit cells for 2D form matching on two directions and all four sides was also provided. The mechanical properties of the unit cells, as well as the combinatorial design capabilities, were evaluated using experimental tests of 3D printed specimens. The experimental results of the unit cells were in good agreement with the numerical simulations. Similar forms to those programmed were achieved by tensioning the combinatorial patterns, albeit with a less degree of distortion. Overall, the findings show the RN unit cells' potential for combinatorial design.","Metamaterials; Machine learning; Mechanical properties; Design workflow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2027-06-10","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Peirlinck, M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Intro - The rapidly developing technology of cardiac finite element modelling aims to improve heart failure treatment by quantifying stresses acting in the cardiac tissue. Cardiac finite element modelling may improve heart failure treatment by providing more insight in the pathophysiology, enabling a patient-specific assessment and improving the efficiency of clinical trials and medical devices. An essential part of the cardiac finite element model is capturing the mechanical behaviour of the heart, including its active behaviour (contraction). This mechanical behaviour is captured by means of a material model. However, the active behaviour of the heart is not readily available in material models provided by commercial finite element software like Abaqus/CAE. Consequently, such active material model needs to be added in a user subroutine manually. This is a time-consuming task, prone to errors. Additionally, the availability of the documentation is limited, and in literature the methodology of the implementation is oftentimes not disclosed. <br/><br/>Thesis goal - The goal of this master-thesis is to implement a combination of the passive and active mathematical material models in a commercial finite element platform. This was done by implementing the combined material models in user subroutine UMAT that can be used in FEA-software Abaqus. Reproducibility of the UMAT is ensured by a detailed documentation. Also, the UMAT is provided in the supplementary material.<br/><br/>Methods - The UMAT consists of the Holzapfel Ogden constitutive law as passive component, and the Time Varying-Elastance contstitutive law as active component, which are combined by means of the active stress approach. Additionally, the UMAT requires computation of the elasticity tensor, which is computed by means of a numerical formulation. The incorporation of the passive and active constitutive laws in the UMAT was verified by means of multiple test-cases. The outcomes of the UMAT were compared to an analytical solution and a benchmark user subroutine in the form of UANISOHYPER_INV. Lastly, reality-check test-cases were carried out by comparing the UMAT outcomes to the results from similar test-cases found in literature.<br/><br/>Verification results - Verification of the implemented material models showed good agreement with the analytical computed solution of equibiaxial extension, equibiaxial compression and isometric contraction test-cases, as all cases showed an MAPEmax or APEmax error lower than 1%. Shear test-case results of the UMAT showed some bigger APEmax values (maximal 17%) with relation to the analytical solution, possibly caused by numerical errors during the elasticity tensor computation. Results of the reality-check cases showed similar trends to the mechanical experiments done on cardiac tissue on which these cases are based. <br/><br/>Conclusion - The public availability of the implemented passive and active material models in the user subroutine UMAT, which is working reasonably well according to conducted verification, forms a significant step forwards in the field of cardiac finite element modelling. The current work can be further extended by the incorporations of compressibility during contraction and viscoelasticity in the material models. This thesis provides the basis for future projects in the field of cardiac finite element modelling including an active material model. Also, the provided implementation of material models may aid in the implementation of other mathematical material models in a user subroutine like UMAT.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-12-31","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Traditionally, kinematics and kinetics are estimated from optical marker data and sometimes measured interaction forces. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) were introduced as a low cost alternative that makes measurements outside the laboratory possible. Measurements are often used in a loosely coupled combination of marker-based inverse kinematics (IK) or orientation-based inverse kinematics (OBIK) and inverse dynamics (ID). The orientations for OBIK are first estimated from IMU data. Recently, tightly coupled estimation methods based on nonlinear state space models have been introduced for both sensor modalities to improve accuracy. Sensor fusion of marker and IMU data is a relatively unexplored area of research. Markers provide a measurement on the position level whereas IMUs measure on the velocity and acceleration levels. Fusing the two sensor modalities is hypothesized to result in the most accurate estimation of kinematics and kinetics. The objective of this thesis is to investigate the effects of the sensor modality and the estimation method on the accuracy of estimated kinematics and kinetics. An iterated extended Kalman filter (IEKF) was developed which estimates joint angles, velocities and torques using any combination of marker data, IMU data and measured interaction forces. To validate the system with respect to ground truth, two experiments (fast motion and interaction force) were carried out on a robot equipped with all three sensor types. For comparison, IK, OBIK and a marker/IMU-based kinematic extended Kalman filter (EKF) were used together with ID to estimate kinematics and kinetics as well. The IEKFs estimated joint angles with a root mean square error (RMSE) between 0.33◦ (markers and interaction forces only) and 1.58◦ (IMUs only, fast motion). The marker-based IEKF and the IMU-based IEKF outperformed IK and OBIK respectively in both experiments. The IMU-based IEKF improved joint velocity RMSE from 4.13 deg/s to 1.10 deg/s in the fast motion experiment. Sharp peaks in the joint torque signal were only estimated accurately using IMU data directly. The marker/IMU IEKF was the only method that estimated joint angles, velocities and torques with RMSEs below 1◦ , 1.5 deg/s and 1.5 Nm respectively in both experiments. It is concluded that using IMU data in a tightly coupled system improves joint velocity and torque estimation. Assuming accurate sensor registration and no soft tissue artifacts, a tightly coupled IMU-only method can be sufficiently accurate in practice.","Sensor fusion; Biomechanics; Joint kinematics; Joint kinetics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(mentor); Dacome, G. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","An experimental study is presented towards inner-scaled Helmholtz-Resonators (HRs) as a passive turbulent boundary layer (TBL) flow control method. Using acoustic pressure-velocity coupling at the orifice of the HR, it is aimed to attenuate the kinetic energy of the grazing turbulence to reduce the mean skin friction. The HRs are tuned towards the spatial and temporal scales of the near-wall cycle turbulence events that play a major role in the production of turbulence. The adopted HR design strategy has a spatial tuning towards the most efficient attenuation of sweep events, based on recent studies on micro-cavity arrays. The temporal tuning is based on the streamwise wavelength of the most energetic wall-normal velocity fluctuations. These interact with the wall to create pressure fluctuations and form the primary excitation source of the HRs.<br/> <br/>A parameter study on HRs under a fully developed grazing TBL at Re<sub>τ</sub> ≈ 2200 was performed. A strong pressure-velocity coupling was found between the HR and the grazing TBL when the HR design frequency either matched the frequency of the most energetic wall-normal velocity fluctuations or when the HR design frequency was below this frequency. The pressure-velocity coupling extends to y<sup>+</sup> ≈ 25, in which phase-interlocking of the grazing TBL occurs. Clear inflow and outflow regions were identified with a streamwise width related to the HR resonance frequency. The inflow and outflow regions cause an increase and decrease in streamwise velocity, respectively. These velocity fluctuations appear as an increase in spectral energy around the wavelengths of the HR resonance and are accompanied by a reduction in spectral energy at higher wavelengths. While quadrant analysis indicates an increase in turbulence production from an increased relative strength of Q2 and Q4 events, variable-interval time averaging indicates no significant changes to the intensity and duration of the near-wall cycle turbulence events as a result of the HR resonance. To date, no significant changes to the mean boundary layer statistics were found that could directly be attributed to the achieved pressure-velocity coupling. Note that only a single HR has been the focus of the current study, with valuable information about HR scaling, resonance and domain-of influence on the TBL flow. Future arrays of HRs may be able to show a more pronounced global effect on the mean flow.<br","Helmholtz-Resonators; Turbulent Boundary Layers; Flow Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Natural cellular structures, specifically, have used randomized microarchitectures to form mechanically efficient materials, such as wood, sponge, and trabecular bone. Mechanical metamaterials are a class of artificial microarchitected materials designed to carry tensions and compressions with lightweight. However, there had been some limitations regarding the range of mechanical properties and geometrical parameters of regular honeycomb mechanical metamaterials. Also, it is not possible for extreme auxetic honeycomb mechanical metamaterials, which are with extreme negative Poisson’s ratio, to have a high level of stiffness. The addition of randomness had been proven to extend the properties of mechanical metamaterials.<br/><br/>In this project, through the approach of the combination of bending- and stretching-dominated structures, based on the level of nodal connectivity of the structures, we aimed to explore the range of properties in both the in-plane and the out-of-plane contexts. In terms of in-plane properties, we proposed a simple design that can achieve extreme auxetic or double-side auxetic lattices, the <i>corner-plus</i> design. The design successfully created lattices with an over -0.8 negative Poisson’s ratio value and a 6 to 10 times level of stiffness as regular honeycomb metamaterials. Through recognition and rearrangement of the <i>openings</i>, the peninsula-like region that expands under tension, over one million different lattices are generated with extreme negative Poisson’s ratio values and a high level of stiffness. The design had expanded the stiffness versus Poisson’s ratio region compared to the ordinary materials and regular honeycomb mechanical metamaterials.<br/><br/>Furthermore, in total six meta-plates were designed from the selected metamaterials and additively manufactured for the investigation of out-of-plane behavior. Experimentally and computationally, their deformation and curvatures presented that the induced curvature along the transverse direction was adjustable, which can be manipulated with the level of connectivity and the value of Poisson’s ratio. <i>Openings</i> in these meta-plates also played a big role in the formulation of surface contours and induced curvatures both locally and globally.<br/><br/>In general, <i>openings</i> had evident contributions to the auxeticity and the unique surface contours, which can be a key factor in the future design of the random mechanical metamaterials. The extreme auxeticity and the modular surface topology can be further implemented into the design of wearable prostheses or medical implants for future applications.<br","Mechanical metamaterials; randomness; auxeticity; Curvature","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-12-31","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

On the one hand they need to be designed sufficiently strong to prevent failure or destruction, while on the other hand they need to be economically feasible. If a structure is designed too strong, unnecessary costs are made and the structure becomes too expensive.<br/><br/>One of the potential failure mechanisms for weirs is erosion of the soil downstream of the weir. Bed protections consisting of rock and concrete are placed to prevent this erosion. Numerical modelling can give additional insight in the design of such a bed protection. This thesis aims to improve the design of bed protections downstream of underflow weirs through numerical modelling. This is done through two research objectives, being 1) proposing a numerical modelling strategy to create a design method for riprap bed protections downstream of underflow weirs, and 2) preserving a small computation time compared to full scale 3D models, as this is ideal for a future application in engineering.<br/><br/>A new approach is formulated by using the stability parameter of Steenstra (2014), ψRS, as basis. This parameter is based on multiple flow situations, except the underflow gate. For this reason the underflow gate is investigated in the current research. The output of the created OpenFOAM models can be applied to this parameter, leading to ψ-curves that can be compared with measured damage.<br/><br/>The first research objective is obtained by the application of three different turbulence mixing length approaches, of which two approaches created interesting results. The first approach is the Bakhmetev approach, leading to a conservative design outcome with a gradual decreasing stability pattern. The second is the Shear Stress Relation (SSR), leading to a promising result with better defined instability regions that compare with measured bed damage. From the desire to work conservatively, the results reveal that in the design phase of a bed protection downstream of a weir, the application of the Bakhmetev approach for the mixing length is recommended over the SSR approach. <br/><br/>Extended physical testing containing three aspects is needed to strengthen the promising findings of the SSR. These aspects are 1) a damage stone count including a sieve distribution, 2) a setup with varying gate heights and stone dimensions, and 3) varying water levels and discharges per different gate height and stone size. In addition a preliminary 2D numerical model study is advised, which allows to investigate the areas of interest for PIV flow measurements.<br/><br/>The second research objective is achieved by the application of a 2D RANS model and the simplification of the water level through a rigid lid. This simplification still leads to workable results, with computation time that are in the range of two to eight hours, operating on ten cores in one computer. This makes the approach attractive for engineering applications and for future applications in renovation tasks for weirs in the Meuse.<br","CFD; Weir; Hydraulic jump; Bed protection; OpenFOAM; Underflow gate","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

A way to tackle these limitations could be by using a ring-light configuration, which produces diffuse scattered illumination for a full 360° around the object.<br/>In this study, we developed and experimentally evaluated two ring-light configurations for intraocular illumination during vitreoretinal surgery: one for insertion through the pars plana (20 mm), and one for insertion through the cornea and placement in the posterior chamber (11 mm). Both prototypes are made from a 27 gauge Eckardt TwinLight (DORC, the Netherlands), placed inside a capillary tube cut in half through the length. Cuts were made in the fiber every 2 mm, perpendicular to the length of the fiber, to allow light to exit the fiber through the cladding.<br/>By measuring the light intensity and illuminated area, we found that the ring-light configurations produce a lower light intensity but also a slightly larger illuminated area and a more diffuse and uniformly distributed illumination than the Eckardt TwinLight.<br/>The placement of the ring-light in the posterior chamber proved to be unsafe and complex, since the installation procedure in ex-vivo porcine cadaver eyes could not be executed without damaging the lens bag, lens zonules, posterior iris and cornea, due to the lack of space in the posterior chamber, and the rigidity and sharp tip of the ring.<br/>The ring-light configuration that is inserted through the pars plana also caused damage to the retina and lens bag, due to the ring’s rigidity and its sharp tip. However, this configuration shows potential when the ring would be made from a more flexible material and has an incorporated pigtail curve a the distal end, which can be easily achieved in a future version of the prototype.","intraocular illumination; vitreoretinal surgery; ring-light configuration; light intensity; illuminated area; installation procedure; safety","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

However, mobility, together with an increased world population, causes problems like traffic congestions, emissions, and an increased energy and raw material consumption that impacts our climate. This, digital developments like the Internet of Things, and the pressure from emerging car brands like Tesla or new mobility providers, have disrupted the automotive industry. Complexity has therefore increased, creating wicked problems for BMW that has to adapt itself to these dynamic times. It however also creates opportunities opportunities for whole new driving and mobility experiences. <br/>To create these experiences, BMW has to rethink its current ways of working that are still largely engineering and product driven. Instead, a more experience driven mindset could be the answer to increasing customer demands and market pressure. This research therefore focuses on developing a strategy on how industries could adapt to dynamic times by changing a company‘s internal mindset, from a product-oriented focus to a more experience driven one. Starting from the experience, means taking a user-centred approach that focusses on human needs instead of merely product- and feature-evolvement. This would not only benefit the customer, but also the company‘s success by generating competitive advantages, profitability and sustaining long-term customer loyalty.<br/>Following from the research, it was found that UX and CX can be taken to a next level, which not only optimises customer touchpoints around products and services but solves for human needs around a clear purpose. This is called a Business of Experience (BOX) and the newly framed goal is to create a strategy that transforms the BMW Group into a BOX that is fully human- and experience driven. In line with the 4M framework, the need for four strategies was derived, called CO: strategies, to reach this final goal. On the individual level, a strategy is needed that enhances the engagement of every employee, a.k.a. Individual Contributor (IC), which is translated into CO:NTRIBUTION. On the second level, collaboration and knowledge flow between teams and departments must be enhanced, resulting in a strategy involving CO:LLABORATION. Next to this, there is a need for supporting organisational structures, cultures, and leaders, thus CO:ORDINATION. Lastly, stakeholders that form the community around organisations should be involved in the development process to learn about needs and innovations, and a strategy to enhance CO:-CREATION should be implemented.<br/>A roadmap with three horizons and a final vision for the BMW Group was created, that should lead the BMW Group towards becoming a Business of Experience. A good starting point is the creation of a Centre of Excellence (COE). A COE is a centralised and independent, physical and/or virtual facility within an organisation, that leverages the resources that are already there and provides the rest of the organisation with coordination, research, knowledge, support, trainings, and enablers in a specific area.

It is able to solve fish harvesting problems, in which we want to optimize harvesting out-take by considering fishing as a control function that acts on the state of the dynamical system, which represents the growth of fish species in the environment. Other modelling aspects of optimal control are defining terminal costs and running costs, e.g. maximizing profit. We keep the terminal condition comparable for a different number of species. It is based on the initial population.<br/>By using the optimal control Hamiltonian and Pontryagin's Maximum Principle we can calculate the optimal state trajectories corresponding to suitable optimal controls. The Hamiltonian is dependent on the state equation and the running costs. We present two approaches of modelling the running costs. An approach that is not directly translatable to the fish harvesting problem, but it leads to a smooth Hamiltonian, which greatly simplifies derivation and computation. The other, which is equivalent to maximizing profit, leads to a non-smooth Hamiltonian. This leads to jump-discontinuous derivatives needed for computation. We propose to regularize the derivatives of the Hamiltonian using suitable smooth functions, such that it is equivalent to regularizing the Hamiltonian directly. We give details for implementing both approaches up to systems of <i>n</i> competing species. After which we go into detail on algorithms and programming structure implemented. Finally, in modest numerical experiments, for one and two species, we show the relation between the optimal control and the terminal costs. But more interestingly, that the smooth Hamiltonian models are inadequate and regularized Hamiltonian models are the preferred choice. Intriguingly, the latter approach results in steady state solution, where the control acts as a stabilizer.","Optimal Control; Numerical Analysis; Fish Harvesting; Harvesting Strategies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Simulations for Science and Engineering (COSSE)","",""

Some key findings are that for accurately forecasting the load, the temperature and time are the most important features. For accurately forecasting the PV power generation, especially the irradiation is most important, but time, horizontal view and humidity are also important features. Furthermore, it is shown that random forest regression models can accurately forecast both the demand and PV power generation with an accuracy above 90%. Artificial neural networks are also adequate models for the forecasting problems, but because they are harder to understand and not necessarily better, it is recommended to start with random forest regressors before making neural networks.

This will require an unprecedented shift in the technologies relied on in almost every part of the economy. Venture Capital can play a pivotal role in hastening the adoption of new technologies, but for investors to pursue a technology, certain conditions must be met. This research uses the Technological Innovation Systems (TIS) framework to qualitatively explore the nature of these conditions. It does this through a double case study of two technologies at the forefront of the “Climate Tech” investor movement: Electric Cars and Plant-Based Meat Alternatives. Combining literature research with interviews of both investors and people closely involved with these technologies, the research identifies several key building blocks as likely to affect investor interest. These building blocks include Product Quality (the product needs to be competitive on grounds other than its sustainability), Product Price (the product must be able to be sold at an initially significant premium), Production System (product components or materials as well as production capacity should be commoditized), and Customers (the product must be interesting to the mass-market). In both case studies, the ultimately successful companies showed that the existing niche fundamentally misunderstood the market. Through the lens of the TIS, this could be considered an Accident or Event, where a visionary founder challenges existing Knowledge of Application and Market. There is a significant level of overlap between the case studies, suggesting that this might be a key strategy to developing sustainable B2C innovations.","Technological Innovation System; Venture Capital; Cleantech; Sustainable Innovation; Battery Electric Vehicles; Plant-Based Meat Alternatives","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

By 2050, the world's population has grown exponentially to 9.7 billion and a tripling of the global use of materials can be realistically expected. Therefore, the transition towards a circular economy has become one of the top priorities of the European Union and its national governments. The Dutch government has stated the ambition to achieve a fully circular economy by 2050 at the latest.<br/><br/>Worldwide, the construction sector contributes to approximately 13\% of the global economy and employment of over 110 million workers. However, the construction sector is also responsible for 50\% of the total raw material consumption, 40\% of the energy usage and for 39\% of all carbon dioxide emissions. The construction sector therefore shows excellent potential for the transition to a more circular production model. One of the initiatives in the Netherlands to accelerate this transition is called 'het betonakkoord'. This initiative aims to make the concrete supply chain more sustainable by focusing on high quality application of recycled or reused building materials and on circular design. <br/><br/>Another interesting development is ongoing in the Netherlands. Since 2019, the housing shortage is 300.000 units and is continuously increasing to approximately 400.000 units by 2025. Combined with the economic growth of the past decade has resulted in skyrocketing house prices. One of the most effective solutions to overcome this problem is to simply built new houses. However, taken into consideration the transition towards a circular economy, raises a fundamental question of how to design sustainable residential buildings with regard to circular principles. This question is quite extensive and consists of a variety of both structural and non-structural aspects. This thesis project focuses on the circular design of a load-bearing floor system for utilisation as a storey floor.<br/><br/>First, extensive literature review is performed in order to identify circular principles and strategies in the design phase of buildings. This thesis project adopted the framework of Cheshire. The framework consist of six nested circles which represent the hierarchy of the framework. Within the framework, Cheshire proposes five design principles in his book: building in layers, designing-out waste, design for adaptability, design for disassembly and material selection. This thesis project expanded the design principles of Cheshire, by defining and providing hands-on strategies or criteria for each design principle. In total, 42 criteria are proposed for transposition into a comprehensive framework for application in practice.<br/><br/>Next, several recent residential and utility building projects are reviewed to determine the state-of-the-art regarding the implementation of circular design principles in practice. The general tendency is that these projects take the deconstructability and, to a limited extent, the selection of materials of the buildings into account. The common denominator in all recent projects, and especially for residential buildings, is the reduction of environmental impact through the realisation of net zero energy buildings. <br/><br/>Concrete floor systems are still widely used in newly built residential and utility buildings, due to their favourable characteristics. Therefore, the four most commonly used concrete floor systems are reviewed and discussed, These four floor systems are primarily designed in accordance with the demands of users and contractors. As a result of this thesis project, a newly designed floor system is proposed which is fundamentally based on the theoretical design framework developed in this report. Implementation of all five design principles was not considered feasible given the current state-of-the-art and regulatory barriers. Therefore, the newly proposed floor system is based on strategies and criteria related to the design principles of adaptability and disassembly. These design principles form the starting point of the multi-criteria analysis conducted in this report. The multi-criteria analysis is conducted in the first place to evaluate the performances of the four most commonly used concrete floor systems in the context of the considered circular design principles and secondly to compare the newly proposed floor system with the four most commonly used concrete floor systems. Based on the weighted rating scale, a maximum score of one hundred can be obtained. Results from the multi-criteria analysis reveal that three out of four commonly used concrete floor systems score well (scoring between 60 and 80) regarding the circular design principles. The newly proposed floor system scores excellent (scoring between 80 and 100).<br/><br/>The structural resistance of the newly proposed floor system is verified in accordance with codes of practice and state-of-the-art research under normal loading conditions. Horizontal wind loading is taken into consideration as well with respect to the stability of floor systems. Moreover, several stakeholder prerequisites are included in the design. Possibilities for recesses, staircases or vertical shafts for example, and building services are provided and suggested. Buildability aspects, such as the fabrication and assembly process are discussed in the report as well.","Modular; Floor system; Post-tensioning; Residential buildings","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Concrete Structures","",""

One of these new innovations is social eXtended Reality (XR). By combining Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies, social XR can provide a more immersive experience than any other VR application by giving users at different locations the chance to virtually gather in real-time. But such applications impose enormous requirements on computational and communication resources. 5th Generation (5G) mobile networks are targeted as solution to provide ultra-low latency and ultra-high throughput for social XR. In current research, many optimisations are aimed at VR applications such as on-demand streaming, while there is a lack of solutions for real-time user-interactive applications like social XR. In this graduation project we develop and assess cross-layer solutions for optimised scheduling of social XR applications in 5G networks. An existing framework for simulating social XR conference applications serves as the basis for our modelling approach. We devise different schedulers, that utilise cross-layer information in the form of the video frametype and frame-level End-to-End (E2E) latency budgets rather than packet-level latency budgets purely within the Radio Access Network (RAN). In contrast to previous work, we create the VR traffic based on real video data and develop tools to model the packet dispersion caused by multi-hop transmission over the internet towards the RAN. We study the effect of various system and traffic parameters on the Quality of Service (QoS) and perceived Quality of Experience (QoE) in the context of social XR applications through an extensive sensitivity analysis. Herein we also assess the performance impact of different types of cross-layer packet schedulers. Further, we gain insights into the correlation between the network QoS and perceived QoE by end users which are the key in future cross-layer implementations for social XR.","Social XR; VR; 5G; MAC Scheduling; Cross-Layer Optimisation; Video Frame Type; End-to-End Latency Budget","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

Also in the area of Water BoardDe Dommel, locatedwithin the province of Brabant, water shortage is a common problem. This results in water abstraction restrictions for farmers in the crop season every year. With climate change the precipitation pattern in the Netherlands will change, resulting in longer dry periods during summertime. Water Board De Dommel is searching for strategies to decrease this water shortage. These strategies need to be tested for future climate scenarios. This research tests different interventions for two specific areas within De Dommel. These areas differ in land-use, location in the catchment, geo(hydro)logy and infrastructure. This research answers the following research question: How does the groundwater of two different areas within Waterschap De Dommel react to different interventions<br/>to prevent water shortage in long-termfuture scenarios?<br/>To find the answer to this research question a stationary groundwater model (iMOD) is used. In this model<br/>the different interventions are tested with four climate scenarios from the KNMI. These interventions take place in the top layers of the subsoil. Next to these interventions also three abstraction scenarios are modeled, to see the effect of changes in deeper aquifer layers. The interventions are tested with three signals from the model: 1) the head of the first aquifer layer, 2) the water balance for both areas for the first aquifer layer as well as the first four aquifer layers combined and 3) the flow paths. Because models include uncertainties and assumptions, expert judgement is included to test the interventions. The expert judgment is based on historical maps and the location of the interventions. At the end of the research a non-stationary model is used to test the ""Brook swamp"" intervention. This result is compared to the results of the stationary model of this intervention. The results show that changes in the top layers of the subsoil have almost no effect on the groundwater in the deeper layers for De Pielis area. More downstream in the catchment, at the Landschotse Heide area, this effect is bigger, because of changes in the upstream area. In the top soil layers the groundwater reacts positive for most interventions for both areas resulting in more water availability. Also in the top layers the effect is bigger at the Landschotse Heide area than at De Pielis area. With the non-stationary model results the groundwater reacts more positive to the ""Brook swamp"" intervention than for the stationary model. A non-stationary model is therefore better to see how the groundwater reacts to seasonal dependent interventions. The groundwater reacts differently per areas as well as per intervention. In both areas the groundwater does react positively to most interventions. For the Landschotse Heide area the groundwater reacts more positive than for De Pielis area. For both areas the ""higher water level"" and ""closed ditches"" interventions show the most positive reactions of the groundwater. Based on these results the Water Board is advised to research the effect of enriching the top layer of De Pielis, to see if these top layers can then hold more water. For the Landschotse Heide the Water Board is advised to decide if agriculture or nature is more important in that area, because these cannot coincide, and reach all demands, in the way it is set-up now.","Groundwater; Drought; Long-term planning; Water management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","Delta Futures Lab",""

The complexity of the physical processes associated with the design has led to the development of many empirical formulas while a standardized method for the selection of breakwaters’ design parameters in the EU does not yet exist. The most common approach to design such a structure nowadays entails using information and recommendations from design manuals and guidelines such as PIANC and the Eurotop Manual. A new Eurocode 1 which includes specific considerations for coastal structures such as breakwaters is in the development process. This study aims to compare the PIANC method with the method to derive actions/loads included in the Eurocode proposal prEN1991-1-8. To do so the following research question has been formulated: <br/>“What differences between the PIANC method and the method proposed by the new EUROCODE in the design of a vertical wall breakwater can be identified, using the new breakwater at the Port of Genoa as a case study?“ <br/>As mentioned in the question, a case study is used. The Port of Genoa, one of the biggest ports in Italy plans to construct a new vertical wall breakwater. An initial design is openly available along with wave and water level data. This design is assessed using both methods and is further optimized. The aim is to gain insights into the differences between the PIANC and the new method. <br/>At first, the failure mechanisms of such a structure are defined along with the safety factors and parameters. The data required to perform such an assessment is also an important aspect of the exercise. Most of the data are openly available during the consulting phase for the new breakwater in Genoa. In cases where extra data were necessary, they were based on the literature or on reasonable assumptions. <br/>Based on the failure mechanisms and the retrieved data, the initial breakwater cross-section was assessed. The assessment both with the PIANC method and the new Eurocode proved that this design is sufficient and can be further optimized to decrease its costs. A high-level optimization is also conducted as part of this study in order to better understand the differences between the two methods. It can be concluded that the differences lay more in the method than in the actual result. For example, the proposed Eurocode creates a stable theoretical framework of how to choose a return period. The actual number may be very similar to the one that one would have used either way, but the choice can be argued in a better way. <br/>On the other hand, the use of the new Eurocode revealed some problems and inconsistencies in the document which is confusing in certain parts. In addition, the new Eurocode which among others aims at standardizing the design process. However, parts like the combination of wave and water level actions and the choice of return period for the two main limit state functions are relatively clearer providing a solid base.<br","Breakwater; vertical wall; Eurocode; Goda; coastal engineering; Port","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

In most parts of the oceans, sunlight is barely available and thus marine animals have evolved to rely on sound for navigation, foraging and communication. Marine animals are not the only sources of underwater sound. Other natural sources such as earthquakes, waves and rain cause ambient noise, but also loud impulses. Furthermore, human activities consisting of dredging, surveying, construction and shipping cause loud noise in a wide frequency range. Underwater radiated noise (URN) from shipping has severe negative consequences on marine animals. The negative effects include auditory masking, stress, and behavioural and acoustic responses, possibly leading to collision with ships. It is evident that the mitigation of the underwater radiated noise of a ship is advantageous and worth researching.<br/><br/>In the past, plenty of research has been done into the modelling of the acoustic characteristics of vessels. A research gap was identified in the modelling of mitigation methods of the underwater radiated noise from ships with a focus on marine mammals. Up until now, most research has focused on the attenuation of vibrations on board a ship or radiated noise due to the propellers. At all times, the focus was either on human comfort or the radiated noise in general, however, for marine mammals certain frequency bands are of greater importance. It is valuable to assess the URN of a ship in the design phase, such that adjustments can be made to decrease the URN without excessive costs. The research goal of this thesis is:<br/>Predict and mitigate the structure-borne underwater radiated noise of a ship in the design phase caused by onboard machinery.<br/><br/>The research goal and corresponding research questions are answered by first setting up the framework for the models. This framework sets the frequency analysis range to 20 - 200 Hz, formulates a reference ship case for validation of the data and gives the inputs and boundary conditions for the models. The acoustic metric of interest is set to the source level (SL) in dB re 1 μPa2m2.<br/><br/>Secondly, a simplified model is setup in Ansys 2021R2. This model is a 3D solid element model shaped like a beam. The equivalent beam (EB) model has similar global properties as the reference ship case. Around the EB model an acoustic domain is located that is modelled to represent an infinite domain. No physical boundary effects are included as the source level is per definition not dependent on this.<br/>Subsequently, mitigation methods for machinery URN are researched and the resilient mount was found to be the most promising. A resilient mount is applied to the EB model in Ansys 2021R2 and source level spectra for different mount parameters are investigated.<br/>Lastly, a two degree of freedom (2-DOF) schematisation is made that incorporates the Ansys model using a dynamic stiffness. The 2-DOF schematisation allows for faster computations of the complete model and thus a more extensive parameter study of the resilient mount is possible.<br/><br/>Over the frequency analysis range of 20 - 200 Hz, the results show that machinery structure-borne URN can be reduced by 45 - 65 dB re 1 μPa2m2. The reduction oscillates over the frequencies at lower frequencies. A linear SL reduction was observed from 60 Hz and above, which gradually lessened for higher frequencies. The SL reduction increased from 45 dB re 1 μPa2m2 to 60 dB re 1 μPa2m2 when the resilient mount damping ratio was changed from 0.18 to 0.02. In addition, the normalised resilient mount parameter study showed the system's parameter sensitivities and responses. It became clear that the resilient mount does not respond to a change in resilient mount damping as expected. The accuracy of the absolute results is subject to assumptions and limitations, which introduce uncertainties.<br/><br/>The absolute decrease in URN with the resilient mount was computed using acceleration input rather than force input. The acceleration input was found to have overestimated the 'no-mount' case, which was used to compare cases with the resilient mount. The total URN reduction with the resilient mount could thus have been overestimated. Furthermore, an effect of the model boundaries and the model domain size on the results was present in the models. The magnitudes of the results were influenced by this effect, which could not be eliminated due to the computational limitations reached. Finally, there was a scarcity of model input data and reference data. The magnitudes of the results were obtained and compared to limited data in order to determine the accuracy of the results.<br/>Taking these limitations into consideration, the findings of this study should be interpreted with caution. The findings support literature claims that a resilient mount can reduce structure-borne machinery URN by 20 - 40 dB re 1 μPa2m2, with more reduction at higher frequencies.<br/><br/>The effect of the application of the resilient mount on marine mammals was hard to quantify. The structure-borne machinery URN is a part of the total URN of a ship. Due to the logarithmic relation of the noise, the reduction of one part could have very limited effects. Furthermore, the total soundscape in the ocean is formed by the combined noise of many ships. Moreover, the relation between the perceived nuisance of marine mammals and the URN levels is hard to indicate. The effect is undoubtedly positive but could be negligible in the bigger picture. At low speeds and close distances, the machinery URN is governing and the influence of URN from other ships is reduced. In those cases, the reduction of structure-borne machinery URN with resilient mounts could be expected to be the most positive for marine mammals.<br","Underwater radiated noise; Resilient mount; ANSYS; Marine animals; Mitigation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-06-01","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

In order for this trend to continue one requires a reliable medical emergency delivery system. Both governments and private companies recognize that drones might be a good fit for this job. Previous qualitative studies suggest benefits of an Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) to be: less vulnerability to congestion, fewer emissions, and cost savings because it enables further healthcare centralization. However, unknown reliability and physical risks that drones pose to civilians, often referred to as third-party-risk (TPR), have prevented systematic adoption so far. Because little holistic and quantitative understanding of these risks and benefits exists, policy- and other decision-makers are unable to value them and compare options. We propose an agent-based simulation model that reflects a multi-use-case medical emergency delivery system sustained by drones, cars, or a heterogeneous vehicle fleet. A case study of the Dutch Medical Drone Service project is performed, incorporating road-risk statistics and hourly congestion predictions. Three system design decisions are covered: testing different modes of operation, vehicle fleets, and healthcare facility allocations. We show that flying/driving safely when possible and fast only when necessary reduces TPR while maintaining reliability. Additionally, not being forced to return to the departure hub after delivery is shown to increase system performance on all indicators. Case-study results suggest that drones are superior in terms of reliability, speed of delivery, and emissions compared to cars. Additionally, we find that commonly accepted road transport TPR is at least as big as UAS-induced risk. Total UAS costs are small compared to the potential healthcare centralization cost savings enabled by such a delivery system. Our results suggest that a system in which healthcare facilities are concentrated at a few easily accessible locations, supported by a UAS, is compelling.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Loneliness, loss, and failure are common everyday experiences that every one of us goes through. However, many brush aside such ’emotional injuries’, or even make them worse, ’picking on their wounds’ by engaging in unhelpful coping strategies (Winch, 2013).<br/><br/>Because of our fundamental need to establish meaningful relationships, emotional injuries can be especially painful in our romantic lives. The rapid and often ’impersonal’ nature of modern online dating can enable frequent negative experiences; small rejections and heartbreaks that can negatively impact people’s self-esteem and well-being (Andrighetto et al., 2019; Her &amp; Timmermans, 2021).<br/><br/>Practicing emotional first aid can help to cope with the ’invisible’ pain of such small injuries and help to efficiently recover from them, building resilience that allows people to withstand life’s hardships (Winch, 2013). Designers can help people deal with these injuries by facilitating positive emotional experiences in human-product interactions. Positive design interventions focusing on resilience and self-compassion can contribute to emotion regulation, leading to improved personal and societal well-being (Gilbert &amp; Choden, 2014; Petermans &amp; Cain, 2019; Yoon et al., 2021).<br/><br/>Using a Research through Design approach, the project explored how designers can translate psychological techniques into tangible solutions and introduce positive psychology interventions for emotional injuries in the context of dating.<br/> <br/>Using a framework based on 7 everyday injuries outlined by Winch (2013), and the 13 fundamental needs theory of Desmet and Fokkinga (2020) a ’map of injuries’ and corresponding ’injury cards’ were developed based on a diary study with currently dating singles. The map and the cards discuss the triggers and the nature of the possible injuries in addition to the needs to be fulfilled by the design intervention. The map and the cards were used to generate design concepts, which were introduced to experts in social sciences and relationship studies during three separate sessions. Using sketches and short scenarios as prototypes for discussion, design objectives for providing emotional first aid were collected. These objectives are demonstrated in a final concept called ’Huggle’. <br/><br/>’Huggle’ is a physical tool and service directly offered by, and integrated into the online dating platform. The product is a collection of self-compassion prompts in the form of colourful acrylic pills wrapped in mycelium coating. The prompts allow people to practice self-compassion after a negative event, accepting and observing their feelings instead of turning to self-criticism and withdrawal. <br/><br/>Using the concept as a research tool during two evaluation studies with users has shown that tangible interventions for emotional first aid need to follow the main principles of flexibility, unobtrusiveness (intimacy), and simplicity. Creating product meaning through personalization and sparking interest and curiosity might help to entice repeated use, aiding reflection and learning. <br/><br/>The findings of this project can give foundation to future work in the area of designing psychological interventions in the domains of emotional first aid, coping, and emotion regulation.","emotional first aid; positive design; Research through Design; dating; coping; Design for Emotion; self-compassion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Further analysis of the robustness of the model shows that the model accuracy can be highly affected by changing channel conditions during training and testing.

Before being processed into various products, the incoming tuber batches are always washed and cleaned from waste particles like clods, stones and haulm. For this purpose washing lines consisting out of different machines are used. Every processing application, customer and kind of input product results in different requirements regarding the machines, options and their configuration. Currently for every customer a tailor made machine line is designed, consisting out of customised machines based on the expertise of the corresponding sales agent and the engineer that designs the machines. This results in individually designed machines, friction between different departments and mistakes in drawings, parts lists, manufacturing, documentation and others. Once installed on site, the machine line is controlled by machine operators that keep the factory operational but are not optimising the performance and efficiency of the machine line nor conduct preventive maintenance. To tackle both the issues on the company and the customer side, the strategy for designing these tuber washing lines has to be turned into adaptive machine line design. Adaptive machine line design is a combination of modular design and smart factory engineering. Machine lines are customer specifically configured out of standardised modules and controlled by smart systems to optimize performance and efficiency and predict maintenance.<br/><br/>Because potatoes are by far the most commonly processed product, followed up by carrots, this research focusses on potato washing lines with some specific side notes for processing carrots. Based on sales records and customer preferences, a set of standardised machine models and options is defined as the machine portfolio. This portfolio consists out of ten different machines, each available in different sizes, with waste and product streams to different directions and other standardised options. A jigsaw puzzle model can be made where this machine portfolio is build up as a set of puzzle pieces. For every different application a set of these puzzle pieces can be chosen from the portfolio and connected in different configurations. To determine which machines with which options to choose from the portfolio in which order, a model can be used. This model is based on a set of input- output relations and first set up as a decision scheme after which it is modeled in LabView as a basic machine line configurator. The model is then used to configure machine lines for five different examples. Each example is an existing order with differences in customer specific wishes, input and output characteristics and boundary conditions regarding factory layout and peripheral equipment. With help of these five examples the model is iteratively checked and improved after which the amount of customer specific engineering is determined that still needs to be performed after standardising of the machines. <br/><br/>A first layer of a Digital Twin for smart control of the washing line is designed. This control strategy is based on the Key Performance Indicators of the washing line and their relations between them. Based on open or closed loop control, a set of control schemes is created for each machine that requires smart control.<br/><br/>A thorough analysis of the costs and benefits of implementing a modular design strategy for the tuber washing lines shows that huge amounts of man hours can be saved after implementation. Next to these savings in labour, less mistakes will be made in the design and manufacturing of the machines which improves the professional image of the company and lowers friction between different departments and stress on the workfloor. Due to significant savings in replacing wear sensitive parts, reduced factory downtime, loss of product in waste streams and reduced operator wadges, installing a system for smart control can easily be earned back in the first year of operations. All and all changing the design strategy for tuber washing lines to adaptive machine line design is very promising for both the machine line manufacturer as for the customer.","modular design; smart design; processing lines; tuber washing; potatoes; adaptive machine lines","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-06-07","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Multi-Machine Engineering","","51.42749298674253, 4.350198959846201"

(graduation committee); Lottermoser, Bernd (graduation committee); Leveinen, Jussi (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Measuring and analyzing the tunnel deformation through convergence measurements and cross-correlation with geological mapping is essential for understanding and controlling tunnel stability, worker safety and predicting failure zones. In order to achieve this, a new device, the so-called GroundProbe GML is tested and analyzed in this study. Currently, the deformation in the Kristineberg mine is measured through conventional techniques, such as the tape extensometer, that are labor intensive and time-consuming. On top of that, the geological mapping is done by visual inspection by experienced geologists. There is no system in place that correlates the geological setting to the deformation of the tunnels. This research aims to explore the possibility to quantify tunnel wall convergence and correlate the movement to geological circumstances. An accuracy analysis is performed, to identify the accuracy of the Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology in comparison to conventional techniques. This analysis is conducted in both a controlled (above-ground) and an uncontrolled (underground) environment and focuses on the use of different targets, i.e. prisms or reflectors, and the difference between continuous and periodic measurements. The fresh rock surfaces are also mapped by means of geological LiDAR data as well as Red-Green-Blue (RGB) image analysis and this is correlated with tunnel wall convergence. This is done to increase the understanding of the impact of the geological setting on the tunnel wall convergence. <br/>The accuracy presented by GroundProbe of _3 mm for periodic measurements is difficult to achieve in an underground environment with mining activity. Especially the deformation of measurement points that are at a more oblique angle to the scanner prove to be difficult to assess. The geological LiDAR data can be used to distinguish different rock types and geological features with limited subjectivity. The transition zones from one rock type to the other become clearly visible from the geological LiDAR data. Additionally, geological features such as joints can be identified when combining LiDAR data with RGB image analysis. The primary promotor of tunnel wall convergence is the hanging wall that pushes down on the foot wall in combination with non-uniform waste rock areas, that are for example split into two sections by a joint. In a tunneling environment where mining activities are conducted, such as the application of shotcrete, scaling, blasting and leveling of the floor, periodic measurements with a LiDAR set-up on a tripod are difficult. One of the main limitations is the absence of stable reference points that the LiDAR scanner uses to determine its XYZ-position. The oblique angle can also be a limiting factor, measurement points closer to the LiDAR scanner provide more reliable results. For continuous measurements however, this proves to be less relevant because the repositioning error can be omitted. The LiDAR scanning technology has the potential to be used as geological mapping tool based on the varying reflectivities of different rock types. By combining LiDAR technology with RGB image analysis, a more thorough understanding of the geological setting can be obtained. By relating this understanding to the quantification of the tunnel wall convergence, this technique can be used to correlate the geology to the movement of the rock mass. <br","LiDAR; RGB; Tunnel wall convergence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences | European Mining Course","",""

To explore what caused users to lose motivation and how design can play a role to engage and motivate users to finish the Recharge week. <br/><br/>The project started with a literature research on Recharge and the integration of design on the topics motivation and engagement.

Bio-inspired soft robots use soft mechanical, structural or material components inspired from nature. The application of soft robotics can often be found on a small size scale but could also be beneficial on a larger size scale to manipulate larger objects and heavier objects. Manipulating large objects often requires many people working close to the object and gripper which can result in dangerous situations. Integrating soft robots can result in a improved safety during operation by preventing these accidents from happening. Also the flexible characteristics of these types of robots enables the manipulation of different types of objects. The main question this research answers is: What are the structural possibilities and limitations of bioinspired soft robots in break bulk manipulation? The objective of this research is to design and evaluate a<br/>bio-inspired soft robot that is able to manipulate break bulk. The soft robotic gripper is designed by using the double diamond design method and by using different concept generation and evaluation tools. Generating concept designs is done using a morphological chart and selecting the concept is done using a modified Harris Profile. The most promising conceptual design is then selected and developed in more detail in the preliminary design. This design explores the different shapes and size using bio inspired design and drawing inspiration fromthe trunk of an elephant as gripper. This design is then modelled on a small size scale as well as the large size scale and evaluated using a FEA and MBD. After several iterations the detailed design could be created. The design of the gripper uses shape memory alloy (SMA) as actuators integrated in segments as building blocks to shape the gripper. The model of the single SMA spring is first designed and evaluated using a FEA program on a small size scale to compare with the physical spring on the same size scale. This model of the spring resembles the physical spring deviating 1.6% with the reaction force of 6.75 N on the simulation and 6.88 N on the physical spring. For the upscaled model this results in a reaction force of 255 N. The next step is to use this reaction force and apply it to the segment where the SMA spring is replaced with this force to obtain the segment bending angle. This results shows the bending angle of the segment of 29 degrees for the single SMA spring actuation and 80 degrees for the two spring actuation at 50% of the actuation force. At 100% of the actuation force, these bending angles increase up to 74 degrees and 126 degrees respectively. Using this result the range of motion (RoM) can be determined and compared with the prototype. This result presents a similar behaviour of the model with a slight decreased performance of the prototype over the simulations. The prototype of the single gripper can be combined with other grippers and work together to manipulate larger, heavier and more complex shaped objects. Combining three of these small size trunk inspired grippers shows the capability to lift an avocado of 276 grams or 2.7 N. Scaling this load capacity to the upscaled gripper shows the load capacity of 10.4 kg or 102 N. Improving the design and performing more research in the different types of objects regarding size, shape, weight and surface roughness can be done to increase this load capacity. This gripper design presented in this research can be seen as the initial step in the automation of large object manipulation. Possible applications of upscaling the gripper can be found in the area of construction sites, offshore industry and space exploration.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Multi-Machine Engineering","",""

Commonly, atmospheric corrosion is affected by the electrochemical properties of the metal and environmental factors, such as humidity, temperature and the properties of the electrolyte on the metal surface. Currently, there still lack of laboratory studies which investigated the effect of changing electrolyte thickness on corrosion behaviours. In this study, a corrosion cell with adjustable electrolyte thickness was used to simulate the atmospheric corrosion process of carbon steel and zinc under thin-film sodium chloride electrolyte conditions. The effects of electrolyte thickness and chloride ion concentration on the atmospheric corrosion of these two metals were investigated by open circuit potential, polarization and galvanic coupling techniques. To perform the experiments under thin-film conditions a novel electrochemical cell was employed. Experiments confirmed the effect of electrolyte thickness on the corrosion rate of the metals. Particularly, it was established the role of oxygen transport in the kinetics of the process. At large electrolyte thickness (several hundred micrometers), oxygen is limited at the proximities of the metal, leading to corrosion rates comparable to the values under bulk electrolyte conditions. With the reduction of the electrolyte thickness, a higher concentration of oxygen is available, due to the faster oxygen equilibrium between air-electrolyte, leading to a substantial increase in both corrosion rate and the diffusion control limiting current. Corrosion current density under approximately 40μm thin-film electrolytes were two orders of magnitude higher than the currents measured for both carbon steel and zinc metals under immersed conditions (bulk electrolyte). The effect of chloride ion concentration on corrosion rate under thin-film electrolytes was also revealed. The higher solubility of oxygen on low chloride-concentration electrolytes showed also an acceleration of the process. Carbon steel and zinc metals presented the highest corrosion rates under 0.01M NaCl electrolyte with 40μm thickness.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

Optimal integrator settings are determined, which is in this case an eighth-order Runge-Kutta method (RK8). By setting the tolerance to the lowest possible value, the accuracy requirements are satisfied.<br/><br/>Furthermore, this thesis explores a different method of modeling DROs that makes use of Fourier series and polynomials, which had already been proposed by Hirani in 2006 for a different set of parameters. By exploiting explicit knowledge about the shape of DROs, this approach is made more efficient in terms of accuracy per Fourier/polynomial parameters needed and thus the computation time is enhanced.<br/><br/>The second part of this study addresses the stability of DROs. This is analyzed in order to get an idea of what DROs would be suitable for future missions. For mass ratios of primary and secondary that realistically occur in the Solar System, all DROs that are closer to the secondary than the primary turn out to be stable when disregarding perturbations. Perturbations are modeled as a constant external acceleration with a constant direction, which is only a first step towards modeling the Sun's and other planet's point mass gravity (p.m.g.), the solar radiation pressure (s.r.p.), and other perturbations, as they are usually depending on time and position. With this rough estimate, only the Sun's p.m.g. is identified as a possible source of instability for DROs in the Earth-Moon system, as all other perturbations are too small.","Astrodynamics; Orbit Design; Stability; Distant Retrograde Orbits; Modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This study focuses on understanding and addressing the interaction effects introduced by the nacelle through wing leading edge and nacelle modifications to increase the high angle of attack performance. This is achieved through the use of a RANS model that is validated using wind tunnel test data. Two methods are evaluated to improve the performance, leading edge droop and a nacelle wing junction fillet. While the droop was able to improve leading edge alignment and reduce the leading edge pressure peak it was not able to substantially improve performance. The fillet improved the junction flow, resulting in an increase in performance however neither modification alone offers complete a solution to the negative interaction effects.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

To successfully analyze the RSA images it is important to have a sufficient amount of visiblemarkers with an acceptable three-dimensional distribution.<br/>Objective: To provide insights on marker location distribution by developing a method to analyse marker placement based on visibility and accessibility.<br/>Method: Marker locations in RSA scenes of patients (N=25) from a previous study are used to assess marker placement and analyze marker density by performing a voxelization operation to divide the bone in a grid of 3x3x3mm<br/>bins. After spatial smoothing the hotspots with high marker fractions are determined and the four non-adjacent locations with the highest marker fraction are selected as the most favorable locations. Of these locations the distribution is analyzed by calculating the condition number (CN) of 1000 samples.<br/>Results: The locations of a total of 635 3D markers in the femur and 917 3D markers in the tibia were assessed. After voxelization, the average marker density of non-empty bins was respectively 3.1 and 4.3 markers per bin. The four selected locations had a 47 times higher marker fraction compared to the average bin in the femur and 66 times higher for the selected locations in the tibia. Their mean condition number was 49.1 for the femur and 68.2 for the tibia.<br/>Conclusion: The proposed method has proven to be sufficient for marker <br/>placement analysis. Placing the tantalum markers in the selected locations, which have a considerably higher marker contribution to the total amount of<br/>markers, would presumably increase the marker visibility during RSA and decrease patient exclusion due to an insufficient amount and/or distribution of visible markers.<br","osteoarthritis; RSA; Knee implant; unicompartmental knee arthroplasty; markers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Technical Medicine | Imaging and Intervention","",""

External towing tugs can be deployed to effectively reduce on-ground fuel burn of outbound aircraft. These new operations are likely to aggravate ground delays as a result of flow-disturbing uncoupling processes on taxiways or holding platforms. The size of these delays has not been previously investigated. The goal of this research is to analyse the impact of various uncoupling scenarios on ground delays. Scenarios are created by varying the uncoupling duration and the available uncoupling points. A computational model is created with Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (AAS) and Taxibot as reference airport and towing system. Vehicle-specific operations are optimised by a hierarchical multi-agent path planning algorithm. The algorithm comprises augmented versions of a Priority Based Search (PBS) algorithm and a Safe Interval Path Planning (SIPP) technique. Simulated conventional operations are compared with Taxibot-enabled operations for traffic samples corresponding to high traffic demands. Minor delays are found for inbound traffic. For outbound traffic, most delays occur during towing and are mainly determined by the arrangement of uncoupling points, the uncoupling duration, and the traffic demand. Delays are furthermore, but to a lesser extent, determined by the changed kinematics of aircraft towing and the runway’s position. Delays resulting from uncoupling only on taxiways or holding platforms vary per runway as a result of different arrangements in uncoupling points. For every arrangement of uncoupling points, the number of points and the presence of alternative paths around the points are key in mitigating delays resulting from long uncoupling processes. The intensity of delays can be reduced by tuning search objective settings in the algorithm, in particular for uncoupling points arranged in series.","Airport; Aircraft taxiing; Sustainability; Airport Operations; Delay management; Agent-based model; Multi-agent path finding; Engine-off taxiing; Taxibot; Hierarchical multi-agent path planning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-06-02","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Casali, Y. (graduation committee); Ziere, Thijs (graduation committee); van den Homberg, Marc (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA), a type of humanitarian aid consisting of giving money instead of products, is being used more frequently because of its effectiveness and efficiency in helping people in need (Cash Learning Partnership, 2020b). The debate on using CVA is currently focusing on improving the quality by better incorporating ’voices’ (needs and preferences) of recipients and by enhancing targeting. In targeting it is a major challenge to quickly identify the individuals and families with the biggest needs, given the lack of data (Aiken et al., 2021). Research on ways of measuring impact on and satisfaction of recipients combined with research on demographic and behavioural characteristics of recipients could lead to deeper insights in recipients of trackable CVA modalities (evouchers and ecash). This research uses the marketing literature on customer segmentation combined with machine learning algorithms to come up with an innovative new approach of categorizing recipients of evouchers, using the case of a Red Cross project on Sint Maarten. The main research question is: How can recipients of cash and voucher assistance be categorized using the field of consumer segmentation by using machine learning methods? The objective of this research is to come up with new methods to better understand recipients of CVA. Theories on customer segmentation pointed to the use of data-driven clustering methods to categorize consumers. Combined with a framework of recency, frequency and monetary aspects, recipients of evouchers could be categorized effectively. A required addition to this clustering method is to use a dimension reduction technique to avoid the negative consequence of the curse of dimensionality. Therefore, a two-step approach of dimension reduction and clustering has been applied in this research. It has been found in this research that a factor-cluster approach can lead to insightful clusters using geo-demographic data and behaviour data. Factor analysis has been used to reduce the dimensions while the k-prototype algorithm has been used to cluster into five distinct groups of recipients. The geo-demographic variables that were the most determining in characterizing distinct clusters consisted of: the age of the main beneficiary, the different household compositions and of a constructed factor ’big families and big receivers’. The most distinguishable variables on behaviour were: the number of supermarket visits (frequency), the time between the first voucher was received and the first transaction (recency) and the variables on the amount of money that was spent with the vouchers (monetary). To be able include the ’voice’ of recipients (needs and preferences), a connection between the registra tion data, behavioural data and survey data is needed. In this research only an exploratory connection could be established, due to the lack of a common identifier between the survey data and the other datasets. However, one crucial finding of this research is that it seems like the combination of these data sources can give meaningful insights in the needs, preferences and behaviour of households of Sint Maarten. With these insights specific clusters can be targeted for additional assistance, based on their needs. Recommendations for future studies include studying the validity of the found cluster results with different validation indices on cohesion and compactness, and by using simulations to determine the cluster stability. Before this factor-cluster approach can be deployed in CVA projects, more research on the treatment of limitations of this approach needs to be conducted. This is critical in communi cating the conditions and constraints of this model to humanitarian aid workers in the field. Another recommendation is to improve the design of surveys to measure the needs of recipients. For insightful factor-cluster results on the needs of recipients, survey data should be linked to geo-demographic and behaviour data. More research on including clusters in retargeting methods using feedback loops have a large potential in minimizing targeting errors and more effectively meeting the needs of recipients. With this research, the humanitarian sector can benefit from new ways to understand the needs of the most vulnerable in need. Decision-makers should build upon the feedback of recipients and move towards a new era of humanitarian assistance.","Clustering algorithms; K-prototype clustering; k-means clustering; Sint Maarten; Cash and voucher assistance; Humanitarian aid; Factor Analysis; customer segmentation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","","18.04248, -63.05483"

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Vibrotactile wearable devices are a non-intrusive and inexpensive means to provide haptic feedback directly on the user’s skin. These devices utilize one or multiple vibrotactile actuators to generate vibrations across the skin and into the tissue. Combining these vibrations in amplitude can create the illusion of a funneled sensation on the skin at another location than at the actual sites of stimulation. This allows for the placement of virtual actuators on the skin, such that fewer actuators need to be deployed. However, the illusion does not take into account that the waves originating from the actuator attenuate and disperse due to the viscoelastic properties of the skin. We hypothesize that this diffusion of the elastic energy in the skin is affecting the perception of this illusion. Therefore, if we correct for the wave propagation speed, and temporally focus the stimulation, we hypothesized that the specificity of the stimulation on the skin could be drastically improved. In this paper, a novel technique, which is named the inverse filter technique, was introduced that enables to focus the amplitude, frequency and phase of vibrations to one location while cancelling them at the remaining nearby positions. We developed a wearable device for the volar surface of the forearm on which we could independently control arbitrary waveforms at any position between a set of four physical actuators. A human-subject study found that the performance in terms of localization confidence was improved significantly, whereas the precision and accuracy of the task did not improve compared to when we did not correct for the wave attenuation and dispersion. These results show that focusing waves towards a target location has a direct influence on our confidence of localizing vibrotactile stimuli on the arm. Therefore, we anticipate that our findings can benefit industries interested in including localized vibrotactile feedback on the human body surface.","human-machine interaction; vibrotactile feedback; surface wave propagation; perceptual localization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-06-03","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Biomechanical Design | Haptic Interfaces","",""

This research presents a study on how regional airlines can strategically adapt to fleet replacement by not-yet-designed electrified aircraft. Earlier research shows interest in integrating strategic airline planning and aircraft design, but the design and operation of electrified aircraft are not yet considered. <br/>A methodology is presented to couple strategic airline planning and electrified aircraft design. In the strategic network and fleet planning model, the operation of electrified aircraft is considered. The electrified aircraft design is provided by the Initiator and aircraft configuration options by the Breguet Range equation. Based on current network information, this approach considers the adaptation of an airline on not-yet-designed electrified aircraft. Impacts on network performance, such as profit, CO2 emission and operating routes, as well as chosen aircraft are studied. <br/>In this thesis, the methodology is tested with a case study of the airline SATA Air Açores. The impact of replacing their current fleet with electrified aircraft on the network performance, development, and aircraft design choices is considered. Furthermore, the impact of airlines’ choices and external factors are evaluated. Under the assumptions, the adaption of electrified aircraft seems profitable for the airline and the CO2 emission is highly reduced.

However, possible issues related to certification requirements have been noted regarding longitudinal handling qualities at low speed, the pull-up manoeuver, and the flight path angle response. This study aims at investigating these issues by means of piloted simulations. With a mathematical model of the Flying-V based on the vortex lattice method, a preliminary off-line analysis of the handling qualities is conducted. A sensitivity analysis is considered over center of gravity position (forward, nominal, aft), approach speed (between 0.225 and 0.3 Mach), maximum deflection of the control surfaces (between 20 and 30 degrees), and flight control system (Direct Law or Pitch Rate Command). The piloted experiments, supported by the preliminary analytical assessment, show that the handling qualities provided by the current design of the Flying-V with Direct Law at 0.3 Mach are satisfactory with minor improvements related to aircraft responsiveness. For lower speeds (0.225 Mach), the handling qualities degrade due to a sluggish response, high compensation workload, insufficient control authority, insufficient sight angle, and tendency to pilot induced oscillations. Shifting the center of gravity away from the nose provides larger control authority at the expense of a minor reduction of responsiveness. Control augmentation proves very effective at improving the handling qualities. It is expected that the go-around certification standards will be satisfied, but approach speed will remain critical for controllability and safety.","Handling Qualities; Flying V; SIMONA; Piloted Experiment; longitudinal stability; longitudinal control; Low speed","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-06-02","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Predictions about the groundwater level can be made using a mathematical model. This model takes into account the precipitation and evaporation, the flux towards a deeper aquifer and flux to lateral open structures, with parameters for the different resistances and the storage. This model needs input data which is acquired from among others the KNMI (Koningklijk Nederlands Meteorologisch Instituut), with data about the groundwater level at the points of interest acquired from the measurements from the Water board Drenths Overijsselse Delta. The input from the model can be used to generate predictions, whilst the measurement data can be compare with the predictions to obtain more accurate predictions and calibrate the parameters in the model. Combining these factors can be done with the Kalman Filter, a mathematical tool from Data Assimilation which can be used to combine a Mathematical Model and Data into an optimal estimate. Furthermore, it is the wish to improve the parameters in the mathematical model, this causes the state to expand thereby enlarging the problem, and the parameters included in the state causes the problem to become non-linear. The Kalman Filter is only suitable for small linear models but an extension of the regular Kalman Filter can account for these problems, the Ensemble Kalman Filter. To apply all this information for groundwater modeling in a single location, first the numerical errors associated with the different model solutions are tested. It was found that a semi-analytical solution which assumed the input to stay constant over a day to produce the best result. After this the Kalman Filter is compared with the Ensemble Kalman Filter to see whether the Ensemble Kalman Filter can perform comparably in state estimation, it was found that en ensemble size of $n = 200$ this was the case. To test if the parameter calibration scheme works as desired and to test the quality of the parameters found, artificial data is created using the model with all parameters set to one. Then, the parameters are shifted to a different value and the parameter Ensemble Kalman Filter is used to try to find the original parameters back. It is found that in almost all cases the parameter calibration cause the parameter to change in the direction of one, within the first 2/3 months most change within the parameter takes place and the standard deviation of the parameters decreases. After this initial period the parameter remains more stable and the standard deviation changes little. Since the model uses multiple parameters for the resistances, the possibility of calibrating these separately was investigated. It was discovered that in the data usually one resistance parameter is lot smaller than the other, it was enough to calibrate only this parameter to account for the resistance. After this, the parameters in the model are calibrated with actual data. The model always becomes a lot closer to the measurements, and interestingly all parameter become larger than 1. Finally the quality of the predictions is tested. Here we saw that the quality improved fast, already 1/3th year was enough to find parameter far better than originally.","Groundwater; Ensemble Kalman filter; Calibration","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

This is a method based on the principle of virtual<br/>work. By minimizing the difference between the internal and external virtual work,<br/>the constitutive parameter(s) can be calculated. In this study, five atherosclerotic<br/>plaques were modeled with a neo-Hookean material model, subjected to intraluminal pressure in a Finite Element (FE) environment.

The method can be applied to numerically model the behaviour of thin cellular membranes, such as lipid bilayers. The membranes are represented by infinitely thin closed surfaces. Both the surface parametrization and analysis are based on state-of-the-art polar spline spaces. These spaces are defined such that a C1 continuous genus 0 surface can be constructed. At the discrete setting, point-wise conservation of mass is attained, using the framework of discrete exterior calculus. Therefore, the polar spline spaces are called divergence conforming. Time discretization of the highly non-linear system is done via the fixed-point iterations. It is found that for certain non-uniformly curved domains, the iterations converge and time stepping can be performed. However, for surfaces that are closely resembling a perfect sphere, the iterations are not stable for any ∆t. The solution is parameter-dependent and this indicates a possible bug in the Matlab code.","isogeometric analysis; discrete exterior calculus; Lipid membrane; divergence conforming; surface Stokes; fluid film; Polar spline spaces","en","master thesis","","","","","","Animation of the basic domain: https://youtu.be/YBrJwtOAqZ8 Gitlab project, containing the Matlab code that was used for this research: https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/hmverhelst/lipid-bilayers","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

(mentor); Hao, C. (mentor); Luime, Jolanda (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic inflammation disease that affects the joints and the skin, which can manifest in many ways and various severities. Psoriatic arthritis impacts the lives of patients in both physical and mental ways. This project focussed on how the patient experience can be improved of newly diagnosed psoriatic arthritis patients. The patient experience involves multiple things, including the hospital visits and life at home. For this project it was decided to focus on the context of home. To get the necessary insights into the disease and the experience of patients with psoriatic arthritis, the co-creation method was used. In this method, a small group of stakeholders are actively part of the complete project as experts. In this project, five PsA patients were included as experts of their own experiences. The literature study and explorative research done in this project showed the following thing about the patient experience of PsA patients: <br/><br/>- Most of the information and help that is available focusses on the physical difficulties that psoriatic arthritis causes, even though there are a lot of mental difficulties that currently get too little attention. <br/><br/>- There is a lot of information available that the patients only get when they look for it themselves. But especially right after their diagnosis, they have little to no idea of what is relevant and what they have to look for. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>With this knowledge, it was decided to focus on these mental difficulties that patients have. To do this, several group sessions together with the five participating patients were done. These sessions revealed that the diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis influences the perception of their identity as well as how they think others perceive them. The patients want to stay valuable and independent, where the psoriatic arthritis causes them to make changes in their daily life and become more dependable. This gives patients the idea that the psoriatic arthritis sometimes takes control over their life. This insight led to the design goal of the project, where the focus laid on empowering the patients to be in control of their own life again. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Together with the participant group, various design directions were explored and evaluated with help of various prototypes. This eventually resulted in the final design: The PEPSA journal. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>The PEPSA journal is a service that provides the user with journal pages that focus on several aspects of life and psoriatic arthritis. The journal makes a distinction between standard material, which is relevant for everyone and focus topics, which allow the user to personalize their journal and make it more fitting to their life and what they think is relevant. Through positively formulated questions about each topic the users are encouraged to think about the various aspects of their life and psoriatic arthritis and how they relate to and influence each other. In this way the PEPSA journal allows the user to get more insights into their situation and get a clearer view of their life with psoriatic arthritis, putting them back in control. <br/><br","Psoriatic arthritis; Patient Experience; Empowerment; Wellbeing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction | Medisign","",""

(mentor); Banen, Benny (mentor); Anink, Simon (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Urgent action is needed to decrease maritime emissions. The renewable wind energy sector must also decrease its life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Total GHG emissions from offshore wind turbines are approximately 120% more compared to onshore wind turbines. Moreover, it is estimated that Walk to Work (W2W) vessels are responsible for 3.3% of the total life cycle emissions of offshore wind turbines. Especially during operation and maintenance (O&amp;M), there are no substantial emissions other than those caused by marine support. This research investigates the technical and economical feasibility of a zero-emission W2W vessel during its operational life. W2W vessels use dynamic positioning (DP), a motion compensated gangway, and a motion compensated crane to transfer technicians and cargo to offshore structures to enable them to perform installation, commissioning, and O&amp;M.<br/><br/>This research has used literature research to collect data, insights on W2W vessels, insights on the offshore wind market, and information on alternative energy carriers. Furthermore, a parametric model is written to test the technical feasibility and the Robust Decision Making (RDM) method is used to test the economical feasibility.<br/><br/>The building rate of new offshore wind farms (OWF) is expected to quadruple by 2030, wind turbines are increasing in size and height, and OWFs are expected to move further offshore. These three expected trends imply a higher demand for W2W vessels and require adaption of the specifications of the vessel and mission equipment. The operational profile of the W2W vessel is unique due to its high operational mode in DP, which is usually 90% to 98%. Additionally, the fuel tanks of the W2W vessels are excessively large for the required autonomy of 2 to 4 weeks.<br/><br/>Characteristics including life cycle emissions, (future) price development, energy density, and social perspective are used to select hydrotreated vegetable oil as a blend-in fuel, compressed or liquid cryogenic hydrogen, methanol, ammonia, and batteries as potential alternative energy carriers. All of them have a lower contained energy density compared to fossil fuels, leading to increased space requirements. Alternative energy carriers are also more expensive today, but energy prices are expected to decrease, while fossil fuel prices are expected to increase.<br/><br/>A parametric model has been developed and applied to 18 configurations between energy converters, energy carriers, and autonomy duration. The model takes a base case and estimates required energy, volume for storage, length, width, weight, draught, and power for DP operations. It has been concluded that all 18 configurations are technically feasible.<br/><br/>An RDM is performed to test the economical feasibility of the 18 configurations among 13122 different futures based on the formulated uncertainties (energy carrier price, energy carrier availability, annual utilisation of a W2W vessel, day rate, CAPEX, and OWF to port sailing distance) and a potential carbon tax (CT). Results are evaluated for profit (NPV), operational uptime, and emissions per wind turbine connection. First, it has been concluded that batteries and compressed hydrogen are highly unlikely to be feasible options because of their low operational uptime. Secondly, a fuel cell running on either liquefied hydrogen or methanol, is unlikely to make profit. Third, it is highly likely that a single fuel green ammonia ICE configuration will be the most profitable among green alternative energy carriers. Fourth, single fuel green methanol ICE configurations could be profitable but are less likely to be profitable than ammonia under the assumptions made. Lastly, for an average LSMGO price (Nov 2018 - Nov 2021), a high CT is unlikely to make alternative energy carriers more profitable than LSMGO.<br/><br/>The ammonia ICE configuration seems the most robust option for zero-emission W2W vessels, but it requires a nuance. To safely operate W2W vessels running on ammonia, safety needs to be addressed more. Because of its toxicity, the on board systems need to be carefully designed for this, regulations are lacking, and passengers and crew need to be comforted with the safety of ammonia. If a vessel owner wants to invest today, in a single-fuel converter, an ICE with LSMGO leads to most profit, HVO gives a mix between profit and less emissions, or methanol gives no emissions but a risk on the profit side.<br/><br/>The end product of this research is the developed model, which allows for changed input for the variables. In due course, when more accurate information becomes available, the assessment and evaluation can be redone quickly. Hence, decision making can be done easier and faster.","Zero-emission; Technical feasibility; Methanol; Ammonia; hydrogen; Batteries; Economic feasibility; Offshore; Offshore Wind; Renewable energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design","",""

(mentor); Djanashvili, K. (graduation committee); van Steijn, V. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","166Ho is a promising radionuclide for targeted radionuclide therapy, because of its beneficial decay characteristics and the possibility to track its dose delivery in a patient. However, a problem for the use of 166Ho in these treatments is its limited maximally produced specific activity in neutron irradiation of a pure 165Ho target, since the produced 166Ho is chemically inseparable from the 165Ho target. The Szilard-Chalmers method is known to be able to increase the achieved specific activity. It does so by irradiating the target isotope while it is incorporated in a compound. As the target isotope undergoes (n, γ) neutron capture it forms the product isotope and escapes the compound due to recoil from prompt gamma emissions. Then by separating the product isotopes from the compound, which still contains the target isotopes, a high specific activity can be achieved. However, batch irradiations using the Szilard-Chalmers method for production of high specific activity gives low production yields. In order to increase these production yields, a continuous flow Szilard-Chalmers system is proposed. The objective of this research is to investigate the main processes at play in a continuous flow system using the Szilard-Chalmers method on 165HoDOTAfor the production of high specific activity 166Ho. Investigations on the labelling of Ho3+ to DOTA4- have shown that 96±3 % labelling efficiency is achievable. Experiments on relabelling and isotope-exchange have shown that less than 8 % of 166Ho3+ undergoes relabelling with DOTA4- or isotope-exchange with 165HoDOTA-. Also, a cation exchange separation method for separation of Ho3+ from DOTA4- and HoDOTA- was developed. Moreover, investigations on Szilard-Chalmers separation of a dried 165HoDOTAsample have shown that with a 4-minute irradiation it was possible to achieve a specific activity of 2.8±0.2 MBq mg-1 . This corresponds to an enrichment factor of 1.62±0.03 compared to an irradiation without Szilard-Chalmers separation. Decreased radiolysis by shielding and slowed neutrons, and increased initial labelling are expected to be able to increase the achieved enrichment factor even more. The continuous flow Szilard-Chalmers system could in potential prove very useful in high specific activity radionuclide production, but further improvements on its subprocesses are necessary before practical implication is worthwhile.","Szilard-Chalmers; radionuclides; continuous flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
