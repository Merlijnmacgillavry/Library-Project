These parameters are expressed in a Site index, which is determined for some specimen that are analysed for density and strength characteristics (Chapter 2). An attempt is made to find a relation between this Site index and the strength of the specimen. The result of this analysis is projected on a viewing platform that was designed for the CONIFERS project. This platform is analysed in a model for different situations that might occur, based on low stiffness values of one or more elements (Chapter 3). Finally, the block shear joint that was used and designed for this viewing platform is tested for moment capacity (Chapter 4). The desrcibed connection system for round wood is patented. A copy is given in Appendix 9. All appendices are shown in the part “Appendices” of this report. In this part “Analysis”, only the “List Of Terms” and “Literature“ are given.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","","",""

For each of these protection systems an analysis will be made; this analysis will be used to come up with possible alternatives for solving the problems. These alternatives are elaborated to some extent to be able to make a good comparison and afterwards a choice of which alternative is favorable. The chosen alternative will be worked on in more detail in the last stage of the project; the results will be presented in the final report. The set-up of this interim report is as follows: the second chapter contains a revised version of the plan of approach, which gives the background information and the goals of the project. Using these goals the program of requirements is formulated in chapter three. In chapter four a concept of how to deal with the primary and secondary protection is chosen; in the two following chapters (five and six) the primary and secondary alternatives are elaborated. Chapter seven deals with the solutions for the tertiary protection system. All is brought back together again in the final chapter, the conclusion. This conclusion will be the starting point for the next phase.","New Orleans; dike; levee; hurricane","en","student report","TU Delft, Department Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","30.027902, -90.092013"

Indien een bovenbelasting op het maaiveld wordt aangebracht, die niet oneindig uitgestrekt is, ontstaan over relatief korte afstanden in horizontale richting spanningsverschillen in de ondergrond. Als gevolg hiervan treden in minder stevige gronden naast verticale grondverplaatsingen ook belangrijke horizontale grondverplaatsingen op. Bestaande en nieuwe palen in de omgeving ondervinden hierdoor horizontale belastingen waardoor buigende momenten en dwarskrachten in palen ontstaan. De belasting op de paal ontstaat doordat de paal, die stijver is dan de grond, de vervorming van de grond slechts gedeeltelijk volgt. Door deze belastingen kunnen de palen ontoelaatbare scheurvorming vertonen of bezwijken, hetgeen ongewenst is. De hoofddoelstelling van dit onderzoek is het ontwikkelen van een zo eenvoudig mogelijke standaard rekenmethodiek voor het berekenen van door grond horizontaal belaste palen en het toetsen en valideren daarvan aan de hand van praktijkmetingen.","","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geotechnology","","Geo-engineering","",""

An example is the Wadden coast of The Netherlands, Germany and Denmark. These coasts consist of barrier islands separated by tidal inlets with at the landward side tidal basins.Characteristic for the Wadden Sea is that the tidal basins are not completely separated,but are connected via topographic highs allowing exchange of water between the basins. As a result the tidal inlets that connect the basins to the North Sea will interact. The focus in this thesis is on the effect of this interaction on the cross-sectional equilibrium and stability of tidal inlets that are part of a double inlet system. The knowledge gained in this study will help to develop rational management plans for this kind of system. In determining the equilibrium values and stability of cross-sectional areas of the inlets use is made of flow diagrams. A flow diagram consists of the equilibrium flow curves of each inlet and a flow field showing the adaptation of the inlet cross-sections after the system has been removed from equilibrium. Each intersection of the equilibrium flow curves represents a stable or unstable equilibrium. The equilibrium flow curve for each inlet is the locus of the values of the cross-sectional areas for which the velocity amplitude in the inlet equals the equilibrium velocity i.e. approximately 1 m/s according to ESCOFFIER [1940]. As a start the double inlet system is schematized as a basin connected to the ocean by two channels. The water surface area of the basin is assumed constant and water levels are assumed to fluctuate uniformly. On the seaward side a simple harmonic, semidiurnal tide is used to force the system. Analyzing the double inlet system under these conditions by means of the flow diagrams leads to the conclusion that a stable equilibrium of the two inlets does not exist. Ultimately only one inlet remains open and the other will close. This confirms the earlier conclusions of VAN DE KREEKE [1990] and BORSJE [2003] concerning the cross-sectional stability of multiple inlet systems.","Delft Cluster; CT05.20; Noordzee & kust; CT05.24.11; morfodynamiek van Noordzee en kust en kustverdediging; barrier island coasts; wadden coast; tidal inlets; North Sea; double inlet system; flow diagram; van de Kreeke; Borsje; hydrodynamics","en","master thesis","TU Delft; Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, section Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor); Van Hooft, J. (mentor)","2006","Malignant colonic obstruction is a severe complication of primary colorectal carcinoma. Patients presenting this clinical condition develop tumors that obstruct the lumen of the intestinal tract. The treatment of this medical complication is aimed to re-establish the normal pass of fecal mass through the colon. One of the current treatments includes the insertion of a self-expandable meshed metal tube (stent) along the obstruction. By deploying the stent, the obstruction is opened, allowing the passage of fecal mass. Despite its advantages, stent placement is associated with a number of medical complications. The literature shows that colonic stent migration is the most common stent related medical complication. This paper studies the factors that influence colonic stent migration and explores new possibilities to anchor a colonic stent to the bowel. In vitro experiments show that providing the colonic stent with an appropriate fixation mechanism, decreases the chance of colonic stent migration. The results suggest that the friction forces in the interface between the stent and the colonic wall increases, if the stent is provided with a fixation mechanism.","stent migration; fixation mechanism; microhooks; friction force","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomechanical Engineering","","","",""
