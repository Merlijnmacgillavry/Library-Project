(mentor); Meenderinck, C. (mentor); Van Genderen, A. (mentor)","2010","Current trends in computer architecture focus on multicore platforms. The target of these new platforms is to scale the performance of the system with the number of cores. However, the performance of current archictectures is limited due to thread-level parallelism overhead and programmability. StarSS is a task-based programming model that eases the programmability of multicores and tries to exploit functional parallelism within applications. However, the performance of StarSS does not scale efficiently for fine-grained tasks, as for such tasks the task management overhead becomes significant in comparison to the execution of the tasks. Nexus is a dynamic hardware support system that aims to alleviate the current overhead of StarSS, by offloading the dependency resolution process and the synchronization with the cores to hardware. In this work, we implement Nexus by defining and connecting the new hardware in a Cell archictecture simulator. The scalability, performance, and throughput of the implementation are evaluated for different task sizes and number of cores, using several dependency patterns. Furthermore, different configuration parameters are evaluated, such as the dimension of the new hardware inserted in the existing architecture. Results show a large improvement of the scalability offered by Nexus in comparison with StarSS, especially for fine-grained tasks. Nexus succeeds at alleviating the overhead of StarSS by accelerating the dependency resolution process and the synchronization with the worker cores. Furthermore, the evaluation of the Nexus system dimensions has shown that its scalability decreases slightly with its area.","H.264; multicore; scalability; cell; simulator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-12-06","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engeneering","","Embedded Systems","",""

(mentor)","2010","The goal of this study is to understand how people experience interest in human-product interaction and how a product can be designed to elicit interest. The appraisal structure of interest proposed by Silvia (2005) was used as a theoretical base of this study. He proposed that two appraisal components, novelty-complexity and coping potential, are required to evoke interest. In the exploratory study phase, it is found that experiences of interest take place in passive interaction and active interaction: when people noticed or observed a product, and when they actually explored and used the products. The sub-questions, raised when people appraise novelty-complexity and coping potential were collected during the exploratory study. The exploratory study identified that each interaction type involves different kinds of sub-questions of novelty-complexity appraisal and coping potential appraisal. In various design case studies, function of novelty is generally well established as an important condition for evoking interest. However, it has not yet been studied if coping potential is a key component for eliciting interest in human-product interaction. Based on the collected sub-questions of appraisal components of interest, three prototypes of an interactive music player were designed with the intention to manipulate a level of interest in both passive and active interaction. Three variants of the prototype are made be identically novel, but have different levels of coping potential. The prototypes were tested with 50 participants. The test of prototypes proved that satisfying or violating the sub-questions of the appraisal components can differentiate a level of coping potential and novelty-complexity, and accordingly, it influenced on level of interest. Therefore, design for interest can be approached by activating novelty-complexity and coping potential, and this approach can be reformulated in terms of designing a product that satisfies (or violates) the sub-questions of appraisal components of interest. The test result showed that correlation of coping potential with interest was significant and stable across the prototypes, which means that coping potential is essential for evoking interest. The strongest correlation for interest was with novelty-complexity. Perceived annoyance was inversely proportional to the level of interest and perceived coping potential. It can be interpreted that novelty-complexity is not enough to elicit interest if there is lack of coping potential.","interest; emotion; appraisal","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

The goal of this project is to identify and create tools to improve the communication over distances for the USAR.nl organisation, a special rescue team that will be dispatched to disaster areas. The system has been designed using the Situated Cognitive Engineering (sCE) method, consisting of three different phases. In the first phase a domain and support analysis has been done, to identify operational demands, human factor issues and technological possibilities. The second phase consists of identification of the SAInT requirements of our system. In the third phase a prototype has been developed, consisting of three different tools. This is an iterative process where requirements are specified and prototypes are made and reviewed. Based on these reviews, the requirements are refined. We have developed three different tools. One of these tools is an iPhone application, which will be used by the commander of a search and rescue team. This application will allow him or her to enter and view information about victims and dangerous areas on a map. Detailed information such as text and photos can also be added to these victims and dangers. Another tool has been created on the iPad, which is use by the operational commander and a technical worker of the support group. The commander is provided with the information entered on the iPhone, as well as statistics of each search and rescue team. The technical worker has access to detailed information about equipment. Each piece of equipment can be uniquely identified by its RFID-tag. The third developed tool, an RFID-application, uses these RFID-tags. This tool can be used to check items in and out of the base camp. This can be seen on the iPad, to track the movement of equipment during a mission. The created systems could still be improved by adding more functionality focused on communication between different members of the organisation, such as a message system, or adding new options for equipment management. This will decrease the dependence on older methods or less optimal systems.","USAR; SAInT; USAR.NL","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Man-Machine Interaction","","","",""

The full body motion is split in a task and compensation motion. The task motion can be generated in advance, while the compensation motion is obtained during execution of the task. We show that the compensation motion can be obtained by making use of the linear relation between the joint velocities and the linear momentum of the complete robot. A setpoint for the linear momentum is generated by making use of the error between the current Capture Point and the desired Capture Point location. We have implemented the control algorithm in simulation as well on a real humanoid robot. We were able to create stable full body motion for a bending forward task. It turns out that the control algorithm to create stable full body motion is insensitive for model errors in the internal model of the robot.","full body motion; humanoid","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-11-05","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BMechE","","BMD","",""

(mentor)","2010","Most digital circuits use a clock signal to synchronize operations, the so called synchronous circuits. Although this clock signal makes the design convenient, especially since practically all commercial EDA tools assume a synchronous design, some advantages can be exploited when using asynchronous circuits; circuits without clock signal. Those advantages can include typical case performance, low power consumption, less sensitive to variability, lower EMI admittance and protection against differential power analysis attacks. Disadvantages of asynchronous circuits include the lack of EDA tools, their sensitivity to hazards and in some cases performance loss. In this thesis, an asynchronous implementation for a scheduled data flow graph is proposed. This type of circuit contains a lot of operations with different latencies. Thus, the faster operations are delayed by the clock signal in the synchronous case. Performance benefits could be gained when using asynchronous circuits instead of a clock signal. In this case, handshake signals are used to indicate the completion of an operation, instead of a clock signal. An asynchronous LWDF filter is synthesized. This implementation is analyzed and an optimized implementation is proposed. A complete design flow is created to generate an asynchronous circuit from any given data flow graph.","asynchronous; clockless; data flow graph; controllers; handshaking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-11-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Circuits and Systems","","Microelectronics","",""

Most of the current building stock is developed as mono-functional buildings to fulfil the demand at a particular moment. They are not designed for the lifespan in which they are functional. Because of their shortcomings in adaptability they are more likely to become vacant as we see in the current Dutch office stock. Due to the constantly changing requirements, needs and wishes of the client/market, projects can become unfeasible or vacant during their lifespan. If we continue to develop buildings as we did in the past decades then we will remain with the same or even a bigger amount of vacancy in the future. Only if we start considering the total lifecycle of building / areas already from the initiative phase then we can react on this problem. Only in this way we can be really sustainable. The current construction industry needs a method based on a lifecycle focus to tackle this vacancy problem and in this way making the new to be developed real estate sustainable. To fulfil this aim the following research question was formulated: To what extent and in which way can a process approach based on lifecycle focus optimize a building to make it react on changes during its lifespan? During our research we noticed that there are already many existing principles based on lifecycle focus like: Drager & Inbouw, Lean Construction, Solids. These theories are mainly focused on technical, organizational, functional and architectural aspects of flexibility and sustainability. But they mostly lack in a holistic process approach towards lifecycle focus in real estate, which embodies the process from initiative until demolition. According to this literature studies a process approach was gradually redesigned and tested on our own design project for architecture. We graduated on a HighRise design for the Schiekadeblok in Rotterdam. This design project was used as a test and example of how the research results could be implemented in a design process. Also the critics from actors in practice helped to shape this process approach. In spite of this the process approach has undergone several changes throughout our graduation period. Beside the products for Real Estate & Housing and Architecture a Strategic Manual was created as a final combined product. The Strategic Manual will be published during the spring of 2011. This manual guides the user, question based, through the design process. In every phase the client is made conscious about his decisions in relation to flexibility / sustainability and the impact on technical / financial feasibility. The manual uses flexibility as a foundation on which sustainability can ‘evolve’. Finally, the manual makes us consciousness about the way we build today and its impact on our ‘City of Tomorrow’. Yet, the following and inevitable step is to be taken. In cooperation with project management office Draaijer+Partners we will test the Strategic Manual on projects in practice in combination with a PHD on the same subject at Delft University of Technology.","Flexibility; Sustainability; Lifecycle focus; Evolve; City of Tomorrow; Process Approach; Holistic; Material; Energy; Information; Flows; Tall; High Rise; Skyscraper; Rotterdam; Schiekadeblok; Mixuse; Adaptability; Future; Changes; React; Market; Client; Question based; Strategic; Manual; Foundation; Biomimicry; Drager en Inbouw; Solids; Lean; IFD; I3con; Open Building","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-11-10","Architecture","Architecture and Real Estate & Housing","","Hybrid / TALL Buildings and Design & Construction Management","",""

It explains the importance of coastline in urban development and for human beings. Previous practices of coastal extension in different parts of the world and related literature are studied. The thesis investigates the social, economic and environmental effects of manmade island and peninsula construction on marginal and leading edge coasts. Then the thesis sets forward guidelines that increase feasibility and decrease failure mechanisms of such coastal structures. The results are revealed, and the conclusion that Coastal Extension via Manmade Islands and Peninsulas lead to a significant improvement on the coastal zone are discussed. This thesis introduces the subject of Extension of Coastline and outlines two major coastal extension types: Manmade Island and Manmade Peninsulas. The thesis aims to review the related literature and previous practices regarding the coastal extension. Then the thesis inductively comes up with guidelines which increase the feasibility, sustainability and decrease failure mechanisms of such coastal structures. The method adopted consists of literature review in the subject, case studies of economic, social and environmental, functional and engineering aspects. Then the thesis sets forward guidelines that increase feasibility and decrease failure mechanisms for implementation of such projects in the future. In design critical factors such as profile, slope, height, and width were defined and their interconnections were outlined. These parameters were further investigated with reference to the literature. Then planning and economic guidelines were introduced for successful implementation of the project. Today, the world is facing a rapid increase in human population. Moreover the majority of the cities in the world are situated in coastal zones. In facing all these problems, one possible solution is Extension of Coastline by Manmade Islands and Peninsulas. In order to find out an answer to the research question “Is extension of coastline by manmade islands and peninsulas feasible in different parts of the world?” the following effort is implemented. (1) Literature is reviewed regarding coastal extension, including coastal engineering, soil mechanics, different types of coastal zones, failure mechanisms of earth structures, hydraulic structures, previous examples of coastal extension, uncertainties in the coastal design and climate change. (2) Engineering, economical, social, functional and environmental aspects of coastalextension by manmade islands and peninsulas are investigated. (3) After the pros and cons of the manmade islands and peninsulas are clearly understood, the focus shifts to the design and guidelines in building these structures. Methods minimize the disadvantages and maximize the advantage are analyzed and proposed. (4) Findings are further analyzed and concluded. The findings mentioned and parameters introduced are powerful tools for the overall assessment regarding the applicability of the project. Additionally, this thesis is a starting point for researchers who would like to further investigate the topic in the future.","coastline; manmade islands; manmade peninsulas; coastal extension","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

(mentor); Bijleveld, S.W. (mentor)","2010","Inner city railway yards disrupt the urban functioning of inner city areas and these inner city railway yards do not exploit the full development potential of these inner city areas. To solve this problem the following main question needs to be answered: “Which transformation possibilities give a feasible result for the transformation of inner city railway yards into multifunctional inner city living areas?” In order to answer the main research question three end products are created: 1. A calculation tool specific for railway areas based on feasibility to support the decision making on the transformation of inner city railway yards; 2. A method to create a transformation variant for inner city railway yards which gives the best result on the feasibility. The calculation tool is used to generate this product; 3. An overview of feasibility factors, which are factors influencing the feasibility of the transformation of inner city railway yards into multifunctional living areas. The developed calculation tool and the method are used to create this overview. A railway yard, in this research, indicates a complex series of railway tracks for storing, sorting and loading or unloading, railway cars and locomotives which can be moved form an inner city location into the periphery, because it lost its function. When transforming railway yards, NS Poort is most likely to be involved, because of the relation between NS Poort and ProRail. NS Poort has the first right of refusal on land of ProRail. This way NS Poort is the largest land owner in these areas. In order to create the calculation tool which can be used for judging the feasibility of the transformation of rail way yard areas, theory is studied. Based on this theory RICARDO is chosen as the base of the calculation tool, because it complies with most of the demand set for the calculation tool. But RICARDO needs to be adjusted in three ways in order to be adjusted to the characteristics of these transformations. First, the design part of RICARDO is adjusted to environmental regulations. The design part has to offer the opportunity to enter the regulations which have a significant influence, regulations on sound and external safety. Second, the calculation part is replaced in order to adjust the tool to the two characteristics of this special type of urban area development, time and high land development cost. Third, the output of the tool is adjusted to give a clear image of the financial as well as the qualitative feasibility the variant delivers. Therefore, the output has to be able to judge the following feasibility indicators: 1. Financial feasibility: The Main variant has to be as financial feasible as possible; 2. Urban type: The Main variant has to have a urban type like the reference railway area; 3. Green: The Main variant has to be as green as a the reference railway areas; 4. Parking: The Main variant has to have a parking ratio matching the reference railway areas; 5. Function mix: The Main variant has to be a multifunctional living area. The first end product, the developed calculation tool consists of two parts, a design part and a calculation part. The output of the design part is the input for the calculation part. The tool needs to be filled with input. The input of the tool consists of data and variables. The output of a calculation is as reliable as the less reliable input. To increase the reliability of the output of the tool an expert team is included, which performs a final check on the input. The design part of RICARDO is adjusted in a way that environmental data creates zones indicating the developable area, the areas with extra costs and the area with a lost of design flexibility, as well as a maximum density. In order to implement the influence of these zones in the tool the overlap of a zone with the design, entered on a map using real estate variables, is calculated. The output of the design part is the amount of Gross Floor Area (GFA) per function and the effects of the different zones on this GFA. Second, the calculation part of RICARDO is replaced with a new developed calculation part. The land value will be the base of the calculation part. The financial feasibility is calculated as the balance between the residual land value and a value based land value. The most important difference is the calculation of the real estate value using an NPV-method, in order to implement time. The calculation part calculates the feasibility based on the output of the design part and the operational data. Third, in order to be able to judge next to the financial, the qualitative feasibility the output of the tool is adjusted. The tool is adjusted in a way that the output of the tool can indicate the qualitative feasibility indicators, using indexes and ratios. The Spacemate program is used to give an overview of the urban type. The research shows that these three adjustments of the tool have a significant added value. The second end product, the method to create a feasible transformation variant is developed using a variant study on the location Zutphen. The method gives a description of the actions that need to be taken to create a feasible Main variant using the developed calculation tool. In the variant study three sub variants are used to determine the characteristics of the Main variant. These three sub variants cover a functional range from a social variant to a profit variant. Based on the strengths of these three sub variants a feasible Main variant was developed. A scenario analysis shows that the Main variant is durable. Also this variant study of Zutphen led to an overview of feasibility factors, the third end product. Conclusions are drawn on the influence of the real estate variables on the financial and qualitative feasibility of the variants. In general the feasibility is influenced by the real estate function. The urban type is also influenced by the building height. But, different real estate types create contradicting results on the financial and qualitative feasibility. To achieve an optimal and feasible Main variant, it was concluded that the function mix is the most important variable. Next, the general applicability of the developed calculation tool and the method is tested on two other locations, Amersfoort and Nijmegen. On these two locations, a Main variant was created using the developed calculation tool and the method. The research concludes that the developed tool needs to be adjusted in order to calculate the overlap between the environmental zones which restrict the development of residential real estate. The method also needs to be adjusted for this overlap. Further, the input of the railway infrastructure in the method has to be changed and a check of the Main variant with the market research needs to be added. With these adjustments the calculation tool and the method are general applicable. The applicability check also led to another feasibility factor: the ratio between the railway yard and the development area. This was also tested. In the research it was concluded that a decrease of the ratio between the railway yard and the development area increases the feasibility of the land development. The conclusions of the research are: 1. The developed calculation tool, the method and the feasibility factors can be used to create a feasible variant; 2. The calculation tool and the method can be seen a general applicable; 3. The adjustments to the tool for the specific characteristics have a significant added value: a. The implementation of environmental regulations in the design part has a significant effect on the design; b. The implementation of a NPV-method to calculate the real estate value in the calculation part offers the best opportunity to implement time in the real estate value; 4. The adjustment of the output of the tool creates the ability to judge the feasibility, which in this research is indicated as a balance between financial and qualitative feasibility: a. Financial feasibility is defined as the balance between the residual land value and a value based land value; b. Qualitative feasibility is defined using demand on the urban type, green, parking and function mix and is judged using indexes and ratios; 5. There are two important factors influencing the feasibility: a. The function mix is the most important real estate variable influencing the feasibility, because the function mix creates a balance between the contradicting effects of the other real estate variables; b. Decreasing the ratio between the railway yard and the development area increases the feasibility. Base on these conclusions some recommendation can be made: 1. The ratio between the railway yard and development area needs further research. 2. The link between the presence of a living area close to the railway station and the amount of railway passenger on this railway areas needs further research; 3. The interface of the tool needs professionalization if the tool will be used in a professional context; 4. The insights on qualitative feasibility can be optimized by increasing the amount of reference projects for the qualitative feasibility; 5. Increase the reference database in Spacemate to make more specific references on the urban type.","Transformation; Railway yards; Feasibility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-10-30","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","Urban Area Development","",""

(mentor)","2010","For real-time streaming applications such as video decoding, the rate of the application is very important. To fully use the available resources of an multiprocessor platform, thus achieve a high rate, the applications have to be scheduled efficiently. We assume a composable multiprocessor, which means that applications on the platform are independent both in functional and temporal behaviour. Prior work provides composability for the processor utilising two levels of scheduling: composable application-level scheduling with Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) and task-level scheduling with an arbitrary scheduler. In this thesis we are concerned with efficient task-level scheduling. We compare two existing schedulers: Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) and Credit-Controlled Static-Priority (CCSP). TDM is simple and couples latency and rate; CCSP originates from memory controllers and decouples latency and rate. To compare these schedulers we create a dataflow graph of the scheduled application and calculate the parameters that result in the maximum rate. Then these parameters are assessed in experiments on a MPSoC implemented on an FPGA. From the results of our investigation we can draw two important conclusions. The first is that the formal models of the schedulers lack accuracy in predicting the latency of a task. This is visible in our experiments with buffer bounded applications. The second conclusion is that CCSP schedules tasks more efficiently than TDM. When the period for TDM is exactly proportional to the execution times of the tasks and the application is not buffer bound, then TDM can equal the performance of CCSP.","composable; scheduling; multi-processor; TDM; CCSP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-11-03","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Master Embedded Systems","",""

In the past problem areas, which cause hindrance for navigation and block the fairway, were prevented with structural measures. Dredging was used as a last resort. In 2005 the desired fairway depth was increased from BRV -2,5m to BRV -2,8m which changed the role of dredging in the maintenance of the fairway. The dredging of the fairway is now executed through a performance-based contract. Today dredging is seen more as a permanent measure and is constantly used to maintain the fairway. In the last hundred years an increasing number of measurements have been executed on the river Waal and have been stored in databases. This data is currently hardly used for the day-to-day maintenance of the river system. This research aims at gaining more insight in the dredging efforts needed to maintain the fairway using the available data from Rijkswaterstaat. Former dredging contracts as well as the currently used performance-based contract were studied in order to get a better understanding of the efforts needed to maintain the fairway for navigation. It was tried to deduce a relation, between the discharge hydrograph and the efforts that are needed to maintain the fairway, in order to obtain an indication of the consequences of expected future changes to the river system. The expected future changes which were studied in this research are changing the currently used river groynes and climate change. The relation found could unfortunately not be used to indicate the possible consequences of changing the groynes on the necessary dredging efforts but it could be used to indicate the consequences of climate change on the necessary dredging efforts. Climate change will cause a major increase in the necessary dredging efforts.","Waal; dredging; climate change; Groyne; river maintenance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-11-11","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","River Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2010","Due to growing human activity in coastal zones, there is an increasing stress on salt marshes all over the world. These intertidal wetlands were often seen as coastal ‘wasteland’ and large areas were reclaimed for urban development and agriculture. In Puget Sound, a system of interconnected marine waterways and basins in the northwest of the United States, this has lead to an 80% loss of marsh area in the last 150 years. In recent years however there has been a growing recognition of their value as habitat for fish, birds and numerous species of plants and as coastal protection. In many countries they are now protected areas and numerous restoration projects are being carried out or planned. One of the largest of these restoration projects takes place in the Nisqually River estuary, in the southern end of Puget Sound. By removing a dike, built in the early 1900s for farming purposes, an area of nearly 405 hectares was reintroduced to the salt water and tides of Puget Sound on November 12, 2009. The goal of this study was to research how this dike removal will affect the estuary in the coming years. A computational model was set up in Delft3D to describe hydrological and morphological processes, with focus on the interaction with vegetation. The vegetation in Delft3D is schematized as cylindrical rods, which add extra source terms to the momentum equation. An external Matlab routine was used to calculate changes in the vegetation field based on the model results. Because this type of vegetation modeling had not been done on this scale before and there were large uncertainties in the required parameters, first a sensitivity analysis was carried out with a schematized model. By doing different runs, changing one parameter at a time, the relative importance of each parameter was examined. The most important parameters were then researched further so that a detailed final model could be set up, with a discharge from the Nisqually River on the southern boundary and tidal forcing on the northern boundary. With the use of a morphological factor a period of 10 years was simulated. Due to limitations in computation time and the lack of some important data, concessions had to be made in the setup of the model. These concessions, combined with the fact that the model could not be validated since there were no post-restoration measurements available at the moment of writing, make it hard to determine the accuracy of the model predictions. Therefore the results should not be seen as an exact prediction, but more as a qualitative impression of how the area is going to develop in the coming years. It was concluded that success of salt marsh restoration mainly depends on elevation. Higher areas are inundated for a shorter amount of time, which makes it easier for pioneer vegetation to establish. During the period in which the restoration area was diked no sediment was brought in, which caused subsidence. As a result, a salt marsh can develop in the eastern part of the estuary but the western part of the estuary is too low to be colonized. However, the dike removal will allow sediment from the Nisqually River to enter the area again, so if enough sediment is provided the elevation will increase, allowing the marsh to expand further. This suggests that sediment discharge from the river is a key factor, and it is therefore recommended to measure this in the future. An alternative scenario, in which the river is forced to flow through the restoration area, was also examined, based on expectations for high river discharges. This increases the amount of sediment that is imported into the area, and could therefore have a positive effect on the salt marsh development. It does however also influence the salinity, which has a large impact on the distribution of vegetation. Further research into these effects is recommended if forcing this change is considered.","Nisqually River; Puget Sound; Wetland restoration; Salt marsh; Morphology; Vegetation modeling; Delft3D","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

Providing overview and insights at the aggregation level above, being the sector network, is the first necessary step to reach this goal. The academic part of this thesis focuses on the sector network. Statistics Netherlands provided two data sets: the Working People and Monetary transactions. These data sets reflect a part of the monetary sector network evolution over the last two decades. In this research, we analysed these data sets from a complex network perspective and visualised as a real world network. Next, the data sets were related to the list of vital sectors of the Dutch Ministry of Interior Affairs to observe and understand trends and dependencies among these sectors. This research shows that the Household is the prime and most highly connected node within the sector network closely flanked by Telecom and Energy. The practical part of the thesis focuses on the vital sectors, their infrastructures, the major trends and the added value resulting from their collaboration. A trend analysis of the ICT developments related to the household in 2000, 2010 and expectations of 2020 are examined by means of expert interviews. Combining innovation options related to Energy, Telecom, Healthcare and Household reveal viable, sustainable near future trans-sector solutions. The importance of the information communication value added to Smart Grids is clearly demonstrated. Finally, the development of devices within the home is studied to find out which sectors already have traces in home and which effects would be expected for the telecom sector.","smart living","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Network Architectures & Services (NAS)","","Trans-sector Innovation Team","",""

(mentor); Gaydadjiev, G.N. (mentor)","2010","Modern applications demand extremely low power budgets in computer architectures for battery-operated devices. In the particular case of implantable devices —the main focus of this thesis— the system must have a long life span and batteries may not be possible or easy to recharge. In addition to power, chip area is also of major concern in this specific scenario. Since implantable devices are sometimes placed at locations inside the body where limited space is available, the implant must be as small as possible. The vast amount of volume of an implant is typically occupied by the battery and its electrodes, so the affordable chip area is very limited. Another reason why we want very small processor cores, is because this approach leaves more space for cache memory and it statistically reduces the chance of hardware failures. In this thesis we focus on the arithmetic unit (AU) of such a core, which is typically the adder/subtracter. The goal is to explore existing fault-tolerant and low-power AUs which are suitable for implementation in biomedical implants. A second objective is to study our own idea for a resource-constrained AU, based on graceful degradation: the so-called scalable arithmetic unit (ScAU). When an error occurs, the ScAU is able to proceed with the computational work, but no longer at the normal throughput: instead of single-cycle we downgrade to double-cycle operations. The design of our ScAU as well as several reference designs are all implemented in VHDL, synthesized and analyzed using Synopsys Design Compiler/PrimeTime and ModelSim. A major part of this thesis is dedicated to fault-tolerant design. An extensive study among common and less frequently employed error-detection schemes is performed. Finally, an error-detection scheme is chosen, applied to the ScAU, as well as to the reference designs for providing fair comparisons. A simple error-correction scheme is implemented as well. The fault-tolerant ScAU proves to have some very interesting advantages over the current state of the art. The fault-tolerant ScAU saves 17% of area, with a speedup of 12% for a 7.3% increase in power consumption, compared to the conventional technique with the lowest costs. Because of these savings, the power-delay-area product reduces by almost 21%. Under specific circumstances, our fault-tolerant ScAU is even capable of saving both area and power.","low-power design; fault tolerant design; computer arithmetic; ASIC; adders; implants","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-10-29","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","","",""

The final product of mapping is a series of diagrams that depict a deformed grid. The degree of deformation varies, according to the voids created between the elements on the picture /the front view of stacks. The quality on which the interest is focused, are the dense and sparse areas that are created by deformation. The sucession of dense and sparse areas is becoming the main principle of the design. Other key words of the design are :altered landscape and bridging of different levels. The last ones were influential so as the cliff to be the site of intervention. The program is related to the notions of : layered structure, repetition of units, connections-disconnections. At the same time, the cemetery as proposal, might be a solution for the current problematic situation; the Coptics that live in the Garbage City have to travel even for 55km for visiting the cemeteries. The final design concerns a structure that creates a new border between the cliff and the public space. It may be described as a building-landscape (or landscape building?) for the reason that there is no interior or exterior in the common sense -which is the case for a building, however is formed by elements that are common in buildings such as slabs and walls. The structure consists of precast concrete elements. The graves are developed verticaly, in combination with plants on top of each volume. The solid parts of the structure -that are the graves, are filled with soil, which is also a necessary condition according to the Coptics' tradition, but also plays a role in the decomposition process. Thus, this design proposal preserves the positive qualities of the traditional cemetery setting-which is outside the city and at the same time has a closer relation to urban life.","deformation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-10-27","Architecture","Public Building","","studio Border Conditions","",""

(mentor)","2010","Within thin-film silicon solar cells, the so-called Transparent Conductive Oxide (TCO) plays an important role. The optimization of TCOs is a very meticulous process since these thin layers not only need to be both highly transparent and conductive, but are also used for light management; that is manipulating the path of the light through the active layer by means of a textured TCO surface which scatters the light. Besides, the TCOs are also used as back reflector in combination with metallic films. By using these methods both the short circuit current and the overall conversion efficiency of the thin-film silicon solar cells is improved. This report focuses on the actual optimization of the RF magnetron sputtering deposition process of tin-doped indium (ITO) TCO’s for application in thin-film silicon and HIT solar cells. By varying deposition parameters such as power, pressure and temperature an optimal recipe for each specific type of thin-film solar cell could be established. The optimized ITO TCO recipes are utilized as both front and back TCO in a-Si:H, ?c-Si:H and HIT thin-film solar cells. Thanks to these optimizations we were able to achieve efficiencies which were comparable, and in some cases even better, to similar devices made with the already optimized aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) TCO’s. A highest initial efficiency of 10.7% was achieved for a p-i-n solar cell with front Asahi U-type TCO and back ITO TCO. Besides the actual optimization process the consistency and repeatability of the ITO depositions with time was investigated. Since the optimization process is so elaborate, repeatability of depositions is very important. Regularly scheduled depositions were made to check the variations of thin-film quality with time. The results show that the quality of the ITO thin-films is quite variable. The ITO quality is known to drop significantly after a deposition chamber ventilation. The number of hours of sputtering needed to return to original and acceptable quality was investigated by means of a post-ventilation recovery series.","Transparent Conductive Oxide; Thin-film silicon solar cells; HIT solar cells; TCO","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Schitter, G. (mentor)","2010","The Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) is an instrument used for studying the topography of samples with nanometer resolution. Possible samples include specific materials or biological samples. The AFM is a mechanical microscope, since a three dimensional topography image is constructed by raster scanning a sharp tip and a sample surface in close proximity to each other and monitoring tip-sample interactions. The tip-sample interaction is controlled in all three dimensions by means of a piezoelectrical scanning unit which consists of a vertical positioner and a lateral positioner. The vertical positioner is controlled via a feedback operation to control the tip-sample distance. The topography image is based on the control signal being sent to the vertical positioner to move it up or down. The vertical positioner consists of a piezo actuator which suffers from nonlinear behavior due to hysteresis and creep. Due to the nonlinearities, the ratio between the control signal and the resulting vertical displacement is not constant over the full positioning range of the piezo actuator. In current dynamic modes of AFM a large part of the piezo positioning range is used. Therefore, a more direct method to obtain the displacement of the vertical positioner is desired which enables a more accurate estimate for the sample topography. To this end, in this thesis a displacement sensor is added to the vertical positioner of the AFM. The resulting displacement sensor yields a variation in measured step height in the order of 6%, compared to 35% for the conventional control signal when imaging a calibration sample. The lateral positioner is controlled via a feedback operation to maintain high positional accuracy in spite of unknown disturbances and model uncertainty. In this feedback operation, the dynamics of the lateral positioner limit the speed of the AFM. Therefore, for the lateral positioner modern control methods can be used to improve the speed of the AFM. The simulation results for the lateral positioner show that with the use of model based control and H-infinity control the scanning speed can be increased with a factor of 5 when compared to the standard PI controlled system. At the same time the control error for the model based controlled system and the H-infinity controlled system becomes smaller with a factor of 4 and 8, respectively. The bandwidth for the PI controlled system is only 50 [Hz], which is much smaller than the bandwidth for the model based controlled system (1900 [Hz]) and the H1 controlled system (3000 [Hz]). This means a bandwidth improvement with a factor of 38 and 60, respectively. However, further experiments must be carried out to validate the simulation results.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

This thesis primarily provides a step-by-step approach for validating a premixed turbulent combustion model in closed vessels. The approach used in this thesis consists of the use of an algebraic expression for the local turbulent flame speed which is then used to close the balance equations. Focus is given to select the correct solver which can accurately predict pressure waves during flame propagation. Before validating the calculations with experiments, mesh and time-step independency is checked.

(mentor)","2010","Wavelet Packet Modulation (WPM) is a novel multicarrier modulation technique and a promising alternative to the well established Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). WPM has been shown to be an efficient technique with interesting features like adaptation and flexibility and improved characteristics in comparison to OFDM. A major drawback of multicarrier systems is their high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). The average signal power must be kept low in order to ensure that the transmitter amplifier operates in the linear region. This however will have a detrimental effect on the efficiency of power utilization particularly in mobile systems where battery lifetime is a premium resource. Minimizing the PAPR allows a higher average power to be transmitted for a fixed peak power, improving the overall signal to noise ratio at the receiver. In the literature several methods are reported to reduce the PAPR problem of OFDM. The PAPR for WPM is extremely novel. This thesis work presents several original contributions to the field of PAPR reduction for the multi-carrier WPM system. We focus on the selected mapping techniques since they are distortionless and their complexity is lower compared to other techniques. After studying the selected mapping with scrambling technique to reduce PAPR, we present a novel WPM architecture that employs our proposed secure PAPR reduction technique. Besides scrambling techniques, phase modification is another PAPR reduction technique and in this thesis we present how selected mapping with phase modification can be applied to reduce PAPR. In all instances the proposed technique reduces the PAPR between 1.5 and 2.5 dB. A smarter approach can be developed to optimize the selected mapping techniques. Consequently, we introduce an optimized WPM architecture that employs optimized selected mapping with phase modification technique. The designed optimization algorithm improves the PAPR reduction performance further than the selected mapping with phase modification. For a complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) value of , the PAPR of the original frame is around 10 dB; whereas, optimized phase-shifted frame produces a PAPR value around 8.2 dB. While, a PAPR value below 8.7 dB cannot be reached with the selected mapping techniques, which depends on randomization such as randomly phase-shifting or random scrambling.","PAPR; WPM; MCM; OFDM; IDWPT; DWPT; SLM; HNN","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","IRCTR","",""

Central to the thesis is an understanding of people?s behavior towards the food waste phenomenon. Three interconnected studies and one design project are included. In Study I, 18 participants were interviewed to explore their perceptions and attitudes towards food waste, revealing the most wasted food types and reasons for food wastage. The findings of Study I are clustered under four phases of food handling: acquisition, preparation, consumption and storage. Study II comprised a generative session with three users and two designers, devised to explore latent and tacit knowledge regarding food wastage. Study II resulted in user-generated ideas for minimizing food waste, which were analyzed so as to reveal possible design directions. From these results, a set of criteria for a ""perfect? kitchen appliance, which could minimize food waste, was drawn-up. The design project took the research findings of Study I and II and devised a collection of design concepts as possible ways to help reduce domestic food waste. Two concepts – Philips Dispense and Canvas - are taken further because they relate to the most wasted food types: ""bread? and ""vegetables and fruits?. In Study III, Philips Dispense and Canvas were evaluated with a questionnaire. According to the results, in households containing busy couples without children, Philips Dispense is valued highest (it takes the food waste responsibility away from users) whereas Philips Canvas was valued lower (it gives feedback on current stocks and persuades homeowners not to waste food).","food waste; kitchen appliances; user-centred design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

In the last decades the idea that only flood defenses can prevent floods gave way to the realization prevention can also be implemented along other lines, e.g. giving the rivers more space. The next thought was that next to preventing floods it should be possible to reduce the loss due to flooding. Therefore, MLS is meant to introduce comprehensive flood risk management by implementing three layers, or put differently safety nets: 1. Prevention (dikes, space for rivers, etc.), 2. Spatial Solutions (flood-proofing houses, elevating houses, re-locating etc.), 3. Crisis Management (evacuation, warning, etc.). Before this study, there was no academic interpretation of MLS and it had never been tested comprehensively. Consequently, a theoretical framework is being developed in this thesis to be able to model MLS. This is followed by a hypothetical case study and additional one for the City of Dordrecht to examine the actual effect of MLS on the flood risk and its cost-efficiency. It was found that theoretically MLS is indeed an alternative to only Prevention. Furthermore, it introduces the option to better customize flood risk management to local circumstances. By doing so, flood risk management becomes more cost-efficient. As the cost-efficiency is found to be dependent on the initial safety level, it is concluded that in the Netherlands MLS only has the potential to supplement the existing flood protection. In areas with a heavy implementation of flood defenses like in Dordrecht, MLS is fit to complement flood risk management rather than replacing the prevailing Prevention approach. However, to do so (local) authorities need to be able to base their flood management policies on flood risk, e.g. by benchmarking a certain Individual Risk.","meerlaagsveiligheid; flood; risk; Multilayered Safety; Dordrecht; loss-reducing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Large infrastructure and construction projects turned China into the world’s largest importer of heavy construction equipment. Many projects are built in a very short period of time. Most observations outside of China are referred to fast prestigious projects such as Beijing Olympics subway, Beijing International Airport Terminal-3 and Shanghai Pu Dong International Airport with beautiful designs, grand structures and short construction time period are practically not the complete picture of building infrastructure in China. In fact, plenty of infrastructure projects took long time duration of decision making process on Chinese large infrastructure projects. Therefore, the main research is to answer the following research question: What are the critical factors that explain time duration of the decision making process on China’s large infrastructure projects? In order to answer this question, three major methods are used: desk research, interviews and case study. The desk research includes documentary studies of the related institutional reports, official white papers and academic research for general information. The interviews are conducted by face to face interview, telephone interview and online interview, which can provide detailed information and data which are difficult to be found from document study. The case study is focusing on one single case, Harbin subway project, which is explained from two decision making perspectives generated from theoretical research: project perspective and process perspective. Factors explaining long time decision making duration of the selected case will be explored based on both the analytical process by applying theoretical framework and the output that how much theoretical framework can apply on the decision-making process of the selected case. Based on the case study, certain of factors are identified as critical to explain time-duration of decision making process on large infrastructure projects in China. They are 1)insufficient power results in inefficient progress, 2)absence of entrepreneurs and absence of coupling, 3)closed national policy window, 4)strategic behaviors among interactions, 5)interminable application procedure on Chinese large infrastructure projects, 6)strategic choice to urban infrastructure services instead of new infrastructure construction project, 7)frequent personnel changes of mayor position, 8)tense economic interference and a tight link between national economic development and infrastructure investment and 9)the changing cognitions of Chinese residences. At last corresponding learning points drawn up as: 1) under Mao’s regime, decision making process presents the most significant characteristics from the project perspective; After Deng’s economic reform and power decentralization, certain characteristics from the process perspective emerged at the municipal government and central government still presents limited characteristics from the process perspective. 2) The characteristics of decision making process on economic infrastructure project as Harbin subway case are varied from that of the national mission project and image project. 3) Different municipal power status and regional deviation result in different speed of decision making process.","decision-making; large infrastructure project; China; time duration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2010-10-20","Technology, Policy and Management","Engeering, Policy and Analysis","","","",""

An improvement to the current work flow of XRF core scanning data acquisition was suggested by a pre-calibration filtering step, in order to increase the signal to noise ratio. Apart from that, a sample selection routine was developed which, given the underlying calibration strategy, was expected to yield improved calibration results. Embedding the two algorithms into the calibration work flow proved that the sample selection algorithm as well as the pre-calibration filtering step result in improved calibration output. They are also found to be effective for real data; when applied to two datasets of unconsolidated cores, similar results were obtained. The second part of this study included the design of a sedimentary basin infill model ”LINMIX”, based on the mixing of different sediment sources with a grain size dependent chemical composition. By doing so, the observed geochemical signal is decomposed into a portion that is the result of textural variations and a portion that reflects differences in provenance. When applying LINMIX to a record of Quaternary sediment (offshore Senegal) as a proof-of-concept, the model was able to reconstruct the geochemical record satisfyingly by linear mixing of 3 endmembers with 3 unique Grain Size Distributions (GSD’s) and 2 unique functions characterising the compositional change in the grain size spectrum (Transfer function or ’TF’). This result implies that the chemical variation induced by the relative mixing of two endmembers was only the result of grain size variation and not of source material variation. The two endmembers that were designated a common TF, have in a previous study been interpreted as both reflecting material from the same sediment source. This implies that the LINMIX model has potential for semi-automatic provenance interpretation of sediment cores. Additionally the endmember compositions correspond fairly well with the present-day composition of the Senegal river and African eolian dust. Finally it was investigated how geochemical data can support semi-automatic grain size prediction of consolidated sediment, for which holds that there is no sediment source variation. This was done using a dataset of Carboniferous material, which is highly variable in terms of lithofacies. Around 11 meter of core has been geochemically logged with an XRF core scanner and successfully calibrated using 40 calibration samples (20 unique sample depths). The quality of the core scanning data was found to be high; the main rock-forming elements were calibrated with a signal to noise ratio larger than 4. Subsequently the textural information content of the geochemical data was investigated in two different setups. Initially the data was used as a quantitative tool to fill in the gaps between the grain size derived from plug data using Multi Variate Regression (MVR). Apart from that it was used as input for an unsupervised Bayesian classification scheme in terms of grain size classes. Whereas the former yielded a residual variance on the input data smaller than 1.5 f -units in 66 % of the cases, the latter identified two core sections that, given RGB and geochemical data, should be classified differently. In both cases, an additional validation step should give more insight in the performance of the scanner as a grain size predictor. Recommendations w.r.t the scanner include (1) embedding the suggested algorithms in the data acquisition work flow and (2) installing a higher resolution camera to extract textural proxies from images.","compositional data analysis; provenance analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-07-12","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience and Engineering","","Applied Geology","",""

An answer to these water problematics is water storage, which could be realised with more surface water. However, more space for water conflicts with other area-claims. Building on water is an answer to this conflict of interests. This is one of the reasons why building on water has taken a flight in the Netherlands. Connections in between floating structures are for the Dutch construction industry still a rather unmapped territory. In this thesis a general survey is done on building on water with all relevant issues. Connections have been researched more elaborately. With a case study of a floating pavilion this knowledge has been applied. Case study floating pavilion The floating pavilion, with dimensions of 24x46 metres, has already been constructed, but it has been constructed in one piece. In this thesis a structural design has been made for a modular pavilion, in a way the separate spheres should be switchable and removable. A combination of EPS and a concrete framework has been found the best floating system for the pavilion, since this results in an unsinkable and light floating body with a low draught. It appears that the concrete beams and floor of the floating body result in the largest self weight by far, so these are the main determining factors of the draught of 0,88m. The normative waves resulted in internal forces which are in the same range as the internal forces by imposed loads. It is not necessary to decrease the internal forces by movement allowing connections, thus the connections between the beams can be executed as rigid connections. Designed connection The designed connection between the floating bodies consists of the following:  Trapezoidal ridges, for self alignment and shear forces  A vertical steel pen with a wedge shaped point, for the tension connection at the bottom side. This pen will be easily to insert and to fix from the top of the floating bodies.  A longitudinal bolt as tension connector on the top side and for pre-stressing the connection.  Elastic material in between, for amongst others preventing small relative movement (which will exist by allowing deviations) and for impact damping. This design has resulted in a connection easy in execution, since it provides self alignment and only actions from the top are needed. The connection does allow tolerances but will still provide a very rigid connection, since it can be tightened.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","Structural and Building Engineering","",""

(mentor); De Lille, C.H.S. (mentor); Hoonhout, H.C.M. (mentor)","2010","One of the most basic needs for a healthy lifestyle is a healthy diet. A healthy diet consists of a variety of different foods thus providing people with all the nutrients they need for their body. One group of essential nutrients are vitamins. Vitamins are micronutrients which are needed for various basic functions of the body.The body only needs small amounts, from a few micrograms to a few grams, of these nutrients per day. But because we cannot store extra supplies in our body, we need to supply them daily. Philips Research is a partner in a collaboration project called ‘Mijn Vitaminen’ which aims at the development of a concept product to help people in attaining the right amount of vitamins. The goal of this thesis project was to identify the user needs and requirements for concept ideas of this product, focusing on a particular target group. Approach The approach of the project was to first identify the most interesting target group young mothers. This target group was chosen based on their need for specific vitamins, the predicted dilemma they face and the positive business prospect for Philips. A context study was done to gain an understanding of the problems and dilemmas within the chosen target group. A concept design was reviewed with users to find the most important user requirements. With these requirements the concept was worked out in more detail. The proposed design of the system was presented to users for evaluation and the project concluded with a final concept design and a list of recommendations for future development. Contextual study A contextual study was done to understand what problems and dilemmas young mothers face in dealing with vitamins in their daily lives. By conducting a contextmapping study a more in depth understanding was created of how a young mother deals with healthful eating and their experiences, hopes and beliefs are. The insights were collected and an overview of ‘what mom wants’ considering healthful food was made. What mom wants The main conclusion from the contextual study is that the young mother would be helped by a product or service which will make her confident that she is providing her children and herself with enough vitamins to stay healthy. Ultimately the product or service should make her feel that she is a good mother. Concretely it means that this product or service provides her with advice to maintain or improve her food choices. To realize this, a three point feedback loop is used as basis for the concept: 1. Track the food intake 2. Monitor and evaluate the eating behavior 3. Provide personalized feedback Requirements study The next step was to consult the user and find out if this basic concept appeals to her and what she would want to see in this system. Different aspects were reviewed in interviews and resulted in concept requirements and constraints. Concept development The concept was defined in more detail by taking a close look at the technological opportunities and developments in the field of tracking food intake. By combining these opportunities with the requirements and constraints and idea developments; a concept was developed for a personal nutrition system. Evaluation and final design This concept was again evaluated with users because feedback was needed whether the young mother can see the benefits of this system and on how it could be used. Based on the insights from the evaluation study a final concept proposal is made for a personal nutrition system in which the young mother is able to choose between different modes of use, depending on what kind of advice the she would like to receive. The project ends with a list of recommendations for further development.","Personal nutrition; Young mothers; Contextual study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-10-22","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

The goals are to increase the concentrations of Ca2+ and HCO3-, the pH and the Saturation Index (SI), thereby improving the quality of the water regarding corrosion control, buffering and taste. Typical applications include (very) soft groundwater with (very) low alkalinity and desalinated water. In Norway, some plants use a product made of ground natural limestone, called Micronized CaCO3 Slurry (MCCS), which is dosed as a slurry of fine particles (order of 1-2 ?m) into the raw water. In this research a study is made of the potential of MCCS as an alternative to limestone filtration. Experiments were performed to determine the dissolution kinetics of MCCS and other CaCO3-products, including natural limestone grains (1-2 mm) and two precipitated CaCO3 (PCC) powders (Heyer test powder and NanoPCC powder), that consist of even finer particles than MCCS (down to 0.088 ?m). The experimental setup consisted of jars containing water in which the CaCO3-product was introduced. An increase in conductivity as a function of time was observed, which could be used to describe the dissolution kinetics. As expected from theory, the dissolution kinetics are strongly influenced by the particle size of the CaCO3 and the driving force towards the chemical equilibrium. However, all CaCO3-products needed substantial detention times (30 minutes and more) to dissolve completely. This severely hampers the feasibility of MCCS as an alternative to limestone filtration, which can be operated with an Empty Bed Contact Time in the same order of magnitude. This finding can be explained by the fact that the available mass/volume of CaCO3 in a limestone filter is much higher than the available mass/volume of particles in the dosed slurry, thus compensating for the difference in particle size. It is concluded that MCCS is generally not a feasible alternative for limestone filtration as a stand-alone option for the conditioning and (re)mineralization of drinking water. Applications of MCCS will be limited and should either be found in combinations with coagulation/filtration (which is the actual mode of operation in Norway and limits the problems associated with non-complete dissolution of the CaCO3) or in combination with other conditioning and (re)mineralization methods (by dosing a limited amount of MCCS to the raw water, which limits the problem of the slow kinetics).","Limestone filtration; Conditioning; Mineralization; Micronized CaCO3; Dissolution kinetics; Remineralization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Watermanagement","","Sanitary Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2010","In this study a industrial survey was performed on the secondary products generated in the Dutch metal industry. From this industrial survey it was concluded that the Dutch metal industry is already far ahead with closing the materials cycle as for almost every product is a processing route to recover its metal content. The residues generated at LDM BV, a secondary brass producer located in Drunen, are currently being processed by a different company; however in their goal to have a zero footprint on the environment LDM BV (hereafter referred to as LDM) is looking for opportunities to process the secondary products on site. Two different kinds of products are generated at LDM; a filter dust containing around 80% ZnO, 8% C, 4% Cu and 1.5% Pb and a slag containing various amounts of copper ~45% and zinc ~40% in metallic and oxide form. A study was performed on the processing techniques available to process zinc containing residues and from this study several treatment options were designed and tested in the lab. The main focus was put on the recovery of zinc from the LDM filter dust as this is the first goal the company has set itself, however since the nature of the two materials is similar a combined treatment of both materials was investigated as well. First the pyrometallurgical reduction by utilizing the carbon contained in the LDM filter dust was tested at 1200oC. It was found that a maximum of 97% of the zinc could be recovered; a higher recovery at 1200oC was not possible as the remaining zinc was bound to gahnite (ZnAl2O4). The residue still contained 15% ZnO and did not form a slag. A combined reduction of both the filter dust and melting slag resulted in the recovery of 96.8% of the copper, 99.9% of the zinc (as ZnO) and 64.9% of the lead. This test was performed at 1400oC and it was found that at this temperature the gahnite would be reduced. Also by addition of lime and silica a suitable slag was formed which contained 2.18% CuO and 0.16% ZnO. Both the copper and zinc oxide produced had a purity of over 98%. Hydrometallurgical treatment was tested by using two different leaching agents, NaOH and H2SO4. It was found that the best leaching conditions for NaOH at a liquid solid ratio of 10 were 90oC using 320 g/L NaOH. After 15 minutes the maximum amount of zinc was already leached and total of 86% was leached. Lead was leached for 68% and Copper for 5%. Using 200 g/L H2SO4 at 65oC resulted in 96% of all the zinc to be leached and 90.5% of all the copper. Both residues contained mainly gahnite which is impossible to leach under atmospheric conditions. After an iron removal step for the acidic solution both leach liquors were purified with Zn dust cementation. A zinc product of 99.7% purity was produced through electrowinning for both solutions; however the power consumption for the NaOH solution was significantly lower at 2.2 kWh/kg opposed to 3.04 kWh/kg zinc produced Finally a conceptual flow sheet is given for both a pyrometallurgical and a (sulfuric acid) hydrometallurgical processing facility in a brass smelting plant.","Brass; Secondary resources; processing; zinc; copper","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Resources Engineering","","European Mining Course","",""

(mentor); Donselaar, M.E. (mentor)","2010","The Ram Group in Jordan forms part of a massive and voluminous quartz-rich blanket that covered North Africa and Arabia, the former northern margin of Gondwana during the Early Paleozoic. The lack of vegetation on the vast peneplained and tectonically stable margin resulted in the development of extensive alluvial systems markedly different in scale from modern systems. In the Petra area, the Ram Group is conformed by the Salib, Abu Kusheiba and Umm Ishrin formations. Its onset and development are admirably displayed allowing a unique oportunity to perform detailed sedimentological studies. In the paleogeographic context of the Early Paleozoic, the detailed analysis of five lithofacies and interpretation of their three major associations in terms of architectural elements, the study of the mineralogical development throughout the sequence and the ichnofacies content from new ichnofossil discoveries are all gathered in order to reconstruct a depositional and architectural model for the Ram Group. The base of the sequence buries a remarkable 100-metre high paleorelief of the Precambrian basement inherited from volcanic activity. Upward, the sedimentary package describes a 110-metre-thick fining/thinning (salib Formation) and coarsening/thickening (Abu Kusheiba Formation) cycle until drastic development of a >500-metre-thick, massive, medium-grained cross-bedded quartzarenite (Umm Ishrin Formation). The environments of depositions evolved from shallow marine shelf to delta-front and delta braidplain until definite onset of a continent-wide alluvial plain dominated by shallow, perennial, sand-bed braided rivers on the distal margins of Gondwana. Short-lived transgressions and tidal currents reworked parts of abandoned braidplains. The Umm Ishrin Formation is an excellent analogue for subsurface braided hydrocarbon reservoirs. Reservoir characterization from outcrop studies results in a vertical stack of laterally extensive sheet-like units with remarkable high net-to-gross ratios. Radial flow is expected and drainage would be driven under gravity dominated flow due to good hydraulic connectivity in a rather thick and homogeneous sand-rich formation. Reservoir heterogeneities such as small, isolated fine-grained interbeds are randomly distributed through the reservoir. Rather than impeding cross-vertical flow, these barriers may be useful in preventing water or gas coning when correct placing of production wells.","sedimentology; Petra; environments of deposition; ichnofossils; reservoir characterization; braided rivers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geotechnology","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2010","Tensairity is a lightweight structural concept, a synergistic combination of an air-beam, cables and struts, which is categorized as a pneumatic structure. The central idea of Tensairity is to use a low pressure of the internal air to stabilize compression elements against buckling. The basic element consists of a simple air-beam (a low pressure inflated tube), a compression element tightly connected to the air-beam and two tension cables having a spiral shape around the tube. Both the cables and the struts play the role of transferring the applied forces over the air inflated beam; the latter stabilizes then the compression element against buckling. This solution increases the load-carrying capacity compared to a traditional simple air-beam. At the same time, the pressure inside the air-tube can be lowered. Tensairity is, due to its characteristics, especially interesting for temporary and architectural applications, like roof structures, (temporary) bridges and tent structures. The applicability of the concept is not restricted to beams. It is also valid for columns or arches. The simplest Tensairity beam has a cylindrical geometry, but many other shapes are possible, too. Cigar-shaped or spindle-shaped beams still have a circular cross section, but are stiffer than the cylindrical structure.","tensairity; load-bearing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-10-23","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural and Building Engineering","",""

(mentor); Czech, B. (mentor)","2010","Studies performed in the last decade have shown that wave energy could contribute as much as 10% in the current world electricity demand, making the ocean one of the most underrated and unexploited renewable sources so far. Wave energy offers distinctive advantages compared to other renewable technologies, providing a constant and predictable source of energy with minimal environmental impact. Although research on this topic has just been reinitiated, the devices that have been developed in these programmes typically suffer from the operation conditions in the marine environment. A new approach in this field is to use deformable materials, which should result in mechanical structures with improved reliability and survivability. An innovative new concept is to use smart materials in these deformable structures, which eliminate the need for additional generators and the typically related moving parts. This research addresses the application of Dielectric Electro Active Polymers (DEAP) in wave energy applications, and focusses on the electrical aspects involved in the energy conversion. Electrically, the EAP structure is represented by a variable capacitor, which capacitance is a function of the mechanical deformation. It is found that the energy conversion of an ideal EAP film is maximized when charging and discharging is performed infinitely fast at the maximum and minimum capacitance, respectively. An intermediate constant electric field stage results in the electromechanical conversion process. An optimized current waveform is investigated that results in the optimal energy cycle, maximizing the electrical energy output of the DEAP structure. For this purpose, the current amplitudes and the amount of charge left on the film are optimized in accordance with the material and excitation properties. It is found that even with poor material properties, reasonable energy output can be obtained by applying an optimized energy harvesting cycle. The energy cycle optimization has shown that energy harvesting in applications with low deformation ratios requires an highly efficient Power Take Off system (PTO). The specifications of this PTO converter have been derived using the parameters of a given test setup and the corresponding optimal energy cycle. In accordance with the purpose of the converter, a basic Buck and Boost topology has been selected, using a Zero Voltage Switching-Clamped Voltage (ZVS-CV) switching strategy. A single high-voltage switch configuration has been chosen for complexity and reliability reasons. Based on the PTO design procedure, it can be concluded that the high voltage and typically low current application challenge the design of the converter. To investigate the converter efficiency and characterize the losses, an accurate IGBT model has been deployed in the Saber circuit simulator. However, it has been found that the current tail effect is not modeled appropriately for the ZVS-CV conditions. Especially for high-voltage switches, the observed current tail is significantly increased under soft-switching conditions. Therefore, the design has resulted in poor efficiencies. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that topologies with a single high-voltage IGBT switch are not able to operate efficiently under the given conditions. Therefore, it is recommended to extend the research to multi-level topologies or series connected switch stacks using low voltage switches.","wave energy; dielectric elastomer; electro active polymer; energy harvesting cycle; Power Take Off system (PTO); Zero Voltage Switching Clamped Voltage (ZVS-CV); EAP emulator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-01-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","Electrical Power Processing","",""

De toenemende geluidsoverlast en luchtverontreiniging als gevolg van een groeiend verkeersaanbod belemmeren niet alleen de groei van de stad, maar ook een verbreding van de weg zelf, waardoor de bestaande congestieproblemen niet kunnen worden opgelost. Langs de oostkant van de A28 wordt een natuur- en recreatiegebied genaamd De Schammer gerealiseerd. Er wordt onderzocht of het (plaatselijk) overkappen van de snelweg A28 om de overlast in de omgeving te verminderen en de samenhang tussen Amersfoort en De Schammer te versterken maatschappelijk-economisch haalbaar is. Hierbij wordt bovendien gestreefd naar meervoudig ruimtegebruik. Bij de A28 bij Amersfoort is er sprake van bebouwing aan de westkant en het aan te leggen natuurgebied aan de oostkant. De locatie kent veel beperkingen. De snelweg kruist ter plaatse met een tweetal waterwegen, de Barneveldse Beek en het Valleikanaal, en kent een hoge dichtheid van aansluitingen op het onderliggende wegennet. Ook zal gezien de ligging van de A28 in het Nederlandse en Europese wegennet de weg open moeten blijven staan voor het transport van gevaarlijke stoffen. De waterwegen maken een gedeeltelijk verdiepte ligging van de snelweg lastig en de aanwezigheid van gevaarlijk transport door de overkluizing belemmert uit veiligheidsoverwegingen het opnemen van aansluitingen in de overkluizing. Het onderbreken van de overkluizing ter plaatse van deze barrières is geen optie, daar het nut van de overkapping in dat geval grotendeels verdwijnt. Enkel bij een langere overkluizing zal de luchtverontreiniging worden verminderd. Bovendien ontstaat er een onrustig wegbeeld voor de weggebruiker bij de dan vele onderbrekingen. Om een langere overkluizing mogelijk te maken moet de aansluiting van de A28 op het onderliggende wegennet worden aangepast. De aansluiting Leusden vervalt en zal worden opgevangen door een verbeterde ontsluiting van Leusden via de aansluiting Leusden-Zuid. Door deze aanpassing wordt het gedeelte A28 tussen Leusden en Amersfoort onderdeel van de overkluizing. Een overkluizing kan boven maaiveld zowel licht als zwaar worden uitgevoerd. Om te voorkomen dat een overkluizing een barrière blijft vormen zal deze tenminste deels zwaar uitgevoerd moeten worden. Er ontstaat in dit geval een tunnelconstructie al dan niet onder maaiveld. Door de bovenzijde van de overkluizing een tweede functie te geven ontstaat er meervoudig ruimtegebruik en wordt de overkluizing beter geïntegreerd in de omgeving. Hierbij dient voldaan te worden aan de externe veiligheid voor de personen in de directe omgeving van de overkluizing. Er worden verschillende opties voor meervoudig ruimtegebruik onderzocht en ook het bebouwen van de overkluizing is een reële optie. Dit kan door, zoals vaker toegepast, over de weg heen te bouwen met de fundering naast de eigenlijke weg, of door boven de weg te bouwen op een aparte draagconstructie. Aan de hand van enkele uitgangspunten kan een draagconstructie worden ontworpen welke tussen de bebouwing en de daadwerkelijke overkluizing wordt geplaatst. Op deze manier is ook woningbouw op de overkluizing mogelijk. Het toepassen van meervoudig ruimtegebruik op de overkluizing draagt mee aan de opbrengsten uit planontwikkeling. Het toepassen van een geheel zware overkluizing, welke het Valleikanaal onderlangs kruist voldoet het best aan de beoogde doelstellingen. De aanwezigheid van de eveneens verbrede A28 is geminimaliseerd en de omgeving kan grotendeels vrij worden ingericht. De haalbaarheid van een overkluizing is vooral afhankelijk van de economische waarde die toegekend wordt aan de maatschappelijke baten van de overkluizing voor de omgeving.","overkluizing; overkappen; snelweg; tunnel; overkapping; overkluizen; meervoudig ruimtegebruik; veiligheid","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","","",""

This research explores how an organization can use a mix of causal and effectual principles, and what the drivers of such behaviour are. In doing this, a basis is created for using the principles of causation and effectuation as an analytical framework. To explore the interplay between causation and effectuation, a theory generating single case study was conducted at Enviu, a Dutch NGO which aims to add environmental and social value by scouting, generating and implementing sustainable ideas. Two major projects within the organization were investigated using the grounded theory method. Data from documentation, interviews and observation was grouped into constructs, after which links between these contructs were developed, forming propositions for new theory. Enviu is characterized by a hybrid behaviour, incorporating heavy use of partnering, research and working on basis of affordable loss, where opportunities are pursued only if failure can be afforded. It also showed to be quite risk-averse. To explain this behaviour, a driver model was synthesized from literature, and additional drivers were developed. The main contributions of this research are two new drivers for behaviour. First, it was shown that financial partners not directly involved with the project operations stimulate the use of causal principles through their need for measurable control mechanisms. Second, low available means result in a fragile organization, stimulating the use of risk reducing principles originating in both causation and effectuation. Noteworthy are the increased use of partnering (to increase the available means), affordable loss and prediction, as well as the decreased use of experimentation. Together, these drivers explain Enviu's behaviour to a very large extent. The drivers emerging from literature - uncertainty, efficacy of the organization, entrepreneurial expertise of the individual and self-efficacy of the individual - played a lesser role in determing the behaviour. The findings of this research were translated into recommendations for Enviu. These recommendations discuss how Enviu should chose, attract and maintain relationships with partners, how Enviu can improve its performance by experimenting at low cost and how Enviu should react in case of a situation of increased means. This is a proof-of-concept of using the causal and effectual principles as an analytical framework, from which meaningful advice can be derived.","effectuation; causation; grounded theory; low resources","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","TSE","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor)","2010","A few years ago a licentiate thesis was presented by K. Larsson on seismicity in Swedish mines compared with experienced seismicity abroad. This thesis was mainly focused on cut and fill mining and sublevel caving methods. Recently the Swedish mining company New Boliden started implementing transverse open stoping in the Lappberget ore body in the Garpenberg mine. The ore varies from being a homogeneous massive sulfide of zinc ore to a schistose biotite in a foliated quartzitic rock. In the early stage of Lappberget when using cut and fill mining stress induced fractures could be seen in the rock when mining the subsequent cut and this led to believe that the stresses are high enough to exceed the strength. The occurrence of a violent sill pillar failure in the Kanalmahnen ore body in Garpenberg gave reason to investigate the potential for instability at high extraction ratios of Lappberget and in particular i f there is a potential for seismic events and associated violent failures. An effort was made in this thesis to summarize all of the relevant geomechanical information available on Lappberget. Fundamental factors in rockbursting have been discussed and the information on the various elements - geology, state of stress, mining sequencing and rock mass properties - are discussed. A brief description of the fundamentals of the used numerical methods and the set-up of the models is described followed by the mechanisms behind two types of seismic events, where strain related seismicity and fault-slip seismicity are distinguished. In discussing the results the tradeoff between the calculated strain energies in threedimensional elastic (non-failure) models were compared to the two-dimensional plastic (failure) models. An indication of the stress reduction due to the plastic zones in the footwall and hanging wall was provided to estimate the potential for seismic events. This included analysis of the loading history, strain energies and indicated plastic zones. Two case studies were analyzed in a similar fashion and it was concluded that the potential for strain related events is low, as rock will likely fail gradually instead of instantly and thereby dissipating the strain energy through small scale fracturing. The fault slip potential is harder to assess, as there are no significant geological features in 3 the vicinity of Lappberget to present knowledge. Fault slip mechanisms close to the hanging wall are not likely to accumulate high energies due to the weak hanging wall - ore contact. I f a significant structure turns out to be present close to Lappberget the Excess Shear Stress method is suggested to provide an upper-bound estimation of potential events and as a starting point for more detailed analysis. Furthermore it should be noted that the only definite way of finding the potential for seismic events is by the occurrence of seismic events. Seismic events do not automatically lead to structural failure. The lack of potential for seismic events does not exclude other types of structural failure. The failure state of the stopes should be closely watched through observations and possibly convergence measurements. The numerical models can be improved by calibrating the failure criterion in the ore by using the observations and measurements. They will also improve by gaining a better understanding of the geology of the hanging wall to get a better idea of the plastic zones and the associated stress reduction in the ore. A three-dimensional numerical code capable of incorporating plasticity can provide a better understanding of the interaction of plasticity in various rock masses, provided that an adequate geomechanical model can be constructed.","Garpenberg; mining; seismicity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Applied Earth Sciences","","Resource Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2010","In a 6 month research at Kyoto University and Delft University of Technology, the urban distribution centre (UDC) was investigated with a multi-agent model to find situations where the UDC can be financial viable. From a literature study the main modeling components were found: commodity estimation, vehicle routing, traffic environment, agent interaction and various policy measurements. Policies to test the impact on the business case of the UDC are: different congestion and toll rates, subsidy and a dynamic fee. Hereby a gap in literature is addressed by dynamic modeling with a multi-agent model with vehicle routing and incorporating dynamic usage. Dynamics are included with variable traffic conditions (resulting in dynamic travel times) and dynamic demand locations. Dynamic UDC usage was tested by various delivery schemes and a dynamic fee, which changes hourly. After generating the multi-agent model with a genetic algorithm for vehicle routing, it has to be checked that an increasing UDC usage rate corresponds to decreasing both the NOx emission and km count (NOx emission reduction of 19.0% ± 13.7 % and km count reduction of 18.8% ± 12.9% over 2318 runs). The model tested different UDC delivery schemes (early delivery, fixed time delivery or full truck delivery), congestion rates (low, normal or high), toll rates (none, low or high) and subsidy levels (none, 25%, 33% or 50% subsidized). The only positive business case for the UDC is with a subsidy rate of 50% (rate 4), which shows the complexity of generating a positive business case for an UDC. Per setting 360 runs were performed. To enhace the UDC financial performance the dynamic UDC fee was tested. This fee varies during the different hours of the day. Five cases were tested by increasing the general dynamic fee curve with an additional global shift of -20, -10, 0, 10 or 20 Yen per parcel. The impact of NOx emission or km count reduction correcsponds to the fixed fee scenario. Per setting 50 runs were performed. Significant differences between various dynamic fee settings are present. The fact that the UDC income is close to being significantly higher than the -300.000 Yen per day, compared to similar fixed fee conditions is highly encouraging. However further and full evaluation of all possible dynamic fee settings is desired to find potential better dynamic fee settings than the currently used settings. At the end of this research three cases are compared for dynamic fee usage: a reference case, highly congested city case and the involved municipality case. Comparing the three scenarios, there is no significant difference between the NOx emission or km count reduction and the freight carriers costs. For the UDC income there is a significant income increase in the third scenario with respect to the other scenarios. Also for the municipality there is a significant increase in costs in the third scenario. Since there is no significant decrease in NOx emission or km count between the second and third scenario, the municipality will need other social or financial incentives, before the municipality will participate in providing such high and long term subsidies. From this research it is clear that generating a positive business for a UDC is highly challenging. For a UDC to be profitable, it seems to be necessary to receive subsidy permanently. This analysis of the UDC analysis relates to the low UDC success rate of the research of Browne, Sweet et al (2005). The conditions for generating a successful business case for the UDC are hard and limited. Further research of dynamic fee settings and investigation of the possibility to implement this in a real-life case can contribute to future prospective and the success rate for urban distribution centres.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-10-14","Technology, Policy and Management","Transport Policy and Logistics?

Since the current version is a prototype, the perception processor is still undergoing some improvements and updates. By performing extensive tests not only to the domain of eye blink detection, advice is given about promising directions for further development of the processor. Ultimately, the demonstrative application created for this thesis is robust enough to be used as a real time blink detector that can be used in different domains of computer vision. In order to create the blink detector, a step by step approach is taken. First, the face is located and tracked. Next, the eye region is to be found, which should lead to real time locating and tracking of the pupils. Finally the blinks are detected to give an indication of a persons blink rate.

We focused on finding a solution that can be integrated to an existing system by using a routing algorithm that can forecast traffic congestion and finding the fastest route to get to the end point. The forecast will be based on the historical traffic information.

(mentor); Bruining, J. (mentor)","2010","Satisfying continuously growing world energy demand by use of fossil fuels has increased carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in the atmosphere. Dramatically higher concentration of the CO2 has a negative environmental impact, for that reason a need for analyzing possible mitigation options has arisen. The research framework on the mitigation options includes conducting studies on capturing the CO2 and its permanent and safe disposal via mineral carbonation. Mineral carbonation of wollastonite (CaSiO3) appears to be the most promising sequestration option for CO2 fixation on silicate minerals: its reaction rate is considered faster than for the other minerals such as magnesium silicates or basalts. This report investigates a direct aqueous route of mineral carbonation of wollastonite under elevated pressure and temperature. Choice of the wollastonite was made based on its high reactivity rate and the method was determined by a catalytic effect of water on the adsorption kinetics. To improve the process and limit duration of the step where CO2 diffuses in solution before attaining the solid surface, most of the experiments were dedicated to carry in a moistened sample. As a result it could benefit from the catalytic effect of water and transport of CO2 was fast enough due to pressure equilibration. To investigate the influence of the water content of the sample, the experiments for this research were carried out with different water fractions. The idea of the direct aqueous wollastonite carbonation was studied experimentally. For this purpose a set-up was designed and built. It comprised of a closed system with a reference cell, a sample cell and tubing. The whole set-up was placed in a thermal reactor to achieve elevated temperature conditions. Sample represented by mixture of water and CaSiO3 was stirred until obtaining homogeneous slurry. The slurry contained 50 v/v% of water for the samples with the highest saturation. The unsaturated sample contained 20% of water. After introducing of CO2 to the reference cell and opening a valve connecting with sample cell, pressure started to decrease until reaching an equilibrium pressure. The pressure decrease in the set-up was monitored by a pressure device. In addition a dedicated reactive diffusion model was built to interpret the experimental results. The reaction rate for the adsorbed phase and the free phase is proportional to the deviation from equilibrium, which is given by the Langmuir isotherm. A comparison between the experiment and the model leads to the determination of the reaction rate parameters. The research on the direct aqueous mineral carbonation led to the following results: the maximum adsorption is 493 kg/m3; amount of water and particle sizes have the strongest influence on the carbonation process; water behaves as a catalyst, however it may limit the conversion rate in time; the direct aqueous carbonation is a complex heterogeneous reaction that involves dissolution, nucleation, interface reaction and mass transfer.","carbonation; ccs; wollastonite","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geotechnology","","Section GeoEngineering","",""

(mentor); Schutte, S. (mentor)","2010","Background Inaccuracy in the measurement of the angle of strabismus is an important cause of reoperations in strabismus surgery. The current methods to estimate the angle of strabismus have limited accuracy, the duration of the test is long and a high level of cooperation of the patient is required. To alleviate this the Delft Assessment Instrument for Strabismus in Young children (DAISY) is being developed. DAISY aims to measure the angle of strabismus accurately (error <1 degree) in different directions of gaze within a short time span (<1 minute) of young children with unrestrained head. Methods Strabismus angles in different directions of gaze with free head movement were estimated using the rotations of both eyes and the head pose. The head rotation was estimated with a face tracking system (FaceAPI) and a webcam, which allowed free head movement. Stereo images were obtained with two Prosilica GC2450 cameras. The eye rotations were estimated with these images, using the coordinates of the pupil centers, fixation objects (LEDs) and corneal reflections centers. These reflections were created by two infrared light sources. Validation experiments were performed on orthotropic test subjects. All experiments were performed at a measurement distance of approximately 1 meter by roomlight. I. The error of the head rotation method was determined with a high precision secondary measurement system on ten adults and ten children. Eye rotation was described relative to the optical axis through the midpoints of cornea and pupil center. II. The errors of the estimation of the angle of strabismus on one adult using a fixed head pose were identified. III. The errors of the estimation of the angle of strabismus with free head movement were determined for gaze ahead and for different directions of gaze on three adults. Results I. The error of the head rotation estimation with the FaceAPI was smaller than 5 degrees for 99.5 percent of the adults' and for 99.2 percent of the children's measurements. The median of the error of the adults' data was 1.40 degrees and was 1.23 degrees for the children's data. II. The strabismus angles with fixed head were estimated with an error smaller than 0.5 degrees for gaze directions up to 15 degrees relative to gaze ahead. III. The error of the estimated horizontal angle of strabismus with unrestrained head was 0.34 degrees for gaze ahead and 0.53 degrees for different directions of gaze. The run-time for a single measurement was 2 milliseconds. Conclusion The head rotation could accurately be assessed for both adults and young children. The measurement time was reduced considerably, from 10 minutes to 2 milliseconds for a single measurement. The angle of strabismus could be measured accurately in different directions of gaze while allowing free head movement. The error was reduced from 5.44 to 0.53 degrees. This research shows that the variance introduced by the inaccurate measurement could be reduced with a factor ten.","strabismus angle; eye rotation; head rotation; angle of gaze; unrestrained head","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-10-08","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME/MIMS","",""

A product is designed with the use of a design model, consisting out of 5 phases: In the first phase an introduction to the company, together with the definition of the project is presented. The second phase is the Analysis, where market research is done on Driessen and galleys to define a strategy and the most important stakeholders. The Analysis phase also contains research on the most important stakeholders; airlines and passengers. The Analysis phase ends with a list of requirements and wishes. The third phase, the Synthesis, contains the idea generation. Three concepts out of 14 proposals are chosen through a selection of feasibility aspects and added value. Finally one concept is selected called Servicedesk. The fourth phase, the Embodiment, contains the complete detailing of the Servicedesk, transforming it into a product. In the last phase, the Validation phase, the Servicedesk is evaluated by several airlines and tested on the list of requirements. The phase ends with recommendations for the future development of the Servicedesk and of branding products for galleys in general. The Servicedesk is a new, innovative product that gives airlines the possibility to communicate their values to their passengers. It creates a good (first) impression since the Servicedesk would be the first thing customers see when they enter the aircraft, leaving a memorable touch. The Servicedesk can be placed inside Driessens new modular MaxFlex galleys, taking the place of one trolley. It can be installed in the front or rear of the aircraft. The front of the Servicedesk provides an area for branding. The image can be altered when desired and it even can be combined with an image on the side panel of the galley. The Servicedesk can therefore create a personal connection between airline and passenger. Additionally, the Servicedesk can be used to hand out folders or newspapers, provide the passengers with information, or sell products (tax free or food and beverages) during flight. It can also be used to display products, store of folders or miscellaneous or as extra work deck space.","Galley; Branding; Aircrafts","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Bruens, G.N. (mentor)","2010","In the fifties Holland became a thriving nation. The gastronomic culture flourished. People came in touch with foreign cuisine. Cheese fondue, stone grilling, fondue Bourguignonne and gourmetten were introduced and became very popular. The collective term of these dinners is table top cooking. The gastronomic culture in Holland however, has changed. After the heydays of individualism, today's trend is to eat together again. Informal dinner parties are organized by the group of young creatives of generation Y. But the traditional types of tabletop cooking are not popular within this group. Its ritual does not fit the lifestyle of generation Y, but does have some strong qualities. The goal during this graduation project is to use the positive characteristics of tabletop cooking and to turn it into a new informal dinner table ritual which fits the lifestyle of young creatives. To accompany the new dinner table ritual, several products are designed. The target group of this project are the young creatives. This group is between 25 and 30 years old. It exists out of the higher educated people who are graduated recently and have started their first job, mostly as creative entrepreneurs. Young creatives are conscious about their impact on the earth. In daily life, they try to deal with the environmental problems by saving energy and buying biological products. Based on this, it must be possible to use the products of the new dinner table ritual on a daily basis for different purposes. When the target group organizes a dinner party, the menu is creatively putted together by ingredients bought at the daily market. They describe themselves as a creative and experimental chefs. Therefore, the new dinner table ritual should not prescribe what should be eaten. Multiple houses were visited in order to get an understanding in the Diderot unity of the target group. It appeared however, that the Diderot unity of the target group is its initial state. The interior and personal products do not visualize a coherent story. Therefore, a design language about the ritual's product could not be formulated from these visits. A style impression could be made however. It is described as: modern but warm and organized but playful. In order to get an insight in the qualities of a tabletop cooking evening and into the dinner rituals of a normal dinner party, multiple dinner parties were organized with the target group. A very positive characteristic of a tabletop cooking evening is the group bonding. Group bonding arises because people go through the complete ritual together. But a negative characteristic is that people are constantly focused on preparing food. During a tabletop cooking dinner little time is left for social conversation, while at a normal dinner party people socially interaction constantly. The group bonding is at a normal dinner party, however, is less. Based on the conclusions of the analysis phase, the idea to design a stackable dinner party was born. The vision was to create a delicate and gratifying dinner party where curiosity is set. During the stackable dinner party, multiple dishes are stacked in front of each diner. A traditional 3-course dinner is not prepared. Instead, the dinner exists out of multiple smaller dishes. To prevent the preparation of a traditional three course dinner, cups are designed. The first course will be shared and is visible. This initiates the dinner party. The other courses are prepared and stacked too. These courses are hardly visible, curiosity is created. Another positive aspect is that the host does not have to leave the dinner table for dinner preparations in the kitchen. When a course is finished, the empty cup will be taken from the stack and the next course will appear. The empty cups can be nested. After the first designs were drawn, prototypes were build. It came clear that the cups were designed too small. Furthermore, the stack-ability and nest-ability of the cups were not satisfying. The design was reshaped. Everything that was designed using a computer looked a lot different in reality. The lesson learned, making the product by hand gives a better insight in its real shape and measurements. To accompany the new dinner table ritual, which is named “aan stapel', a cookbook is composed. Four menu suggestions are put together. The dishes differ from very easy to challenging. To accompany the cups from the dinner table ritual, cutlery and drinking glasses are designed. In order to create a complete dinner table ritual, it is recommended to design placements and napkins as well. The final design is tested by the target group and it became clear that the designed dinner table ritual fits the target group. It is an informal dinner party. The stack of crockery is inviting and the overall stackable dinner party is a joyful experience. Because of people's curiosity, the food is eaten more fast than at a normal dinner party. Hopefully, in five years from now, the young creatives have embraced 'aan stapel' as their new dinner table ritual, if an informal dinner party is organized.","dinner table ritual; young creatives; stackable dinner party","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Xiao, Y. (mentor); Van Sandwijk, A. (mentor)","2010","The metal zirconium (Zr) and its related alloys have high melting points and an excellent resistance to corrosion. Consequently, zirconium is applied in chemical technology and particularly in nuclear reactors. The low neutron-capture cross-section of zirconium, combined with its corrosive resistance, make the metal pre-eminently suitable as cladding for nuclear fuel rods. In nature, zirconium is nearly always found in combination with hafnium (Hf). Chemically the metals zirconium and hafnium strongly resemble each other. However, contrary to zirconium, hafnium has a high neutron-capture cross-section. As a low absorption coefficient for neutrons is essential for fuel rod cladding, the hafnium content of nuclear-grade zirconium should be as low as possible. Currently, most of the world’s zirconium is produced by the Kroll method. This process is over sixty years old, and due to its inefficient batch production the production costs are high. A (semi-)continuous molten salt electro-refining process could result in a cheaper, purer product that still meets the high requirements of the industry. A new process for the production of pure zirconium has been recently developed and patented at Delft University of Technology. In the current work, fundamental operating aspects of the patented process have been investigated. The patented process consists of three steps. The first step is the reduction of ZrO2 and HfO2 to Zr and Hf metal. For this step, the solubility of ZrO2 in molten salt has been investigated. Different salt compositions, additives and temperatures have been used. The best results were found using an equimolar NaCl-CaCl2 mixture with 5 mol% CaO and 5 mol% NaF added, at a temperature of 750 °C. This resulted in a ZrO2 solubility of 2.86%. The second step is the separation of hafnium from zirconium. By contacting a molten Cu-Sn-Zr-Hf alloy with a CuCl2-containing salt, the hafnium is transported to the salt phase. The effects of different salt compositions at different stoichiometric ratios have been investigated. The best results were obtained with a NaCl-CaCl2-CuCl2 salt mixture at a stoichiometric ratio of 1.5, reaching single-step removal efficiencies of 95%. Higher CuCl2 concentrations in the molten salt have a positive effect on the removal efficiency. The final step is the electro-refining of zirconium from the Cu-Sn-Zr alloy, which has been tested on a laboratory scale. The best results were obtained using vitreous carbon anode lead, a zirconium block cathode and a molten salt electrolyte consisting of equimolar NaCl-KCl with CuCl2. It is essential that the molten salt electrolyte is purified with hydrochloric gas to remove oxide and hydroxide ions. A dense metallic deposit was formed, which consisted of ~25 wt% Cu, ~28 wt% Zr and ~ 47 wt% Sn. The applied potential was too high for selective refining of zirconium. Future experiments should use a lower potential, and have a sufficiently high concentration of zirconium in the molten alloy in order to prevent the deposition of tin and copper.","Zirconium; Hafnium; Separation; Molten salt; Electro-refining; Electrolysis; Solubility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-10-01","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geotechnology","","Section Resource Engineering","",""

(mentor); Van Breemen, E. (mentor); Brøndum, M. (mentor)","2010","The following document reports a graduation project done at the LEGO Group, by a student from the Delft University of Technology. It was the student's assignment to take a look at how LEGO can enter the professional market with a product that combines LEGO with sheet materials. Within the project, product designers were defined as the target market. They use LEGO quite often in their work, but unfortunately, many times they end up confronted with the limits of the system. The project started with finding out how many product designers there are to address, what they can spend and what they need. The first needs were found by conducting 15 interviews among product designers. This narrowed the focus to where this project should go and where it should not. Main outcome of the interviews was that these people have workshop related problems and thereby are likely to use LEGO. They would like to see more flexibility in the LEGO system and get much more options for specific cases. These outcomes were used in the synthesis of concepts. In the synthesis phase several concepts were developed with the help of context mapping with another set of product designers. Their unmet needs became clearer and three concepts were defined. The concept that was chosen was based on flexible parts and parts that can attach the LEGO system to the 'real world'. This should stimulate designers to faster test their ideas and concepts on their desk or in the workshop and finally making product designs better. This concept was worked out to a final product+packaging proposal which was tested in the end with 7 product designers. Result is that the concept works, but some bricks should be tested again (but then) in the right materials and for a longer time. Finally, the whole product design was wrapped up in a business planning for the next 4 years. The first step is to launch small and to do more extensive research before the product can be scaled up to global market after 3-4 years. Expected is that this product, after investing and launching small can become a self sustaining business model that can deliver around 1-2 million euros each year in a mature market.","LEGO; Product Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-10-06","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Product Engineering","",""

Due to the depth and size of the operation, it is crucial that this turnover takes place within the anticipated time to avoid delays in the mining sequence and cycle and set-backs in production. Currently delays in the stope turnover occur, this is called stope slippage.

(mentor)","2010","Rainwater harvesting is the primary source of fresh water on the majority of isolated and volcanic islands in the Eastern Caribbean island chain that lack reliable sources fresh water. Recent research studies have determined that the microbiological quality of rainwater in cistern systems is generally unstable and can lead to serious health implications when used for human consumption. Another related issue is that rainwater shortages occur more frequently due to fluctuating rainfall patterns and increasing rainwater consumption rates. In this paper minimum design requirements are determined, using data from the islands of Saba and St Eustatius, for the construction of new domestic rainwater systems on small volcanic islands in the Eastern Caribbean. These minimum design requirements can be used to prevent potential water quality and quantity issues. One of the conclusions of this research study is that mainly the collection and storage elements of rainwater systems need to be constructed using non-toxic and non-corrosive materials to mitigate potential health risks. Also, first-flush devices need to be installed in the collection system to divert the mostly contaminated first load of rainwater after a dry period. The storage tanks need to be watertight and protected from sunlight, preferably located at least 30 meters away from active bacterial sources (such as open street sewers or cesspits). The minimum rainwater catchment area for a standard rainwater system, based on a 4-person family with a modern water consumption pattern, is 113m2; the minimum cistern storage capacity is 24m3.","rainwater harvesting; water demand management; drinking water; water quality; catchment area; rainwater cistern; design requirement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-10-05","Technology, Policy and Management","Multi Actor Systems","","Policy Analysis","",""

On behalf of, and in cooperation with the TU Delft and the MARD-CWRCT two dike designs are made for a pilot project on Cat Hai Island. Two different types of revetments are used, namely the Dutch block type revetment Basalton and the classic rip-rap revetment. The designs are based on the available boundary conditions, the new Vietnamese guidelines and the Dutch knowledge. The focus points of the technical design are the geometry, the revetment, toe construction and the settlement. Compared to the current Vietnamese dikes, the design is revolutionary due to the presence of an outer berm. Besides the technical part of the design, the logistics and finance for the pilot project is explored. The different possibilities of producing, placing and transporting together with a time and cost estimations are given. In addition a proposal is given for the maintenance schedule and how to monitor the dike. Eventually two optimal dikes are further investigated, this height is based on zero overtopping and the most economical feasible. The crest heights of the old Vietnamese dikes on Cat Hai Island are around 4,80 m and it has a dike footprint width of 40,20 m. The crest height of the Basalton dike will be one meter higher than that of the rip-rap dike and the rip-rap will be one meter higher than then old dike. Because Baslaton has a larger wave runup than a rip-rap dike. Therefor the footprints of both the new Basalton and rip-rap dike are almost twice as large as the old footprint. The reason for this is because of the use of a berm in the outerslope for the Basalton dike. An estimation of the cost of this project is for a riprap dike, roughly 24 billion VND and for the Basalton dike more or less 21 billion VND.","Vietnam; block revetment","en","student report","TU Delft - Section Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

In this context, we developed JTestCraft, a state-of-the-art test generator for the Java programming that deals effectively with all object-oriented programming concepts, such as object array types, inheritance and polymorfism. Furthermore, JTestCraft can locate all relevant test cases due to the use of the novel Candidate Sequence Search algorithm. Other novel concepts introduced in this thesis include the Constraint Tree data-structure to improve scalability and the Heap Simulation Representation to simplify the implementation of the test generator. We evaluated JTestCraft by looking at its ability to generate tests that obtain high code coverage and compare the results to human crafted tests. In addition, the performance of JTestCraft is compared against similar tools. Finally, we give pointers for further research to improve the performance and usability of future test generators.","unit testing; software verification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Software Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2010","This thesis presents a remote vision system designed to be used for telepresence applications. Telepresence is essentially being able to assert one's presence at a remote location. Being able to see and talk to people in another corner of the world is one method of telepresence we have come to know as video conferencing. As technologies evolve, the sense of `presence' allowed by them also grows. Present-day telepresence systems limit our most prominent sense, sight, to monoscopic video where we only see one view of the remote location. In order to take telepresence to the next level by being able to manipulate remote objects, it is important that our sight be stimulated to perceive depth to the fullest. Therefore, this thesis focuses on creating a \textsl{stereoscopic} remote vision system designed for teleoperation. Delay plays a major part in the ease of teleoperation. While most teleoperation systems focus of alleviating the effects of delay by means of control methodologies and environment modeling, this system attempts to directly minimize delay and other factors of human discomfort. This was done by analyzing the several technologies involved in capture, compression, transport and display of 3D video along with an exploration on the factors of human comfort and performance for teleoperation. The most appropriate technologies were then selected while keeping these factors in mind. The stereoscopic remote vision system was then designed and implemented while keeping a focus to minimize delay. The resulting system was then used as a testbench to further explore the same factors.","stereoscopy; remote-vision; telepresence; teleoperation; telerobotics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","Embedded Systems","",""

(mentor); Chen, X. (mentor)","2010","The world’s energy requirement has been dominated by petroleum oil for centuries in many application fields, including transportation, household, and electricity. Mineral oil as an important insulating material in transformers has been used more than 150 years. Mineral oil application in power system equipment can be potentially hazardous to the environment especially when there are any incidents during operational time like transformer explosion which may cause a spill of oil to the soil or water stream. Due to the concerns about the deducing petroleum resources and the environmental issues, the alternative insulating oil with biodegradable characteristics has been attracted lots of attentions for a couple of decades. In this thesis, the dielectric properties of a type of mineral oil and a type of vegetable oil were investigated, and the effect of accelerated thermal aging on their dielectric properties were studied as well. Since it affects its dielectric properties, such as breakdown voltage, dielectric dissipation, and relative permittivity, the humidity of oil was measured along the aging process. The experimental results were compared with those from the previous research, showing that most of the test results obtained in this work was comparable with the previous work.","transformer insulation; dielectric properties; mineral oil; synthetic ester oil; breakdown voltage; dielectric dissipation factor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","High Voltage Technology and Management","",""

(mentor); Shahbahrami, A. (mentor)","2010","Texture, the pattern of information or arrangement of the structure found in an image, is an important feature of many image types.In a general sense, texture refers to surface characteristics and appearance of an object given by the size, shape, density, arrangement, proportion of its elementary parts. Due to the signification of texture information, texture feature extraction is a key function in various image processing applications, remote sensing and content-based image retrieval. Texture features can be extracted in several methods, using statistical, structural, model-based and transform information, in which the most common way is using the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM). GLCM contains the second-order statistical information of spatial relationship of pixels of an image. From GLCM, many useful textural properties can be calculated to expose details about the image content. However, the calculation of GLCM is very computationally intensive and time consuming. In this thesis, the optimizations in the calculation of GLCM and texture features are considered, different approaches to the structure of GLCM are compared. We also proposed parallel computing of GLCM and texture features using Cell Broadband Engine Architecture (Cell Processor). Experimental results show that our parallel approach reduces impressively the execution time for the GLCM texture feature extraction algorithm.","Texture Feature Extraction; image processing; parallel computing; cell processor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-10-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Embedded Systems","",""

Greek economy relies on the protection and the development of the coast, where major economic activities take place and where about 60% of the population lives. Despite the crucial role of the coastal zone in Greece, there is no organized integrated act with regard to coastal zone management. This project introduces the development and application of a database of all the Greek coasts. The main objective of this project is to take a first step towards an integrated coastal zone management, by developing a tool for primarily identifying any piece of Greek coast, and secondarily accomplishing a coastal classification with regard to physical characteristics and social-economic activities. In order to decide about the content of the database and to come up with a proper structure, it was first necessary to define the main issues related to the Greek coasts, such as touristic development or environmental protection of a wetland, as well as to identify the possible users of the database and the kind of information that they would demand. The range of possible users has proved to be very wide, and therefore the range of information included in the database is wide too. The main data fields are the following:  Type of coast: beach / rocky coast / wetland / port etc  Geographical aspects: coordinates / province / prefecture  Physical aspects: geological features/ beach length, width/ sediment grain size  Hydraulic aspects: wind speed and direction / significant wave height  Other general aspects: existence of fisheries / industry / urbanized areas etc. The database has been developed with web-based software and is accessible via the internet in the address www.greekcoasts.info.","Greece; Coastal Zone Management; database development; data analysis","en","student report","","","","","","","","2014-04-26","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

An inventory of different connection topologies is made for some of the sources generate AC power and others generate DC power. By comparative study on the system efficiency, the Mixed-coupled HPS is found to be the best layout and this layout is used for further investigation. By considering AC-load demand, solar irradiation and wind speed profiles of a typical site, the sizing approaches of the system elements are developed for the HPS. For the selected layout, eleven innovative Power Management Strategies (PMSs) are defined; and for each PMS Mathematical models are derived based on the power balance between the supply and the demand sides, charging/ discharging control of the battery and switching controls for the Genset. The different HPSs are modeled using MATLAB/Simulink blocks and simulation results are analyzed. The different PMSs result to different sizing of system elements, power sharing, fuel consumption& environmental impacts, and cycles of batteries in the lifetime of the system. Finally, the hybrid system of each PMS is investigated for its cost competitiveness and environmental impacts by taking the economical aspects and fuel consumption into consideration. It is found that RESs and/or HPSs are cost competitive over the system life, in spite of the huge initial capital costs, for the variable costs of the Genset overshadows its low initial capital investment .","battery bank; cost analysis; hybrid system; power management; renewable sources","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-07-28","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Power Engineering","","Electrical Power Processing","",""
