(mentor); Bijlsma, A.C. (mentor); Labeur, R.J. (mentor); Pourquie, M.J.B.M. (mentor)","2014","A Horizontal-axis tidal current turbine (HATT) is a device that converts tidal energy into electrical power. The HATT uses the tidal current to generate electricity. There are plans to implement HATTs on a commercial scale in tidal farms similar to wind-turbine farms. However, experience with prototype farm arrangements in the field is lacking. This thesis focuses on the hydrodynamics of HATTs. The main areas of interest are the power production and hydrodynamic impact assessment of a tidal farm. The HATT extracts momentum from the flow and as a result a wake forms downstream of the HATT. The wake can greatly influence the efficiency of HATTs positioned in the wake of another HATT, e.g. in tidal farms. HATTs may not only influence the efficiency of adjacent HATTs, but they may also affect the tidal motion on a large scale. The change of the tidal dynamics can in turn affect the power production of the HATT itself. The rotor diameter of HATTs are dimensioned to approximately half the water depth and in general HATTs convert 30 to 40% of the available energy in the current flowing through the rotor into electrical power. The relative large rotor diameter and high efficiency underline the hydrodynamic influence the HATT can have on the flow. A case study of a tidal farm conducted in the thesis shows that the hydrodynamic impact of a tidal farm can be significant and can extend to large areas. The assessment of the hydrodynamic behaviour of shallow seas, in which HATTs are situated, usually requires the use of a numerical program which solves the shallow water equations. Therefore, it is interesting to know what the contribution of such a program can be to the hydrodynamic assessment of HATTs. In this thesis modelling of HATTS in a in such a program (Delft3D) and in theoretical models are compared to experimental data. The theoretical models use the self-similar properties of the wake to describe its evolution. From literature and the experiments it is known that the ambient turbulence is important for the recovery of the wake and is more influential compared to the rotor blades. Among other things, due to the large rotor diameter the influence of the free-surface and sea bottom on the wake is important, as the wake can be bounded by these boundaries. The theoretical models are able to predict realistic values of the momentum extracted from the flow. At approximately x/D = 7 (x being the coordinate in stream wise direction and D the diameter of the rotor) downstream of the rotors the models predict the velocity within the desired accuracy of 15%. The accuracy of the theoretical models can be improved by setting more accurate boundary conditions and accounting for the influence of the free-surface and sea bottom. Modelling of the HATT in Delft3D-FLOW focusses on large scale effects of the HATTs. The rotor of the HATT is modelled by a momentum sink. The momentum sink models the absolute momentum extraction from the flow. Delft3D is able to simulate the entire velocity field within the accuracy of 15% from approximately x/D = 5. Consequently, the velocity is predicted more accurately by Delft3D compared to the theoretical models. For locations different from the centre line of the wake, the desired accuracy is reached closer to the HATT, e.g. for x/D <5. Overall Delft3D shows good potential to be used as a practical tool for the implementation of a tidal farm.","Turbines; Green energy; HATT","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Volker, L. (mentor); De Haan, R. (mentor); Kassels, O. (mentor)","2014","One could say the Dutch building industry is an inefficient industry. Every year almost ten percent of the turnover of Dutch construction firms is wasted by unnecessary mistakes and poor collaboration (USP, 2012). Integrating and managing information more actively and forcing all stakeholders to collaborate during the life cycle of a building could be an adequate and effective way to reduce these problems. One way of doing this is Building Information Modelling (BIM). BIM is a buzzword, and therefore the definition of BIM from BuildingSmart (formerly known as IAI), a platform for knowledge exchange regarding BIM (BuildingSmart, 2012) is taken as a guideline. BuildingSmart provides. BuildingSmart’s definition of BIM runs as follows: “Building Information Modelling is a business process for generating and leveraging building data to design, construct and operate the building during its lifecycle. BIM allows all stakeholders to have access to the same information at the same time through interoperability between technology platforms”. Based on an explorative literature research, five 2013 observations on BIM are addressed:  Building owners are reluctant to use BIM during the whole lifecycle of a building;  Public authorities are experimenting with BIM on construction projects;  Other countries and industries are ahead of the Dutch construction industry in the use of BIM;  The resistance of non-BIM users is increasing;  BIM is mainly restricted to the stages of design and realisation, and not to the operations phase. From these observations it becomes clear that BIM is attracting more attention in the Dutch building industry. BIM, however, is mainly used in the stages of the building process up to realization. This is why the added value of BIM for design and engineering firms is extensively known. Owners and operators have thus far failed to see the added value of BIM for themselves. As initiators of the building process, owners and operators remain reluctant in their use of BIM during the whole life cycle. This seems to have become a barrier for the wide use of BIM in the Netherlands. To deal with this barrier, this research conducts a broad analysis of the currently deployed information management by owners during the operations phase. Based on the conclusions of the current information management the added value of BIM can be explored. Samenvatting Jaarlijks worden er in de Nederlandse bouw- en vastgoedsector vele miljoenen euro’s, gemiddeld 10 procent van de bouwomzet, verspild door onnodige fouten en gebrekkige samenwerking (USP, 2012). Het actief integreren en beheren van informatie e?n partijen dwingen tot samenwerking gedurende de gehele levenscyclus van een bouwwerk lijkt een goede methode om deze problemen te verhelpen. Een concrete manier voor het verzamelen en integreren van informatie is Building Information Modeling (BIM). Uit een orie?nterende literatuurstudie volgt dat BIM terrein wint in de bouw- en vastgoedsector. BIM wordt daarbij voornamelijk toegepast als een middel in de fases tot en met de realisatiefase, waardoor de meerwaarde voor de ontwerpende en bouwende partijen al uitgebreid belicht is. Opdrachtgevers zien de meerwaarde van BIM echter nog niet in. Opdrachtgevers, als initiator van het proces, zijn hierdoor terughoudend in het gebruiken of voorschrijven van BIM over de gehele levenscyclus van een bouwwerk. Dit lijkt een barrie?re te vormen voor de toepassing van BIM. Het onderzoek is verdeeld over twee delen: een analyse en een ontwerp. Dit met als doel om op basis van een analyse van het huidige informatiemanagement tot een verkenning van de toegevoegde waarde van BIM in de beheerfase voor opdrachtgevers te komen. In een ontwerp is dit vervolgens uitgewerkt tot een concreet model voor BIM in de beheerfase.","BIM; Bouw Informatie Model; Beheerfase; Beheren; Augmented Reality; Operations; Building Information Model; Building Information Management; (Semi) publieke opdrachtgevers; Toegevoegde waarde; Informatiemanagement","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-01-31","Architecture and The Built Environment","Real Estate and Housing","","Design and Construction Management","",""

The rectangular grid of the city and the cubic high-rises suggest a bold form for the new UNEC building. Starting with a simple cubic form and to develop the final shape of the building from it, makes it more contextually responsive and creates a unity of forms between the new building and the existing ones. In relation to the natural surroundings, the boldness of the selected cubic from contrasts with the fluidness and motion of the river nearby, which makes the building stand out. This rectangular from is then divides horizontally into several identical parts being pushed out from one corner, suggesting a piled up shape in an organized manner which creates an overhang on one side and terraces on the other. This spontaneous repetition of forms stacking on top of each other creates a rhythm in the building’s form and at the same time the overhang brings a sense of instability which contrasts with the existing UN building’s forms, making it stand out while connected. This distinction is also visible from the situation plan where it’s positioned off-center closer to the river to avoid having shadows casted on it by the nearby tall buildings which contrasts with the location of the General Assembly building located at the center of the site. Also the building is rotated 45 degrees emphasizing it among the rest of the surrounding buildings. So while being unified with them it also stands out and creates a sense of dominance. These contrasts help each building to have their own character while being connected. Use of overhang in front of the building leads the visitors towards it and demonstrate itself as an entry point. A double height ceiling level at the entry point leads to the central atrium 4 floors high and 1 floor deep to the basement level. This height gradation makes for hierarchy and a majestic entrance which generates a step by step interior routing. All these features are symmetrical in the building, balancing the from, making it visually calm and pleasing. The public space is then located at the right side of the site making a connection between the main road at the front and the water front at the back of the site, aiding in the continuation of the public space, keeping it’s integrity and unity. I employed the context, urban typology and their relation to spatial qualities which aided my design of the UNEC to be more rational and well structured which is a necessity for a strong thesis project and I believe that I have been able to achieve this goal in this project with the help of my tutors.","Environmental Council","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-01-31","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Materialization/Strategic Architectural Design Development","",""

(mentor); Hanssen, R.F. (mentor)","2014","The Black Desert in the east of Jordan has recently gained attention in the archaeological domain due to the discovery of pre-historical structures and a vast amount of rockart depictions. The Department of Near Eastern Archaeology of the University of Leiden has started investigating the cultural developments within this area from c. 1000 BC to 500 AD under the ‘Jebel Qurma Archaeological Landscape Project’. The main archaeological structures of interest are known as ‘The Works of the Old Men’. These structures are clearly visible from an aerial perspective, but hard to recognize at ground level. Furthermore, they are extensive in scale as they are known to occur throughout the whole Arabian peninsula. Until now, structures have been mainly documented based on human visual inspection of aerial and spaceborne optical remote sensing. This research covers the results of a case study on the use of spaceborne optical and radar remote sensing imagery for archaeological site detection in the Near East in an automatic way. This will facilitate faster analysis of the area of interest, as well as the Arabian peninsula as a whole. For the research, imagery from several spaceborne optical and radar imagery was acquired, most notably from the CORONA, IKONOS, ALOS and TerraSAR-X satellites. Fieldwork was performed in the region of interest as well, to place corner reflectors and perform GPS measurements of structures of interest. As the corner reflectors were captured in the last two acquisitions of the ordered TerraSAR-X imagery, they served to improve the geo-referencing of the radar imagery. All imagery was processed to form a co-registered, geo-referenced imagery stack for use in feature detection. Based on observations during fieldwork and the literature available, the main structures of interest were parametrized. An automated test using the GPS measurements was used to determine the suitability of layers of the imagery stack for automatic feature detection based on their normalized cross correlation. However, the currently obtained radar imagery proved to have insufficient spatial resolution to allow for automatic feature detection. Two different kinds of detection algorithms were designed for feature detection: the Direction of Constant Gradient (DoCG) and the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) approach. Of these two, the LoG approach performed better in the detection of structures. The end result provides a faster way to analyze large areas in an intuitive way. Possible archaeological sites can thus be directly identified and documented.","archaeology; site-detection; remote sensing; SAR; GPS; corner reflectors; geo-referencing; image processing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","Geomatics","",""

The storm was a disaster for New York City, causing around 50 billion US dollars of damage. Research shows that 75% of the expected annual dam-age in New York occurs around the Jamaica Bay area. Another problem that has been going on for several decades is the disappearance of marsh islands. Due to human interference and effects of climate change, the bay area has been altered in such a way that the sustainability of the mashes is indispute. This research combines the two problems and gives a comprehensive overview of measures that can be taken to improve both flood risk mitigation and the sustainability of marsh islands. Thereport focuses on an open Jamaica Bay. This means that scenarios in which a hydraulic barrieris implemented in the inlet are not researched. The study gives an answer to the question which perimeter measures could be implemented to improve flood protection for the Jamaica Bay area. Furthermore, it elaborates on the best way to improve marsh islands within Jamaica Bay and to what extent these islands have an effect on incoming storm surges. The Jamaica Bay area is characterized by a dense residential area, an estuarine ecosystem and several key infrastructure assets. The bay is surrounded by Brooklyn and South Queens, New York’s two boroughs with the highest population. The boroughs are vulnerable to flooding, and current SLR projections exacerbate this danger. The area lacks a comprehensive system of coastal protection measures. In addition, uncontrolled structural erosion is to be found. The waters and wetlands of the bay serve as breeding grounds and are a critical migratory stopover for a surprising diversity of birds. The bay is also of great importance to a great variety of butterflies, visiting seals, sea turtles and other species. Furthermore, the area needs to be shared with one of North America’s most important air transportation hubs, namely, John F. Kennedy International Air-port. In 2012 JFK handled almost 50 million passengers. The area is also host to several infrastructure assets, which greater parts of the city rely on, e.g., land and waterroutes and water pollution control plants. The system of measures is designed for a storm with a return period of 100 years. This is according to the policy currently implemented in the USA. The governing water conditions during such a storm for the Jamaica Bay area have been subtracted from FEMA Preliminary Work Maps. For the Atlantic side of Rockaway Peninsula the governing storm surge level is 5.18 m and the governing wave height is 3.35 m. Within Jamaica Bay these values are respectively 4.27 m and 2.8 m. The design lifetime for the measures is 50 years, which means that the measures to be implemented still have to prevent flooding due to a 1/100 year storm in 2065. Sea Level Rise has been approximated to be 0.65 m in 2065 with the use of the most recent IPCC report. When looking at the safety of the Jamaica Bay area as a whole, it should be noted that the same boundary conditions should be used for all of the measures. Also, the measures should be connected in a way that guarantees the safety of the hinterland. The area analysis shows that there is a variable amount of space to implement a coastal protection measure throughout the Atlantic side of the peninsula. Therefore, because of its size, a dune alone would not suffice. Both the energy impact of the storm and the hydraulic level is taken into account. However, it is possible to combine safety, aesthetics and ecology to protect this area. Also, when the bay side of the Rockaway Peninsula is taken into account, the area analysis shows several different situations. It is found that there is a limited amount of space available for measures. Therefore, raising Beach Channel Drive is one of the proposed measures in this particular area. The proposed solutions integrate multiple functions or take up a small amount of space, e.g. flood walls. When looking at further perimeter measures, the report also accounts for solutions for JFK Airport. The boundary conditions show that within a one mile radius no bird habitat can be constructed. Furthermore, because pilots need a clear vision of the runway, no measures can be applied that permanently reach above ground level. Therefore, temporary measures like self-closing flood barriers are proposed. The Jamaica Bay area encompasses a lot of infrastructure which disrupts the continuation of the shorelines. Hence, there are a couple of exceptions when looking at perimeter flood protection measures. The report briefly gives possible solutions for all of the exceptions within the area. The different creeks are elaborated on as well as Floyd Bennett Field and Broad Channel. For each of these exceptions, different options of protection are given and sketches are made on how they would look like. It can be concluded that it is possible to secure the whole perimeter of the Jamaica Bay area to protect the inland form flooding during 1/100 year storm surges. A part of the research is analyzing the effectiveness of vegetation on wave height reduction. Reduction in wave height enables a reduced levee height. Also a hardened revetment would not be required resulting in a more ecological solution. From this research can be concluded that vegetation suffices in reducing wave height. The stems of the applied vegetation (i.e. Spartina Alterniflora) are modeled as vertical rigid cylinders, based on an article of Mendez and Lodosa (2004). Due to the drag between the cylinders and the current velocity induced by the waves, the wave height is reduced. An important parameter is the vegetation density. The research states that a steeper living shorelines slope leads to a low-er mean water depth. The lower water depth results in a larger wave dissipation. For the Canarsie Pier area the reduction of vegetation based on the current slope is 40% and the reduction for a steep slope is 75%. However, it should be noted that constructing a steep slope requires a lot of landfill and, therefore, is an expensive activity. Therefore, another approach is advised for the Howard Beach area. For this area the current shoreline slope will suffice in reducing wave energy. At Howard Beach the large available space results in a wave reduction of 75% over 350 m. Aside from perimeter measures, the influence of dimensions of the bay are researched. Shallowing is preferred regarding flood risk mitigation. The results show that shallowing the inlet and/or the channels in the inner-bay can contribute significantly regarding the expected storm surge level in the bay. Shallowing the inlet results in the highest storm surge reduction. On the other hand, restoration of wetlands hardly shows any influence on the surge. However, wetlands can have a positive effect on wave height reduction. Looking at the sustainability and ecology of wetlands in Jamaica Bay, several remarks and design directions can be formulated. In the last century the area has shown dynamic features. To address the exhaustiveness of the area, the study area is analyzed with an equilibrium theory for the outer delta, basin and inlet. The approach complies with measures and changes in the bay, which have occurred in the past. Therefore, it is advised to apply a system approach for restoration of the bay, instead of the current strategy of local measures. In practice this means that wetlands can be created in a more efficient way, by carefully thinking about their placement. Also the study shows that many channels are deeper then needed, eventually, shallowing these channels can have a positive effect regarding sustainability. In conclusion, restoration of marsh islands improves ecology and could improve sustainability. Delft3D is used to evaluate the results of the storm surge mitigation and the sustainability of thesystem. A high resolution, small scale model with a high resolution (70m) curvilinear grid is forced at the boundaries by Sandy conditions to simulate a ‘1/100 year storm’. Results from the model calculations are discussed in the report. Results The three most important conclusions of this study are given below: - It is advised to implement a system approach - Restoration of marsh islands improves ecology and could improve sustainability but hardly affects flood risk mitigation - Shallowing the channels is preferred regarding both flood risk mitigation and sustainability","USA; flood risk; superstorm Sandy; mitigation; Jamaica Bay","en","student report","TU Delft, Department of Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","40.6181246, -73.828673"

One of the implications of this strategy is that directives will have to be updated. One of these directives is the ecodesign directive. Since the directive currently only focuses on energy-efficiency a study is underway to investigate if material resource efficiency requirements could be incorporated in the directive and its . implementing measuses. This will have influence on how products have to be designed. The main challenge for this thesis is to find out how regulation and legislation might possibly change and to find out which implications this has on the design of flat panel televisions. Several requirements are proposed by DG JRC for flatpanel TV design : »» Improved dismantling of key components »» Declaration of CRM (Indium Content) »» Improved recyclability of plastics (marking of plastic parts) Disassembly of a current TV shows that mainly the first requirement is difficult to meet with current TVs. A literature review is conducted to identify design guidelines for improving the disassembly of products. The following aspects were identified: »» The selection and use of compatible materials »» The design of components and product architecture »» The selection and use of fasteners With this information, a concept TV is designed, which has a renewed product architecture in which those components most critical for recycling are grouped together. Assessment of the renewed design shows that it is possible to meet the proposed requirements, but that TV design will radically have to change.","Disassembly; Flat panel television; Product hierarchy; Legislation; Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

Supplier selection can be best described as a highly complex process due to the involvement of many, sometimes conflicting, both qualitative and quantitative criteria. The goal of supplier selection is to select the most suitable supplier(s) for meeting a company’s specific needs. This research presents a case study on solving the supplier selection problem in the airline retail industry by means of a two-phased methodology. The first phase of the methodology employs a conjunctive screening method, which aims to reduce the initial set of potential suppliers prior to the comprehensive final choice phase. The second phase of the methodology employs a fuzzy AHP in which suppliers are evaluated against thirty-six sub-criteria. By means of combining the decision maker’s preferences and experts’ knowledge, the employment of the developed methodology will eventually result into a ranking of suppliers that enables to select the most suitable supplier(s).","airline industry; conjunctive screening method; fuzzy analytic hierarchy process; retail; supplier selection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-01-30","Technology, Policy and Management","Infrastructure Systems & Services","","Transport & Logistics","",""

The essential objective is to repair and revitalize the area in the heart of the historical part of the city that apart from the mosque is in a very bad state, by bringing additional public program in, to accommodate for every facet of life in this metropolitan city. The project marries the old fabric below with a new public space above that facilitates virtually all kinds of public program. It consists of three stacked interpretations of universal space. A plinth that negates the hierarchy caused by the topography that does not rely on program to give it its form but rather, inspired by the permanence of monuments, is capable of housing any kind of program for any period of time. On top of the plinth on grade with Fatih mosque the possibility is created for large public programs to take shape as a multitude of expressive buildings that, together with the mosque, form a unity in diversity. The new public space is the interface between, vertically, the existing city and the intensified public program and horizontally, the collective space around the mosque and the new square while at the same time providing all the services for the large public programs on top to allow them to be as autonomous as they can be.","Istanbul; Fatih; earthquake; deterioration; urban transformation; intensification; a-temporality; manifestation of ideals; universal; Dom-ino+; interior street; 3d pocket; building as a city","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-02-28","Architecture and The Built Environment","Public Building","","Capital Region - Istanbul","",""

(mentor); Pont, S.C. (mentor)","2014","Light has always been an important aspect in our daily lives. Many years back the people on earth only had light from the sun to rely on, after that the flame and other light sources like the incandescent lamp and LED lighting were invented. A pioneer in lighting design (Richard Kelly) defined lighting as three different groups; ambient lighting, focal glow lighting and play of brilliance lighting. Ambient lighting illuminates everything around us; focal glow lighting illuminates certain objects or areas; play of brilliance lighting itself attracts the attention. Therefore play of brilliance lighting can be seen as a more decorative lighting. The focus during this graduation project is on decorative lighting in combination with translucent porcelain tiles. These tiles are produced by the design company Studio Barbara Vos. The tiles are made from a special porcelain mixture that uses ashes from bones to create the translucency. In combination with a textile imprint, the tile shows different light intensities over the tile when it is placed in front of a light source. In order to create a wall with porcelain tiles and light behind them, the lighting product is developed during this project. During the research phase information about ceramics, lighting and their combination is discussed. The variety in lighting created a comparison between five light sources where the LEDs and the LED-strips turned out to be the most suitable for this product. The choices are based on a long durability, small size, rather low costs and the flexibility for the design. The target group for the final product is a group of people that have more money to spend than a regular household. This was already a predefined target group because of the rather high costs of the porcelain tiles itself. Surveys amongst people within the design industry confirmed this target group and also showed that the product will be attractive to hotels and restaurants. By looking at products and their prices of competitors in the lighting and tiling industry a price range was defined for the final product. The complete analysis phase resulted in a list of requirement that was divided into four different groups; production, use, installation and maintenance. The most important design aspect were derived from the requirements and listed below: - homogeneous light - dimensions - connecting - light intensity - wall mounting - heat management - maintenance All these design aspects created a basis for the concept development. After idea generation and testing different models eventually three concepts were created. By using the design aspects in combination with a Harris Profile, the most promising concept was chosen and optimized during the embodiment phase. The final design is a lighting product with the dimensions of 150mm x 150mm x 18mm which can be placed behind a porcelain tile. The product carries a diffusing acrylic sheet enclosed by RGB LED-strips on two sides. These strips shine light into the sides of the acrylic which causes the light to exit the sheet perpendicular to the LED-strips. The light from the LED-strips spreads over the complete surface of the acrylic which causes the desired homogeneous light. Multiple lights can be connected by using the two connectors on the product that can be used as both an input as an output. The used RGB LED-strips enable the user to set the desired colour or effect. A prototype of the product in combination with porcelain tiles was build and a user test was conducted. The results show that the product looks attractive and that it would be suitable for hotels and restaurants and wellness centres. The colours on the remote control do not resemble the colours of the illuminated tiles perfectly; therefore a recommendation was done to find a suitable control system. People do perceive the illuminated lights as looking luminous under bright and darker circumstances.","lighting; experience; LED; porcelain","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2016-01-31","Industrial Design Engineering","Integrated Product Design","","","",""

(mentor); Haagsman, E.M. (mentor)","2014","Pets Place is the largest pet retail chain in the Netherlands. It is a franchor with about 170 stores in the Netherlands. Apart from the physical stores, Pets Place also has a website containing a webhop, the online store. More and more products are bought online at the expense of the physical retailers. The internet can be seen as a threat, but when applied in the physical retail environment, this threat can become an opportunity. Pets Place is already planning to introduce a webkiosk in their stores in the near future, containing the website including the webshop and this way disclosing the complete assortment to the customer. This is a first step towards creating an omni-channel strategy but in order to succeed it will have to become one integrated concept. For this concept to be a success, the customer of Pets Place was to be mapped. Research in the Pets Place store showed that there is not one specific customer of Pets Place. Four personas containing the main characteristics of the customers interviewed in the research were set up to create people to design for. The research also showed that convenience is one of the main reasons why customers come to the store. It also showed that experienced staff in the store is required, as customers ask for advice in the stores. Quality products for a good price is what customers want as well. Customers would be more loyal to a pet store if a loyalty program would be available. To improve the online experience of the customer, big data should be used to make its usage more personal. Taking in mind the objectives of the three different parties involved in this project, |1| Pets Place as a company, |2| the retailer (franchisor) and |3| the customer, four focus points were generated. Those focus points are:  Advice  Products & information  Sales  Loyalty system Convenience is a big motivator for the customers to come to Pets Place. In order to be open at any time and at any place, the decision was made to introduce a smartphone application. The smartphone app, the tablet app (on the webkiosk) in the store and the website will together form the design in which the customer can move from one device to another with ease. Advice – is mostly looked for on Google or in the store. The retailer is already in the store to give the advice, which leaves the website as the best place to show the advice. Products & information – products and information is the main focus of the tablet, showing the complete assortment to the customers. Also on the smartphone app and on the website Products and information is important, though not as a central part as in the tablet app. Sales – the research showed that the customers look for sales before they come to the store, which makes the app and the website the perfect place to show relevant sales to the customer. Loyalty system – the loyalty system links all three elements and is present in every part of the system. Information about the shopping habits of the customers is shared with Pets Place, who can in return offer a personalised shopping experience. The smartphone application is like a personal assistant, containing all the personal information from its user and using it to give for example personalised advertisements or product information. The tablet in the store should function like a showroom, drawing attention to the products of Pets Place and providing more information when asked for. The website is the place where all the focus points come together, Advice, products & information, sales and the loyalty system. In a user test the navigation through the apps of the smartphone and the tablet was tested. The smartphone app was clear to the users, although an instruction video after first opening the app would help discovering all the different functionalities of the app. The tablet in the store had to be clear at one glance because customers will probably not use the tablet frequently. The navigation was clear, but more feedback about being logged in was required. The designed system and its elements, form the start of an integrated omni-channel retail experience of Pets Place.","retail; app; design; smartphone; tablet; online; offline","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

One innovation of the project is using a distributed architecture to replace current centralized system to increase robustness and extensibility. As a core component of wireless lighting control system, there are many wireless communication protocols can be applied in distributed system. We choose BLE protocol which is a new wireless communication protocol as the communication protocol of distributed system to do research because BLE has a huge potential in low power consumption. However, there exist some problems in BLE based distributed lighting control system. One of these problems is a commissioning problem. The commissioning problem we come up with is that a constrained device (no screen) router, cannot display a scanning list of BLE based lamps. This prevents specific BLE based lamps which user want to remotely control, from securely joining in the existing access point (router). The main purpose of this thesis is to solve the commissioning problem in a BLE based intelligent lighting control system to make BLE become an appropriate candidate in this field. An innovative solution, developed on standardized BLE protocol, which is used for overcoming the commissioning problem through utilizing modified BLE protocol in a smartphone. The modified BLE protocol is a application protocol. With the modified BLE protocol stack, a third device which is a Commissioning Tool(smartphone) can securely instruct specific BLE based lamps to router. As part of this thesis, a demo was set up and the solution to the commissioning problem has been tested on this system. Results proved that the solution was valid to solve the commissioning problem of BLE based intelligent lighting control system.","BLE; intelligent lighting control system; commissioning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-04-30","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","Electrical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Spruit, R. (mentor); Blom, C.B.M. (mentor)","2014","Monitoring (geotechnical) constructions is often based upon displacement measurements. However, these measurements do not offer information about the stiffness behaviour of a soil-structure system. A loss of stiffness might be observed as a decrease of the system’s eigenfrequencies. This research investigates if monitoring of ambient vibrations can be used to observe a change in the system’s stiffness. Stiffness monitoring of structural parts (e.g. steel and concrete beams) using vibrations is already common. These implementations are based on measuring natural frequencies and mode shapes. Any change in structural stiffness results in a change in these modal characteristics of the structure. A technique similar to this, but operating in the lower frequency range (i.e. below 300 hertz), is already used to derive the shear elasticity of soil. These techniques are known as seismic methods, and they record body and surface waves. The denser and stiffer the layer of the strata is, the faster it vibrates and the faster the phase velocity of the recorded waves will be. This provides an estimate of the strength of the soil and its ability to resist permanent deformation (i.e. its elastic behaviour). It is also used to find boundaries between different soil layers. In this research, the possibility of monitoring a relative change in stiffness during construction works is investigated. By a relative change is meant the change in stiffness with respect to the initial stiffness, expressed as a percentage. The initial stiffness will be coupled to the initial eigenfrequency of the system. A changed eigenfrequency can then be coupled to a percentage of this initial stiffness. The soil-structure system used for the analytical and empirical part of this research is part of a railway bridge in Nijmegen. In Nijmegen, diaphragm walls are constructed to a depth of more than 20 meters, surrounding the old pillars of this bridge. It is assumed that, during construction works, there will be a change in the system’s stiffness due to the installation of the diaphragm walls. The eigenfrequencies of the soil-structure system are determined by continuous vibration monitoring of ambient vibrations, where the ambient vibrations are caused by the railway traffic. When the stiffness k decreases, the eigenfrequency of the system should also decrease. Two models have been analysed to simulate the bridge: a single and a double mass-spring model. Multiple parameters of these mass-spring models are modified in order to determine which parameter influences the eigenfrequency of both the soil and the structural part of the system. From the mass-spring model it follows that the dominant frequency in the lower frequency range, between 5 and 15 hertz, represents the eigenfrequency of the soil. The dominant frequency in the higher frequency range, between 40 and 50 hertz, represents the eigenfrequency of the structure. With a changing stiffness of the construction, the eigenfrequency between 40 and 50 hertz changes significantly while the change in eigenfrequency around 10 hertz is insignificant. When the stiffness of the soil decreases, the eigenfrequency around 10 hertz decreases significantly while the eigenfrequency between 40 and 50 hertz remains almost unchanged. With the mass-spring model it is also concluded that only a change in stiffness relative to the initial stiffness can be monitored. A Fast Fourier Transform is used to convert the measured data into a frequency spectrum. When there is a phase difference between the first and the last data point a so called leakage occurs. Since it is impossible to determine the phase of the signal when dealing with ambient vibrations, a phase difference cannot be avoided. Due to leakage, the velocities in the frequency spectrum do not correspond well to the real velocities. Actual velocities may be more than 30% higher than the velocities obtained after a Fast Fourier Transform. With the recorded datasets of both the author, in cooperation with the Municipality of Rotterdam, and Fugro GeoServices B.V. it is investigated if the eigenfrequencies are changing during the construction works. The initial data is compared with the data recorded during and after the construction works. The dataset recorded by the author contains continuous vibration measurement in three directions, recorded by 10 geophones with a sampling frequency of 1000 hertz. The datasets are recorded on two different days. The first day represents the initial phase. The second day represents the construction phase. From these measurements it can be concluded that different types of trains do not have an influence on the observed eigenfrequencies. On the other hand, they do have an influence on the magnitude of the recorded vibration. In between the two days of measurement, hydraulic jacks were installed in between the girders and the pillar of the bridge to correct the settlements that occurred during the construction of the diaphragm walls. These jacks have made the joint in between the girder and the pillar more rigid. Due to this, the girder is acting stiffer than before. From the dataset it can be concluded that the eigenfrequency of the structure increases significantly after installation of the jacks. The frequency peak values representing the pillar and the girder increase. The eigenfrequency of the soil remains almost unchanged after installation of the jacks. This conclusion is consistent with the results that followed from the analytical model, as described above. With the dataset recorded by Fugro GeoServices B.V. it is possible to analyse and compare the results of the initial phase, the construction phase and the post phase. For the analysis only the recorded traces are used. These traces contain continuous vibration measurements during 2 seconds, with a sampling frequency of 1024 hertz. The lower frequency range, between 0 and 25 hertz, of multiple monitored traces is analysed and compared. From these results, it can be concluded that a change in stiffness of the soil can be observed by a shift in eigenfrequencies. A decrease in eigenfrequency compared to the initial measured eigenfrequency is observed during the construction works. The decrease is small, but comparable to the decrease that was expected beforehand. In the post phase, when the construction works are finished, the eigenfrequency increases again. This leads to the conclusion that the stiffness has recovered again. Observing a change in stiffness of a soil-structure system by shifts in eigenfrequencies is possible, but only a relative stiffness change can be observed (i.e. the change in stiffness with respect to the initial stiffness). It is possible to monitor the shifts in eigenfrequencies by measuring ambient vibrations. It should be noted that with this monitoring system it is not possible to monitor settlements. The outcome of this research is relevant for stiffness monitoring of constructions. For projects where the deformation of a construction is rather irrelevant if the stiffness is not being influenced significantly, a vibration monitoring system which monitors shifts in eigenfrequency can offer information about the dynamic response (i.e. stiffness behaviour) of the construction.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2014","Plated structures are widely used in many engineering structures. Most designs are poor in resisting compressive forces. Usually, the buckling phenomena observed in compressed conditions take place rather suddenly and may lead to catastrophic structural failure. Therefore it is important to know the buckling capacities of the plates and stiffeners in order to avoid premature failure. However not every model and/or analysis is suitable for an accurate buckling assessment by a FEM analysis. Buckling is a complicated phenomenon. Many properties and parameters influence the buckling strength. Most of the time, details such as imperfections, material properties or residual stresses are not included within the model. Hence, the lack of a satisfying analysis is tried to resolve with a combination of linear FEM results and standards. In the standards, just as in most literature, the behaviour of a panel is simplified by subdividing it into individual sections; plate fields and beam-columns. This study mainly aims to define the conversion of linear FEM stress results into input design stresses needed to check buckling of plated structures with the standards. The report first contains an in-depth research into what problems arise with different buckling modes and the parameters that define these problems. Furthermore several proposals for implementation of the standards are explained; plate buckling, local stiffener buckling, flexural stiffener buckling and torsional stiffener buckling. A more extensive part is about the validation of the plate buckling implementation. Linearization of in-plane stress distributions on plate fields is researched. Results show an overall allowable and good implementation method by subdividing the real stresses into longitudinal stress gradient, transverse stress gradient and remaining shear portions.","finite element analyses; standards; plate buckling; column buckling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","(ME) Transportation Engineering","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

(mentor); Van der Veen, O. (mentor); Calabretta, G. (mentor)","2014","In this thesis the subject of service implementation is investigated. From the research findings a framework is constructed which serves as the basis of a toolbox. The thesis fulfills an assignment that was posted by service design agency Ideate from Amersfoort who wanted to become more effective in the implementation of newly developed services. Ideate consultants always work closely with their clients to develop services and experienced difficulty in implementing these services. Service implementation is a relatively new subject that is underexposed in the academic literature. Where in research on New Product Development much attention is paid to each stage of the development process, for New Service Development this is only true concerning the earlier stages of a project. This project was carried out by a gradation student who worked internally in the company during the project. The project consisted of a research, an analysis and a toolbox development phase. The research consisted of a literature review, expert interviews with experts from the field and case studies of four of Ideate’s cases. In analysing the findings of this research insights are generated and a framework is constructed. This framework consist of the perspective of integrated service implementation. This term indicates that the implementation of the service that is to be developed needs to be addressed continuously and iteratively throughout the project and in parallel with the actual development of the new service. Additionally integrated service implementation consist of three themes: Process Understanding: All involved stakeholders should to a certain degree adopt and understand the user-centered iterative NSD process used in the development and implementation of the service. Stakeholder Management: All parties and individuals involved in service implementation and development should be identified, involved, informed and coordinated by favouring open communication and continuous alignment of objectives throughout the entire NSD. Finding Fit: The new service development project should be continuously aligned with the client company’s capabilities, strategy, culture and objectives. This framework formed the basis of the development of a toolbox. The toolbox makes the information from this framework and the insights accessible to and directly applicable for the Ideate consultants. The toolbox intervenes at three moments in the service development project. Check-In: at the start of a project at which the project is positioned with the help of two positioning tools. Check-Up: during the project a check-up moment will be introduced at which the project leader and consultants discuss the status of the implementation of the service. Since implementation is continuous these check-ups take place throughout the entire project. Continuous support tools: principle cards and a project journey make the knowledge from this framework easily accessible to the consultants.","service innovation; implementation; consultantcy; innovation process","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

Development of DrESSeD Framework: An alignment of supplier selection criteria with customers’ preferences","Kokkotas, G.","Verbraeck, A. (mentor); Kortmann, L.J. (mentor); Cunningham, S. (mentor); Wenzler, I. (mentor)","2014","This research is based on the development of a supply chain method that could help firms/organizations to take strategic decisions. DrESSeD framework is a simulation-based framework for strategic decision making support. The proposed framework tries to directly relate supplier selection criteria, customers’ preferences and manufacturer’s performance. The acronym DrESSeD stands for (D)isc(r)ete (E)vent (S)imulation for (S)trat(e)gic (D)ecisions. The need for more coordination and control on supply chain activities, processes, and uncertainties within and between organisations caused the creation of the concept of Supply Chain Management (SCM). Strategic supply chain management can provide companies with the appropriate strategic knowledge in order to obtain competitive advantage and improve their performance (Hult et.al., 2007). Companies make high level strategic supply chain decisions considering issues in the fields of product development, customers, manufacturing, and suppliers (Murray, 2012). Simulation approaches have been used as decision support systems for supply chain networks. Two most popular simulation approaches are systems dynamics (SD) and discrete event simulation (DES) (Tako & Robinson, 2012). Although, strategic issues are commonly modeled by SD, only a few models exist for solving strategic issues using discrete event simulation. Supplier selection simulation is an unexplored area in the field of supply chain networks (Tako & Robinson, 2012). Although, strategic issues are commonly modeled by SD, few models stand for solving strategic issues using discrete event simulation (Tako & Robinson, 2012). This finding creates a need for exploring the area of supplier selection processes using discrete event simulation. In addition, companies do care about the reaction of customers in the market. Moreover, strategic supply chain decisions are related with issues in suppliers’ and customers’ tier (Murray, 2012). Finally, it can be useful for companies to take into consideration customers’ preferences for the decisions in their supplier selection processes. As a conclusion, the use of discrete event simulation for studying supply chain strategic issues, focusing on supplier selection processes and customers’ preferences, creates the knowledge gap of this research. This master thesis report is expected to scientifically contribute by answering the question: How can we support strategic decision making of firms/organizations in the dynamic supplier selection process, using discrete event simulation, taking into consideration specific selection criteria, customer’s preferences and market characteristics? Considering the research question, there is need for an appropriate method that can explore supply chain strategic issues, using discrete event simulation in order to support companies in strategic decision making. A simulation based framework is the method that used in this report. Framework is a conceptual structure, intended to serve as a support tool. In other words, it creates something more generic, which it can be expanded in the future. Existing supplier selection frameworks have not considered customers’ needs and/or simulation approaches (Ng, 2008), (Jahani et.al, 2011), (Vijayvagy, 2012). With the increased competition in global supply chain networks, the significance of vendor selection based on supply chain risks is high (Liu et.al, 2011). There is need for a new framework, which has simple structure, can be easily used in different environments, and can bring together firm’s performance, suppliers’ performance and customers’ preferences. DrESSeD framework is a new proposal in the field of supplier selection using discrete event simulation. The framework consists of three main parts. Part I helps the end user to apply the Design Code Method in order to analyse the performance/behavior of suppliers. The Design Code is a method that based on Boolean theory and uses different attributes of suppliers for the determination of suppliers’ performance. Part II is proposing to companies how to conduct an analysis, regarding suppliers’ selection criteria and customers’ preferences. Both the supplier selection criteria and customer’s choices will be studied by discrete choice theory. Part III teaches the user how to use a simulation model in order to calculate market share. The generic discrete event simulation model is showing the basic processes of the supply chain network and includes two main functions: the supplier selection processes, and the customer choice process. The supply chain network consists of two major suppliers, one manufacturer and N customers. This is the case for the moment, used to validate the framework. In future, this number may be extended to model any number of competing suppliers. Customers’ choice are determined by cost, time, quality, and innovation (Cohen & Roussel 2005). Based on these four decision variables, customers make their final choice for purchasing a product/service. Considering the appropriate evaluation factors for supplier selection, the author selected four factors (Strategic, Operational, Financial, and Risk) that proposed in Accenture’s supplier selection report (Accenture, 2011). DrESSeD framework was evaluated through a case study. From practical perspective, case studies help companies and organizations evaluate the advantages of methods and tools. The case study for this report focuses on the Dutch smart phone market. Since the needed supplied evaluation factors could not be found in scientific sources or Accenture’s reports, the information from an empirical study presenting generic evaluation factors for supplier selection ( Verma & Pullman, 1998) was used instead. On the other hand, the author conducted a statistical research in order to obtain responses about customers’ preferences. The results of the statistical research are collected through a questionnaire. Framework’s evaluation through a case study wanted to show Apart from framework’s evaluation through a case study, DrESSeD framework was evaluated in order to identify the scientific added value that contributes to the research field and the business added value that contributes in Accenture. Therefore, the evaluation process of the framework was based on interviews with supply chain professionals both from academia and industry. Regarding the aspect of adding value in a business context, the author evaluated DrESSeD framework using 3U framework (Verbraeck, 2010). In the 3Uframework the main evaluation factors are:  Usability: Alignment of the application to the user  Usefulness: Alignment of the application to the task  Usage: Alignment of the application to the organizational goals Professionals believe that the framework is not usable by companies’ employees. However, all the experts agreed that the framework could be very useful in the supplier selection task. In terms of usage, the framework cannot satisfy organizational purposes. Accenture is the main client of this particular research. Accenture’s clients are potential users of DrESSeD framework. The author proposes a plan that Accenture can use in order to overcome usability and usage shortcomings of DrESSeD and apply it on its projects. This plan is based on Accenture’s report about supplier selection evaluation factors (Accenture, 2011) and on its access to data within organisations. DrESSeD framework has two main advantages. The first is related with framework’s structure. DrESSeD framework has simple structure and development; characteristic that makes it easy to be adapted by other frameworks and/or applied in different case studies. The second positive aspect of the framework presents the contribution of the study. DrESSeD framework brings under one umbrella, a simulation approach (DES), a statistical analysis (discrete choice analysis), and the observation of firm’s and suppliers’ performance. On the other hand, the two major problems of DrESSeD framework are low validity and low applicability. Giving some details about framework’s development, there are two important aspects (one positive and one negative) that have to be mentioned: From the positive point of view, the author used an econometric model called Multinomial Logit (MNL) in order to conduct the discrete choice analysis. MNL model uses a maximum likelihood estimation scheme to maximize the probability of choosing an alternative with given attribute levels (Verma & Pullman, 1998). MNL model used properly in DrESSeD framework, as it presented perfectly the attribute levels of suppliers’ profiles. From the negative point of view, DrESSeD framework used four specific evaluation factors for supplier selection and four decision variables as purchasing criteria. This choice was not effective, because it increased the complexity of the model. Supplier selection has to be based on three factors: Cost, Product Leadership, and Service (van Houten, 2013). DrESSeD framework succeeded to make a difference in the field of supplier selection process. The use of discrete event simulation for facing the supply chain issue of supplier selection, it is not a new idea. But, the implementation of supplier profiles, which indicate supplier’s performance, and the interaction of supplier with customer preferences under the umbrella of DES, is a new approach for supplier selection. That difference can benefit Accenture’s clients, because it can provide any company with multi-dimension results (decision about appropriate supplier, customer choices, market share value) without big costs (simulation model). Unfortunately, based on evaluation (Section 4.5) and simulation (Section 4.6) results, DrESSeD framework is characterized by low validity. As a result, the framework does not work for Accenture and it cannot be applied in current projects.","Discrete Event Simulation; Strategic Decision; Supplier Selection; Customer Preference","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2015-02-02","Technology, Policy and Management","Technology, Policy, and Management","","Engineering and Policy Analysis/Systems Engineering Section","",""

(mentor); Cuperus, Y. (mentor); Van der Burg, L. (mentor); Harteveld, M. (mentor)","2014","De Afrikaanderwijk in Rotterdam-Zuid bestaat voor een relatief groot deel uit een oude en versleten bebouwing. De wijk is, op basis van metingen van de sociale index, aangewezen als probleemwijk. De situatie behoeft vernieuwing, waarvoor momenteel 1 plan in uitvoering is. Dit plan ‘Parkstad’ is vastgelegd in een grootschalig masterplan waarin verschillende (inmiddels) achterhaalde stedenbouwkundige methoden zijn toegepast. De economisch moeizame tijd resulteert in een (tijdelijke) staking van het vervolledigen van dit plan. Desondanks is de vernieuwing noodzakelijk en is er dus behoefte aan een alternatief vernieuwingsplan. De vraag naar alternatieve plannen wordt momenteel ingegeven door de economische crisis, maar er is een structurele verandering van de vakdiscipline noodzakelijk. Bevolkingsprognoses tonen aan dat de bevolkingsgroei vanaf ±2030 zal uitvlakken en zelfs krimpen. Stadsuitbreidingen worden mede daarom niet meer gedaan en de pijlen moeten worden gericht op het vernieuwen van bestaande stedelijke gebieden. In dit afstudeeronderzoek wordt aangetoond dat er zeker alternatieven voor het bestaande grootschalige plan ‘Parkstad’ te ontwikkelen zijn. Hiervoor wordt gebruik gemaakt van verschillende ontwikkelingen in de omgeving van het projectgebied. In Rotterdam blijkt op stadsniveau het plan te bestaan om zuid en noord meer bij elkaar te betrekken. Hiervoor is het plan bedacht om het centrum richting de rivier de Maas te verschuiven, zodat gebruik gemaakt kan worden van de rivier als kwaliteit voor de stad. Dit is momenteel goed zichtbaar in de vernieuwing van de Wilhelminapier, waar recent het grootste gebouw van Nederland is gebouwd. Alle plannen bij elkaar maken dat de de omgeving van de Afrikaanderwijk verstedelijkt, dit biedt verschillende kansen voor een vernieuwingstrategie.Verstedelijking gaat namelijk gepaart met groei en dus verdichting, tenminste als het gaat om de vernieuwing van bestaand stedelijk gebied. Verstedelijking is ook aanleiding voor het creëren van meer diversiteit in de woonomgeving. Dit wordt in het onderzoek besproken aan de hand van de theorie van Jane Jacobs, waarin diversiteit als essentie van de stad wordt bestempelt. De verstedelijking wordt aangegrepen om een alternatieve vernieuwingstrategie voor te stellen. Door op een kleinere schaal de bebouwing te vernieuwen wordt er automatisch een bepaalde mate van diversiteit in de woonomgeving gegenereert. De opdeling in meerdere kleine projecten vergroot ook de haalbaarheid van de noodzakelijke vernieuwing.Tegelijkertijd ontstaat er een meer intrinsieke stratenstructuur die past bij een hoger stedelijke woonmilieu. Omdat er in bestaand stedelijk gebied wordt vernieuwd wordt onderzocht of er bestaande herbruikbare elementen in de bebouwing en/of stedelijke omgeving aanwezig zijn. De herbruikbare aspecten in het kader van verstedelijking worden vervolgens aangewend om het alternatieve vernieuwingsplan op te baseren. De bebouwing blijkt hier niet veel mogelijkheden in te bieden maar de stedelijke omgeving wel enkele. zoals: de bestaande verkavelingsstructuur, het karakter van de straten (het straatbeeld), het patroon van de straten met de aansluiting op de rest van de stad en de ligging ten opzichte van allerlei grootstedelijke voorzieningen. Kortom, kansen genoeg voor een alternatieve vernieuwingstrategie op basis van de bestaande omgeving in de Afrikaanderwijk.","stadsvernieuwing; verstedelijking; diversiteit; transformatie; hergebruik; schaalverandering; duurzaamheid","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture / Urbanism","","Dual Graduation Lab","",""

(mentor); Leus, G. (mentor)","2014","Near-field source localization is an important aspect in many diverse areas such as acoustics, seismology, to list a few. The planar wave assumption frequently used in far-field source localization is no longer valid when the sources are in the near field. Near-field sources can be localized by solving a joint direction-of-arrival and range estimation problem. The original near-field source localization problem is a multi-dimensional non-linear optimization problem which is computationally intractable. In this thesis we study address two important questions related to near-field source localization: (i) Sparse reconstruction techniques for joint DOA and range estimation using a grid-based model. (ii) Matching the sampling grid for off-grid sources. In the first part of this thesis, we use a grid-based model and by further leveraging the sparsity, we can solve the aforementioned problem efficiently using any of the off-the-shelf l1_-norm optimization solvers. When multiple snapshots are available, we can also exploit the cross-correlations among the symmetric sensors of the array and further reduce the complexity by solving two sparse reconstruction problems of lower dimensions instead of a single sparse reconstruction problem of a higher dimension. In the second part of this thesis, we account scenarios where the true source locations are not on the grid resulting in a grid mismatch. Using the first-order Taylor approximation, we model the grid mismatch as a perturbation around the sampling grid.

(mentor)","2014","Wind energy today is synonymous with the extraction of energy from wind via the deployment of groups of large multi-megawatt wind turbines. Nonetheless Small wind turbines (SWT) have been also designed for the built environment in order to extract energy from the wind, while being at close proximity to buildings. Despite the fact that their technology has vastly improved over the years, SWT can be considered as still technologically immature and are rather limited in use forming a niche market in a global level which has yet to grow in competitiveness as compared to other urban-focused renewable energy technologies (RET) such as photovoltaic panels and conventional power producing methods. This Thesis focuses on investigating the potential for SWT in Greece by addressing three main research questions which regard the technological and economic potential of this technology in the country, the factors which have limited in the past and still limit their development and implementation on the built environment and support policy options which could accelerate their introduction and establishment. Due to the fact that Small Wind Turbines comprise of technological products for which little is known regarding their design options, specific technical limitations and requirements, operating conditions especially in the built environment, methods of assessing their potential annual energy yield, cost of energy parameters and investment assessing methods and are often misinterpreted as solely “miniaturized” large scale wind turbines while significant differences exist on the above factors, the necessary techno economic background are being provided for the reader to be able to understand in depth, parameters important to covering the relevant research questions. Furthermore the current Renewable Energy Market of Greece along with the SWT relevant institutions, organizations and actors, the key SWT related policy measures already undertaken by the Hellenic Government and the existing Hellenic wind potential are provided in order to depict the market framework within which this technology will struggle to be established. By the analysis conducted, the fact that the necessary legal framework and RES target related to SWT deployment have been established for years but have still to be implemented despite the fact that favourable wind potentials exist (specifically in the numerous islands and coastal/mountainous areas of Greece), is drawn. In lack of official data regarding the current number of Business groups active on the field of SWT, installed SWT in the country as well as other crucial parameters such as total installed power capacity, a survey was conducted by means of contacting SWT suppliers and manufacturers in an attempt to quantify the level of penetration of this technology in Greece as well as identifying cost related parameters and perceive barriers by the industry. The companies willing to answer to a short questionnaire with questions which could not be covered by the information provided by their internet sites, provided valuable information which were processed and critically assessed in order to form an image of the current market status. Important conclusions were drawn based on the facts that almost all related companies are suppliers which import machines from abroad and that the majority of them have already installed a non-trivial number of SWT in Off-Grid applications, contrary to the only six On-Grid installed turbines identified to have been installed by a very limited number of companies. Other identified financial information were used in the conduction of an investment analysis through economic evaluation methods previously described (Simple Payback, Generation Cost, Cost of Energy, Levelized Production Cost) and also via the simulation software RETScreen 4 which presented with a clear image on the financial characteristics of three distinct investment scenarios such as the Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Net Present Value (NPV) and O&M costs. The most favourable scenario, where the equity payback time was equal to 7,1 years with an IRR equal to 14,1 %, provided a basis of comparison with the predominant competing technology of photovoltaic panels in order for a comparison to take place. The conclusion depicts a marginal superiority of PV with the current market characteristics. The barrier framework of analysis of J.P. Painuly, which divides barriers into distinct categories and adopts a top-down approach in order to gradually pinpoint the specific barrier elements which do not allow for the adoption of a Renewable Energy Technology, is employed. Based on the proposed categories and by incorporating and adapting the findings of international literature for the Hellenic case, investigating articles published in relevant Hellenic journals, sites and magazines based on their chronological order and by relying on the help provided by SWT specialists from the Hellenic Wind Energy Association (HWEA) and the Centre for Renewable Energy Sources and Saving (CRES), the Hellenic specific barriers are analysed in depth, providing with valuable information on Technical, Institutional/Legal, Economic/Financial, Market Failure/Imperfections, Market Distortions and Societal/Behavioural aspects as well as a new perspective on the main reasons the SWT market penetration has not still occurred in Greece. Also the information provided by Hellenic small wind turbine suppliers are taken into account in the identification of barriers. The striking fact that the Hellenic Government failed to follow through the issued by law regulations that would boost this market for a number of reasons, ranging from sluggish permit procedures to the overall destabilized RES funding mechanism and lack of nationally adopted Standards, is drawn and considered to be the predominant barrier. The final part of the Thesis initially assesses existing action plans as issued by EU and US organizations and proposes a set of recommendations, policy measures and actions based on three distinct axes of analysis in an attempt to cover the inefficiencies of previous roadmaps. The recommendations target specifically the Hellenic barriers and focus in being applicable and practical. As such the introduction of the Net Metering System with specific added propositions is encouraged in order to jump start this stagnant market and serve as the “foundation” for the penetration of the technology in Greece and overcoming of the predominant barrier. Other actions include the adoption or establishment of implementation Standards, granting of Economic incentives, promotion of Social Corporate Responsibility through the adoption of SWT and raising of awareness and social acceptance, with the analysis ever focusing in the establishment of not only a viable market but eventually the creation of a relevant industry. Conclusions are provided which critically assess the manner in which the separate research questions are covered as well as provide insight on the future of this technology in the crisis and post-crisis economic environment of Greece. The strong points of the Thesis prove to be the novel business related research conducted as well as the detailed and categorized analysis of the current Hellenic related barriers which has not been identified to be present in literature or concentrated in a single document. Limiting parameters regarding the research conducted, calculations and framework of analysis are provided while recommendations for future research which will focus on investigating in depth the social aspects of SWT deployment in Greece, utilizing different frameworks of analysis regarding the barriers in order to avoid inefficiencies and researching in depth the potential benefits of SWT implementation in CSR promoting application are also presented.","Small Wind Turbines","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Economics of Innovation","","","",""

Initially an explorative research about the airport and airline context was conducted to understand the current condition of the check--?in process, constraints and demands of the airport context. Next, a passenger research was conducted in order to see the whole pre security process from the passenger’s perspective, understand passengers’ mindset, concern and how they experience the current check--?in. The two areas of research were analyzed to gain insights on factors that influence passengers’ experience during their check--?in. A problem definition along the passenger journey of the current check--?in process is defined in the end. The problem definition is divided into several focus points, some of which formulates (1) a design goal and others are translated into (2) a series of service strategies. The service strategies are suggestions provided to airlines on ways to use of their check--?in area more effectively. The design goal however, is use as a guideline and starting point for product conceptualization later on. Base on the insights gained from the analysis and the design goal, different ideas on the product design were generated through several activities such as creative session and idea validation in airports. The ideas were further processed into a concept through iteration of prototyping and user testing. The final concept designed is a webpage – boarding pass – door interaction that locates in three different timeframe on passengers’ air travel journey. The three products prepare the passengers and offer them a sense of awareness on the to come check--?in process: the webpage allows passengers to foresee the personalized bag drop assignment and prepare for that; the door facilitates the passenger flow at the airline check--?in area entrance and provides them visual guidance inside the area; the boarding pass bridges passengers’ pre trip awareness with the airline check--?in process through a common feature both the boarding pass and the door has. By the concept proposed, passengers would be more confident to self serve in bag drop and the service providers would be able to fully exploit the value Self Bag Drop brings. All in all, the service strategies and concept are able to increase passengers’ awareness about the check--?in process, and become more fluent in the process. The concept was evaluated by Type22, experts from Mijksennaar and Brussels Airlines. According to their feedback, final adjustment was made, and recommendations for Type22 to further optimize the design and strategies were also given.","self-service; check-in; bag drop; passenger","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2014","The need for fault ride-through (FRT) capability is not yet documented for the low voltage connected DG. The realization that an increase in the capacity of installed DG power in the specific voltage level can trigger disconnection, in case of transmission faults, of massive amounts of power from DG and jeopardize system stability is forming. In order to investigate the response of low voltage distribution systems with high penetration of PVs, in case of a fault in the transmission system, a complex network model is created consisting of different voltage levels, from eHV (220 kV) to LV (400 V). This model is implemented as a benchmark system with DG capacities chosen to match the German network. Also an elaborate PV model is used to simulate different behaviours during and after fault and assist in examining the impact of different sensitivity factors on network stability. The problem is analysed through root mean square (RMS) stability simulations performed on the models of the network and the DG. The projected year that this study takes place is 2022 and the DG capacity is chosen for that year. The commercially available DIgSilent PowerFactory software version 14.1 is used to carry out these simulations. A sensitivity analysis is performed for different control modes of the PV that range from disconnection in the event of a fault to full dynamic network support during fault. Also different pre-fault states of the network are used to examine the effect of the state of the network in the results; these states vary from normal top-down power flow to full reverse power flow when PVs are at full capacity. Moreover the effect of delayed post-fault active power recovery of the LV connected DG is discussed. The conclusions and analysis show the importance of introducing FRT criteria even for low voltage connected DG and give an insight on the behaviour of the system under the circumstances described. The differences between control modes are affecting stability of the system and the various phenomena that take place are analysed and explained. Finally corrective steps that need to be taken in order to avoid future stability problems for the network are outlined and justified and recommendations for future grid connection requirements for low voltage installed DG are given.","fault ride through; low voltage network; distributed generation; photovoltaics; voltage stability; German network; grid codes; renewable integration study; digsilent Powerfactory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Electrical Power Grids","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Mooyaart, L.F. (mentor); Van der Toorn, A. (mentor); Broere, W. (mentor); Van der Wiel, W.D. (mentor)","2014","In response to the devastation caused by Hurricane Ike to the Galveston Bay Area, Texas, United States in September 2008, several proposals emerged to protect the region against future storm surges. One of them is a coastal spine called the ’Ike Dike’. A challenge for this 160 km [100 mi] long flood protection is to cross Bolivar Roads, a 2.8 km [1.7 mi] wide channel between Galveston Island and Bolivar Peninsula. A storm surge barrier is required to close the coastal spine and prevent hurricane surges in the Gulf of Mexico from penetrating into the Galveston Bay. This thesis, based on a global-to-detailed approach, presents the design process and a feasible design for a storm surge barrier at this specific site. The design process starts with drafting a design framework consisting of a program of requirements and boundary conditions. According to the requirements Bolivar Roads is divided in two sections: a navigational section spanning the deeper section of the waterway allowing the passage of vessels and an environmental section which aims to preserve the Galveston Bay ecosystem. The objective of this thesis is to make a conceptual design for a barrier along the environmental section to satisfy two requirements. Firstly to enable sufficient water exchange between the Gulf of Mexico and the Galveston Bay through keeping at least 60% of the original flow area open, and secondly to sufficiently reduce the effect of storm surges with an estimated probability of occurrence of once in ten thousand years. The first design step considers the barrier as a system. It reveals that the large retention capacity of the Galveston Bay brings an opportunity to construct the barrier more cost-effective: it does not have to be fully retaining. A closed barrier with a continuous retaining height of only 0.1 m [0.3 ft] above mean sea level reduces the storm surge sufficiently. With this retaining height along both the navigational and environmental sections the barrier is vastly overflown during storms, but the Bay’s retention capacity ensures the flood hazard along the Galveston Bay shores to remain acceptable. Knowing the required retaining height and having a sense of the local conditions, several barrier types for the environmental section are evaluated. A shallow founded caisson barrier meets the drafted design criteria best. During this second design step a preliminary design for a caisson barrier is drafted to find the required main dimensions. The last part of this design step simulates the barrier on its final location through a settlement calculation. This reveals that the subsoil under the caissons is not able to bear the weight at all: the soil settles up to 3.7 m [12.1 ft] in depth, which is unacceptable. An alternative foundation method is therefore required and proposed. In the third and last design step measures are investigated to improve the soil friction capacity and to deal with the settlements. Four alternatives for a foundation are drafted: 1) a shallow foundation using vertical drainage as soil improvement, 2) a shallow foundation with vacuum preloading as soil improvement, 3) a deep foundation through steel tubular piles and 4) a shallow foundation through replacing the entire weak clay stratum with sand. The sum of foundations costs and caisson construction costs for these alternatives are estimated at $675, $800, $823 and $897 million respectively. For this caisson barrier design, a shallow foundation with vertical drainage as soil improvement is advised. This third design step provided an important insight: the drafted design criteria in the second design step, on which the choice for a caisson barrier was based, were unbalanced. There should have been more emphasis on the foundation as it is a large portion of the total costs for the environmental barrier (± 40%). It subsequently results in a two-fold recommendation. If the decision is to continue the caisson barrier design it is advised to apply vertical drainage. Alternatively, the suggestion is to reassess the barrier types in design step 2 while taking into account that the more expensive deep foundation method is likely more appropriate for Bolivar Roads. The report proceeds with the construction method for a caisson barrier with vacuum preloading soil improvement. Despite its relatively high costs, further investigating the application of this method is preferred as it has not yet been applied before for a large, shallow founded structure like a storm surge barrier. The construction method shows the consecutive activities up until the completion of the structure, together with a cost estimate. The cost estimate for the complete storm surge barrier in Bolivar Roads ranges from $2.7 to $4.0 billion. This includes the navigational section. In this thesis the focus lies on foundation design. For further design it is recommended to focus on the barrier ?doors, the bed protection and the adaptability to uncertain sea level rise. These are, next to the foundation aspects, important cost drivers for the storm surge barrier. For a complete integrated design the construction method should also be fully included in the design process, as for example the construction dock is linked to the optimal barrier type.","storm surge barrier; Galveston Bay; Hurricane; Houston; storm surge; Hurricane Ike; Ike Dike; caisson; barrier; Flood risk reduction barrier; Bolivar Roads","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Structures","",""

(mentor)","2014","Continuous economic growth, ignoring the incidental recession, is currently still coupled with increases in the use of resources and generation of wastes. The European Commission (EC) is looking for ways to achieve absolute decoupling between economic growth and environmental impacts. A shift from product-based to function-based production and consumption, known as `servicising' of the economy, has the potential to contribute to absolute decoupling. The EC is therefore looking for policy measures on all political levels that may stimulate a servicising shift and thereby contribute to absolute decoupling. In this thesis, I propose a generic agent-based model to inform policy towards absolute decoupling, with a focus on the role of servicising. The model captures interactions between selling and buying `agents' and can be parametrised for many different specific markets. It integrates rational and non-rational considerations, decision making on multiple levels of both producers and consumers, and resulting material flows and impacts, all in a generic way. Also, the model features sophisticated market research as a novel basis for the decision making of agents in an artificial market. The model was developed following the methodology for developing an agent-based model proposed by Van Dam, Nikolic and Lukszo \citep{Dam2012}. A substantial part of this thesis is reserved for a reflection on the methodology. The main conclusion from that part is that although the methodology provides valuable structure to help new modellers through model development, the recommended techniques and practices are mostly suitable for relatively small, domain-specific models. Additional practices are recommended in order to successfully build large and generic models. The proposed model is suitable for the three planned case studies in the pan-European SPREE project, of which the generic model development constituted a central part. The concluding sections of this thesis provide suggestions for future extensions of the model, including the inclusion of social networks, spatial explicitness and chain-level interactions.","agent-based modelling; servicising; absolute decoupling; policy exploration; behavioural economics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","ESS","","SEPAM","",""

(mentor); Rudinac, M. (mentor)","2014","Object tracking plays a vital role in the future of Robotics as it is used for motion planning and decision making. In recent years, research in object tracking has focussed on designing tracking methods that do not rely on a pre-learned model of the object and are therefor able to track any kind of object. As a result, online learning of an object model is used in virtually all new methods. However, these tracking methods often fail when presented with articulated objects or when an object rotates enough that parts become visible that haven’t been seen before. Furthermore, these methods rely purely on texture and have no notion of object shape. Additionaly, almost no existing tracking method processes images fast enough to be practically applied in Robotics applications. Affordable depth sensors have started to become popular. These sensors work as normal cameras, but with an additional depth channel. This depth information contains information about the shape of objects, which can be used to recognize the difference between object and background, or to learn a more accurate model of the object of interest. In this work, novel methods are introduced to improve tracker accuracy. Acknowledging that introducing novel methods, tracking speeds are likely to decrease, two additional methods of increasing the tracker speed are proposed. K-means clustering and local searching are applied to increase tracker speed, while depth information is used in two ways to improve accuracy. Gaussian Mixture Modelling of the depth histogram is applied to segment object from background and shape features based on local curvature are used in a Random Forests classification method to learn an object model that includes shape information.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-02-11","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

(mentor); Menenti, M. (mentor); Steele-Dunne, S.C. (mentor); Wolters, E.L.A. (mentor); Jeurissen, P.C.M. (mentor)","2014","This research evaluates the potential of thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing to determine and continuously monitor the horizontal water temperature distribution of inland surface water bodies. Usually, monitoring temporal and spatial variability of surface water temperature takes place by measurement networks of in-situ gauges, but these networks are often limited by sparse sampling in both time and especially space. For these and other reasons (e.g. relatively cheap, easy, and fast) the use of remote sensing in water management studies and practices has increased. By remote sensing in the TIR spectrum the TIR radiation leaving from the top surface water layer (< 0.1 mm) is measured, which can be used to determine the radiant water temperature distribution in the horizontal plane. This horizontal radiant water temperature distribution can be used as supplement to in-situ kinetic temperature measurements. It is however necessary to first evaluate the accuracy and precision of the remotely sensed water temperatures. Therefore, the goal of this study is to determine how and with what accuracy and precision TIR radiant water temperature measurements (Tremote) can be used as an approximation for the horizontal distribution of the kinetic water temperature, based on comparisons of Tremote with in-situ kinetic water temperature measurements (Tin-situ). The criteria used in this study to determine the accuracy and precision of Tremote is by means of comparison with Tin-situ, which are usually taken at a certain depth in the water column. Tremote represents a pixel value, which is thus compared with a point measurement of Tin-situ. The bias (Tremote – Tin-situ) statistics are indicative for the obtained accuracy and precision. In this study Landsat 7 ETM+ images measured in the thermal infrared spectrum (? = 8-14 ?m) are used for water temperature determination of Tremote (by means of the inverse of Planck’s Law), together with Landsat 7 ETM+ images measured in the visual and near infrared spectrum for water detection of inland surface water bodies. The effects of emissivity; atmospheric absorption, emission and scattering; and surface effects and thermal stratification are evaluated and, if possible, corrected for. Uncertainty contained by the Landsat 7 ETM+ instrument has been taken into account by means of applying a 95% confidence interval over the obtained surface water body. Reduction of thermal pollution by land-originating TIR radiation of radiant water temperatures is well established by such a 95 % confidence interval water body. The correction for atmospheric circumstances took place by means of the web-based Atmospheric Correction Parameter Calculator, ACPC (see http://atmcorr.gsfc.nasa.gov/), which makes use of the MODTRAN radiative transfer model. Obtained results have been verified by means of a newly derived atmospheric correction algorithm for Landsat 7 ETM+ TIR images, developed with use of the MODIS In-Scene Split Window Method. For clear-sky images, on which this study focuses, the uncertainty contained by the atmospheric correction is up to ±0.8 °C inland, which can increase up to ±1.5 °C near the coast. Coastal uncertainty of the atmospheric correction is larger because of larger coastal atmospheric gradients (mainly of water vapour), which is difficult to correct for. The emissivity of water approaches that of a black body (? = 1), but is usually 1 to 2 % lower. This causes a reduction of up to 1 °C of the established radiant water temperature, but introduces an uncertainty of up to ± 0.5 °C. The surface effects and thermal stratification are influenced by many factors and processes which are difficult to address. The combined result of the surface effets and thermal stratification lead to an uncertainty in winter and summer of ±1.6 and ±3.2 °C, respectively. Overall, this study concludes the best procedure to approximate the horizontal kinetic water temperature distribution of inland surface waters with Landsat 7 ETM+ TIR images makes use of a 95% Confidence Interval Water Mask, and an Emissivity and Atmospheric Correction. The accuracy and precision levels of the horizontal water temperature distribution display an average bias of 1.5 °C with ? = 1.5 °C and SE = 0.1 °C. Tremote tends to nearly always over-predict Tin-situ. Using the 95% Confidence Water Mask to avoid thermal pollution of water pixels by land (sub-pixel heterogeneity), rivers with a width less than 120 m cannot be well resolved from the ETM+ images anymore. Furthermore, no physical relation could be derived between Tremote and Tin-situ. The numerous and complex processes that together affect the measurement of Tremote and its agreement with Tin-situ, combined with the issue of the scale difference between Tremote and Tin-situ, make it difficult to derive a (physical) relation or formula that connects Tremote to Tin-situ. The seasonal influence, expressed by a difference between winter and summer, could be captured by means of the statistical analysis. During winter, Tremote over-predicts Tin-situ on average by 0.8 ° with a bias spread of ? = 0.8 °C and SE = 0.2 °C. During summer, Tremote over-predicts Tin-situ on average by 1.8 ° with a bias spread of ? = 1.6 °C and SE = 0.2 °C. The bias statistics of the obtained horizontal Tremote distribution and the statistical seasonal relation between Tremote and Tin-situ can be used as an approximation for the horizontal kinetic water temperature distribution. Based on the results in this study and the difficulty to establish a more direct relation between Tremote and Tin-situ, the proposed systematic correction becomes: in winter Tremote - 0.8 and in summer Tremote – 1.8. The bias spread statistics (? and SE) form a first and reasonable quantification for the precision and uncertainty contained by the obtained approximation. It is recommended to attempt to reduce the uncertainties contained by approximations obtained in this study by further research. Research towards a better Atmospheric Correction, which especially accounts for local surface conditions and the spatial variations in atmospheric circumstances, could mean a major improvement for the remotely sensed water temperature approximations. Other research to improve the approximations of horizontal kinetic water temperature distributions by Tremote is to assess the thermal stratification and the surface effects. To better understand the thermal water body processes and the skin effect, improving our insight in the relation between kinetic water temperature in the water column, kinetic water temperature at the surface (water depth 0 m) and the TIR radiant surface water temperature measured locally would help. This improved insight would also help to reduce the uncertainty of remote sensing measurements. It is also recommended to investigate and improve the operational abilities of remotely sensed water temperatures. A main practical constraint is the time interval by which images of the same location are generated by the Landsat 7 satellite: 16 days. Therefore, to operationalize space-borne remote sensing of water temperatures for daily water management practises it is highly recommended to include more satellites with a TIR spectral channel. Another practical recommendation is to optimize the time of ETM+ image acquisition and processing. With NASA currently requiring 1-3 days to process the images to L1T process level, it must be carefully decided for what purposes the water temperature information can be used.","Remote Sensing; Landsat 7; ETM+; surface water temperature; thermal infrared","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-01-27","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","","",""

To be able to design a stable bed the velocities at the bed need to be accurately determined. In design practise the velocities generated by a propeller are determined with formulae based on a mix of the momentum theory and measurements. The application of the formulae is often limited to cases for which measurements have been carried out and do not allow a secure design for more complicated structures and the different velocity field of a bow thruster. Scale model measurements To improve the calculation of velocities on a slope, a large number of measurements were done by Van Doorn [TU Delft, 2012] for several scenarios with and without piles and resulted in an amplification of the design formula for some of his scenarios. To also predict the velocities for other scenarios these measurements are used to build and calibrate a numerical model. Numerical bow thruster implementation The open source CFD package OPENFOAM is used for the construction of this numerical model. As the implementation of a rotating propeller in the mesh will result in high computational costs and to allow a fine calibration of the propeller efflux, the propeller is simplified to an actuator disc. At the actuator disc an axial and tangential body force, varying over the radius, are added to the momentum equations in the OPENFOAM solver. Functions for both a ducted and a free propeller are simulated and show comparable results, the free Goldstein propeller functions are further applied. The coefficients are estimated based on the measured thrust and torque and calibrated to achieve a good fit to the measured efflux. A local increase of the turbulence at the hub and the propeller tip is not implemented in the numerical computations. Results Comparing the calibrated model to the measured diffusion in axial direction, shows a very good agreement and the numerical model nearly exactly computes the distribution as derived by Blaauw and van der Kaa. When comparing the velocities at the slope to both theory and the scale model measurements, it shows an underestimation of the velocities at the toe for steeper slopes, which is explained by unexpected velocities in the wall boundary layer, as a result of the wall functions in OPENFOAM. The model is exerted on different geometries (with piles) to get insight in the velocities for quay structures.","OpenFOAM; CFD; Bow thrusters; Quay structures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-01-30","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Ports and waterways","",""

(mentor); Verheij, H.J. (mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor); Blokland, T. (mentor)","2014","Introduction Inland and seagoing vessels are equipped with (bow) thrusters. The use of these thrusters can cause scour of the bed alongside a quay wall. In order to assess the consequences of local scour due to bow thrusters on the design of the structure it is desirable to know the dimensions of the scour holes as a function of in time. Analytical relations for the calculation of scour, only determine the scour depth, but do not involve remaining dimensions of the scour hole and the development of scour in time. Model description A three dimensional quasi-steady-state numerical model is developed, which describes the scour development alongside a vertical quay wall induced by thrusters of a vessel. The flow simulations, using the Realizable k-? Model in the Computational Fluid Dynamics package OpenFOAM, provide the flow properties near the bed in order to calculate the bed shear stress. In the flow simulation the influence of the rotation of the propeller is neglected. A boundary adjustment technique is applied in order to move the mesh near the bed. In case the critical shear stress is reached, the morphology plays a role and the bed changes. This critical shear stress and the bed change are calculated, by applying an empirical relation for the erosion rate of sand, which is valid for both the high and low velocity regime of the flow. Every time step the bed level is updated and the hydrodynamics are calculated for the updated bed level. Results & Validation The hydrodynamics are validated separately from the model with erosion by applying a fixed (i.e. non-erodible) bed and comparing the results regarding flow velocity in the numerical model with physical experiments and analytical expressions. Several cases are elaborated with different distances between quay and ship, and keel clearances. It appears that for relative large distances between ship and quay the numerical model overestimates the near bed velocities. The erosion itself is validated with full scale tests regarding thruster induced scour, performed in the Port of Rotterdam. A maximum scour depth of 2.2 meter after 6 departures of the vessel is calculated with the numerical model, which is rather conservative compared to the measurements where a maximum depth of 1.75-1.85 meter is measured. The difference in results is probably due to presence of clay and silt in the Port of Rotterdam, however the numerical model is developed using an empirical relation for sand. Sensitivity From a sensitivity analysis it appears that the maximum scour depth is sensitive for the amount of fine sediment which is present in the soil. Coherent with this the porosity of the soil and the dilatation of the soil during erosion play an important role in the magnitude of the erosion rate. Recommendations It is recommended to improve the modelling of the propeller induced flow and to integrate this flow model with the current erosion model. Beside that an improved mesh near the bed is recommended. In this case flow properties, regarding flow velocity and turbulence, can be averaged over the water column in order to involve the higher order moments for the calculation of the extreme bed shear stresses. The length of this water column depends on the mixing length of the turbulence. In addition, it is striking that the width of the scour hole in both calculations and measurements, are smaller than the width of common applied bed protections. From an economical point of view it might be interesting to assess whether the current bed protection design is not too conservative.","Scour; Bow Thruster; CFD; OpenFOAM; Soil Water Structure Interaction; Quay Wall; Bowthruster; Bed Protection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-01-30","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Therefore, in 2012 Service Innovation Team in the company initiated MyCar project to tackle down this challenge. Based on MyCar project, the project “Socially Smart Mobility” (SSM) sees social engagement between people as a way to enhance ca-shairng experience and poses this questions: “How can shared mobility serve as a social platform where people engage and share information, which further provides a smart and flexible mobility solution for end users?” Particularly by mapping “social engagement” onto “car-sharing”, factors that contribute to “car personality” is discovered.

The focus is to realize the current development of MyCar project, find common ground between MyCar and Socially Smart Mobility, find insights in literature as well as user research, generate concepts based on these insights, embody a concept into interactive prototypes, validate the concept with target users, get valuable feedback and provide suggestions and recommendations for future development for the company. The main research question is: How can social engagement enhance the shared-car using experience? Based on the persona in MyCar project, two potential target groups: experiential drivers and eco pursuer are merged. Also future context is pinpointed out based on MyCar project’s identified future trends. Potential target groups and future context serve as a starting point for SSM project. Insights for future content is that there are more and more connected objects, ubiquitous computing are everywhere including the in-car environment and people combines different mobility modes in one trip to travel within the city. Experiential drivers are groups of people who not only focus on using mobility solutions but are open to new experience while driving. On the other hand, insights from literature shows that there is a growing trend in sharing economy and specifically car-sharing has been receiving attentions over the years. Two crucial insights for achieving successful sharing business model in terms of social aspect are: 1. people believe in sharing and 2. people trust strangers. An in depth interview is conducted with ten participants based on insights from literature research and MyCar project. By utilizing the methods of “culture probe”, “focus groups” and “contextual interview”, user’s latent needs are elicited. After the research phase, general findings and four user profiles were identified and discovered in terms of being socialized and using car-sharing. Two profiles: “social seeker” and “goal achiever” are selected and used in the idea generation phase, which aims at tackling down the design challenge: How can we help different types of people achieve their social interests by providing relevant and innovative car-sharing services? In the end, the final concept is developed. The concept is called “SoundDrive”. SoundDrive is a “token” concept that is embodied on a mobile app. SoundDrive possesses music data thorough online music platform, SoundCloud specifically, which users can carry to the shared car. Once the user gets into the car, SoundDrive right away communicates with the car’s infotainment system, logging in the driver’s online music platform. Along with the trip, music data is accumulated and shared on the social platform. After arriving home, driver can check the music history again and being able to connect to other drivers who use the same car on social platform. See figure 0.1 the using scenario of SoundDrive. After developing the prototypes, user testing is conducted. The goal of the testing is to see if the concept is align to the design goal: How can we help different types of people achieve their social interests by providing relevant and innovative car-sharing services?, and answer the initial research question: How can social engagement enhance the shared-car using experience? Seven people joined the user testing sessions and feedback and insights are obtained. In the end people are willing to use SoundDrive in the future and to see how network effect can be achieved by this service. However, they cannot foresee that the shared car possesses a personality which can enhance their car-sharing experience. Future recommendations were drawn: 1. the company can team up with SoundCloud to continue on this project. 2. Transferring the mobile app concept to the application on infotainment system. 3. Further researching on in-car social music recommendation system.","social media design; mobility service; interaction design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Swaak, J. (mentor); Griffioen, I. (mentor)","2014","The main goal of this graduation project is to positively change the mindset of children towards children with (physical) disabilities through an empiric game. It uses an emotion-driven design approach in which two interesting conflicting concerns of able-bodied children are used as inspiration to find a meaningful and innovative design solution: ‘I should let everyone play along, although they are not competent in the game’ vs. ‘I want to be challenged during play’. Furthermore it addresses the concern conflict between user groups, in which able-bodied children have the need to take the lead and helping function in an interaction, causing them to see the physically limited child as a ‘need-help-kid’. In my research I found that children with physical disabilities have unique abilities due to their disability! For example, children with a visual impairment hear very well and children with tubes or prostheses can shoot very hard. Using these characteristics I designed a game in which children with physical disabilities are positively presented as superheroes: the uniekies game. They have started a secret club in which all superheroes can train their superpowers. The Uniekies game is a role playing game in which all children (age 6-11) can become superheroes by putting on special suits. These suits will be made with materials that can be found at home, such as aluminum foil. The suits give children a disability and a unique power. It consists of 5 steps: 1. Watching introduction movie and read information on www.uniekiesclub.nl. 2. Collecting game materials (printing and searching for required home materials) 3. Choosing superheroes 4. Making superhero suits 5. Training superpowers with mini-games Children can pick from 6 superheroes, all representative for the 6 groups of children with disabilities I used as guidance in my research: (1) visual impairment, (2) hearing impairment, (3) hand, arm function impairment, (4) walking function impairment, (5) use of splint, tubes or prostheses and (6) dependent on a wheelchair, walker, etc for moving. The Uniekies game is a first step towards a more positive interaction of children with and without disabilities. It reverses the mindset of children towards children with disabilities by shifting their disability-focus to an ability-focus. The experienced feeling of solidarity through empathy makes physically limited children be viewed as equal play partners. Because the game is a lot of fun, children will share their experiences with others and spread the game.","emotion; disabilities; mindset","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

To achieve that, the basic theory behind the system is described but also the most common construction methods are described. Furthermore, in the first chapter the benefits of the system and the system requirements will be discussed. In order to illustrate the different design possibilities, case studies will be analyzed. The different design principle will be divided in groups of four and described with climate schemes. After describing three main design options, the manual goes in further on the integration steps of the new structure in each principle.

(mentor); Fransen, A.E.P. (mentor); Boomkens, H.R. (mentor)","2014","The Reinier de Graaf Hospital in Delft has concluded that care for frail elderly with impaired mobility is not always optimal. Due to multimorbidity, traditional monodisciplinary care is not the best possible care. The Reinier de Graaf Hospital set out to improve their care process to serve the frail elderly best. It was found that the target group has a high risk for functional decline, dependence and reduced quality of life. Thus the target group can benefit from short admission and throughput times. In order to deliver the best possible care, multidisciplinary collaboration is found to be essential. Using soft and hard systems theory combined with thorough data analysis, the current process was evaluated. It was found that the average combined admission and throughput time was 196 days for the target group, in this period a patient visited the hospital 8,6 times. The hospital visits were found to be predominantly for outpatient care. The multidisciplinary care was largely delivered in a sequential manner. This leads to a lack of collaboration between medical specialist, to unnecessary long throughput times and to many hospital visits. To improve the quality of the health care logistics, improvements have been proposed in a process redesign. Instead of delivering care in a sequential manner, the redesign allows for parallel multidisciplinary treatment. In order to do so, a triage appointment is suggested at the start of the care route and appointments with multiple medical specialists should be clustered on a single day. Short admission and throughput times can be achieved by reserving capacity based on expected patient flow. By means of data analysis the expected future input volume is set at 14 patients per week and the mean capacity required was calculated accordingly. To assess the performance of the proposed design under stochastic influence, a discrete event simulation was developed and verified. The simulation results indicate that if 110% of the theoretical capacity is used, for the average patient the throughput time can be reduced by 50% to 73%, depending on the average wait time between visits. On average a simulated patient visited the hospital 4,4 times for 6,7 appointments. The cost for these improvements are an average occupancy drop for medical doctors of 15%.","health care; logistics; delft systems approach; simulation; discrete event simulation; logistiek; ziekenhuis; Reinier de Graaf; simulatie; care route; zorgroute","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Production Engineering and Logistics","",""

(mentor); Jimenez Garcia, J.C. (mentor); Dempsey, M. (mentor)","2014","Personal informatics systems are popular: tools to help people improve on their behaviour by collecting and providing personally relevant information about an activity. Companies explore the possibilities to develop products that apply these sorts of systems, as does TomTom. After ten years of developing personal navigation devices successfully, they have decided to diversify their practices in the consumer business unit. They have entered the sports market to support people in achieving their fitness goals. Several markets are being explored and the purpose of this graduation project is to explore the possibilities in the cycling market; the objective is to develop a personal supportive device for cyclists for TomTom. This master thesis consists of seven chapters. Chapter 1 elaborates on the objective and challenges that are defined for this project. Chapter 2 analyses TomTom and the cycling market. What companies are active, what kind of products do they offer and for who? The market analysis and the analysis of TomTom’s brand and strategy resulted in the decision to design a supportive cycling device for serious cycling enthusiasts in the competitive sports segment. The second part of chapter two researches this target group to identify their habits, problems and needs. With a clear scope and a thorough understanding of the user, the design goal and vision are defined in chapter 3. A clear defined direction with guiding design principles and criteria are described: a companion will be developed for serious cycling enthusiasts, to support them to monitor and reflect on their performance. Ultimately to increase their self-control and improve on their cycling performance in routine (training) rides. In chapter 4 three main concepts are developed out of the ideation phase. An initial concept is created: ride load monitoring, mini-tasks and subjective reports of perceived exertion support the cyclist through four use stages. The companion is designed to function as a riding partner that supports the cyclist to setup a ride, regulate performance for an efficient ride, do effective ride exercises and reflect on his performance. The initial design develops into the final design through three iterations. The first iteration was a visual redesign, which was simulated into a click-through prototype and paper prototypes. In the second iteration two company evaluations and a user review session are set up. With the results of those sessions the concept principles and user interface improved. In the last iteration a usability test was executed with a digital interactive prototype. The user flow and communication style improved and resulted into the final design. Chapter 5 recaps on the goal and set-up of the evaluation sessions and summarizes how they impacted the design. Chapter 6 describes the final design of RiCo. Ride load is implemented for an easy understanding of the cyclist’s status. Mini-tasks are a mechanism to trigger in-ride reflection moments. Advice is given in different use stages, to make the user aware of smart ways to achieve improvement. The chapter explains how RiCo is operated and visualizes how it will be used in a routine ride. Visualizations of RiCo as a complete TomTom product conclude the final design. Final chapter 7 recaps on the assignment of this project. During the project RiCo developed into a standalone TomTom product, it will be used as a companion, supporting serious cyclist enthusiasts to improve on their performance in routine rides.","assistive system; personal informatics; cycling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Rietveld, L.C. (mentor); Fischer, A. (mentor)","2014","Since several decades organic micro pollutants (OMPs) have been detected in natural waters. Although appearing in very low concentrations (nanograms to micrograms per litre or even lower), the presence of more than 100.000 registered chemical substances in the European Union, of which 30.000-70.000 are in daily use, is a major reason for concern. Due to their persistent character the OMPs remain longer in the water cycle and can be transported over a longer distance than other pollutants. Current treatment facilities are not designed to remove those compounds, which causes them to end up in the environment and even in drinking water. The current problems on OMPs in the water cycle are not that the concentrations present in the water cycle are too high to guarantee the safety of drinking water, but are the long-term effects of these concentrations, the increase in concentrations (due to changing circumstances) and the unknown effect of OMPs in mixtures with other OMPs. In order to find a solution to this problem this project focusses on the following question: What is the most sustainable, applicable and cost-efficient strategy to reduce concentrations of selected micro pollutants in surface water and drinking water in the Netherlands? In this project various strategies to reduce the concentrations of OMPs are composed and scored by a Multi Criteria Analysis (MCA). The best strategy is tested on two case studies to see the influence of the strategy on the concentrations. The future situation regarding the emission of OMPs and discharge of river water is also taken into account. Whether the strategy is effective is determined based on limits of concentrations of OMPs. The scope of the project is on drinking water extraction areas in the Netherlands. Firstly a literature study on current European and Dutch legislation and policy, future trends regarding population growth, consumer behaviour and climate change and the presence and behaviour of target compounds in the water cycle is conducted. Based on the Deltascenarios two future scenarios regarding emission of OMPs, river discharge and precipitation are selected: REST and STEAM. Scenario REST is a scenario of economic stagnation with moderate climate change. In scenario STEAM both the economic situation and climate change increases. Later in the report these scenarios are used to test the best strategy on, which reduces the concentrations of OMPs in the water cycle. Dutch limits on OMPs in the water cycle only exist for a few compounds. For other compounds target values of other organisations are used. The found limits and target values are in the order of 0.1-1.0 ?g/L. The target compounds are selected based on an analysis of relevant compounds, which results in a limited number of compounds to elaborate on. Persistence of the compounds and availability of measurement data are important criteria in this analysis. The selected target compounds are carbamazepine, metformin, sulfamethoxazole (pharmaceuticals), iopromide (X-ray contrast agent), acesulfame-K, caffeine (domestic tracer compounds), MTBE (industrial chemical), AMPA, bentazone, glyphosate and N,N-DMS (pesticides). In surface water concentrations of the selected compounds between 0.025 and 83 ?g/L are measured. Found removal efficiencies in WWTPs and DWTPs vary between 0 and 98%, highly depending on the type of OMP, the used treatment techniques and the composition of the influent. Different strategies with different approaches within the water cycle are discussed, which are divided in source approach (use), mitigation approach (emission) and end-of-pipe approach (drinking water). Source approach: 1. Green pharmacy 2. Awareness in use and prescription 3. Legislation and policy 4. Green agriculture, greenhouse farming and cattle breeding Mitigation approach: 5. Separate collection of urine 6. Decentralised collection of wastewater in residential areas 7. Decentralised collection of wastewater in hospitals 8. Improvement of wastewater treatment plants End-of-pipe approach: 9. Improvement of drinking water treatment plants A MCA and sensitivity analysis are used to present the best strategy that is well balanced between all aspects of the water cycle and its users and which is sustainable, applicable, cost-efficient and which functions within European and Dutch legislation. The strategies are scored based on an expert judgement of the expert panel. The best two strategies are applied on water and mass balances of the two case studies to see the impact of the strategies. The first case study is the Bethunepolder between Amsterdam and Utrecht. This is a groundwater system. The second case study is the IJsselmeer area at Andijk, which is a surface water system. Both areas are partly fed by water originating from the river Rhine and serve as a drinking water extraction area. A water balance and, by multiplying the discharges by the measured concentrations, a mass balance of OMPs is composed. The results from the mass balances show whether or not the strategies are sufficient to decrease the concentrations to below the limits. Finally, a comparison between the two types of water systems (groundwater and surface water) is made. The MCA results in a highest score for the strategy ‘legislation and policy’. However, this strategy only holds when incorporating other measures to reduce the emission of OMPs into the water cycle (implementing stricter regulations results in the need for solution at the use or emission of OMPS, WWTP or DWTP). For this reason also a second best strategy is determined. Strategies 1, 2, 4, 8 and 9 are in the same range and score moderately, where strategies 1 and 2 score higher than the remaining three strategies. Although without a big difference with the third best strategy, the second best strategy is ‘green pharmacy’. All strategies with (de)centralised collection and treatment of urine or total wastewater score poor, due to a poor score on all three aspects: sustainability, applicability and cost-efficiency. Although, the systems in the two case studies are both partly fed by the river Rhine (via the groundwater and via the river IJssel), the measured concentrations and exceedance of limits and target values are not the same. In the Bethunepolder the calculated concentrations exceed the limits for six compounds, while none of the measured concentrations exceed the limits. In the Andijk case the calculated concentrations of five compounds exceed the limits, while for the measured concentrations these are only three substances. The future scenarios regarding the emission of OMPs and the discharge of river water are not influencing the (non-) exceedance of the limits. After applying the strategies on the models in the Bethunepolder case concentrations of most compounds decrease to below the limits, where this decrease is in the Andijk case not enough to go below the limits. For both case studies the results show that ‘legislation and policy’ is a better strategy, because concentrations of all compounds are reduced, while for ‘green pharmacy’ only the concentrations of pharmaceuticals decrease. From these results it is concluded that ‘legislation and policy’ is the most sustainable, applicable and cost-efficient strategy to reduce concentrations of selected compounds in surface water and drinking water in the Netherlands. With this strategy governmental regulations regarding the emission of OMPs into the water cycle are improved. Comparing the two case studies with each other it can be concluded that in a groundwater driven system the influence of OMPs seems to be less acute than in a surface water system. However, in the groundwater system the effects of the presence of OMPs will be noticeable after a longer period, which makes this system more unpredictable and it takes more time till measures are resulting in a decrease in concentrations. In this project the MCA is performed without exact numbers for the criteria ‘sustainability’, ‘applicability’ and ‘cost-efficiency’. Further research on these aspects and the addition of more criteria improves the reliability of the MCA and thus of the winning strategy. Regarding the composed models of the case studies more attention needs to be paid to the assumptions on mixing and decay. In a system with high residence times (like the groundwater system of the Bethunepolder) decay could play an important role in the modelling.","Organic Micro Pollutants; water cycle; mass balance; water balance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Sanitary Engineering","",""

(mentor); Barnhoorn, A. (mentor)","2014","Polymer flooding is an important EOR method in heavy oil reservoirs, where field studies showed a recovery up to 59%. However, accurate assessment of injectivity of viscous polymer solutions can give major challenges. Little research has been devoted to pressure build-up phenomena with polymer injection in porous media. Therefore, the objective of this study is to experimentally investigate the water and polymer injectivities in an unconsolidated sand pack saturated either with brine or with heavy oil, subject to confining axial and radial stresses in the range of those encountered in reservoirs. In particular we are interested in the typical reservoir conditions under which failure/hydraulic fracturing of the sample occurs. We also intend to investigate the effect such a hydraulic fracture will have on polymer injectivity. The injection experiments were conducted in a biaxial pressure vessel containing a porous medium, in which flow rates can be controlled and pressures can be measured. Data from rheological measurements and a single phase water flood experiment carried out in this study were utilised for understanding and comparing the injectivity results for polymer flood experiments. The outcome of experimental analysis showed that the viscous nature of the polymer solution and the viscosity of the oil are the main causes for the loss in injectivity compared to a water flood. A change in confining pressure does not influence the injectivity. However, it does affect the occurrence of fracturing. It was found fracturing occurred at a pressure drop of 4.3 times the minimum confining pressure and caused injectivity to rise. Pressure data obtained from the water flood experiments was fitted with prediction models that describe pressure behaviour during injection in a porous medium. Fitting resulted in a value for permeability of the porous medium and was used in prediction models that describe a polymer flood. Polymer flood data gave a best fit when polymer with a constant average viscosity was assumed to have displaced all saturation fluid. The rheology showed that the polymer solution has shear thickening behaviour, making a non-Newtonian model that only considers shear thinning invalid. A displacement model, which describes the displacement of water by a polymer solution with constant viscosity, made clear that retention effects are highest close to the wellbore and decrease when polymer is further invaded in the porous medium. Finally, the results from this study lead to recommendations to refine future experimental polymer flood of this scale.","Polymer; Pressure; Fracture; Petroleum; Injectivity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

In this research, a new type of quay-wall is investigated: the ‘Tube-Cell Combi-Wall’. The Tube-Cell combi-wall consists of relative large diameter piles with flat sheet piles in between. The large diameter piles are the primary elements and are placed with relative large center-to-center distances. The flat sheet piles are the secondary elements and places in an arch shape, so that they will act as a kind of chain. The soil strength, in this research described by the ultimate lateral soil resistance (ULSR), is extensively considered. The Tube-Cell combi-wall is considered as a pile row, loaded in both lateral and axial direction. A new model that calculates the ULSR based on wedge failure of a pile row, subjected to both lateral and axial loads, is developed: the Rough wall Wedge Method for pile Rows (RWMR). In contrast to the current wedge models, this model includes an analytical approach to the influence of overlapping of wedges and vertical loading of the pile row. The model is validated using three dimensional finite element analyses. For computing the lateral soil resistance, the nodel interface stresses presented by Plaxis 3D are integrated over the area of the pile-soil interface. Plaxis 3D shows that the RWMR needs to be corrected due to occurrence of two phenomena: 1) curved slipsurfaces and 2) lateral shaft friction. It is observed that curved slipsurfaces occur, while straight are assumed by the RWMR. Further, the finite element analyses show that the ULSR is made up of two components: a normal- and a lateral shaft friction force. Therefore, increasing the vertical shaft friction will result in a decrease in lateral shaft friction capacity. On the end, it is observed that a vertical force will increase the ULSR of pile row, but not all shaft friction capacity can be used by the vertical component. The steel stresses are verified based on strains instead of stresses. It is concluded that the Tube-Cell combi-wall results in a reduction of the amount of steel of 7% compared to a traditional combined wall. Based on this result, it is concluded that the Tube-Cell combi-wall has potential to compete with the traditional combined wall for the EMO quay-M5. It needs to be noted that the production, transportation, installation and reliability of the Tube-Cell combi-wall is not considered.","quay wall; passive earth pressure; laterally loaded pile; pile row; wedge failure; ultimate lateral soil resistance; lateral soil stiffness; influence of vertical load on lateral soil resistance; local buckling; strain based design verification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Tolou, N. (mentor)","2014","Energy harvesters extract energy from the ambient environment and can be used to power electronic devices. One interesting application of these harvesters is the medical field where in the future they might be used to power pacemakers or medicine pumps. One common energy harvester is the automatic wrist watch, a 1 degree of freedom (DOF) rotational motion harvester. When attached to a generator, the automatic winding device has shown to harvest 50 µW. However, an increase in harvested power is necessary for it to be applicable for other devices. Knowing that wrist motion occurs in different directions, the goal of this study was to design a multi-DOF harvester for a mechanical watch in order to increase the harvesting power. To achieve this goal, firstly measurements of wrist motion during daily activities were performed. Based on the collected wrist motion, the harvestable content of the motion and the principle components of the motion were analyzed. We showed that a correctly orientated energy harvester with the size of a wrist watch can harvest most of the wrist motion (> 90 % of the total variance) by harvesting from only two translations. The correct orientation of the harvester is rotated almost 90 degrees from the original plane. Based on these results a 2-DOF harvester was designed to harvest two translations. The 2-DOF harvester transforms the translations into two rotations which are then used to wind two mainsprings. A simulation performed to evaluate the 2-DOF harvester indicates that it can harvest more motion than the original 1-DOF motion harvester. A prototype of the design was made from acrylic sheets using a laser cutter. This prototype, manufactured at true scale, shows that the 2-DOF energy harvester can be produced and shows a response similar to the expected response.","Energy harvester","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-01-24","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

(mentor)","2014","This thesis describes the design and implementation of an FPGA-based hardware platform based on the rVEX VLIW softcore and the adaption of a Linux 2.0 no_mmu kernel to run on that platform. The rVEX is a runtime reconfigurable VLIW softcore processor. It supports various configurations that allow programs to run faster or more efficient. The rVEX core can switch between different configurations while it is running. Reconfigurations are typically performed by a software program that is running on a different processor. We discuss the concept of using an Operating System, running on the core itself, that monitors the execution of its tasks and orchestrates core reconfigurations during task switches. In addition to using statically found optimal configurations, performance counters could be added to the core that measure how efficient a program is running on the current core configuration. The OS could use that data to evaluate if another configuration would be beneficial. The implementation of the hardware platform and the porting of the Linux kernel represent the first steps in working towards that final goal. To support our Linux port, a vectored trap controller has been designed. Additionally, a debugging environment has been created by designing a hardware debug unit, implementing an RSP server program and adding rVEX support to the GNU debugger (GDB).","Operating Systems; Linux; reconfigurable; VLIW; Computer Architecture; Interrupts; GCC; binutils; GDB","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","SCT","","CE","",""

(mentor)","2014","During 1997-2000 Dyngjujökull, one of the major outlet glaciers of the main Icelandic ice cap Vatnajökull, surged. This event was captured by ERS 1 and 2 satellites flying in tandem mode, enabling the use of InSAR to monitor the motion of the glacier. Since a major limitation of InSAR is its sensitivity to deformation in only one dimension, the research presented in this M.Sc. thesis searched the most accurate method of extracting azimuthal deformation using InSAR. Starting from a theoretical framework, the available methods are explored and corresponding measurement uncertainty formulas are derived. Currently available software enables the possibility to underpin the theoretical findings by performing different tests to compare two methods that are widely used in the InSAR community. Results show the presence of azimuthal shifts corresponding to TEC variations in the Earths ionosphere, which partly distort the along-track deformation. To solve this, the nature of this signal is studied and a filtering method is designed. Consequently, the corrected azimuth interferograms are used jointly with LOS interferometric data in a Markov Random Field minimum energy method, optimized by Simulated Annealing to derive 3D flow fields of the Dyngjujökull glacier in surge. This glaciology method is tested for its response behavior using synthetic data. The testing schemes involved mainly noise propagation and assessing the influence of different weighting factors in the optimization of the 3D flow outcomes. Knowing the limitations of the glaciology method, 3D flow fields are derived with real input data accordingly. The results show both horizontal- and vertical velocities corresponding to observational data. Finally, the presence of a process similar to a system of linked cavities as the subglacial hydrologic mechanism of surging glaciers is indicated by the glaciological outcomes.","InSAR; Ionosphere; Multiple Aperture InSAR; Offset tracking; SAR; Spectral Diversity; Speckle","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","Radar Remote Sensing","",""

(mentor)","2014","This thesis investigates the applicability of the Probabilistic Inference for Learning COntrol (PILCO) algorithm to large systems and systems with time varying measurement noise. PILCO is a state-of-the-art model-learning Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm that uses a Gaussian Process (GP) model to average over uncertainties during learning. Simulated case studies on a second-order system and a cart-pole system show that both the Radial Basis Function (RBF) controller and the GP controller find good solutions when the number of basis functions is chosen correctly. However, when a high number of basis functions is selected, the RBF controller fails completely, while the GP controller is able find a suboptimal solution. In order to reduce the computational time for large systems is the identification of the GP model parallelized. For a four dimensional model the parallelization results in a 20 to 40 percent reduction of the identification computational time. A simulated case study of a cart-pole system shows a strong decrease in performance when increasing the measurement noise variance or kurtosis. The controller is robust for changing skewness of the measurement noise. Furthermore is the variance of the measurement noise an important parameter, because it has to be selected as a fixed parameter of the GP controller prior to learning. Therefore Adaptive-Probabilistic Inference for Learning COntrol (A-PILCO) is proposed. This is a framework that initiates a new learning process when the measurement noise variance exceeds its confidence bounds. By reducing the computational time significantly for large and/or complex systems and by implementing the A-PILCO framework the PILCO algorithm becomes applicable larger set of systems.","reinforcement learning; Bayesian inference; Gaussian Process; adaptive nonlinear control; parallel computing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-01-23","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","Systems and Control","",""

(mentor); Van der Spek, S.C. (mentor)","2014","Since the 1950s the city of Lima, capital of Peru, has drastically grown both in size and inhabitants due to a process of rapid urbanization, by which the city has expanded horizontally in an informal way. Informal settlements have occupied peripheral areas, producing a centre-periphery pattern of urban development. Because the activity centres remained in the city centre informal settlement dwellers have to travel for long hours to the centre to work. For more than 20 years Lima has been without mass public transport due to inattention from governmental entities. As a result an extensive informal public transport system established itself. This transit network has grown in amounts of vehicles, routes, competitiveness and an unsafe transit environment over the last years. The entire city is well connected by informal public transport, making it difficult for single mass public transport corridors like Metro Line 1 to compete against the inefficient informal system. Governmental entities of Lima are just starting to implement mass public transport corridors within the city, but a lot of adjustments of the urban environment have to be made to regain lost urban space and ensure the transit efficiency of public transport. The objective of this graduation project is to develop an approach to tackle public transport related problems of a large city in a developing country, characterized by high levels of informality and socio-spatial segregation, using Transit-Oriented Development. This strategy focuses on the analysis and improvement of Lima’s metro line corridor that started operation in 2012, linking the historic city centre, the modern centre and informal peripheries of the city. This approach aims to create different urban transit nodes typologies and urban development opportunities based on theory. The obtained typologies and opportunities have a high potential to develop and integrate the mass public transport network, optimizing land-use efficiency creating and recovering the adjacent urban space. A general vision is developed with three urban design interventions of three metro station areas, which are considering the most significant and representative three different urban patterns of Lima. This thesis can be considered as an exemplary and results are applicable to other and future urban transit nodes in Lima and other similar metropolitan cities in developing countries.","Transit-Oriented Development; informal settlements; redevelopment transit nodes; social-spatial fragmentation; social inequality; Lima Peru","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-01-21","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","Explorelab","",""

A hydraulic circuit, incorporating an 8.5 m riser pipe of 99.4 mm inner diameter, was built to identify and quantify the dominant transport mechanisms during conveying, merging and passing of two batches of solids. Experiments were conducted with single batches and various combinations of two batches, including two types of sand (0.39 mm and 1.05 mm), two types of gravel (6.34 mm and 11.20 mm) and Polystyrene granulate (2.80 mm). Experiments indicated a decreasing influence of axial dispersion for an increasing particle size and particle density. By measurement data analysis, it is proven that axial dispersion is negligible for coarser solids, implying a larger risk of concentration peaks during transport compared to recent numerical calculations which assumed Taylor dispersion. Experiments with two merging batches revealed the ability for sand to merge and pass the gravel, whereas polystyrene merges and fuses with the gravel leading to pipe blockage. This discrepancy is thought to originate from a specific solids diameter ratio between both batches. A relation is suggested between the occurrence of pipe blockage and Terzaghi’s filter rules. The report concludes that the volume fraction of solids can rise significantly during the merging process and that for certain solids combinations, the merging process can lead to blockage of the riser.","hydraulic vertical transport; deep sea mining; axial dispersion; pipe blockage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Maritime and Transport Technology","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

The Kurdistan Region is a federated region in Iraq that has experienced very strong socio-economic growth in the last ten years coupled with a strong contrast between poverty and wealth. The populated city in this region, Suleimany city, has also undergone this phenomenon. The ever-widening gap between rich and poor is symbolized by the stark disparity in the quality of the living environment. The current young government does not have proper regional housing policy nor does it have an adequate land management system. According to figures (Mumtaz 2011), the city of Suleimany needs more housing for its target groups. In order to achieve the maximum benefit, the report will be limited and emphasis will be put on the land issues and the low-income household. As for this research this significant housing aspect will be further elaborated to find a solution for the housing problem. According to UNESCAP and UN-Habitat (2008), for the urban poor there is probably no more fundamental problem than their inability to access decent, secure land for even the most minimum housing needs.","land; housing; low-income","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-01-22","Architecture and The Built Environment","Real Estate & Housing","","Housing Policy, Management and Sustainability","",""

By focusing on decision making within creative problem solving, an analysis of convergent techniques was done which resulted in a new categorization for these techniques. Additionally, a model was formed which summarized a generic creative problem solving and decision making process and implemented influencing factors from the field of creativity and behavioral decision making. At last, this knowledge created the basis for the design of a new tool aimed to help companies in creative problem solving.

The proposed solution, utilizes Riak with ZooKeeper to provide a single point of entry, scalable, and fault-tolerant communication service. I developed a prototype service and load simulator to demonstrate its scalability and failure tolerance through an extensive load simulation of 32 thousand users. The results show how failures are dealt with, and how the cluster expands, all without disrupting the user interaction on the service.","scalability; fault-tolerant; groupware service; enterprise communication; communication service","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-01-21","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software and Computer Technology","","Web Information Systems","",""

This thesis presents a generative approach for data synchronization between web and mobile applications, which simplifies the creation of a standalone mobile application based on an existing web application. The generated framework is an incremental approach for synchronization of data in different representations.

(mentor)","2014","Since a few years, more than 50% of people live in urban areas and this number will increase, resulting in major city expanions while facing (potential) problems such as an inadequate access to drinking water, poor levels of sanitation and not enough space for rainwater. Therefore the integration between the water system and architecture becomes ever more important. Especially in a growing city as Tamale, Ghana, all of the scenarios above are actual problems already. On one hand you have the increasing needs for drinking water, utility water and dwellings, while on the other hand there are the increasing risks of drought, high levels of surface runoff and poor quality of sanitation. These problems all come together and coexist once people decide to live in a certain area. Because of growing demands and diminishing space, it makes sense to integrate architecture with a plan for water in stead of treating all problems individually. Preferably in such a way that they can support each other and perhaps even enhance the design as a whole. In short the design will contain a small a small neighbourhood for 500 people that has all the facilities to provide for safe utility and drinking water all year round, to provide for hygienic sanitation and to minimise flood risks during the rainy season. The design is a combination of architecture and the water system. They both ‘share the same space’ and influence each other rather than the water system being an individual aspect that is subordinate to the architectural framework. The scale of the project is not limited to the neighbourhood, but includes building blocks (50 people) and individual houses. (Whenever ‘water system’ is mentioned in this guidebook, it will always refer to more than just what happens inside the walls of a building. It can include up to the whole cycle: precipitation, harvesting, storage, filtration, use, source separation, nutrient recovery, infiltration, retention, etc. as all of them affect the human environment.)","water; integration; architecture; sustainability; nutrients; water management; expansion; vernacular architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Explore Lab","",""

(mentor); Stapersma, D. (mentor)","2014","The aim of this thesis is to investigate whether other representation techniques of the in-cylinder pressure signal, besides the current pressure-crank angle curve, have the potential of improving the diagnosis in a condition monitoring program. Investigated are the quantitative representation of the heat release through Vibe parameters and the analysis of a temperature-specific entropy diagram. These two alternative techniques are being discussed theoretically in the first part and are tested through simulations in the second part. Two pre existing MatLab models, functioning as the selected 12SW28 benchmark engine, are used to analyse pressure measurements collected from the Marinebedrijf. Three different situations are being discussed: a reference dataset, a dataset diagnosed with leaking injectors, and simulated blowby by an implemented subsystem in the models. For all three of these situations, the outcome in terms of p-alpha curve, Vibe parameters, and Ts curve are being compared. The output of the simulations seemed promising at first but unfortunately the consistency of output abnormalities raises doubts on whether the input parameters are all valid. To test this, five possible input errors are simulated and the effects are studied. The cause of the abnormalities, whether diesel engine faults or systematic errors, can not be determined in this thesis. This means that the potential of Vibe parameters and the Ts diagram, in terms of condition monitoring diagnostics, can not be determined based on this data. The current way of analysing the pressure signal is not really influenced by these possible errors. However, functioning as input for a heat release simulation model enlarges these errors, creating an unreliable output. Fixing these possible errors, and other structural shortcomings of the current condition monitoring program at the Marinebedrijf, will certainly improve the representation.","vibe; diesel engine; condition monitoring; heat release","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Mechanical Engineering","","MSI","",""

(mentor); Van Oosterom, P. (mentor)","2014","The past seventy years the number of disasters that occur, man-made and natural, has increased. This problem requires suitable and efficient means to control and respond to emergency situations. Currently, the emergency responders use maps and software that allows for two dimensional visualisations of situations. Meanwhile the development of visualisation software continues. In the Netherlands the interest in CityGML, software for 3D city visualisation, has vastly increased after the 3D pilot ‘NL’, coordinated by Geonovum. As a result of this interest, Geonovum has set up a Dutch CityGML format, which is an extension of the existing 2D IMGeo format. This extension contains the standard 3D objects that make up a city, but might lack objects that are required specifically for disaster fighting. A three dimensional environment could provide a better overview of a location than a 2D map and also allow for 3D, and thus more realistic, computations such as 3D distance, 3D flow computation, 3D visibility analysis and for example flood simulations. These possibilities could have profits for emergency responders but might require extensions of the IMGeo information model and its data before IMGeo can be used for emergency response. There are a lot of organisations, actors, involved in emergency response. Based on their experience, obtained insight and a literature study, this thesis researched to what extent IMGeo and CityGML comply with the user requirements for an emergency response model. The results indicated that IMGeo covers the basics of an emergency response model, but that a lot of scenario related objects are missing (e.g. dikes). These objects are to be combined per scenario and thus form scenario based modelling; the base of this research. This modelling allows dosed relevant visuals of the model. which is important since too much information will slow down a model and could counteract the user.","emergency response; IMGeo; user requirements; scenario based modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","GIS Technology","","Geomatics","",""

From this exploration it was possible to conclude that a standardised solution would be a multi faceted one, i.e. only addressing the materialisation would not be sufficient. To this end Model M was developed. Model M is a standardised signage system than is based on standardising sign design by creating a standardised grids for multiple sign types and contexts. Next to this also the materialisation was designed to create a congruent sign system that can be easily reused, repaired and recycled. Finally some tools were proposed to the streamline wayfinding and sign design as well as tools that could help persuade a potential client. In evaluating Model M it has become apparent that the goals set out in this project seem to been met, although there are some issues that need extra attention to make Model M into a successfull and directly applicable product.","signage; standardisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

Most household consumers only receive feedback on how much energy they have consumed that year, by receiving their annual utilities bill. But these bills only give an overview of the overall consumption, leaving consumers clueless about what caused the increase of their energy consumption. Lately energy suppliers have been marketing the use of energy feedback monitors and more of these devices have entered the market that enable the users to gain insight and manage their energy consumption. DSP Innovation BV has developed such a Home Energy Management System, called See What You Can Save. They have succesfully implemented their system in businesses and housing corporations, and are now considering to enter the consumer market. The aim of this graduation project is to analyse the consumer market and to redesign the system so that it fits the needs of the household consumer. The first step in this process is to analyse the market and its competitors and to look for opportunities. The analysis lead to the conclusion that, in order to succesfully enter the consumer market, DSP Innovation BV will have to differentiate themselves from the competition and offer something new, to better help the consumers save energy. It was decided that the focus of the research should be on improving the feedback and the usability of the system, and literature was reviewed to gather requirements. Next to the theoretical data, user tests were performed with the current system to identify any shortcomings. And as a result a list of requirements was established that served as a foundation for concept development. The redesign aims to give consumers richer insights into their consumption patterns and the consumption of their devices. The main feature is that it uses tangible information to point out exactly how much users can save on individual devices by changing their behaviour, or by replacing older appliances for more energy efficient models. A final concept called SWYCS @Home was further developed into an interactive prototype to evaluate the design. More user tests were performed with the prototype and the results were quite positive in general. In conclusion the system has to give the users an integral solution, that can help them to manage, not only their electricity consumption, but their gas and water cosumption as well. However the analysis phase and consumer research have also pointed out that, in order to succesfully launch a consumer version of the system, additional research and development is needed. In the future developement chapter recommendations are made about which aspects DSP Innovation BV needs to consider, before taking the next step.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2015-01-17","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Bakker, C.A. (mentor)","2014","E-waste, price volatility of resources and the constant increase of the middle class world population expecting the same ‘high quality’ life standards have (amongst other) made some companies consider their options. In the reports of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, one aspect of the circular economy model aims at decoupling sales revenues from material input using a restorative industrial economy by intention and design. In contrast to the current model, products are designed for maintenance, reuse, refurbishment, remanufactured and/or recycling. Special care is put in thinking how to reuse the totality of the materials and reclaim the embedded value in end-of-life (EoL) products. The current linear consumption situation of the sector was analysed in order to identify guidelines, challenges and opportunities to the implementation of circular economy principles. Since no design guidelines have been published for the development of circular products, various guidelines were gathered from literature on inter alia design for disassembly, design for maintenance, design for refurbishment, design for remanufacture and design for recycling. These were combined and organised in five categories: Product Structure, Components, Materials, Joints and Accessories. Multiple threats to the application of circular thinking exist with respect to society & customers, design, manufacturing, EoL and economics. For example, the complexity of the map of stakeholders, the complexity of the composition of current mobile phones, the lack of knowledge on the topic throughout the value chain, customer behaviour and confidentiality issues might stand in the way of circularity. Various opportunities for circular systems and products can be seized. Public procurement and B2B can be seen as interesting targets for the introduction of circular devices and business models (as compared to consumer customers). By offering a lease-like programme, users can have access to personalised performances and upgrade products to meet these performance requirements during their contract period with a mobile network operator. The operator could thus remain in control of the embedded resources. Collaboration cross cycles and sectors will be essential for the success of this model. The drafted guidelines, challenges and opportunities were translated into concrete characteristics for a desired circular future product and system in the mobile telecommunication industry for an advanced scenario (technically possible within ten years). The design named BlackbOx has standardised 3D printed components, durable and self-healing materials, and is completely recycled and recyclable. Active disassembly techniques have been integrated to ensure an efficient, effective and profitable treatment circular process. A roadmap describing the steps from the current situation to this desired situation was made. Both the system and the products are further detailed for each milestone. The first milestone focusses on the low hanging fruits. The second and third ones are concentrating on making the most important components circular. In an advanced scenario (fourth milestone), all components are becoming circular. Finally in a truly circular economy (fifth milestone), the whole system and product are designed to create no waste. A second product was developed for the first milestone so as to embody the previously formulated characteristics and assess the drafted guidelines. It could be in use by employees in the public and private sector within a period of two years. The aim of this product development was to decrease costs on maintenance and refurbishment operations and lower the barriers for customers to hand in their old devices. The ratio between the labour needed to retrieve components and the value of the involved components and materials had to be improved. The designed mobile phone has a durable and minimalistic design suitable for the users. The product is also built from the inside out. The components to be prioritised are standardised and modular using joints utilised in other commercially available products. As a result, these can be more easily disassembled therefore more simply repaired, upgraded, refurbished, remanufactured and recycled. The set of drafted guidelines were evaluated during the two product developments and fine tuned to be used by other industrial designers. Key characteristics of a circular mobile device can be summarised to: built to last, easy to disassemble, modular parts, standardised components and joints, upgradeable components, materials cycle through the various CE circles (‘waste’ is used as input), uncontaminated material flows, and finally, tight CE circles are preferred thoughout the life of the product.","circular economy; disassembly; design guidelines; maintenance; refurbishment; remanufacture; recycling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Maleki, S. (mentor); Leus, G. (mentor)","2014","Energy-harvesting cognitive radio network has emerged as a solution to increase energy and spectrum efficiency. In this thesis, we propose short-term offline optimal power allocation algorithms for multi-user energy-harvesting cognitive radio networks considering interference between secondary users. Assuming finite and rechargeable batteries for secondary users and a time-slotted operation model, an off-line optimization problem is formulated so as to maximize the network throughput during finite time-period. To that aim, the design of a power allocation and the spectrum sensing strategy is required. Together with the inherent constraints imposed by the use of energy-harvesting devices, a collision constraint is also required to limit the probability of interference with the primary user and to guarantee the quality of service. Because of the intractability of the power allocation problem in the interference channel, we spilt the optimization task for two different size cognitive radio networks: a) 2-user network, and b) multi-user network (i.e. more than 2 users). The optimal algorithms are developed for a sharing single-frequency band, and a multi-band scenario for the two-user network. We derive the optimal solution following a two-step strategy in case of a 2-user energy-harvesting CR network. A suboptimal algorithm that entails reduced computational cost and performs very close to the optimal one is also proposed for the single-band sharing scenario. In case of multi-user energy-harvesting cognitive radio networks, a SQP-based sub-optimal algorithm is derived for single-band sharing scenario. Besides, a optimal solution is proposed for a CR network applying interference cancelation techniques sharing the single band. At last, we derive the optimal power allocation strategies for the multi-user multi-band sharing scenario. Simulation results of the optimal (and suboptimal) solutions outperform those achieved by a random or priority best-user power allocation algorithms for the AND and OR fusion rules.","cognitive radio networks; energy-efficiency; power allocation; energy-harvesting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-04-30","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","Electrical Engineering","",""

(mentor); van Paassen, M.M. (mentor); Mulder, Max (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2014","This research investigates a neuromuscular analysis based tuning algorithm for haptic cues that has been hypothesized to simultaneously improve safety and workload when compared to heuristic tuning, applied to a haptic collision avoidance system for unmanned aircraft teleoperation. This novel tuning method considers the combined stiffness of the human arm and the control inceptor when computing ideal haptic cues. The `relaxed' setting of the neuromuscular system, for which neural reflexes are suppressed, is chosen as the design point for tuning haptic cues as it is expected to lead to the lowest workload, contrary to the `force' and `position' settings. Theoretical investigations using offline simulations verified the novel approach and the selection of the `relaxed' setting. Subsequently, a teleoperation experiment (n=12) in an obstacle laden urban environment was conducted with six different tuning profiles, including a manual control condition. Results showed that safety, workload and situational awareness was substantially improved over conditions that ignored the neuromuscular system. Additionally, over-tuning haptic cues was found to be worse than manual control for user acceptance of the system. No significant differences were found between the `relaxed' and `force' settings, suggesting that selection between these two options depends on the specific application of haptic cues. The admittance-trajectory relationship during teleoperation was studied, without haptic cues, to further improve the tuning method. Here, no statistical differences in admittance were observed between different obstacles. However, a significant effect was found for admittance variations within obstacles, and an inverse relationship was established between admittance and UAV velocity/yaw rate.","Haptics; UAV; Teleoperation; Haptic Shared Control; Collision Avoidance; Neuromuscular admittance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Control & Simulation","",""

(mentor); Kuiper, C. (mentor); Weijers, J.B.A. (mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor)","2014","The Afsluitdijk is unable to withstand the future conditions that belong to an annual probability of occurrence of 1/10 000 per year for water level and wave conditions. Solution of Rijkswaterstaat is to strengthen the dike according to the principle of the wave overtopping resilient dike (NL: Overslagbestendige dijk). Therefore the Afsluitdijk has to be able to cope with large amounts of wave overtopping (>150 l/s/m). The current design methods are unsuitable to prove the resistance of the Afsluitdijk against these large amounts. The goal of this thesis is to develop design procedures in order to prove the landward slopes erosion resilience of the Afsluitdijk against large amounts of wave overtopping. Based on a theoretical study a new design procedure has been developed, this method consists of six sub-procedures, two choices and two results. The first step is to determine the wave overtopping discharge. Up to 30 l/s/m good quality grass can be applied. This average wave overtopping discharge appeared a good measure for the load below 30 l/s/m. Otherwise the load should be expressed as the front flow velocity per overtopping wave. It is important to express the velocity for each wave separately, because only waves resulting in a higher velocity than the critical velocity contribute to the damage. Damage only occurs if the critical velocity the landward slope is able to withstand is exceeded. These wave are the number of critical overtopping waves Ncow or the percentage of waves that contribute to the damage Pcow. The overtopping velocities are based on empirical relations between the overtopping velocity and volume. The volume has been determined using the probability of a certain wave volume to occur (a Weibull distribution with a freeboard dependent scale factor a and shape factor b). A categorization based on the discontinuities and objects that are present on the Afsluitdijk has been created. For each category an amplification factor for the front flow velocity has been derived which varied from 1 (no influence) to 2.1 (for holes). With the velocity distributions the required critical velocity can be calculated using the cumulative overload factor. In which each wave has contributes to the damage D. The influence of the storm duration and the allowable damage number D on the critical velocity has been analyzed. As well as the relation between the critical velocity, the number of critical overtopping waves and the percentage of critical overtopping waves. The results of the procedure are a required protective top layer or required investigations to complete the procedure. These investigations can be the development of the flow velocity on the berm, gradual transition between slope and berm, transition between dike section geometry, transition between different revetment types, influence of bushes, damage as an effect of large external structures and the resilience of revetments other than grass. The application of this procedure to the Afsluitdijk resulted in required critical velocities varying from 5.8 (smooth crest) to 12.4 m/s (rectangular structures). From tests in the past it appeared that the top layer of the Afsluitdijk is able to withstand 6.3 m/s. This is insufficient for the conditions considered in the thesis. The limits of grass are exceeded and another revetment type should be applied. For pulsating wave overtopping currently no method exists that is able to prove the resilience of other revetments than grass, this is due to the non steady state character of wave overtopping. With this knowledge and realizing that the whole outer revetment should be replaced as well, it can be questioned if the concept of an overtopping resilient dike is the best choice for the reinforcement of the Afsluitdijk.","overtopping; resilient; Afsluitdijk; large volumes; landward slope; erosion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-01-18","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","",""

The most important design variables of the dike cross-section dimensions are set and following probabilistic design methods, the probability of failure of many different dike cross-sections is estimated based on the abovementioned failure mechanisms.

(mentor)","2014","The floriculture sector is globalizing and digitizing rapidly. This affects the flows in the supply chain and the way of doing business with FloraHolland. Customers are becoming more demanding and are expecting more service. Growers decrease the use of the auction clock, and do more business via direct flows. The Logistics and Facilities Department is partly responsible for optimizing the logistics process. In this process the available data is processed in a large number of different reports. While possessing this large number of reports, FloraHolland is looking for the Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s) for the logistics process. The logistic process of FloraHolland is analyzed according to the Delft System Approach. During this analysis a number of issues were found referring to the control of the logistics process. The first observation is that the logistics process is controlled via financial control instead of logistic control. This leads to a lack of focus of an efficient logistics process and makes it hard to initiate the right process improvements. ‘Distribution Flowers’ is the largest of 13 logistics departments. This department is responsible for 39% of the working hours of the logistic process. However, the deployment of staff for this distributionprocess is determined by a planning-tool that is based on an outdated process. Also, there is no standard set for the productivity of the staff, but the productivity is chosen based on intuition and experience. In the distributionprocess the distributors transfer the casks from the auctioned trolley to trolleys which are delivered at buyers locations. The productivity of the distributors is dependent on the purchasing behavior and number of distributors because of congestion. The research question of this report is: With which KPIs and standards can FloraHolland control their logistics process in a changing environment? FloraHolland provides logistics services to growers and buyers. The demands of the growers and buyers on the logistics process can be divided in reliability, quality, throughput time and efficiency. The first three can be expressed in the percentage of casks that are missing, damaged, or took more handling time than the agreed throughput time. For an efficient process a workload should be processed with minimal resources. The most important and most expensive resource is the staff. At different stages of the process the departments are dealing with various types of workloads...","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-01-14","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

(mentor); Van Bueren, E.M. (mentor); Ploeger, H.D. (mentor)","2014","Netbeheerders en gemeenten plegen werkzaamheden voor de aanleg, onderhoud en vervanging van kleine ondergrondse infrastructuren. Zij doen dit om aan de vraag uit de maatschappij te kunnen voldoen en om de netwerken te laten functioneren in overeenstemming met de gestelde doelen, veiligheidseisen en wet- en regelgeving. Door de aanleg van glasvezel en hemelwater-afvoersystemen, het onderhoud en de vervanging van het gasnet, het drinkwaternet, de riolering en het werken in de openbare ruimte ondervindt (in het algemeen) de burger steeds vaker bovengrondse hinder. Deze hinder is onder andere in de vorm van overlast voor de omgeving (door geluid, stank, zand etc.) en de overlast op verkeers- en vervoersstromen (omleidingen, opengebroken straten en trottoirs) wanneer er bij werkzaamheden gegraven wordt (Jonkhoff, Van Ravensteijn, Van de Velde, & Hompe, 2013; Rozenberg, Lieshout, Van Wingerden, & Jonkhoff, 2007). Een mogelijke reductie van de overlast is te bereiken door samenwerking tussen gemeenten en netbeheerders. Het doel van dit onderzoek is te verkennen op welke wijze gemeenten en netbeheerders kunnen samenwerken om de overlast bij aanleg, onderhoud en vervanging van kleine ondergrondse infrastructuren te minimaliseren. Aan de hand van literatuur- en empirisch onderzoek is een analyse gemaakt van het totstandkomingsproces en de manier van vastlegging van de samenwerking. Theoretisch kader Voor het theoretisch kader is gebruik gemaakt van vijf theoretische handreikingen uit de literatuur: - het besturingsparadigma van De Leeuw (1990) - de institutionele structuur en het vier lagen institutie model van Williamson beschreven door Koppenjan en Groenewegen (2005) - de kenmerken van actorgedrag in netwerken beschreven door De Bruijn en Ten Heuvelhof (1999) - de kenmerken van convenanten, privaatrechtelijke overeenkomsten en formele regels in netwerken beschreven door De Bruijn en Ten Heuvelhof (1999) - de procesontwerpeisen van De Bruijn, Ten Heuvelhof, en In 't Veld (2012) Bovenstaande literatuur is geanalyseerd om inzicht te krijgen in de totstandkoming van samenwerking, netwerk dynamiek, instituties en vastgelegde institutionele structuren. Er is voor bovenstaande theoriee?n gekozen, omdat deze aansluiten op de onderzochte situatie waarbij gemeenten en netbeheerders tot samenwerking kunnen komen. Empirisch casestudie onderzoek Voor het empirische onderzoek is gekozen voor een vergelijkend casestudie onderzoek. Hierbij is gebruik gemaakt van documentstudie, diepte-interviews en participerende observaties. De onderzochte cases hebben betrekking op praktijkervaringen van samenwerkingen, waarbij op een breed niveau (stad, gemeente) of op een beperktere schaal (straat of wijk) de samenwerking heeft plaatsgevonden. De geanalyseerde cases zijn: - Tilburg: Afstemmingskader Gemeente Tilburg Deze case betreft een brede samenwerking (afstemmingsoplossing) waarbij de gemeente een convenant is aangegaan met de netbeheerders Enexis (gas en elektra) en netbeheerder Brabant Water (drinkwater). Enexis heeft in de gemeente Tilburg een ze?e?r grote saneringsopgavevan het gasnet en zonder een toekomstige samenwerking zou volgens de gemeente de burger (te) veel hinder ondervinden en zou de stad onbereikbaar worden. - Amsterdam: Coo?rdinatiestelsel Werken aan de Weg Amsterdam Deze case betreft een brede samenwerking (afstemmingsoplossing) waarbij alle pa rtijen in de openbare ruimte zijn betrokken doormiddel van een verordening. Het Coo?rdinatiestelsel is het grootste stelsel qua afstemming van projecten in de openbare ruimte in Nederland en is opvallend omdat het uitgaat van een breed gedragen beleid door aangesloten partijen in de openbare ruimte. - Amsterdam: Integrale Leidingen Tunnel Mahlerlaan (ILT) Amsterdam Deze case betreft een specifieke civiele oplossing waarbij alle modaliteiten van ondergrondse kleine infrastructuur zijn ondergebracht in een tunnelconstructie. De ILT komt voort uit de visie van een hoogwaardige Zuidas, waarbij de straten niet open hoeven voor aanleg, onderhoud en vervanging van kabels en leidingen. - Alphen aan den Rijn: Kabel- en Leidingengoot Alphen aan den Rijn Deze case betreft een specifieke civiele oplossing waarbij vrijwel alle modaliteiten van ondergrondse kleine infrastructuur zijn ondergebracht in een gootconstructie met inspectieputten, onderling verbonden met mantelbuizen. Het is een nog te realiseren pilot project, metde focus op de technische kant van de oplossingen. De totstandkoming van samenwerking tussen netbeheerders en gemeenten Er zijn vijf aspecten naar voren gekomen met betrekking tot de totstandkoming van samenwerking: 1. De gemeente speelt een belangrijke rol in het initiatief van samenwerking Dit komt voort uit het feit dat de gemeente de belangen van haar burgers behartigt. De belangen van de netbeheerders liggen anders doordat zij andere kernwaarden en taken h ebben. Daarnaast heeft de gemeente de rol van regievoerder/vergunningverlener en was daarom in alle cases een noodzakelijke partij als het ging om samenwerking in de openbare ruimte. In alle cases namen de betrokken gemeenten het initiatief en dit werkte positief in de totstandkoming. 2. Een transparant handelende procesmanager zorgt voor vertrouwen en gelijkwaardigheid van partijen Het ontbreken van een (externe) transparant handelende procesmanager gaf in een aantal cases aanleiding tot spanning. Dit was het geval bij de start van de cases ILT in Amsterdam en Alphen aan den Rijn met als gevolg onrust en het dwarsliggen door e?e?n van de betrokken partijen. Daarnaast blijkt uit de vier onderzochte cases dat op het moment dat het proces transparant werd, dit tot gevolg had dat het proces op gang kwam en er vertrouwen ontstond in het proces. Het moeilijkste facet van de samenwerking blijkt voor veel partijen het zich verplaatsen in, en het respecteren van de kernwaarden van de andere partijen. Vanuit eigen inzicht lijken plannen logisch en nuttig voor alle partijen, maar bij een benadering vanuit de andere partij zal soms blijken dat dergelijke plannen helemaal niet logisch of gewenst zijn. Een transparant handelende (externe) procesmanager zorgde voor vertrouwen in het proces, gelijke kansen voor alle partijen, bescherming van ieders kernwaarden, en daarnaast bracht deze de juiste personen aan tafel. 3. Betrekking bij het proces van alle relevante partijen in een vroeg stadium draagt bij aan een goede start en betrokkenheid bij het proces In Tilburg werden alle partijen die noodzakelijk waren voor het proces vanaf het begin betrokken bij het proces. In het geval van het Coo?rdinatiestelsel in Amsterdam en bij de Kabel- en leidingentunnel in Alphen aan den Rijn zijn ook alle partijen betrokken vanaf het begin. Deze aanpak resulteerde in Tilburg en Amsterdam in een positieve snelle start. In het proces rond de ILT in de Mahlerlaan z ijn de partijen te laat betrokken, met als gevolg dat dit een grote financie?le impact heeft gehad op het project en men door het uitlopen de doelstelling uiteindelijk niet volledig heeft gehaald. Uit de cases blijkt dat een vroege betrekking leidt tot een snelle start en betrokkenheid bij het proces, daar waar een late betrekking vertraging en uitloop tot gevolg heeft. 4. Een dubbele sense of urgency is noodzakelijk voor actieve deelname aan samenwerking en de bereidheid om tot procesafspraken te komen Uit de cases blijkt dat een samenwerking pas echt tot stand komt als er sprake is van een dubbele sense of urgency. Een dubbele sense of urgency betekent dat er zowel een inhoudelijke als een procesmatige noodzaak moet zijn om tot een samenwerking te komen. Er moet een gedegen inhoudelijke noodzaak zijn zoals de saneringsopgave van Enexis in Tilburg. Daarnaast moeten de partijen er van overtuigd zijn dat een procesmatige aanpak de beste aanpak is. Dit laatste zag men sterk terug in het Coo?rdinatiestelsel van Amsterdam waarbij men in het proces mee mag beslissen over de regels van het stelsel. Niet deelnemen aan dit proces betekent dat men ook geen invloed heeft. Met enkel een inhoudelijke sense lukt het de partijen meestal niet om zelfstandig het probleem op te lossen. In sommige gevallen krijgt een partij later alsnog het gevoel dat een procesmatige aanpak noodzakelijk is om tot een oplossing te komen. Dit is wat men terugziet in het proces rond de ILT in Amsterdam: initieel probeerde het Ontwikkelbedrijf Gemeente Amsterdam en het Ingenieurs Bureau Amsterdam er zelfstandig uit te komen maar uiteindelijk zag men in dat er een procesmatige aanpak noodzakelijk was waaraan alle relevante partijen deelnamen. 5. Vertrouwen tussen de afgevaardigde personen in het proces vergemakkelijkt de totstandkoming van samenwerking Als de afgevaardigde personen vertrouwen in elkaar hebben, leidt dit in de bekeken cases tot succes in de samenwerking. Door dit onderling vertrouwen is men bereid om elkaar iets te gunnen en om met elkaar sneller tot een samenwerking te komen. De vijf empirisch gevonden aspecten worden onderschreven door de geanalyseerde theoriee?n en vormen de essentie?le aspecten in het opzetten van een samenwerking tussen netbeheerders en gemeenten ter minimalisatie van de overlast bij aanleg, onderhoud en vervanging van kleine ondergrondse infrastructuren. De vastlegging van de institutionele structuur van de samenwerking tussen netbeheerders en gemeenten Naast de totstandkoming is de institutionele vastlegging van de samenwerking geanalyseerd. Er kwamen twee aspecten naar voren met betrekking tot de vastlegging van de institutionele structuur van samenwerking: 1. Een vastgelegde institutionele structuur geeft duidelijkheid aan de be trokken partijen Het vastleggen van de instituties van de samenwerking in de vorm van convenanten, overeenkomsten of formele regels zorgt in de cases voor structuur en duidelijkheid bij de betrokken partijen en daarmee voor een betere samenwerking. In de gevallen waar geen invulling is gegeven aan een vastgelegde institutionele structuur zoals in de case van Alphen aan den Rijn, of waar onvoldoende invulling is gegeven aan de vastgelegde structuur, zoals bij de Integrale Leidingen Tunnel Amsterdam, is er onzekerheid bij de partijen wat negatief terugkomt in de samenwerking. 2. Door de vorm van de vastgelegde institutionele structuur in de loop van de tijd aan te passen blijft deze aansluiten bij de fase waarin de samenwerking zich bevindt In de case van Tilburg is de samenwerking nog jong en nog niet volledig uitgekristalliseerd. Er is gekozen voor een convenant met procesafspraken, doelstellingen en intenties voor verdere samenwerking. In deze fase is de samenwerking nog dynamisch van structuur en in deze fase zou vastlegging in een formele regel niet de gewenste uitkomst hebben. De cases laten zien dat als de samenwerking nog niet uitgekristalliseerd is, zoals in Tilburg en vroeger in Amsterdam, er vaak gekozen wordt voor een convenant. Het convenant is dan een opstap naar verder uit te werken afspraken. Toen na verloop van tijd de samenwerking een steeds vastere vorm kreeg bij het Coo?rdinatiestelsel in Amsterdam is overgegaan tot het opstellen van een formele regel. Formele regels hebben namelijk de orie?ntatie meer op de inhoud en geven het bevoegd gezag de mogelijkheid deze eenzijdig uit te dragen. De case van het Coo?rdinatiestelsel van Amsterdam laat zien dat door de structuur van de vastlegging aan te passen aan de fase van de samenwerking men verder komt in het minimaliseren van de overlast. Dit door het aanpassen naar een formele regel nu alle partijen verplicht deelnemen aan het stelsel. Een mooi aspect uit de case van het stelsel in Amsterdam is dat ondanks het feit dat de formele regels eenzijdig vanuit het bevoegde gezag worden opgelegd, ze breed zijn ondersteund doordat ze vooraf zijn besproken door de betrokken partijen. Als men te maken heeft met een groep netbeheerders met ieder afzonderlijke belangen blijft een stuurgroep of een ander inspraakorgaan cruciaal om draagvlak in de samenwerking te garanderen. Op basis van de theorie en het empirisch onderzoek blijkt dat voor samenwerking tussen netbeheerders en gemeenten naast een vastgelegde technische uitvoering ook een vastgelegde institutionele structuur nodig is. In een mogelijke samenwerking moeten gemeenten en netbeheerders niet alleen kijken naar de technische uitvoering, maar moeten zij ook aandacht geven aan de vastlegging van de institutionele structuur van de samenwerking. Het vastleggen van de institutionele structuur en het aan laten sluiten van deze structuur aan de fase waarin de samenwerking zich bevindt zijn essentie?le factoren voor de samenwerking bij het minimaliseren van de overlast bij aanleg, onderhoud en vervanging van kleine ondergrondse infrastructuren. Ondanks het feit dat de gebruikte proces-, netwerk-en institutionele theoriee?n niet nieuw zijn, laat dit onderzoek zien dat er toch niet altijd door alle gemeenten naar is gehandeld. Gemeenten en netbeheerders zijn niet altijd doordrongen van de noodzaak om bij het proces andere partijen te betrekken en om via een procesbenadering naar een oplossing te werken.","samenwerking; netbeheerders; openbare ruimte","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2014","To compete more successfully with other sources of energy, a decrease in the costs of offshore wind energy needs to be achieved. Operation and maintenance costs represent a large share of these costs. In order to reduce these costs new developments and strategies are considered for operation and maintenance of wind turbine components. Condition monitoring systems (CMSs) could be a vital tool to decrease these costs, especially for expensive components such as a gearbox. This thesis focusses on the gearbox as it is the component, with one of the highest downtime per failure and failure costs. A literature study reveals that the replacement of a gearbox offshore might lead to months of downtime and costs might sum up to one million euro for a 6 MW wind turbine. In order to prevent such high costs, CMSs are assessed in this thesis. CMSs comprise of sensors providing data, which reflects the health status of the component. This data is subsequently analysed by a data-mining technique, capable of detecting trends and anomalies to predict upcoming failures. If the system is sufficiently accurate, a large failure can be prevented, which leads to significant savings in the lifetime gearbox maintenance costs A cost-benefit study is performed to determine the required performance of a CMS in order to be profitably implemented in an offshore wind turbine. The CMS performance is described by two parameters: one reflecting the ability of the system to prevent large gearbox failures, and a second parameter describing its ability to prevent waiting downtime, caused by weather window waiting time, spare part logistics and vessel mobilisation. Based on Monte Carlo simulations, the gearbox maintenance costs are quantified over the wind turbine lifetime. Subsequently a sensitivity analysis is performed. Results show that differences in gearbox failure rate and wind farm distance significantly affect the maintenance costs. Hence to break-even different performance requirements of the CMS are necessary. The model reveals that a system, capable of preventing large failures and/or preventing waiting downtime, can reduce the lifetime maintenance costs to a great extent. The actual performance of a CMS, needed to break-even, can be considered low, as the condition monitoring costs are in no proportion to the total gearbox maintenance costs and thus the potential revenue of the CMS.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor)","2014","In the last 60 years many new technologies have entered the aerospace industry, but the overall aircraft design remained virtually unchanged. If we compare an aircraft built in the 1960's with the latest generation, they look strikingly similar. Only small evolutionary changes entered the commercial aircraft market. A lot of these changes are driven by the ever-lasting quest to reduce the amount of burned fuel. However, the reduction in fuel usage which can be gained with these small evolutionary changes decreases every aircraft generation. A revolutionary change in the aircraft design is needed to make step-change in aircraft fuel efficiency. Changing the configuration of the aircraft could create opportunities for aerodynamic and structural improvements, which will result in higher fuel efficiency. Current tools used in the field of aircraft design use a lot of empirical data obtained from the analysis of existing aircraft. These tools are not capable of correctly analysing unconventional aircraft configurations. A design tool, called the Initiator, is created which is able to synthesise a conceptual aircraft design based on a given set of top level requirements for a wide range of aircraft configurations including conventional aircraft, canard aircraft, Prandtl-planes and Blended-Wing-Body aircraft. The Initiator is verified by comparing the output of the Initiator with existing aircraft. A selection of thirteen reference aircraft varying from small regional jets to wide-body long-range jet-powered aircraft is made to verify the tool. Top level requirements are defined which match the payload, harmonic range and runway performance specifications of the reference aircraft. The aircraft generated from these top level requirements are compared to the existing aircraft. The design process is proven to work, since it converges to a feasible aircraft design which complies with the top level requirements. By comparing the maximum take-off weights and operational empty weights, it can be shown that the generated aircraft are similar to the reference aircraft. Nine out of the thirteen generated aircraft are estimated to within 10% of the reference aircraft weights. Visual inspection and comparison of external aircraft dimensions show that the implemented design rules are capable of generating an aircraft which is similar to the reference aircraft. The design tool was used to compare the different aircraft configurations. The design process works for conventional, canard, three-surface and Prandtl aircraft. Testing the design process for the Blended-Wing-Body was unfortunately not possible with the current state of the sizing methods. The canard aircraft design results in a 12% reduction in fuel mass and a 28% reduction in operational empty mass in comparison with a conventional aircraft designed for the same payload and harmonic range. However, since none of the analysis methods have been validated the confidence in the results gained from the configuration comparison in low. It can be concluded that the design tool can be used to synthesise and compare a wide range of different aircraft configurations.","aircraft design; conceptual design; mdo; kbe; initiator; design and engineering engine; novel aircraft","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-01-29","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Design, Integration & Operations","","Aerospace Structures and Design Methodologies","",""

(mentor); Everts, H.J. (mentor); Holscher, P. (mentor); Van Koten, H. (mentor); Vijlbrief, M. (mentor)","2014","The static bearing capacity of most driven piles in The Netherlands is derived using a preinstallation method based on soil parameters. As a result of recent research the reliability of this method decreases; As a result different calculations might become attractive. A method widely used abroad is a Dynamic Load Test(DLT) to calculate the dynamic resistance during driving, and to convert this to static resistance. Literature study reveals little research is available concerning the conversion from dynamic resistance during driving to final static bearing resistance. In this research the COLOMET (COntactLess Optical MEasurement Technique) is investigated to determine the dynamic resistance during driving based on displacement during driving. In order to measure the displacement a laser is suspended on a beam and measures the displacement of a angular profile attached to the pile. Due to the length of the beam and the application of an accelerometer the disturbance of the sensor can be eliminated. The measurement technique is proven to be successful, however the attachment of the angular profile to the pile requires improvement. A Linear Elastic Perfectly Plastic(LEPP) soil model is used; All force exceeding the ultimate soil resistance Fy will result in plastic deformation. Since no more soil resistance is present after exceeding Fy a ’free rod’ model can be used. Force can be converted to velocity when dividing by the impedance Z, a material constant.If the velocity corresponding with the ultimate soil resistance, vy, is subtracted from the total velocity and integrated over the time plastic deformation occurs this will result in half of plastic displacement. With only Fy as unknown this value can iteratively be changed until the calculated plastic displacement converges with the measured plastic displacement. A validation is performed with another ’established’ method, the DLT. However due to physical differences encountered during driving in combination with the different calculation methods it is concluded the performed measurements are not suitable for comparison. The assumed LEPP model is also a simplification of reality and should be investigated when the method is applied. The time-intervals for integration are dependent of the value of vy and are not 1D-wave-equation related. The COLOMET applies a combined resistance at the toe. This only is valid if no shaft resistance is present since superposition of shaft resistance is not possible. Further research is advised concerning the possible separation of toe and shaft resistance. In order to do this experiments are advised with multiple strain-gauges. A FEM model should be constructed to verify the model, this however requires a physical test to be validated. The assumed force equilibrium at the toe and the corresponding ’free rod’ model requires further investigation since the validity of this assumption is insufficiently proven.","soil dynamics; driven piles; bearing capacity prediction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-engineering","",""

However, these statistical methods often result in many spuriously identified relations, which confound the discovery of genomic markers in follow-up experiments. We propose to reduce the amount of spuriously identified relations by using Multi-task Learning, a machine learning technique that identifies relations between DNA and drug response simultaneously for multiple drugs. We show that using Multi-task Learning, the number of identified relations between DNA and drug response can be strongly reduced, while retaining similar prediction performance.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Mediamatics","","Bioinformatics","",""

Uit een uitgebreide literatuurstudie is gebleken dat er tot op heden weinig bekend is over de inzet van zulke doserende VRI’s. De initiatieven die er zijn geweest waren er meer uit noodzaak dan dat werkelijk in detail is onderzocht hoe de werking van een dergelijk verkeerssysteem zo goed mogelijk kan functioneren en wat de meerwaarde is ten opzichte van reguliere toeritdosering. Het ontwikkelde dummy-TDI-algoritme in dit onderzoek maakt gebruik van het AD-ALINEA-doseeralgoritme. Iedere regelstap bepaald het AD-ALINEA-algoritme de gewenste doseerintensiteit. Deze doseerintensiteit wordt vervolgens door het dummy-TDI-algoritme door meerdere rijrichtingen bij een VRI gerealiseerd. Hiervoor wordt met het dummy-TDI-algoritme iedere regelstap bepaald hoeveel verkeer in de beschikbare buffers moet worden opgeslagen om aan de gevraagde doseerintensiteit te kunnen voldoen. De verdeling van dit bufferverkeer gaat op basis van het uniform vullen van de beschikbare buffers. Door het uitvoeren van meerdere effectevaluaties in een simulatiemodel in VISSIM is de te behalen effectiviteit van een dummy-TDI in beeld gebracht. Zowel lokaal geregelde als gecoördineerde dummy-TDI’s zijn hierbij vergeleken met een nulvariant (waarbij niet gedoseerd wordt) en een reguliere TDI. Daarnaast is een gevoeligheidsanalyse uitgevoerd naar de invloed die de ingestelde streefwaarde dichtheid in het AD-ALINEA-algoritme heeft op de prestatie van de dummy-TDI. Hierbij zijn drie waardes voor de schalingsparamater ? (die de adaptief bijgestelde kritische dichtheid naar de streefwaarde dichtheid omzet) gesimuleerd, te weten: 0,9, 0,8 en 0,7. Het kiezen van een streefwaarde dichtheid die 20% lager werd gekozen dan de kritische dichtheid (? = 0,8), bleek te resulteren in een verbeterde prestatie ten opzichte van de overige waardes. Het onderzoek heeft aangetoond dat het met een dummy-TDI mogelijk is om een capaciteitsval op een snelweg uit te stellen – en in sommige gevallen zelfs helemaal te voorkomen – waardoor de netwerkprestatie in totale doorgebrachte tijd (TTS) ten opzichte van een situatie waarin niet wordt gedoseerd verbeterd met 11,7%. Echter, de te behalen effectiviteit van een dummy-TDI is minder dan van een reguliere TDI: 10,8% bij lokaal regelen en 11,7% bij gecoördineerde inzet. Het is gebleken dat de opbouw van de wachtrijen als gevolg van het doseren met meerdere rijrichtingen de nodige aandacht verdient. De beschikbare bufferruimtes stromen bij een dummy-TDI namelijk veel sneller vol dan bij reguliere toeritdosering. De inschakeling van wachtrijmanagement (om te voorkomen dat de gecreëerde wachtrij terugslaat naar het onderliggend wegennet en daar blokkades veroorzaakt) beïnvloedt in dit geval de werking van een dummy-TDI enorm. Bij het wachtrijmanagement in dit onderzoek wordt ervoor gezorgd dat de wachtrij vermindert door het instellen van een maximale groentijd op de doseerrichting. De resulterende toestroom van voertuigpelotons zorgt ervoor dat de kans op congestie fors toeneemt. Geconcludeerd kan worden dat de implementatie van doserende VRI’s voordelen kan bieden bij het verbeteren van de doorstroming in een verkeersnetwerk, maar dat niet dezelfde effectiviteit verwacht moet worden in vergelijking met reguliere toeritdosering. Wanneer de beschikbare opstelruimte op een toerit te klein is voor een goed functionerende TDI, zou de inzet van doserende VRI’s uitkomst kunnen bieden om alsnog de doorstroming in een verkeersnetwerk te bevorderen.","toeritdosering; verkeerslichten; dummy-TDI; TDI; AD-ALINEA; coördinatie; effectevaluatie","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","Transport and Planning","",""

It is characterized by the short distance between the mountains in the west and the coast of the South China Sea in the east. Two large rivers flow through the province, fed by multiple smaller rivers from the mountains. The Bo River flows through the northern part of the province and ends up in the Cau Hai lagoon. The Huong River is the largest of the two and flows through Hue city ending in the Cau Hai lagoon. The coastal zone of the Thua Thien-Hue province knows a lot of water related problems, like salt intrusion and drought in the dry season and both pluvial and alluvial flooding in the rainy season. Tackling these problems requires an integrated approach that considers all problems, functions and stakeholders. This project will aim to apply a Framework for Integrated Water Management to the Thua Thien-Hue province to minimize the water related problems in the future. This framework assigns different return periods for flooding per area. An area with a high population density will suffer more damage during a flood than a rice paddy, and should have a smaller chance of flooding in order to make the water defence system economically justifiable. This way, a map is created that indicates the desired chance on flooding throughout the coastal, flood prone area of the Thua Thien-Hue province. Using a SOBEK 2D model, the flooding can be simulated. The results from this model show that the amount of water that enters the area is too large to apply traditional protection by raising dikes. Also, most houses are built near the riverbanks, making the implementation of dikes problematic. Two possible solutions were considered. The first, consisting of two bypasses, showed unrealistic as the capacity of the second bypass was insufficient. The second scenario, called “Lake Hue”, uses a reservoir as a retention area during extreme events. A dam regulates the discharge towards Hue City while a spillway towards an area with a lower population density takes care of excess water. An initial cost benefit analysis, using the results from the SOBEK model, indicates a payback time of fifteen years. After the design lifetime of 50 years, the initial investment is returned twofold.","Vietnam; Hue; flood; river flood; SOBEK; watermanagement; Thua Thien-Hue; flood protection; Huong River; Central Vietnam","en","student report","TU Delft, department of Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2014","A feasibility study on the development of a prototype tool to determine the required amount of viscoelastic damping in a high rise structure to reduce accelerations from wind-induced vibrations Introduction The research regarding damping in high rise structures from wind-induced vibrations has been split up into two investigations: 1. Investigation on viscoelastic damping (VED) 2. Investigation on modeling a N mass spring damper (N-MSD) system as a basis for the prototype tool Literature showed that VEDs are most effective in shear and even though a VED is often referred to as non-linear, the material behaves linear for small values of the damping ratio. This region has been studied in the investigation on VED. Physical test set-up In literature, no information is available on the relation of VEDs to the load bearing structure in buildings. Therefore, a physical test set-up was built to study the relation. The physical test set-up was constructed as a braced portal frame structure with a slenderness of about 6. Layers of SBR (natural rubber) were applied to the bracing to simulate dampers in a structure. Multiple dampers have been tested with a variety in thickness. This was based on the expectation that the thickness of the layers would have an optimum value with regards to the shear stiffness. The half-power bandwidth method was used to determine the damping ratio of the structure with and without damping in the frequency domain. To verify the obtained values, the damping ratio has also been determined from the time signal through the logarithmic decrement. Both methods showed the same results. N-MSD In this research, a model has been presented for the core structure with structural damping by means of an N-MSD system. The model has been validated in two ways. The stiffness matrix was validated by finding the static behavior of the structure and the eigenmodes from the structure. Additionally, the peak values for the accelerations come close to the maximum allowed values mentioned in NEN-EN 1990+A1+A1/C2-2011. Also, a mathematical expression for a braced portal frame structure including an auxiliary damping component has been presented. In this case, all elements in the portal frame structure are described by a continuous system. Additionally, a model for the bracing with and without a damping component is to be used. Conclusions The following damping factors were observed within the damping component: 1. Damping by friction 2. Material damping 3. Damping by adhesive layer (glue) If a higher damping coefficient is required to reduce accelerations, each of these factors may be changed. However, the exact energy dissipation by each individual factor in the damping component and in the connections remains still unknown. The only certainty is that the system as a whole dissipates energy from the structural system and reduces the accelerations. The measurements were also influenced by many factors, such as disturbances from higher frequencies and executional factors. The description of the core structure model and of the portal frame structure prove that it is indeed feasible to develop a prototype tool to determine the required amount of VED. However, in case a prototype tool is to be developed, input of experimental data of the damping coefficient of the VEM layer is required.","structural dynamics; viscoelastic damping; high rise; buildings; wind","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural and Building Engineering","",""
