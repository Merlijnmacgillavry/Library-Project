Een groei naar 80 miljoen reizigers binnen de bestaande terminals is voor Schiphol zeer wenselijk. Mijn oplossing voor deze opgave richtte zich met name op het onderscheiden van stromen mensen en, waar mogelijk, het combineren van stromen. Daarnaast moest de bestaande terminal aangepast worden om de stromen te huisvesten. Met name het combineren van stromen bleek een oplossing te bieden voor de groei-problematiek binnen de bestaande terminal. Het Schengen verdrag lag aan de basis van de oplossing. Schiphol kent 5 stromen: Vertrek Schengen, Vertrek Niet-Schengen, Aankomst Schengen, Aankomst Niet-Schengen, Publiek. Binnen de AirportCity wordt de publieke stroom van steeds groter belang. Voor publiek biedt de AirportCity een dagje uit, wat voor de luchthaven een belangrijke bron van inkomsten vormt. Nu kent terminal 1/2 een Verticale Schengen / Niet-Schengen-scheiding. Technisch gezien is in Nederland de publieke stroom ook Schengen. Mijn voorstel was om de publieke- en Schengenstromen te combineren, en een horizontale Schengen/Niet-Schengen scheiding in de terminal aan te brengen. Hierdoor kan de eerste verdieping (vertrek) ook voor publiek toegankelijk worden gemaakt, wat in wezen een uitbreiding van Schiphol Plaza betekent. Hiermee was gelijk de belangrijkste architectonische opgave gedefinieerd: hoe kan Schiphol Plaza over twee verdiepingen functioneren, en hoe is het verloop van de verschillende stromen binnen de terminal zo soepel mogelijk. Een nieuw as, in het verlengde van de D-pier, centraal gelegen in de terminal vormt de nieuwe verbinding tussen de verschillende verdiepingen. Overzicht, licht en het technische uiterlijk van de ingreep dragen bij aan het karakter van de luchthaven, de AirportCity.","Restauratie; Renovatie; Schiphol; Amsterdam; Luchthaven; AirportCity; Schengen","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","","","","",""

In the coastal zone the effects of over-population, pollution and changes in climate are becoming ever clearer. This requires a suitable policy to tackle the increasing number of problems and provide the coast with the necessary infrastructure for development. These works call for large sums of money, which the developing countries often do not have at their disposal. An alternative approach is necessary to increase the financial means available for coastal infrastructure and policy. Project financing is a suitable way of arranging financing between multiple financiers when the project generates revenues. For project finance a separate company is founded which manages the projects finances. The most important roles for financiers in project financing are lender and sponsor. They invest in the project based on future cash flows with the projects assets as collateral. This type of financing is non-recourse, stating that no recourse from sponsors or government is possible at default. This increases the risks for participants and also the arrangements costs. The available international financing sources are divided in three categories: Bilateral institutes, multilateral organisations and private investors. The criteria found to be of most importance for the financing decision of the party are development goal realisation and economic feasibility for multilateral and (often with addition of off-take obligation) bilateral institutes. Private financiers determine their investment decision mostly on a return on investment as high as possible compared to the risk of financing, together called the commercial attractiveness. Other criteria researched are: financial feasibility; inter party agreement; environmental sustainability and country risk. Taking two examples, the actual arrangements in financing is examined as well as the working of the cash flow model to execute project feasibility studies. For the Cartagena Tidal inlet project in Colombia is found that the FMO grants mostly because of development goals and Dutch export incentive. Environmental protection is also and important issue. For the Maputo Port concession in Mozambique the estimated returns for sponsors are high enough to explain their interest in the project without even considering secondary benefits. The lenders have a much lower rate of return on this project, especially compared to the estimated risk adjusted required return. This poses some questions about the risk modelling. It can be concluded that the involvement of development institutes can bring down perceived risks and thereby limit the cost of financing. Regarding the policies of financiers and the examples examined, the criteria and how their fulfilment is assessed by financiers, provides a handhold for developing country's policies. Addressing the criteria of development finance institutes is best done by striving for development goals fulfilment and economic development. Environmental aspects are also very important, while the eligibility for development financing is of hardly any influence for the government. Private financiers can best be attracted by limiting risks through government involvement in the financing or development finance participation and by improving profitability for financiers by tax incentives or subsidies. Contractors have the option to advice on financing, arrange financing with other parties or participate in financing. Lately, the latter option is demanded more often requiring the contractors to invest in a project as sponsor. This investment should be compared to the additional benefits of goodwill and surety of work. The financial risks need to be assessed properly and a partnership with a financial party would be beneficial. Optimally, if demands for participations keep growing, a standard financial partnership for multiple projects could be beneficial. In South Africa development assistance is hardly given anymore because of the average welfare. Some funds are available for small local initiatives or particular environmental issues, other than infrastructure. Within the scope of this research, private financing would have to be addressed if foreign financing is required. South Africa has understood this and promoted foreign investment by tax relief programmes, and investments assistance. What could still be improved is the allocation of needed projects to prosperous development opportunities. Especially tourism and transport seem attractive developments to co-finance coastal infrastructure. In general the advice to developing countries is: 1.To aim at grants for financing first, second soft loans, third commercial loans and fourth commercial investments, because of the costs of capital. Secondary benefits like import of knowledge and efficiency can make the fourth option more attractive. 2.Developing countries' governments can best attract bilateral foreign finance by creating political relations and address development goals. 3.Developing countries can best attract multilateral finance by aiming at development goals like spread of welfare and economic development. 4.Developing countries can best attract commercial financiers by limiting the perceived risk by financiers and provide tax incentives for higher returns. 5.Also demanding sponsorship from contractors or operators or an export credit is a possibility. 6.Even though a country may not be entitled to receive development assistance, the involvement of a development financing institution is helpful in reducing perceived risks by investors.","investment; project financing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Winterwerp, J.C. (mentor); Wang, Z.B. (mentor)","2004","The aim of this study is to improve the knowledge of the influence of three key processes on the net up-estuary transport of fine grained sediment in the Humber estuary. The key processes that will be focused on are: Tidal asymmetry Gravitational circulation Channel - Shoal interaction After the calibration of the hydrodynamic model Delft3D-Flow and the set-up of the initial sedimentation and erosion model Delft3D-Delwaq, the key processes are studied in the form of a sensitivity analysis. Non-linear interactions of tidal components are of paramount importance to the sediment transport, since they can give rise to a net, tide averaged, sediment flux. The tidal asymmetry depends on the sea-boundary conditions and the local generation of higher components. Depending on the bed status, an asymmetry in slack water periods or in combination with an asymmetry in peak velocity magnitude is of importance to net up-estuary sediment transport. Peak velocity asymmetry is flood-dominant throughout the estuary and increases in magnitude up-estuary. Slack water period asymmetry due to tidal components M2 and M4 shows a different result than analysis of low velocity magnitude. Thus it can be concluded that analysis of only components M2 and M4 is not sufficient to describe slack water period asymmetry in the Humber estuary. Slack water period analysis of low velocity magnitude reproduces a flood dominant asymmetry in the outer estuary and in the inner estuary. Tidal asymmetry in the inner estuary is primarily locally generated and therefore less sensitive to small changes in the M4 sea-boundary condition. Horizontal density gradients can generate a vertical circulation in the system resulting in a net up-estuary sediment transport. Three factors can cause this gravitational circulation: salinity differences, temperature differences and differences in concentration of solid matter. During this sensitivity study the effect of gravitational circulation on net up-estuary fine sediment transport is limited to density gradients due to salinity. Integrating of the gross discharges and transport gives the net distribution of discharge and fine sediment transport. From this analysis follows that in longitudinal direction gravitational circulation results in a small increase in net up-estuary fine sediment transport. In the Humber estuary-channel, and especially -mouth, large longitudinal gross ebb (export) and flood (import) transports of fine sediments occur. If part of the sediments entering the system during flood is deposited in intertidal areas, a net import of fine sediments is the possible result. In the intertidal areas, bedshear stresses play an important role in the overall sediment import. The sensitivity of net up-estuary transport on channel-shoal interaction is analyzed by a change in bed roughness in the SE-processes. The main conclusion from this analysis is that, as bed roughness increases, a lower amount of fine sediments is net imported. Whereas, -with the exception of the areas Skeffling clays and Easington clays- the net transport in transversal direction increases for the rough bed-simulation. This process can be explained by a lower deposition in the deeper parts of the estuary, resulting in a higher amount of material that reaches the intertidal areas. Besides the three key processes that are focused on, several other processes can be of importance. The literature survey shows the high variability in conditions due to biological, chemical and seasonal processes. Knowledge of the influence of this variability on net fine sediment import and distribution can be improved by additional work that needs to be done.","","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

Witteveen+Bos are engineering these structures and need for this reason more insight in the wave boundary conditions at the locations Kashagan East (KE) and Kashagan West (KW). These wave boundary conditions are very specific since the North Caspian Sea has a small water depth that extends over a large area. The purpose of this study is to obtain more insight in wave spectra and wave height distributions at KE and KW during extreme conditions. Special interest goes to the wave parameters that are needed for input in the presently used design formula for rubble mound breakwaters. A SWAN model for the Caspian Sea has been developed to simulate wave fields under extreme conditions. The performance of the model is shown in the figures below. Remarkable is that the simulated mean wave period in SWAN seems to approximate the measured mean wave period for more extreme conditions. The SWAN model has been used to simulate wave fields for the 96 most extreme wind events in the period 1948 to 2000. Since water level fluctuations are significant in the North Caspian Sea the events were simulated for 5 different still water levels. The simulation results showed a depth-dependent wave height limit. It has been possible to define wave fields for return periods larger than 30 years as function of the water depth only. The most used parameters in design formula have been given as function of the still-water level. Furthermore design spectra have been produced for five different water levels. The shape of these spectra is between a JONSWAP spectrum and a TMA spectrum and varies with the water depth. A comparison of the found conditions with simulated design parameters from fetch-based wave growth models showed good similarity.","","nl","master thesis","TU Delft, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

De gemeente Delft is daarom een politieke lobby gestart om het viaduct te vervangen door een spoortunnel. Daarbij zal de ruimte boven de tunnel opnieuw ingericht worden. In de plannen van de gemeente is er op de tunnel bebouwing geplaatst. Het doel van het onderzoek is te bepalen of de bebouwing op de tunnel beperkt wordt door het risico van explosies in de tunnel of andersom. Een complicerende factor bij het ontwerp en gebruik van de tunnel is dat het tracoor Delft gebruikt wordt voor het vervoer van gevaarlijke stoffen. Indien de gevaarlijke stof vrijkomt, bestaat er het gevaar van een explosie. Dit kunnen gaswolkexplosies of BLEVEs zijn. In mijn afstudeeronderzoek heb ik in eerste instantie bepaald wat de kans op een explosie is. Vervolgens is bepaald wat de maximale explosiebelasting is die de tunnel op kan nemen. Hierbij is gebruik gemaakt van het ontwerp van de tunnel zoals dat door de betrokken partijen nu is opgesteld. In een volgende stap zijn de gevolgen voor de bebouwing op, naast en over de tunnel bepaald. Deze gevolgen zijn getoetst aan de externe risiconormen en uit de beschouwing blijkt, dat de tunnel met geplande bebouwing erop voldoet aan de externe veiligheidsnormen.

Accelerated sea-level rise due to climate change combined with human interference which may cause land subsidence can have significant impact on the Wadden Sea system. A major question of concern is how vulnerable the Wadden Sea system is to the relative sea-level rise. The present study focuses at the apparent deviant behaviour of the Lister Tief tidal basin compared to Dutch tidal basins in the Wadden Sea. All the tidal basins in the Dutch Wadden Sea appear to import sediment such that the deposition in the basins tend to cope with the low sea-level rise rate of about 20 cm/century at present. The Lister Tief, a tidal basin located between Germany and Denmark, appears to be eroding sediment despite the sea-level rise. Long-term modelling, needed for large scale systems like the Wadden Sea, can be done by the model ASMITA. It is a semi-empirical model which appears to be a powerful tool for simulating the long-term morphological development under influence of sea-level rise. In this study the Lister Tief basin is compared with the tidal basins in the Dutch Wadden Sea concerning aspects including the hypsometry and tidal asymmetry. Moreover, results of application of the ASMITA model are compared with the development of parameters representing hypsometry and tidal asymmetry under relative sea-level rise. The hypothesis was that the hypsometry of the Lister Tief could be the reason for the deviant behaviour of the Lister Tief tidal basin. From the analysis carried out in this study it appears that the Lister Tief tidal basin is not behaving differently than Dutch tidal basins under relative sea-level rise. The basin hypsometry does have a significant influence on the tidal asymmetry, but results from the analysis do not explain the loss of sediment in the Lister Tief tidal basin. From an analysis and the application of the ASMITA model it becomes clear that the model agrees with the development of parameters representing the basin hypsometry.","morphodynamics; tidal basin; Lister Tief; asmita; sediment","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

Om aan deze functie te kunnen voldoen dienen de zandlichamen over voldoende draagkracht te beschikken, wat bij een hogere dichtheid van het zandpakket wordt verhoogd. Om een vergrootte dichtheid van onder water liggende zandlichamen te bereiken, wordt in de praktijk veelal gebruik gemaakt van de verdichtingstechniek vibroflotation. Hierbij wordt een naald op diepte gebracht om horizontale trillingen in het zandpakket te brengen, waardoor lokaal de zandkorrels hergroeperen en poriater afstroomt. De praktijk leert dat er nog geen goede relatie bestaat tussen de hoeveelheid ingebrachte energie en de bereikte (gewenste) verdichtingsgraad. Met behulp van een rekenmodel zijn de benodigde trilduur en de grootte van het verdichtingsgebied om tot een zekere verdichtingsgraad te komen bepaald. Hierbij is het mogelijk om zandparameters en configuraties van de trilnaald te varin.","","nl","master thesis","TU Delft, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor); Verheijen, P.J.T. (mentor)","2004","Nowadays, refineries face a double challenge: increasing hydrogen consumption for deeper hydrotreating, together with stricter environmental legislation on the sulfur content of fuels, which further increases refinery hydrogen demand. Therefore,hydrogen system is bottlenecked and hence hydrogen management has become a priority issue in current refinery operations. Pinch Analysis is a powerful tool for targeting minimum hydrogen utility in refinery hydrogen network and establishing improvement directions. The concept of hydrogen surplus is not only used to identify the bottlenecks in the hydrogen distribution system, but also provides valuable theoretical insights into the impact of hydrogen purification on the performance of a hydrogen distribution network. In this thesis, hydrogen pinch methodology has been successfully applied to a refinery hydrogen distribution network. Both low cost and capital investment solutions have been developed to improve the hydrogen network efficiency. Moreover, the low cost solutions delivered significant potential benefit to site and will be implemented in September 2004. In addition to the pinch analysis for deciding improvement solutions, hydrogen management requires further tools for system representation. A shortcut method has been successfully applied and a deterministic steady-state lumped model has been developed for simulating the behaviors of hydrogen distribution system and predicting the impact of network modifications on the individual network elements, as well as the network constraints. Besides delivering improvements to the site, the hydrogen system requires support for sustaining performance. Sensitivity analysis and pinch based solutions (operating strategies) have been developed for sustaining performance of hydrogen distribution network. Finally, A systematic approach has been developed for hydrogen management studies,based on experiences with a case study.","","en","master thesis","Delft University of Technology, Department of Chemical Technology, Process System Engineering","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Chemical Technology","","","",""
