This is said because both oil and data can be very valuable but only after they have been pre-processed. Among other things, a challenge for creating value from data lies in realizing data exchange. This is what data marketplaces aim to do. The number of shutdowns of data marketplaces during the past years implies that their business models are not viable and that there are obstacles that should be overcome to create a data marketplace that is robust in the long run. In this research, we explore a new research context: the relationships between business models of data marketplaces and data marketplace obstacles. To do this, by the means of explorative theorizing, we first provide an overview of the obstacle categories for data marketplaces: trust, lack of governance mechanisms, privacy and control, product quality and product description, matching data providers and data buyers, data pricing mechanism, and ‘other’ that do not fall within a specific category. We then followed a multiple-case studying approach in which we subject three different real-life data marketplaces to a Business Model (BM) Stress Test on the identified obstacles. The cases were selected by theoretical sampling of the types of data marketplaces: personal data marketplaces, Internet-Of-Things (IoT) data marketplaces, and Business-to-Business (B2B) data marketplaces. By reflecting upon the results, we conclude that the assessment of the true viability of a data marketplace business model goes way beyond just the relationships between business model choices and obstacles. It is concerned with the business model strategy and dynamic capabilities of a data marketplace. We add to the literature by presenting a first explanatory model on the relationships between data marketplace business models and data marketplace obstacles. This model leads us to the practical implications of our results. These include the considerations that a data marketplace owner can take into account when making business model choices. Based on the results, we are also able to give recommendations that go beyond certain business model choices.","Data Marketplaces; Business Model Stress Test; Business Models; Multiple case study; Obstacles; Explanatory Model; Explorative study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

However, existing GLOSA systems only work in combination with a limited selection of Traffic Signal Controllers (TSCs) and therefore have not been widely implemented. This research describes and evaluates the design of a system to model the behaviour of the most common types of TSCs using data that is shared by road users, also known as Floating Car Data (FCD). Almost every road user is able to share his location using a smartphone, so this means that a system of this kind can be implemented everywhere in the world where people are willing to participate, without requiring any changes to the infrastructure. It is chosen to model TSC behaviour using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), because they can be generated from unlabelled data, as opposed to other machine learning techniques. More specifically, Explicit Duration Hidden semi-Markov Models (EDHSMMs) are used, so that timing behaviour can be captured more accurately than with standard HMMS. An adaptation to an existing learning algorithm is made to decrease amount of data required for learning and to make sure the algorithm can cope with the sparse nature of FCD. Additionally, a system is developed to combine generally known intersection data and FCD to generate models that have transition parameters with low entropy and thus high predictive powers. In this way, the system produces models that are accurate enough to be used for the generation of GLOSA from relatively sparse data.<br/>In a simulated setting, it is shown that the system can identify the true switching behaviour of the most common types of TSCs and that it produces models whose duration probability distributions converge to the true situation when provided with realistic amounts of data. <br","GLOSA; hidden Markov model; Hidden Semi Markov Model; Traffic signals; Floating Car Data","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Offline reinforcement learning, or learning from a fixed data set, is an attractive alternative to online reinforcement learning. Offline reinforcement learning promises to address the cost and safety implications of taking numerous random or bad actions online, which is a crucial aspect of traditional reinforcement learning that makes it difficult to apply in real-world problems. However, when offline reinforcement learning is naïvely applied to a fixed data set, the resulting policy may exhibit poor performance in the real environment. This happens due to over-estimations of the expected return for state-action pairs not sufficiently covered in the data set. Therefore, offline reinforcement learning agents must know what they do not know, allowing them to avoid these over-estimated state-action pairs and their potentially erroneous outcomes. A promising way to instill offline reinforcement learning agents with this ability is the pessimism principle, which states that agents should select actions that maximize an uncertainty-based lower bound of the expected return. This pessimism principle has drastically improved the performance of offline reinforcement learning methods in the tabular and linear function approximation domain. However, in deep reinforcement learning, uncertainty estimation is highly non-trivial, and the development of effective uncertainty-based pessimistic algorithms remains an open question. That is why in this thesis, we explore various existing deep learning-based uncertainty estimation techniques with the aim to combine them with existing deep reinforcement learning methods to create an uncertainty-aware offline deep reinforcement learning algorithm. This research has resulted in two novel offline deep reinforcement learning methods built on Double Deep Q-Learning and Soft Actor-Critic. We applied these methods to various benchmarks and experiments to demonstrate their interesting and unique properties. In some situations, they even beat the current state-of-the-art results of these benchmarks.","Deep Reinforcement Learning; Offline Reinforcement Learning; Uncertainty Estimation; Reinforcement Learning; Deep Uncertainty Estimation; batch reinforcement learning; ensemble; pessimism; uncertainty","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://github.com/j0rd1smit/PEBL An open source version of the code used in the thesis.","","","","","","Computer Science | Data Science and Technology","",""

(mentor); Jarquin Laguna, A. (graduation committee); van der Male, P. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","For marine structures subjected to combined wind and wave loads, predicting the long-term extreme response corresponding to a certain return period is an important aspect during the design stage. Generally, a full long-term analysis (FLTA) is recognized as a highly accurate method to determine the long-term extreme responses. FLTA integrates all the short-term extreme responses with their corresponding occurrence probability of environmental conditions. Therefore, this approach is very time-consuming and inefficient, especially for complex marine structures. Therefore, the environmental contour method (ECM) is proposed as a more efficient alternative method for predicting the long-term extreme response of offshore structures. The traditional environmental contour is obtained using the joint distribution of mean wind speed, significant wave height, and spectral peak period. This method has been used extensively on marine structures subjected to wave loads with reasonable numerical accuracy. It decouples the response with the environmental variables and uses the largest most probable short-term response evaluated along with the environmental contour corresponding to a given return period or exceedance probability to represent the extreme response. However, for offshore wind turbines which are subjected to combined wind and wave loads, the ECM performs poorly on wind-induced responses (under wind only or combined wind and wave load conditions). This is due to the non-monotonic behavior of the wind-induced responses resulted from the control system of the wind turbine. The ECM will cause the deviation of the critical environmental conditions between the identified environmental contour and the realistic case. The modified environmental contour method (MECM) is proposed and developed to deal with such a system whose response changes discontinuously due to variations in the operating conditions with additional environmental contours taken into consideration. It is seen that environmental contour plays an important role in the application of both the ECM and the MECM. A set of environmental conditions are selected along the target contour to perform short-term response analysis for the determination of the long-term extreme response. Traditionally, the environmental contour is established based on the inverse first-order reliability method (IFORM) by Rosenblatt transformation with response excluded as a variable. Since this traditional method involves the transformation of the standard normal variables and original physical space which is related to the FORM-approximation closely, a possible over-or underestimation of failure probability may be induced. Another method to obtain environmental contour is the inverse second-order reliability method (ISORM). The ISORM approximates the failure surface by a quadratic function at the design point in standard normal space instead of a linear function in the IFORM. The result of contour based on the ISORM always being conservative, which cannot be ensured by the traditional IFORM method. The highest density region method (HDRM) is to define the environmental contour as the boundary, along which the joint probability density function (PDF) of the environmental variables is a constant. This method solves the contour in the original physical space and can be used in high-dimension conditions. Applying the environmental contour method and modified environmental contour method based on the IFORM, the ISORM, and the HDRM allows to predict the extreme response. The MECM results are much better than the results from the ECM according to safety requirements in the design stage. When applying the environmental contour method, the inverse second-order reliability method to obtain contour is recommended. The ISORM contour is more conservative than the traditional inverse first-order reliability method but the numerical analysis is more stable than the highest density region method in three dimensions, while when applying the modified environmental contour method, the traditional inverse first-order reliability is preferred because of its simplicity and time-efficiency in the calculation.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Accurate fault classification is an important step in locating the fault to achieve faster network restoration times. This reduces the operational costs of the system operator by reducing the duration of interruptions in the power supply. Furthermore, it has been found from practical experience that distortions or instabilities in fault waveforms can result in their classification and subsequent localisation being delayed, causing the loss of valuable customer minutes. The objective of this thesis is to investigate the potential of modern supervised learning techniques for the classification of faults in the distribution network. The problem is split into two parts: one aspect is to study the ability of a supervised learning classifier to differentiate between types of stable faults, and in this pursuit, to also identify better criteria for stability. <br/><br/>First, after a review of pertinent literature, it is found that discrete wavelet transforms and support vector machines (SVM) are suitable for fault signal processing and classification, respectively. Next, identifying characteristics, or features, from the three-phase fault current and voltage waveforms are engineered with the help of the db4 wavelet. The features are used as inputs to an SVM classifier model, and the model is tuned and validated to ensure optimal classification performance. Results showed that the developed SVM can differentiate between real-world instances of single-phase, two-phase and three-phase stable faults with a classification accuracy of 95%. A set of business rules are also developed to characterise instability by performing a windowed Fourier analysis and studying the strength of the fundamental frequency component of fault waveforms. The rules are tested on a set of fault data whose stability is uncertain, and it is found that the developed rules are able to improve upon the older method of stability analysis by increasing the rate of stable fault identification.","Supervised Learning; Distribution Network; Wavelet Analysis; Classification; Fault Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Kamp, L.M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The chemical industry needs to quickly adapt to deal with climate change's environmental and economic challenges. The chemical industry is a sizable contributor to climate change. On the other hand, their contribution to financial stability and growth is considerable. Adopting sustainable process technologies is the most promising solution for the industry as the current processes are the leading cause of emissions. This thesis aims to formulate a model that describes the adoption decision of a production firm in the chemical industry. It focuses on the adoption criteria at play, the relative importance of these criteria and the influence that actors of the production companies' environment (further referred to as context) have on adoption. Research conducted for this thesis is done through the lens of the sectoral view, focussing on organisational level criteria and interactions. The Netherlands has a sizable presence of industrial activity. As such, this context is used for this study. The organisational level focus of this thesis, together with the specific context of the chemical industry, inspired us to choose the Technology-Organisation-Environment (TOE) framework to describe the adoption of sustainable process technologies (SPT) in the chemical industry. During the creation of this thesis, it seemed no prior work applied TOE to the chemical industry. Therefore, the TOE framework is combined with industry-specific adoption criteria. The study provided three primary insights. The first insight is a new set of adoption criteria specific for the chemical industry. This insight is valuable as general adoption model literature criteria are purposely vague. Vague formulation of the adoption criteria is helpful to help potential customers evaluate radical innovations that they do not fully comprehend. However, managers in the chemical industry seem to know the exact criteria for assessing sustainable process innovations in the chemical industry. The second insight from the interviews concerns the tendency of adoption criteria to change in importance in particular situations. This variation is an essential addition to the existing literature in which adoption criteria are generally applicable and equally important across various adoption situations. The interviews identified four dimensions that demarcate adoption situations: three continuous technological dimensions and one discrete contextual dimension. The third insight of this thesis is the importance of the organizations surrounding the focal production firm. The adoption system refers to the businesses and organisations that influence production companies in their adoption decisions. The adoption system of the chemical industry consists of regulators, clients, competitors, engineering firms, development firms and feedstock suppliers. The collaboration with multiple stakeholders is of utmost importance when considering SPT adoption. In conclusion, the TOE framework with industry-specific adoption criteria seems to fit adoption in the chemical industry. However, due to the varying adoption situations in the chemical industry, it is crucial to consider the adoption dimensions. Future research could focus on finding the weight of these criteria. Whist doing this, it is essential to consider the adoption dimensions. It could be interesting to find out what influence the different dimensions have on adoption.","Master thesis; Chemical industry; adoption","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

Gonçalves, Joana (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Motivation: As one of the most common and life-threatening diseases in humans, cancer is a result of the accumulation of somatic mutations throughout the life cycle. Somatic mutation is a joint result of DNA lesion, which is a result of damage on DNA caused by mutagen, and the failure of DNA repair mechanisms. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of DNA repair is important for the development of cancer pathology. Research on mutational signatures in cancer genomic data has given us insights into the relationship between DNA repair pathway and certain types of cancer. However, close-up studies on DNA repair pathways still need to be carried out to understand repair behaviour further. The CRISPR-Cas9 technique can create double-strand break in DNA. This paper extracts mutational signature to observe the characteristic of the pathway for the CRISPR-mediated double-strand break repairing in order to obtain a deeper understanding on DNA repair mechanisms.<br/>Results: By analyzing the mutational signature extracted from CRISPR-Cas9 mediated targets, we found out that the mutational processes involved in double-strand break DNA repair processes are simple and predictable compared to mutational processes involved in the formation of cancer cells. When comparing the mutational processes in wildtype and cNHEJ-deficient cells, the latter show a much higher frequency of micro-homology related deletions. However, no significant difference between the two types of cells on the mutational process is able to be captured by the mutational signature extraction algorithm. The experiments also show that the selection of mutational features could significantly influence the final signature extraction results.","mutational signature; DNA repair; CRISPR-Cas9","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Without changing the world’s diets, even if we stop all fossil fuel emissions today, we would still not be able to maintain global warming below 1.5°C. The EU has set out their strategy for reducing agricultural emissions in the Farm to Fork Strategy, as part of the European Green Deal. This strategy, however, falls short of addressing meat consumption. Individual meat consumption is shaped by a range of factors, including social norms. The influence of these norms is investigated in this thesis, which addresses the research question: “how do social norms influence meat consumption and to what extent can European policy influence these to reduce meat consumption?”. This thesis takes the Netherlands as case study, and constructs an explorative agent-based model, based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour, where social norms spread through social networks. Individual meat consumption is broken into beef, pork, poultry, processed and substitute meat consumption. The factors of influence are analysed in this research through a correlation analysis of various surveys, and the likelihood to eat specific meat types is calculated through a least-squares multiple regression analysis. This research finds that social norms play a tangible role in shaping consumption, and targeting these can emissions from meat consumption by 0.4-4%. Fiscal policies are a more effective policy measure for the EU to follow, as a 20% tax on all meat can reduce emissions by 10%. A tax on beef was found to redistribute consumption in such a way that overall emissions do not decrease. The findings from this research are discussed in the political, policy and socio-economic contexts regarding meat consumption.","agent-based model; theory of planned behaviour; meat consumption; sustainability; social networks; social norms; Europe","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Cao, Wen-Jun (mentor); Schuurman, M. (mentor); Meijers, R.J. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The environmental strain and depletion of natural resources caused by the current economic system could be reduced through the transition to a more circular economy, based on regenerative use of resources, where materials are kept in use for as long as possible and their value is retained (Cheshire, 2016; Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2013; European Commission, 2015; Geldermans &amp; Jacobson, 2015). The building industry has an important part to play in this transition, as it is a heavy user of raw materials and a large producer of construction and demolition waste (Merrild et al., 2016; Rijksoverheid, 2016). The circularity of the building industry can be improved by reducing waste production and preventing the need for additional material input by increasing the service life of existing structures and components (Platform CB’23, 2020; Rijksoverheid, 2018). <br/>The service life of buildings and building components is usually limited by the frequently changing user demands and their inability to adapt to new requirements (Blok &amp; van Herwijnen, 2005; Durmisevic, 2006; Landman, 2016). In Dutch residential buildings, the building services are often cast into the floors, creating one fixed element (Durmisevic, 2006; Landman, 2016). As a result of this integration, adaptation to changing technical requirements or different spatial topologies results in damage or even demolition of the load-bearing floor, reducing the overall service life of the floor system (Brand, 1994; Durmisevic, 2006). A way to remedy this is by designing the floor systems to be able to adapt to changing circumstances and user requirements through flexible design (Geraedts, 1996; Gijsbers, 2011; Schmidt et al., 2011). This way, flexible design could provide a practical approach to improve the circularity of building components such as floor systems. This leads to the main research question of this thesis: “To what extent can flexibility measures improve the circularity of prefabricated floor systems in residential buildings?”<br/>The main research question was addressed in two parts. First, the theoretical framework for the research was compiled, then the theory was put into a practical context through a case study. As part of the theoretical framework, a literature study was done into the factors that influence the flexibility of design, existing designs for flexible floor systems, and existing assessment methods for the circularity and flexibility of building components. In addition, interviews were held with people involved in different parts of the decision and design process of building projects to identify possible opportunities and challenges for the implementation of flexible design of floor systems. <br/>As a result of the research into the factors that influence the flexibility of design, seven technical characteristics were identified that should be included in the design process to accomplish flexibility of design. These technical characteristics of flexible design are accessibility, durability, independence, integration, interface simplicity, overcapacity, and standardisation. Accessibility indicates the possibility to access components that need to be adapted without hindrance from other components. Durability regards the capacity of a material or system to continue to be useful after an extended period of time and usage. Independence concerns the technical separation of parts with different service lives and functions, while integration indicates the technical coupling of parts that are unlikely to ever be adapted separately. Interface simplicity requires the use of uncomplicated mechanical connections between elements to allow for easy disconnection. Overcapacity indicates the ability of a design to accommodate higher technical specifications than initially required and allows for flexibility in the application of the design in different functions. Finally, standardisation regards the use of the same components size and construction details throughout the design to ensure compatibility between different parts.<br/>From the interviews, it became apparent that flexible design provides opportunities for both the clients and the building industry itself. Flexible design offers clients the possibility to adapt their buildings to changing circumstances and requirements and plays into the growing interest and willingness of clients to invest in sustainable alternatives. It is expected that the opportunities regarding adaptability to future developments and residual value are especially interesting to professional investors. For the building industry, flexible design can have a positive impact on the efficiency of the collaboration between different disciplines in the design process. Other opportunities for the building industry lie with reduced failure costs and the possibility to increase the standardisation of building components. The main challenges for the adaptation of flexible design in practice, as identified through the interviews, are the conservative nature of the building industry and the possible cost increase of building projects as a result of the use of a novel floor system. <br/>The literature study into the existing flexible floor designs showed that two types of flexible floor systems can be identified. The first type has the building services incorporated within the structural height of the floor and can be further subdivided into floor systems that are variations of the hollow core slab with grooves through which pipes can be laid and floors systems with a hollow space within the structural height of the floor for the placement of building services. The second type concerns systems where the building services are separated from the structural floor and the building services are either placed on top or below the load-bearing floor.<br/>Through the literature study, a variety of circularity assessment methods was identified. Based on the availability of the full method and the applicability on a building component level, the Building Circularity Indicator method was found to be the most relevant for this thesis. No suitable method was found for the flexibility assessment of building components. Therefore, a new flexibility assessment method was developed based on the seven technical characteristics of flexible design. <br/>As part of the case study, the building code and stakeholder requirements for the design of a floor system were compiled and the existing flexible floor designs, as well as some traditionally used floor systems, were assessed on their circularity and flexibility to identify what characteristics of the floor designs contribute to their circularity and flexibility and where there was room for improvement. This was used as input for the development of a new flexible floor system. Several design concepts for flexible floor systems were worked out based on the incorporation of the technical characteristics of flexible design and with cost considerations in mind. The design concepts were developed, verified, adapted, and at times discarded, based on the building code and stakeholder requirements. The resulting designs are two versions of a prestressed ribbed concrete floor element. The ribs are placed at the top of the concrete slab. Between the ribs, there is space for the placement of building services and the ribs contain openings for the routing of pipes and cables. The gaps between the ribs are covered with panels, which remain removable for accessibility of the building services, and are filled with a loose granulate material for sound insulation. <br/>The developed floor systems were assessed on their circularity and flexibility and compared to the existing flexible floor designs and traditional floor systems. This comparison showed that the developed floor systems have the highest flexibility score of all floor systems included in the comparison and also have circularity scores that are among the highest. The high circularity score as a result of a design based on flexibility and cost considerations indicates that the circularity of a floor system is improved by the inclusion of flexibility measures in the design. When looking at all the floor systems included in the comparison, a significant positive correlation between the circularity and flexibility scores of the floor systems was found. In conclusion, the implementation of flexibility measures can improve the circularity of prefabricated floor systems in residential buildings.","Flexible design; Flexibility; Adaptability; Flexibility assessment; Circularity; Circular economy; Floor; Floor system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering - Structural Design","",""

Within this project further steps have been explored on both strategic- and product level of EVBox’s commercial AC chargers. First, an analysis on the EV context led to the conclusion that there are many stakeholders involved that need to be included in the value retention process and that EVBox could strengthen its market position by differentiating by becoming circular rather than just sustainable. Secondly, through a method dubbed reverse logistics mapping the economic viability of implementing maintenance and repair-, remanufacturing-, recycling- and component harvesting strategies was explored. A cascading strategy where all benefits of the aforementioned strategies can be added up, was chosen as the most fruitful. Thirdly, by disassembling two chargers Disassembly Maps (De Fazio, 2018) could be made where areas of improvement were found. The EVBox Iqon was chosen as the focus product and redesigns were proposed based on the areas of improvement and priority components, namely the charger cables, side panels and kWh-meter. Through Disassembly Map-guided brainstorm sessions multiple redesign proposals were developed within the solution spaces of a redesigned installerbox that allows for the harvesting of the kWh-meter; mechanical fastening of the PMMA plates to completely liberate the side panels for reconditioning; and a modified stopper mechanism to allow easier replacement of the cables. The chosen redesign is a custom installerbox which allows for a decrease of disassembly time of 76% compared to the original design. Furthermore, this project has proven that the Disassembly Map is a suitable tool to evaluate and guide redesign sessions for EV chargers. This project resulted in a proposal for EVBox’s future approach to circular design: Standard definitions of circular jargon have to be implemented throughout the whole company to facilitate communication and avoid miscommunication on the topic. The tools used in this project, namely the Disassembly Map and Reverse Logistics Mapping can be used to guide future circular design activities. The tools can be used on other products within the portfolio or to develop the focus strategy and product further. It is preferable to take circularity into account from the earliest stages of development, as it is difficult to optimise a product for circularity that is already on the market. When optimising a product for circularity that is already on the market, it is advised to focus on optimising 1 area of the product per time. The actual implementation of circular strategies goes much further than calculations and redesigns; the structure of a company has to be adapted too. If EVBox manages to successfully implement a cascading strategy both in- and outside the company, it can become one of the sustainable frontrunners in the EVSE market. In the long term it might be worthwhile to change to a subscription model, also known as ‘charging as a service’.","EV Chargers; Disassembly Map; Circular Economy; Circular Design Strategies; Circularity assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); El Serafy, Ghada (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The need for accurate estimation of hydrodynamic and water quality model variables arises from the UNITED project, which aims to create high-resolutional forecasting systems for monitoring the cultivation of seaweed and flat oysters and operating of the Belgian pilot of UNITED in the coastal area of the North Sea. Accurate observations of physical variables are usually only known for small domains of the model, on the water surface. Therefore, data assimilation is applied on different hydrodynamic models to search for improved estimates of waterlevel, water velocity and temperature. The sequential data assimilation algorithm, the Ensemble Kalman filter is considered. The algorithm is a Monte-Carlo approximation of the Kalman filter, both using accurate observations assimilated into the model, where the model each time is shifted towards the observations when available, providing an optimal trade-off estimation between the model estimations and observations. Two models are considered: a 1D model of the Western Scheldt estuary in Python and the 2D model with depth of the Western Scheldt estuary implemented with software packages Delft3D FM and OpenDA. Model estimates and estimates of model with assimilated observations are investigated in various experiments to look for improved predictions, using twin experiments to generate artificial observations over the whole domain. The various experiments contained the search for the effect of assimilation location on the estimates, of the effect of assimilation of different physical parameters, the effect of the observational error covariance and the effect of water surface assimilation on the estimation within the water column. In most cases, the Ensemble Kalman filter improved the estimate of waterlevel and water velocity with varying results up to a decrease in rmse of a factor four, while the assimilation of temperature gave a worse prediction. Furthermore, assimilation of waterlevel gave the best improvement in estimate. For the investigated models, assimilation of observations near the boundary conditions with implied noise gave the most improved estimates. Furthermore, assimilation of water surface observations improved the estimate within the water column for water velocity with a factor of 2, while temperature assimilation did not show any improvement. The result for temperature may be due to a collapsing Ensemble Kalman filter due to small standard deviations and a not realistic model setup for temperature. Therefore, assimilation of only observations at the surface may be used to accurately improves water column estimations for water velocity. For temperature, more research is needed. Advised is an experiment with a different model setup with more realistic and longer spin-up time of temperature. The collapsing Ensemble Kalman filter can be prevented by initialization of new ensembles before the the collapse happens. In further research, data assimilation can be applied on the DCSM model, a model involving the area of the Belgian pilot.","Data assimilation; Ensemble Kalman filter; Hydrodynamic modelling; Delft3D FM; OpenDA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Computational Science and Engineering","",""

Intelligent systems and smart assistants will fill in the gap and take their role to guide travelers along their way on the trail of mobility infrastructure weaved in cities., Smart travel assistants will not only enable seamless journeys through navigation, but also make many decisions on our behalf. How should we handle these tools to enrich our multimodal trips while not losing control of the relationship when they are equipped with capabilities to better understand and predict travelers’ needs and behavior? This thesis describes how multimodal travelers plan and make a journey and how to support this process with a personal travel assistant called a travel buddy. During the Mind Mapping session with users, it was found that they want smart assistants to know everything about themselves. However, since they believe machines can’t think like a human, they want to be more involved in customizing routes. On the other hand, there is a responsibility for such apps to deliver only accurate and necessary route options and travel information while making the interaction between a user and an app easy and intuitive. However, simplicity can bring negative consequences such as losing congruence with travel patterns of users by neglecting factors that are important determinants in human decision making. Aiming to establish a collaborative relationship between a traveler/user and a travel buddy, the final prototype depicts a future scenario in which a travel buddy actively learns, and asks for participation, and defines a travel type of a user to optimize the journey together. A defined travel type can be used as a tool for users to observe and reflect on their travel behavior. The impact of defining a travel type can change travel behavior when it’s treated well. This thesis concludes with a manifesto that delivers considerations when developing a travel buddy that will shape future mobility together with users.","Multimodal tranport; human machine interaction; Decision making process; Behavioural design; Future Context; Manifesto","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Biomarkers that predict recovery while providing functional insight into the underlying neural process are highly desired for optimal clinical care. Objectives: This explorative study aims to determine potential biomarkers from Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SEP) using ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG). Brain asymmetry metrics are derived from high-density EEG recordings of five longitudinal stroke patients during the first six months of stroke recovery. In addition, EEG sources and their interactions, constrained by anatomical information from (d)MRI, are explored for a potential biomarker. Results: Subjects with low baseline FMA-UE show a trend of increased recovery as the Laterality Index (LI) of the infarcted hemisphere increases, although it is not significant within this small group. The LI of the non-infarcted hemisphere shows a significant trend of high LI values at baseline that decrease to lower values during recovery. This effect was tested on a different dataset of 17 longitudinal stroke patients (without dMRI data). The results in this second group showed strong variability between subjects and measurements. The non-infarcted hemisphere is able to significantly predict the FMA-UE for both datasets. On the other hand, estimated effects for the LI of the infarcted hemisphere did not show significant values. Biomarkers were not derived from EEG sources and their interactions. Conclusion: In this study, we have demonstrated the potential of the LI as a biomarker for stroke recovery. Small sample size and absence of controls make hard clinical conclusions impossible. However, our findings show that the LI might predict recovery of the FMA-UE, even at low baseline FMA-UE. The LI of the non-infarcted hemisphere is able to significantly predict the FMA-UE of the affected hand, a surprising discovery that might be attributed to background cortical activity or ipsilateral SEP components. Derivations from EEG sources and their interactions might lead to more sensitive metrics and novel insights into stroke rehabilitation. Significance: If the discovered trends apply to a larger sample size, asymmetry metrics from SEP’s have prognostic value in stroke recovery.","Stroke; EEG; Somatosensory Evoked Potentials; diffusion MRI","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Context Listening to music in the domestic domain is something everyone does, but not all in the same way. In this research user of HiFi systems are the focus. HiFi Enthusiast listen to music to experience their Music. For decades HiFi systems were quite sustainable, put together out of separate components, if one failed only that one needs replacement. However things have changed, digital and analog systems are combined in one enclosure. Problem All-in-One HiFi solutions gain in popularity amongst Music Enthusiasts. All-in-One solutions are small, everything is contained in one enclosure. Easy to use, a mobile phone and application can be used to control the system. Analog and digital systems are put together to increase the use cases, however the technical lifetime of the different components is different. The digital parts can last for 5 to 10 years, the amplification part 10 to 20 years. A sustainable alternative needs to be designed, with the same benefits for the Music Enthusiast. Approach During this design research the double diamond approach is utilized. First to discover the current situation and fill in knowledge gaps using expert interviews and Hotspot Mapping. Thereafter online questionnaires and in-depth interviews provided the remaining data to start the design process. The design process is split in two, first the gathered data is used to design an overall ‘enclosure’, which is tested with the Music Enthusiast. Thereafter the technical implications of the design are researched, prototyped and implemented. Findings For the Sustainable HiFi solution to be saleable in traditional HiFi stores it has to be usable in a demo room. The HiFi solution should be adaptable to the changing needs and wishes of the Music Enthusiast during their Audio Life. By focusing on adaptability the sustainability aim can best be achieved via a new product design. For the Sustainable HiFi Solution to utilize its sustainable potential to the fullest different parts of the system should be designed using different circular design methods. In the new design unused functions should not be present in the system. Results The Critical Design Challenges for a Sustainable HiFi solution have been met. A modular design was made that can adapt to the Music Enthusiast wishes and needs with regards to Aesthetics, Functionality and Ease of Use. The different modules are easy to replace, without any tools, with the push of a button. The current status of the design is enough to clearly communicate the ideas and reasoning behind the concept. The next step would be to make a minimal viable product to demonstrate the potential of the IMS system to the Music Enthusiast.","Modular Design; Adaptability; Circular design; Sustainabilty; Audio amplifier","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Large areas of the world are protected by flood defence systems. A common part of flood defence systems is a levee with grass cover, with the primary function to protect hinterland against floods. Waveovertopping might lead to erosion of the grass cover, followed by erosion of the inner slope and potentially levee breaching. The wave overtopping simulator (WOS) was developed for full-scale and insitu testing of the erosional resistance of levees against wave overtopping. The first experiment with this simulator was carried out in 2007 and more followed. However, the data gathered during these overtopping experiments has always been considered on individual experiment scale or in small subsets, exception being the Cumulative Overload method. The experiments proved to be difficult to reproduce, seemingly identical experiments gave different results. The objective of this thesis is to combine WOS data and multiple grass erosion models to make a prediction for the failure of the grass cover. Key features that determine the prediction of failure are the location and moment of failure. Therefore, these are included in the main research question, which is identified as: How can grass erosion models and WOS experiment data be combined in a new method to generate a prediction of the moment and location of the grass cover failure due to wave overtopping? A literature study on grass erosion and grass erosion provides the basis for modelling grass erosion, a review of combination techniques gives insight in combining results for a prediction. A selection of models is discussed and used for setting up a prediction method. These include three flow-based models which are semi-realistic simplified representations and time-independent over a single overtopping event: Cumulative Overload Method, Analytical Grass Erosion Model and Dean Stream Power. These models are, where required, adjusted to model grass cover failure and to comply with identical hydrodynamic input. A fourth model, the Wave Impact Approach, is an impact-based approach. Each model is calibrated on each WOS experiment, creating a set of calibrated models, which function as the set of predictors. The number of predictors equals the number of models times the number of experiments. During calibration, the moment of failure has been traced back using the control list of the WOS, and vice-versa, resulting in a moment during the experiment at which the grass cover failed. Detailed review of all factual reports on WOS experiments and the nature of the grass erosion models highlighted the need for a locationdependent resistance parameter to determine the location of failure. Therefore, calibration was based on a location-depended resistance parameter; critical flow velocity for the flow-based models and critical pressure for the impact based model. This set of predictors has been used to create a set of predictions for each of the five validation experiments, input being the geometry, loading and initial condition of the slope. The initial condition given by a registration of anomalies to the average grass cover. Failure is determined by vote and averaging. After validation, none of the final predictions proved to be fully correct. Meaning that none of the final predictions correctly indicated the location and moment of the first grass cover failure. Despite this, in four of the five validations at least one correct failure location was indicated when considering the specific anomalies. The main shortcoming is concluded to be the prediction of number of waves until grass cover failure. Based on this research and given a certain average grass cover quality, it is concluded that the resistance against grass erosion by wave overtopping is described by resistance against erosion of anomalies. For at least 22 of 28 sections in the dataset, grass cover failure occurred at an anomaly of the average grass cover. No grass cover failures occurred related to the average grass quality. Especially mole activity showed a significant 46% decrease in the averaged calibrated critical flow velocity with relative to that for the average grass cover. This leads to the conclusion that design and safety assessments should include conditions other than the average grass quality. For future research a method is recommended that divides mole activity into classes, based on certain characteristics. Each class distinguishable by unique combination of properties and assigned a resistance against erosion. For design, the probability of occurrence of each class must be determined and combined with the corresponding influence on the resistance against erosion. For assessment, an inventory or representative sample of animal activity must be available to asses if the occurrences of animal activity are within the design requirements.","grass erosion; Grass covers; grass revetment; wave overtopping; Wave Overtopping Simulator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

The aim is to provide an integrated approach from both natural and social sciences and to perform this in three different country settings. These countries are Indonesia, Turkey and the Netherlands and they were selected because of their different geothermal system types. The integrated approach in this study results in a research process that requires a broad range of measurement and analysis techniques and a clear understanding of the natural and social disciplines. From the natural sciences approach this report studies the environmental risks through a geochemical characterization of the geothermal fluids, whereas the social sciences approach studies the risk perception on geothermal operations. The outline of the process followed is visualized in Figure 0.1. From the natural sciences approach, an extensive geochemical data set is used to characterize the geothermal fluids and their environmental risk. This contains approximately 750 sample measurements from three countries that were collected through partners and third parties. The samples are characterized with help of two ternary diagrams (Na-K-Mg and Cl-SO4-HCO3), their salinity (in TDS), pH and correlation coefficients between commonly occurring elements in fluids, such as Ca, Si and F. These fluid properties help to define the maturity, origin and characteristics of geothermal fluids at a broad range of locations in each of the three countries. Through this analysis we found a strong relation between the fluid classification and the sample type (well or spring) in Indonesia. Besides, a relative high influence of volcanic activity on the geochemistry was observed. The Turkish and Dutch samples are dominated by their geothermal system types that are respectively carbonatic and clastic sedimentary systems. The concentrations of nine toxic gases and elements dissolved in the geothermal fluids are analysed and compared to guideline values to determine the relative environmental risks in the three countries. The toxic gases are H2S, CO2 and CH4 and the toxic elements Al, As, Cd, F, Hg and Pb. Their effects on the environment differ but all of them affect the health of humans, flora and fauna when they contaminate groundwater or the atmosphere. From the risk analysis in the three countries it was found that the risk of excessive H2S pollution is highest in Indonesia, for CO2 in Turkey and for CH4 in the Netherlands. The contamination risk with toxic elements differs largely per element but often occurs in specific locations, for example with high volcanic impact. For the social sciences approach, a survey was distributed to measure how the public perceives the risks of geothermal energy. The population for this survey is people affiliated with the geothermal industry because of their prior knowledge on the subject. They are asked to indicate their (risk) perception through several statements and factors to which they indicate their level of agreement. The result indicates that the perceived risks were generally higher in countries with a higher risk, like Indonesia. However, there were several interesting exceptions to this rule in which the perceived risks were low whereas a relatively high environmental risk was identified, like for potential CH4 pollution in the Netherlands.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

In theory, CRDTs seem like a natural fit for open P2P networks, however there are obstacles to overcome. Firstly, many proposed CRDTs are grow-only because (i) CRDTs may track deletions in permanent tombstone values or (ii) they may gather permanent information on every peer in the system. As such, CRDTs are not well adapted to open P2P networks. Many peers may come and go over time and persistent accurate information about all peers will grow too large eventually. Secondly, some types of CRDT (mainly op-based CmRDT) require causal message delivery which is hard in open P2P networks. Thirdly, CRDTs are typically built with the assumption that all peers need all data in a replica and thus all data is fully replicated, even though a client may only be interested in a small subset.<br/><br/>To address these issues a new state-based CvRDT is proposed: BloomCRDT, which is a variation on the OR-set that replaces its 푅 grow-only set with Bloom filters. It does not need knowledge of other peers or their state and avoids tombstones. This makes BloomCRDT well suited for use in open P2P networks. The grow-only aspect is vastly reduced compared to the standard OR-set. However, the BloomCRDT itself is indivisible and can grow to be too large if it stores many elements. This limit is not high enough to accommodate demanding applications. Scalability can be dramatically improved by combining multiple BloomCRDTs to form a Conflict Free R-Tree (CFRT). Each node of the R-Tree is represented by a BloomCRDT. Concurrent modifications are allowed and, due to the characteristics of the R-tree, this results in a consistent data structure with overlapping ranges. Since an R-Tree’s efficiency is reduced when ranges overlap, a periodic optimization algorithm can be used to eliminate the overlapping ranges.<br/><br/>A proof-of-concept implementation was made of BloomCRDT and CFRT using Python and PyIpv8. Experiments where performed using the Gumby experimental framework and the DAS5 cluster. The experiments show that BloomCRDT performs as designed: it keeps a smaller state than other solutions while being invariant to the number of identities that have interacted with a BloomCRDT instance. The CFRT is shown to be able to balance key/value entries over multiple BloomCRDT instances using favorable messaging metrics. Moreover the CFRT, and by extension BloomCRDT, tolerate network faults and can work with up to 90% message loss. A final experiment uses real world data to compare the CFRT to Tribler’s channels implementation, and shows that even at scale a CFRT can outperform the current channels implementation by orders of magnitude in terms of user responsiveness.","CRDT; P2P Networks; Tribler; Eventual Consistency","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current lane detection methods do not provide the versatility of real-time performance, robustness,and accuracy required for real-world scenarios. The reasons include lack of computing power while being portable and inability to observe the continuity and structure of lane lines over a sequence of images. An investigation into the present methods in the literature reveals that deep learning networks cannot focus on relevant images and critical parts of the images. The neural networks implemented with max-pooling operations can cause a loss of information at a granular level of the image during the downsampling of images. Obtaining a fixed set of lane locations will restrict the number of lane lines detected. It hinders the generalisability of the network. This thesis aims to introduce a novel spatio temporal method that can focus on lane lines and key features to increase the robustness and accuracy of lane line detection.The spatio temporal attention network based on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) units tested on the tvtLane dataset provided an accuracy of 98.1443%, the precision of 0.8873, and F1-score of 0.9108.

Different methods that aim to achieve better visual effects on reducing or avoiding seams and distortions during synthesis are proposed. It has been a popular topic both in computer graphics and computer vision for many years. However, most of the synthesis methods are automatic and take images as the input. There are few methods designed for artists who want to control and create patterns manually. The goal of our Diffusion Mosaics is to introduce a graphics tool that allows the artist to create tiles that can be seam­ lessly concatenated. In this way, non­periodic textures of arbitrary size can be produced at very low memory costs. We rely on a special kind of tiles called Wang tiles, which are squares with colored edges. Neighboring tiles should share the same edge color at the common border. The texture tiles are designed in such a way that if this constraint is fulfilled, the transition from one tile to the next will be seamless. It becomes possible to create a large non­periodic final texture. In our system, each tile can be filled with hand­drawn patterns using diffusion curves, which is a vector graphics primitive created by diffusing the given colors of defined Bezier curves, which has been proven to be a useful alternative to purely pixel­based design that artists typically rely on. They also match our application well, as, by adding border­color constraints to the tile, solving the diffusion process results in tiles that match the neighboring tiles naturally, hence avoiding any seams. The tool gives creative freedom to the artist that they can even draw the pattern outside the tile area, resulting in an automatic update of all other tiles when needed to ensure consistency. Finally, for more complex illustrations and back­ wards compatibility to software such as Photoshop, pixel­based images are also supported and can be integrated.","Texture Synthesis; Diffusion Curve; Wang tile","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These metals are for example required to improve and expand the capacity to store energy and to improve efficiencies of electrically powered vehicles. There are large quantities of those rare metals in the form of polymetallic nodules present in the oceans at great depth spread out over large areas. Allseas is developing a collector vehicle to pick up these valuable polymetallic nodules from the ocean floor, and is looking into the possibility of having this collector operate autonomously. This Thesis presents a system that allows the collector to use sensor data to detect and safely avoid obstacles that might be present on the ocean floor, taking into account collector dynamics and sweep efficiency. Different techniques have been reviewed and tested in a simulation environment that was created for this challenge. The data coming from a simulated Multibeam sensor is used to detect obstacles that are present in the simulated environment through ground plane detection with a RANSAC plane fitting algorithm and classifying data points as either ground or obstacle. These two data sets were used to create an occupancy map capable of handling noisy data and accurate storage of the locations of obstacles for the collector to navigate around. Four different planners (RRT, Bi-RRT, RRT* and PRM) were tested to calculate a new safe path for the collector using the occupancy map. The path was constructed whilst minimising the deviation from the planned mining plan as this would result in the most optimal coverage of the area. It was concluded that the RRT planner provided the most optimal paths for the collector.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-08-31","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering","",""

Much is to be gained in the transport of people and goods, which accounts for 25% of the total carbon emissions in Europe. Presently, Air Passenger Transport (APT) hinders carbon emission reductions due to its large environmental impact and evermore growing market share (Van Goeverden et al., 2017). So far, the environmentally friendly high-speed rail only competes with APT up to approximately 600-800 kilometers. Hyperloop as kickstarted in 2015 by Elon Musk has the potential to substitute APT beyond that range, with electric propulsion of magnetically levitating passenger capsules within semi-vacuum tubes. However, research towards Hyperloop’s potential travel demand has remained sparse as of now. Within the financial appraisal of infrastructure projects, forecasted travel demand of the infrastructure is a vital aspect. Namely, ticket revenues and societal value through environmental benefits and travel time savings can result from travel demand. So far, only straightforward analyses have been done to forecast potential Hyperloop demand, using data from previous travel surveys that do not include Hyperloop. Used data does not cater to travellers’ overall (dis)like for Hyperloop, or travellers’ trade-offs including Hyperloop-specific transport mode attributes. Moreover, since potential Hyperloop implementation lies in the future, various future contexts surrounding travel behavior could also influence its competitive potential. To account for these issues, this research estimates future Hyperloop travel demand by conducting a Stated Choice Experiment (SCE) amongst Dutch travellers. Here, future decision-making contexts and travellers’ (dis)like for Hyperloop are included.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

(mentor); Yin, F. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In the last few years, there has been a growing awareness regarding the climate impact of aviation in the general public. With global warming effects becoming more severe, it is important that aviation drastically reduce its emission footprint to keep the impact on the climate lower. There have been ongoing efforts by various organizations such as ICAO and ACARE which have led to the formulation of ambitious targets for reducing aviation emissions in the future. In the past, the main goal of improving aero-engine performance has generally been to increase the operating pressure and temperature, thereby improving the cycle efficiency leading to lower fuel consumption, and consequently, lower CO2 emissions. However, this increase also leads to more NOx emissions from the engine, as NOx emissions are sensitive to engine pressure and temperature variations. The climate impact of aviation is mainly driven by long-term impacts from the CO2 emissions and short-term impacts from the non-CO2 emissions. This thesis aims to analyze the sensitivity of the turbofan engine design parameters towards the impact on the climate in terms of near-surface temperature change due to the various emission species. A detailed methodology was developed for the thesis, encompassing different aspects such as aircraft performance, emission prediction, engine modeling, emission inventories, and climate analysis. The aircraft performance model, the emission prediction model, and the emission inventory model were developed specifically for the purpose of this thesis. The engine modeling was done in the Gas Turbine Simulation Program (GSP), which is a modeling tool used for the development and simulation of gas turbine systems. The climate analysis was carried out in AirClim, which is a surrogate model obtained from the results of Climate-Chemistry models, meant for comparing aviation technological options from a climate impact point of view. The results from the thesis are intended to develop a better understanding of the relationships in the field of aviation emissions, especially concerning the tradeoffs between the CO2 and the non-CO2 effects, since the relationship between design parameters, emissions, and climate impact is not straightforward.<br/><br","Turbofan engine design; Aviation climate impact; Combustion technology; Climate modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-31","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Sadly, most of these robots are currently being held back by their power sources and control systems. These components, which are usually quite heavy and bulky, need to be integrated before mobile soft robots can cut their tethers and explore the world autonomously. Soft robots should be mindful of their energy consumption to minimize the requirements on the power supply. However, the efficiency of their actuators is still a not well understood area of research. We attempt to pave the road for future research into this subject by developing a testing protocol based on a simplified analytical model. We built an experimental setup and investigated the efficiency of soft pneumatic extension actuators. We found that actuator designs which reduce axial stiffness produced higher efficiency. Additionally, we found that efficiency increases with load, until it is limited by the buckling load. Unfortunately, these two conditions seem to conflict with each other since a lower axial stiffness also reduced the buckling load. Future actuator designs should therefore try to combine a low axial stiffness with high load bearing capabilities. Also, this research should be extended to different classes of soft actuators as well as investigating non-ideal circumstances. We believe this research aids in the general understanding of efficiency of soft actuators and act as a stepping stone for future research.","Soft Robotics; pneumatic; Experimental; Energy Efficiency","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Poor reliability directly affects their cost effectiveness due to increased operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs and reduced availability to generate power because of downtime. This certainly encourages WT operators to employ advanced O&amp;M methodologies and focus on the critical components to reduce failure rate, time to repair and maximizing WT performance. Condition monitoring (CM) of wind turbines for the purpose of prognostics and health management of critical equipments can improve the reliability and reduce maintenance costs by identifying failures at the earliest possible stage and by eliminating unnecessary scheduled maintenance.

Mayors and municipalities understand the urgency needed with the climate action and are acting at the forefront by engaging in transnational initiatives to support emissions reductions. The steady emergence of transnational municipal networks such as C40 or ICLEI is an indication of a paradigm shift in climate change governance. These TMNs have started to become diplomatic actors themselves and fostering climate action within the network. Hence, a mixed-method research design entailing both the quantitative and qualitative analysis is chosen to single out the impact of network membership on climate mitigation. The quantitative study pertains to a multiple regression analysis of factors that are expected to covariate with the CO2 emissions. Data from over 600 OECD cities were analysed. Although, the main hypothesis - i.e., that TMNs have a significant positive impact on CO2 emissions could not be verified. The qualitative analysis was performed after the statistical analysis and two case studies were compared: Bogota and Copenhagen. The results showed that C40 membership cannot be associated with the outcome i.e., - change in emissions owing to its limited influence in the implementation phase. The triangulation of results showed no causality between network membership and decrease in CO2 emissions in the OECD cities for the period of 2001-2019. The policy advice is highly relevant for both local and national governments, to leverage the full potential of TMNs. Finally, this analysis is the first approximation to measure the 'impact' of a climate network, hence recommendations are provided for future avenues to be explored to substantiate and validate my findings. <br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Fuelled by commercial interest and rapid technological improvements, the coming two decades are expected to have humans return to the Lunar surface and possibly set foot on Mars for the very first time. The gateway concept is likely to play a significant role in these missions. A gateway is a man-made structure in space that functions as an intermediate station in an interplanetary transfer. NASA’s Artemis program relies on a gateway in an Halo orbit around the Earth-Moon L2 Lagrange point to facilitate sustainable Moon missions. This thesis will contain an extensive feasibility study into the application of the gateway concept to Earth-to-Mars travel. At the end of this work, an optimal trajectory design for a gateway concept that supports efficient and practical (crew) transportation from Earth to Mars will be presented.<br/><br/>The research will regard three distinct gateway trajectory design aspects: The gateway location, the gateway orbit and the transfers supported by the gateway. These three aspects can be combined to form a large number of different gateway trajectory designs. A total of three analyses were performed. In these analyses, the performance of the different gateway designs was researched. The goal of the first two analyses, Analysis A and Analysis B, was to investigate a specific set of design aspects, evaluate and compare the designs’ performance and select a subset of design options to further investigate in the next analysis. As a result, Analysis C was able to perform a detailed study into a small number of designs and select a single optimal design.<br/><br/>Two types of gateway locations were identified: gateways orbiting a central celestial body and gateways in the vicinity of a Lagrange point. Analysis A focused on the Lagrange-point gateways only, so that the stationary-gateway assumption could be made. It was concluded that the equilateral Lagrange points are not suitable gateway locations. Additionally, it was determined that the remaining two analyses should focus on impulsive thrust transfers rather than their continuous thrust equivalent.<br/>As a result, Analysis B could focus on a set of specific transfer trajectories and a selection of only seven gateway locations (both central-body and Lagrange-point locations). By modelling the gateway orbits and optimizing for Delta V requirements, it was found that the gateway orbit has a significant effect on the performance of the gateway concept. Both Halo orbits and vertical-Lyapunov orbits proved suitable gateway orbits for gateways stationed at the Lagrange points. Although central-body gateways significantly underperformed Lagrange-point gateways, a gateway orbiting the Moon at a high altitude was selected together with four Lagrange-point gateway designs.<br/>Analysis C evaluated the consistency of the remaining five designs and investigated the TOF characteristics of the transfers supported by these gateways. By splitting a synodic year into ten separate launch windows and optimizing transfer trajectories for each, it was found that the Lagrange-point gateway designs allowed for more frequent travel from Earth to Mars than the gateway in Lunar orbit. Subsequently, it was found that a gateway at the Earth-Moon L1 location supports a better trade-off between TOF and Delta V compared to one at the Sun-Earth L2 point. <br/><br/>Through these three analysis, it was found that a gateway placed in a large Halo orbit at the Earth-Moon L1 point is the optimal gateway trajectory design for future Earth-to-Mars gateway missions. This design is capable of supporting multiple suitable transfer trajectories, of which the EdG1 x G1mEM is most efficient. The minimum Delta V transfer solution between Earth and Mars orbit in the synodic period starting January 1st 2033 is 5.99 km/s, but this would require a long TOF of 386 days. A TOF of 300 days is possible for a Delta V of 6.41 km/s, 250 days for a ¢V of 6.82 km/s and 200 days for a Delta V of 7.26 km/s. This gateway trajectory design scored good on consistency; allowing a transfer below a Delta V of 7km/s in five of the ten launch windows in which the synodic period was split. <br/><br/>A mission using this optimal gateway design was compared to a direct transfer between Earth and Mars (EM) and a flyby mission (EmEM), both traditional missions without gateway concepts. It was found that the inclusion of an intermediate gateway in the mission design both adds to the Delta V requirements and to the flight duration. The difference is a little over 1 km/s in Delta V for TOFs under 200 days and less than 0.2 km/s for a TOF of roughly a year. Mission planners will have to decide whether these differences are justified by the gateway concept’s benefits, such as its function as a logistics hub in space and its ability to<br/>facilitate transfers between spacecraft.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

However, the financial stability board recommended to replace these rates by alternative risk-free-rates at the end of 2021. The new rates will be backward-looking rates and therefore, the payoff definitions of interest rate derivatives will change and the currently used Libor Market model to price exotic interest rate derivatives is no longer feasible. This thesis examines a new type of model, the forward market model, which is able to generate both the new backward-looking rates as the current forward-looking rates under the same stochastic process. Besides, contrary to the Libor Market Model, the dynamics under the risk-neutral measure can obtained. Consequently, the new forward market model should always be chosen over the Libor market model. Two issues regarding the forward market model are also considered in this thesis. First of all, the forward market model cannot deal with negative interest rate, this is solved by implementing a shifted version of the log-normal model. Second, a log-normal model is unable to reproduce the implied volatility smile which is present in the market. We solve this issue by combining the forward market model together with the SABR model. Under a few assumptions we derive the shifted SABR forward market model which hasn't been derived in the literature. The model is validated by pricing a new type of caplet that will be present in the post-Libor world, where the payoff won't be known until the payment date. We find that the implementation of this new shifted SABR-FMM can accurately price zero-coupon bonds and caplets in the market. Therefore, we conclude that this new type of model is a possible solution to price exotic interest rate derivatives in the post-Libor world.","Market Models; Backward Rates; SABR; Interbank-Offered-Rates","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

A driving circuit based on a current mirror structure is implemented to drive the ultrasound transducer element with different slewing currents. These currents levels are generated by6-bit current DACs controlled by a calibration loop. This calibration loop senses the pulse output voltage through a capacitive divider. The resulting attenuated voltage is compared with a reference voltage by a low-voltage (LV) dynamic comparator. Based on the comparison result, the input code of the current DACsare adjusted by a successive approximation register (SAR).<br/>Several techniques are proposed to flexibly change the pulse amplitude and reduce the die size. First, the pulser is driven in a current mode which allows the transistors at the output stage to operate in the saturation region, so that the currents through the transducer elements always follow the input codes. Second, a separate calibration phase is applied at the beginning of the transmitting and receiving cycles, which will generate flexible and accurate input currents for the corresponding transmission phase.<br/>The pulser has been implemented in TSMC180nm HV BCD technology. The simulation results show that the prototype is able to transmit HV pulses with a4-bit amplitude modulation with 0.5V inaccuracy.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The constant impingement of sand particles on the wetted surfaces of a centrifugal dredge pump causes the performance of the pump to deteriorate. Therefore, components or complete pumps have to be replaced after some time. The use of numerical models to estimate the erosion wear in centrifugal dredge pumps can give insight into the principal erosion zones and the magnitude of the erosion in those zones. This information can be used to increase the erosion resistance of pump components. In addition, instructions for the maintenance of the pump can be composed based on the expected erosion wear. In that way, the efficiency of dredge processes can be increased considerably. This Master's Thesis project is carried out by the author during a 12-month period at Damen Dredging Equipment in Nijkerk, The Netherlands. The focus of the project is on developing, validating and demonstrating a numerical model capable of estimating the erosion wear due to slurry flow on the impeller blades of a centrifugal dredge pump by using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Within the CFD framework, it is found that the appropriate model for calculating the flow of the slurry (water with sand particles) is the Eulerian-Lagrangian method. The numerical computations are performed using the commercial software ANSYS Fluent. For the turbulence of the water, the k-ω SST turbulence model is used. The collisions of the particles with the wall are modeled using the Grant-Tabakoff model, whereas the linear soft sphere model is used for the inter-particle collisions. Using the aforementioned combination of models several studies are conducted, starting with a validation study using a submerged impinging jet benchmark. From that study, it is found that the fluid and particle velocity fields can be calculated with reasonable accuracy. For the same type of problem, the numerical erosion profile is compared to experimental values. It appeared that there is a considerable dependency of the erosion profile on the material hardness. In addition, the result of the four-way coupled method is influenced to a large extent by the values of the collision model parameters. By comparing the resulting erosion profile from the two-way coupled model with the experimental erosion, a good qualitative agreement is found. However, the magnitude of the erosion is overpredicted by this model. In addition, a verification and validation study was performed for the impeller. For the latter, new experiments were conducted in a facility that is available within the company Damen Dredging Equipment. By measuring a number of points before and after a 56 hour experiment, the resulting erosion could be determined. The four-way coupled computation for the impeller could not be fully completed within this project. However, the two-way coupled numerical model showed good correspondence with the experimental results. The currently available model is capable of predicting the maximum erosion zones on the impeller blades. This information could for example be used to improve the design of the impeller or to get a first order estimation of the lifetime of an impeller. The applicability of the numerical model that is developed during the current project can be extended by for instance including the pump volute.","CFD; Erosion; Centrifugal dredge pump; Slurry flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Aerodynamics","",""

(mentor); Colomes, Oriol (graduation committee); ter Horst, Erik (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In this thesis I will show the realisation of a multiline anchor system using a suction pile anchor (SPA). From the literature research it can be concluded that the SPA is a suitable anchor for a multiline anchor system and that the most probable mooring configurations will be either the original single-line, the 3-line or the 6-line system. Furthermore it could be concluded that when using a catenary mooring solution for the 3-line system, that the anchor perceives a lower horizontal net force due to anchor lines coming from different directions and cancelling parts of each other. This would, in theory, make the SPA for the 3-line multiline system smaller and also there would be 67% less anchors needed in a wind farm array. Furthermore the 6-line anchor does seem to have a bigger horizontal net force which requires the SPAs to be bigger but 83% less anchors are needed in an array of wind turbines. The looked at FOWT-system was the University of Maine VolturnUS-S reference floating offshore wind turbine semi-submersible, which supports the IEA-15-240-RWT turbine with a turbine rating of 15MW. With the original mooring configuration being a catenary one, a comparison has been made with a taut system and its implementation into a multiline anchor system has been researched. Lastly three different soil profiles have been chosen: normally consolidated clay, slightly consolidated clay and loose sand. In Chapter 4 Suction anchor concept design, the forces on the anchor are set up using the data set-up by NREL and the University of Maine and the C. Fontana papers. A SPA has more bearing capacity when the mooring-anchor connection point is below the mudline. Because of this feature the mooring line attaches to the SPA at an angle and in this thesis a range of angles of approach are chosen to be investigated: 25 and 35 degrees for the chain and 45 degrees for the taut line. Because of the angle there is a vertical force introduced to the anchor which need to be added together for each line. Because of this the total net force on the anchor is increased for the 3-line and 6-line anchors compared to the single-line anchor. With the mean and maximum forces the calculations for the holding capacity/pull-out capacity can be set up by looking at the Ultimate Limit State (ULS) or maximum forces in the system. These calculations are taken from the DNV guidelines which are the industry standard. To set-up the first parameters estimation a embedment (h/D-ratio) starting value has to be chosen and from literature and in discussion with SPT offshore the starting values were set at 5 for the clay profile and 1.5 for the sand profile. The weight of the SPA must be defined which was done as the mean vertical force applied to the anchors as such they will not be pulled out over time. The installation and removal calculations are an important step in the design and are also set up. Here the under pressures required to fully install the SPAs are calculated. Furthermore, structural failure due to buckling is checked for and different soil failures are analysed. Lastly the removal pressure of each concept is checked which allows for complete removal of the suction anchor. By lowering the embedment ratios of the different concepts the pressures inside the anchors can be minimised and problems can be averted. In the detailed design the full design of a in use SPA is shown and each part is defined. Furthermore, the one-line-broken criterium is discussed and it can be concluded that in case this happens the 6-line multiline system is very dangerous because a chain reaction can be started which can take out large parts of a wind farm array. Also a weight estimation of each SPA is made from which the extra needed ballast is calculated. Subsequently a cost estimation of each anchor concept can be made by calculating the cost of each system from the structural weight, the ballast and the mooring line lengths. At a depth of 200m, at which this study is situated, the taut multiline system cannot be set-up but the single-line taut system can be compared to the catenary single line system. Lastly a parametric analysis is done where changes in different parameters are compared to each other. What can be concluded from this thesis research is that a multiline system is technically feasible for a 15MW floating offshore wind turbines using SPAs. The 3-line and 6-line systems both have larger anchors than the single-line system although they need less anchors in a system. When including the mooring line costs together with these anchor costs it can be concluded that the 3-line anchor is more economically viable but the 6-line anchor is not. What can also be concluded from these mooring line costs and what is discussed in the parametric analysis is that the system works better if the wind turbines are closer together because the lines will be shorter. This distance is dictated by the wake recovery and an optimisation study is recommended for the 15MW wind turbine but it is also recommended that smaller turbines and deeper depths are looked at.","Anchor; anchor mooring; anchor points; multiline; SPA; suction pile anchor; FOWT; Floating offshore wind turbine; SPT Offshore","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-31","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering | Bottom Founded Structures, Arctic and Wind","",""

The DDP algorithm is proven to be robust for trajectories extending up to 500 revolutions and, compared to known locally optimal steering laws, allows to obtain more or equally optimal solutions. The latter is demonstrated in this paper through a set of test cases that range from theoretical scenarios to realistic mission applications, including increasing the specific orbital energy of NASA’s upcoming ACS3 mission.

(mentor); Stefanov, Alexandru (mentor); Kruimer, Bas (mentor); Qin, Z. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","A large contribution to the total share of electricity generated in European power grid will come from renewable sources of energy in the near future due to European initiative to become carbon neutral. RES are connected to the grid with PE devices, which if not modelled correctly provide lower level of system stability and security of supply. The existing power grid with mainly synchronous generators will not be suited to operate in the future, when synchronous machines will become less important sources of energy. An increase in dynamic behaviour of the system could cause significant challenges for the existing system, which calls for new monitoring and control strategies. The aim of the project is twofold; firstly, to enhance system stability by deploying WAMS in power system with a massive share of RES to total electricity generation. Secondly, it focuses on developing and proposing a tool which will improve consultancy in future power grids. A tool developed is Next Generation Grid Operations (NextGen GridOps) Knowledge Framework which is conceptually designed by DNV. The effectiveness of WAMS applications on system stability improvements and damping enhancements will be evaluated by studying rotor angle stability as well as effect of WAMS on damping of electromechanical oscillations. The response to a disturbance of the remaining synchronous generators will be studied to evaluate the effect of different types of control schemes (grid-following, grid forming control) on the rotor angle stability. Rotor angle stability will be examined to show whether different control structures and WAMS will show enhancements of the overall stability through time domain simulations. WAMS structure in this project consists of PMUs as well as WADCs. While PMUs are sensors deployed in the system to provide synchrophasor measurement, WADCs are damping controllers deployed with an intent of enhancing damping in the system. This project build upon findings from Horizon 2020 MIGRATE Project. The effectiveness of grid-following control and grid-forming control on stabilizing the grid with massive penetration of PE devices are conducted to set the base case for evaluating the effect of WAMS. Modelling software used in the project is DIgSILENT PowerFactory 2021 SP1 and the PowerFactory Thesis Licence was provided by DIgSILENT GmbH for research and educational purposes. Based on the off-line numerical simulations conducted in IEEE 39 Bus New England test system it was found that WAMS functionality with corresponding PMUs and WADCs can decrease oscillations in the system. It has been verified that grid-following control enables 60% of RES penetration and grid-forming control enables penetration of RES above 80%. There have been two grid-forming controllers used in the system, where DVC is able to receive the stabilizing signal while VSM grid-forming controller has a supporting role. WAMS and corresponding WADCs deployed on DVCs are able to enhance damping of the low-frequency modes with frequencies below 2.0 Hz, which is supported by time domain simulations and by conducting Prony analysis. Eigenvalue analysis results for some cases with WAMS deployed show no additional enhancements, which is a consequence of newly introduced controllers and interactions among them and existing controllers. The practical implications of this Master's Thesis study have been modelled in the NextGen GridOps Framework with an intent to make a step towards real world implementation of the findings developed during the project. Framework modelling focused on implementing client maturity classification of WAMS deployments, contributing towards development of WAMS roadmaps and further deployment of WAMS solutions for grid operators as part of the DNV Next Generation Grid Operations advisory services. Work done and information implemented will be valuable for DNV while solving the complex process of future grid operations and at the same time bringing newly developed knowledge into practice. The framework development part of the project ties in with scientific contribution by allowing newly developed information to be further explored. Effectiveness of WAMS and WADCs on improving selective damping and consequently enhancing system stability has been identified in this project through use of DVCs. It has been proven that VSM control has a better stabilizing effect and would allow even further enhancement of damping critical oscillation modes. Higher damping in the system increases the stability and consequently higher security of energy supply.<br","Selective Damping Control; WAMS; Direct Voltage Control; PE Interfaced Generators; NextGen GridOps Knowledge Framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-31","","","","","",""

However, because of AI's varied application areas, its inherent complexity, and the new organizational requirements that result from AI adoption, companies encounter pitfalls when deploying the technology. Potential implementation scenarios are not always clear. Understanding the AI readiness on an organizational level, which shows “the extent to which an organization has the ability to reap the benefits of AI” can improve the chances of effective AI deployment. This study aims to bridge the gap between academia and practice as most attention to artificial intelligence was paid to modeling steps in academia. Research on applying AI models to real-life problems and realizing business value has received insufficient attention. The current frameworks do not incorporate context-specific considerations for organizational readiness. This research investigates the organizational readiness of AI in the semiconductor industry. It is a critical step in avoiding costly failures, considering the capital-intensive characteristic of the semiconductor industry. A literature study has been conducted at first to review the existing AI organizational readiness framework and typical readiness factors. Then eight industry expert interviews are conducted to give a more holistic view of AI use cases across the semiconductor value chain as identifying the opportunity is the first step to establish AI readiness. Three challenges of AI deployment are summarized and the potential AI organizational readiness factors are listed to guide the case study interviews. The case study is carried out in ASML, one of the leading producers of chip-making equipment in the world. Through fourteen case study interviews, this research proposes an AI organizational readiness framework with six dimensions and conceptualizes twenty readiness factors. In the strategic alignment dimension, there are needs and added-value assessment, bottom-up proposal/innovation lab, top management support, business model innovation. In the resource dimension, there are talents, financial budget, IT infrastructure, competence center. In the process dimension, there are multidisciplinary team/collaboration, agile way of working, employee training, business process standardization. Regarding data dimension, there are data availability, data governance, data platform. In the AI model cluster, there are explainable AI with domain experts, context-aware modeling, model operation. In the external business environment, there are peers/competitors/software vendors and customer demand. Furthermore, twenty propositions on AI readiness in semiconductor organizations are given indicating their positive or negative influence on AI organizational readiness. This study contributes to the emerging literature on AI organizational readiness with the developed multi-dimension framework. It identifies AI-specific readiness factors under the dimensions of ""Data"" and ""AI model"". Moreover, among 20 readiness factors, 10 readiness factors are newly identified such as the agile way of working, competence center, context-aware modeling. Companies that seek to implement AI can use the proposed framework with readiness factors as a tool for assessment to help decision-makers, managers, and project teams to develop and deploy AI faster and more effectively.","Artificial intelligence; Organizational readiness; Semiconductor manufacturing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-31","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

A solution to the problem consists of minimizing the running costs of the power system, through defining the optimal operating state for each entity in the system, while adhering to a set of physical constraints. A lot of research has been conducted on decentralized and distributed solutions to this problem, which, when compared to centralized solutions, offer benefits such as adaptability, reliability and scalability. Nevertheless, most of these solutions have only been evaluated through simulations, while physical applications of these algorithms introduce new challenges, such as noise, delays, and the regulation of physical variables like voltage and current. In this thesis, we focus on a decentralized DC-OPF algorithm based on the Consensus and Innovation method, where system entities utilize their physical measurements and communicate with their neighbouring entities in order to reach consensus on a solution. While previous implementations of the algorithm were tested on simulated environments, this thesis explores and proves the effectiveness of the algorithm implemented for a real DC unipolar microgrid, consisting of power supplies, loads and a Power Circuit Board attached to each, where each device's behavior is governed by its own, exclusive entity. The newly-introduced challenges of a physical environment are accounted for, and any negative effects of them are mitigated as much as possible. Furthermore, the algorithm is successfully modified and extended to handle region DC-OPF, something that has not been attempted before, where a single entity of the algorithm could be responsible for many devices in the network. Finally, it is known that the original algorithm has not been experimented on before on scenarios of islanding and de-islanding, which are of importance in OPF, because a power fault may occur and one area may wish to isolate itself from the faulty area, or perhaps a distributed energy resource should only be connected to the network during certain periods, e.g., during sunlight for solar panels. Hence, this thesis also proves the effectivess of the algorithm on scenarios of islanding and de-islanding, in an innovation site called the Green Village, where technologies in the field of sustainable energy provision are tested and applied in a real-life environment.","Optimal Power Flow; decentralized; Consensus and Innovation; physical grid; microgrid; algorithm","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-31","","","","Computer Science","",""

A lot is known about the stump-socket interface in transtibial (TT) amputees. However, there are hardly any articles that explain the load transfers between the tibia and an OI prosthesis. For this reason, this study will focus on the load pattern at the bone-implant interface. The aim is to investigate how the osseointegrated loading for TT amputees is compared to able-bodied subjects. Method: Two generic musculoskeletal models were created in OpenSim: a transtibial osseointegrated (TTO) model and an able-bodied model. The able-bodied model includes all muscles in the lower limb, where the TTO model had no muscles around the tibia. Two datasets, consisting of five able-bodied participants (healthy control (HC)) and five transtibial amputees (TTA) with a socket prosthesis, were used. The internal reaction forces and moments were analysed for the affected side during the stance phase of the gait cycle. These normalized forces and moments were expressed in bodyweight (BW) and bodyweight x height (BWH), respectively. Results: The largest forces at the bone-implant interface were measured in the longitudinal direction (-6.92 BW) for the able-bodied model, the lowest in the mediolateral direction (-0.09 BW) for the TTO model. The loading differences were the highest between the able-bodied model and the TTO model with TTA data. Around the antero-posterior axis, the largest moments were found. The able-bodied model measured 0.027 BWH, where the TTO model with HC data found 0.023 BWH and 0.017 BWH for the TTA data. Conclusion: Transtibial amputees have decreased loading at the bone-implant interface compared to able-bodied subjects. The muscles play the most prominent role in comparison with the gait pattern.","Loading; Transtibial; Osseointegration; Gait; OpenSim","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Smallholder farmers cultivate more than 75% of the available agricultural land in Africa and therefore this form of agriculture is crucial to the global food supply. At present, little is known about these smallholder agricultural and related irrigation practices, yet the increasing availability and accessibility of remotely sensed data provides significant opportunities to assess the status quo of these practices. However, these characteristic agricultural landscapes can create complexity in identifying land use with the help of remote sensing. The cultivated plots are small and consist of intercropping systems with dynamic spatio-temporal practices concerning planting, irrigation and harvesting.  This research aims to provide insight into the usefulness of remotely sensed passive Sentinel-2 Level-1C and active Sentinel-1 SAR data for land use classification of these complex landscapes with a focus on irrigated agriculture, using a case study in Central Mozambique. For this purpose, an open source-code is written that uses open-source satellite data from Google Earth Engine to execute the supervised image classification methodology, using confusion matrices as an assessment method.  The results of this research appear to show that a nonparametric RF classifier ( = 88.0%) is preferred over a parametric ML classifier ( = 85.0%) for processing the data that is high in variability, in which classifications based on the chlorophyll sensitive Red Edge and SWIR bands provide the highest overall accuracies (&gt;88.0%). However, the classifier overestimates the amount of irrigated areas by a factor of 1.5 in the first and a factor of 3 in the second irrigation season. The opportunistic sampling method appears to cause inflated accuracy outcomes and an optimistic bias towards classification of the main class in training. Spectral analysis of the temporal behavior of various S-2 bandwidths does not provide insight into the underlying mechanisms on which the algorithm performs classification. Although it appears that irrigated agriculture with S-2 data can be identified on the basis of an increase in vegetation biomass and that the classifier benefits from more information through the use of multiple bands. Research into the use of Sentinel-1 SAR data appears to have potential for identifying irrigation. Time series of the VV backscatter signal show a difference between the irrigation class and the classes non irrigated and light seasonal vegetation in irrigation season 2. However, high standard deviations do reflect the high intra variability of the data, and classification accuracies in this period, do not exceed an overall accuracy of 64.1%. The main confusion as identified by the confusion matrices, comes from classes that are often identified as irrigated, whereas they are not, overestimating the amount of irrigated areas as with the use of S-2 data.The results of this research show that the used method and data collections do not provide accurate information for the intended classification goal. This research demonstrates in several ways the complexity of supervised image classification in complex agricultural landscapes: the unbalanced and variable reference data of different land uses, which often consist of only a few satellite pixels, make it difficult to identify characteristics of land classes, from which the classifier can derive information. In which Sentinel-1 as added and used in this research, offers no additional insights. Therefore, in order to improve the identification of farmer-led irrigated agriculture in Manica, other technologies for smart agriculture can be explored in addition to deploying satellite data, such as citizen science. Further research is recommended on the field of using S-1 and S-2 data for classification of complex agricultural landscapes. This may include more advanced methods of performing image classification and accuracy assessement with imbalance datasets, such as: the use of a weighted confusion matrix for accuracy assessment or exploring the use of spatial-spectral instead of pixelwise random forest algorithms. These algorithms seem to be better at handling spatial dependencies and intrinstic heterogeneity which is characteristic of these complex agricultural landscapes. Lastly, it is strongly recommended to assess the use of speckle filters when using SAR data for small target objects. These filters make use of a buffer zone, consisting of a few pixels in size and about the same size of the target object. The main challenge with be to balance the need of speckle reduction and class specific information preservation.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

In particular, we consider a stochastic version of the parametrically-forced nonlinear Schrödinger equation (PFNLS), which models the effect of linear loss and the compensation thereof by phase-sensitive amplification in pulse propagation through optical fibers. We establish global existence and uniqueness of mild solutions for initial data in L2(R) and H1(R).<br/>The proof is an adaptation of a fixed-point argument employed by de Bouard and Debussche [Comm. Math. Phys., 205:161-181, 1999] for the nonlinear Schrödinger equation with multiplicative noise. The fixed-point argument relies on space-time estimates on the semigroup generated by the linear parametrically-forced Schrödinger operator. We prove these so-called Strichartz estimates, originally proven for the Schrödinger operator, using Fourier methods. A key difference between the Schrödinger operator and its parametrically-forced version is that the latter is not self-adjoint. We overcome this complication by establishing fixed-time estimates on the semigroup and its adjoint, based on their Fourier representations. We also briefly discuss possible future research in the direction of stability of solitary standing wave solutions of the PFNLS equation under the influence of multiplicative noise. Using informal calculations, we demonstrate an approach to track the displacement of a soliton due to small stochastic forcing.","Stochastic partial differential equations; Analysis; Nonlinear Schrödinger equation; PDE","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

There have been many studies exploiting these side-channel leakages, and most of the state-of-the-art attacks have been shown to work on systems implementing AES. The methodology is usually based on exploiting leakages for the outer rounds, i.e., the first and the last round. In some cases, due to partial countermeasures or the nature of the device itself, it might not be possible to attack the outer round leakages. In this case, the attacker has to resort to attacking the inner rounds. This work provides a generalization for inner round side-channel attacks on AES and PRESENT, and experimentally validates the same for AES with non-profiled and profiled attacks. We formulate the computation of the hypothesis values of any byte in the intermediate rounds of both AES and PRESENT. The more inner the round is, the higher is the attack complexity in terms of the number of bits to be guessed for the hypothesis. We discuss the main limitations for obtaining predictions in inner rounds and, in particular, we compare the performance of Correlation Power Analysis (CPA) against deep learning-based profiled side-channel attacks (DL-SCA). We demonstrate that because trained deep learning models require fewer traces in the attack phase, they also have fewer complexity limitations to attack inner AES rounds than non-profiled attacks such as CPA.","Side-Channel Attacks; Deep Learning; AES; PRESENT","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Kim, A. (mentor); Panacho, Swithin (mentor); Jenniskens, Stephan (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In the Netherlands, one of the government bodies solving complex problems is the Netherlands Enterprise Agency (‘Rijksdienst Voor Ondernemers’; RVO). Within RVO, X-lab is developing new ways of working to be better prepared to deal with these complex problems. In short, X-lab is RVO’s internal innovation lab that creates and collects different frameworks, methods and tools to support policy writers when they solve problems. They do this by co-creation, developing frameworks, experimenting and setting up processes. In practice it has been noted by X-lab that innovative ideas are being created with the help of X-lab, but not always successfully carried out in practice. Hence, X-lab is working on improving its methods and processes. A new method they are currently developing is flow design, which is seen as a good fit to solve the present complex problems. However, X-lab encounters problems scaling up the flow design method, therefore it is not practiced by many. I was approached to further investigate this problem. While investigating the problem, I noticed there are several underlying problems within flow design that do not allow flow design to live up to its full potential to deal with complex problems. This is mainly because after a flow design session no clear actions to solve the problem are designed after analysing the problem. Based on this insight, I decided to shift the focus of this research towards these underlying problems. Resulting in the following aim of this research: The aim of this research is to deliver a tangible product that enables X-lab to better deal with complex problems, supported by recommendations that are based on a thorough analysis of X-lab and flow design. Since I am a designer experienced in design thinking, the following research question was drafted: Where and how can design thinking support the trajectory of flow design within X-lab RVO? This thesis follows the structure of the double diamond as presented by the design council (2007). The starting point of this thesis was conducting research into X-lab and flow design. These results are evaluated and then compared to design thinking theories. Based on the outcome of this analysis several experiments were performed to develop the solution. As a final step this solution is validated and iterated. Resulting in two manuals and a decision-making canvas. The discovery phase The first phase of this thesis is the discovery phase. In this phase case studies and interviews are done to develop a theory explaining flow design. Based on this analysis several problems are identified which are arbitrary division, language, time limitation, lack of process and measuring impact. Of these problems lack of process is the most relevant problem and therefore it was selected to solve in this thesis. In this analysis it was concluded that flow design doesn’t live up to its full potential. According to the theories by Tuckmann (1972) and Snowden and Boone (2007), there need to be steps added after a flow design session, so that the group can live up to its full potential and so that complex/complicated problems are solved in the best possible way. Therefore, the question arises whether design thinking is a relevant theory to support in developing these steps and if so, how can it support flow design? The define phase: This question is answered in the second phase of this thesis, the define phase. With the help design thinking models, such as frame creation (Dorst, 2015) and the double diamond (Design council, 2004), the conclusion is made that design thinking is supporting when dealing with complex and complicated problems. Also, based on the design thinking models, two design thinking principles were drafted that can support flow design, which are:<br/>•<br/>To be able to perform next steps while solving a problem, their needs to be clarity in which steps to take and why<br/>•<br/>Secondly, these steps need to be taken using iteration and experimentation<br/>The create phase:<br/>The third phase of this process is the create phase. In this phase the solution is created and developed. To do so several experiments are performed to understand the moment of intervention, the use of frameworks, how to deliver clarity and their current way of experimentation. Based on these experiments a model is developed and tested. The result was a concept model, which had potential, but needed further iteration so that the user knows how to properly apply the model. This was done in the final phase.<br/>The deliver phase:<br/>The final phase of this thesis is the deliver phase. In this phase I have developed two manuals and a decision-making canvas which guides you through the necessary steps to take for solving a complicated or complex problem. These products were validated using a fictive case study. The evaluation pointed out that the product portfolio is succesfull, but where and how did design thinking support the trajectory of flow design? I will explain that based on the theories I have consulted in this thesis.<br/>The support of design thinking:<br/>Based on Tuckmann (1972) and Snowden (2007) and the interviews it can be said that the full potential of the current flow design process is not met. First of all, because in theory the potential is higher when all steps of the two theories are completed, and secondly, because flow design has no tangible outcome and therefore no clear actions to solve the problem are designed after analysing the problem. However, the final goal is to solve the problem, consequently the current flow design process could be improved.<br/>So, flow design doesn’t perform all the steps of Tuckmann’s model of group development and also not of Snowden’s dealing with complex/complicated problems model. The missing steps in flow design are Tuckmann’s norming and performing steps and Snowden’s probe, sense and response steps for complex problems, and Snowden’s sense, analyse and response steps for complicated problems. The product portfolio was designed in such a way that it facilitates that all of Snowden’s and Tuckmann’s steps are performed. Furthermore, the validation showed that the product portfolio indeed delivered clear actions to solve the problem. Since, the product portfolio has been created with the use of design thinking, namely the methods of the double diamond and frame creation are being applied, I conclude design thinking supports the trajectory of flow design.<br/>So, I have presented a product portfolio in this thesis which improves flow design. Furthermore, this product portfolio along with the thorough description I made on flow design itself has been written down in a tangible document that can be transferred to collegues within the organisation. Reflecting on the starting point of this project six months ago, I conclude that the side effect of this thesis is that the resulting product increases the potential scalability of flow design.<br/>Lastly, the validation pointed out that improvements can be made on clarifying what type of problem you are dealing with and on how to use the action model more time efficient.","Design thinking; government; Public sector innovation; experimentation; Complex problems; Complicated problems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(graduation committee); Noori, Negar (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The Dutch transition towards carbon-neutral cities is in full swing and the share of local solar and wind energy is growing rapidly, as well as the electrification of heating, cooling and mobility. Amsterdam is getting the energy transition started and is a forerunner when it comes to developments within the smart energy domain. As a result, multiple smart energy projects are carried out and will be carried out in Amsterdam in order to make Amsterdam a smart energy city. However, it is still unclear in what way these technological developments influence local communities and businesses and how we make sure vulnerable groups are not pushed out, isolated, and marginalized from important urban services, amenities, commercial flows en jobs. This brings us to the concept of inclusion and the need to build inclusive cities. Inclusion exists in many forms but in the smart energy domain mainly ensuring equal rights and equal participation of all citizens including the most vulnerable groups, remains a challenge. Moreover, enabling the disadvantaged and typically low-income people to share in rising prosperity as a result of technology development and eliminating inequities by providing information and financial support, is often not a main concern in smart energy projects which results in smart energy cities being not inclusive. Therefore, the main research question in this thesis is as follows: ""How can inclusion be achieved within the smart energy domain of the city of Amsterdam in order become an inclusive smart energy city?"". This thesis consists of a theoretical chapter in which a theoretical framework is used that aims at mapping the pillars of an inclusive smart energy city. This framework is used in the empirical part of the thesis in order to found out to what extent inclusion is present within smart energy projects in Amsterdam and how inclusion can be achieved. This empirical part of the thesis consists of an embedded case study that involves two smart energy projects in Amsterdam that are chosen as sub-units of analysis. The first sub-unit of analysis is the Local Inclusive Future Energy (LIFE) project and the second sub-unit of analysis is the Lighthouse City Amsterdam Project. Data is collected through documents and interviews. The interviews are conducted as part of qualitative research and analysed using ATLAS.ti. The results of the case study showed that despite the fact that participation and inclusion are often part of smart energy project plans, effectively achieving it remains a challenge. Challenges related to inclusion identified in this research are the gap between technology and society, limitations as a result of regulations, the rise of inequality, and the existence of different perspectives. Nevertheless, these challenges can be faced by using the theoretical framework as a guideline and in this way meet the objectives of an inclusive smart energy city.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

Oily wastewater is produced in many industrial processes such as oil and gas extraction processes, and can take a product, a by-product or a waste stream. In this study, silicon carbide (SiC) membranes were employed to separate oil droplets from O/W emulsion. The effect of ionic strength, pH, surfactant concentration on threshold flux of commercially SiC MF using O/W emulsion stabilized by the sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS) were investigated. The results indicated that the threshold fluxes, determined by both the TMPavg method and fouling rate method, increased with an increase of SDS concentration, but decreased with the salinity when using commercial SiC MF membrane filtering 400 mg/L O/W emulsions. Besides, a higher threshold flux was observed for emulsions with a higher pH. Moreover, the high absolute value of zeta potential of O/W emulsion could alleviate fouling. In the end, we produced SiC UF membrane by depositing SiC layer on the alumina supports by low pressure vapor deposition (LPCVD) due to its low fabrication cost. We investigated the anti-fouling abilities of pristine Al2O3 UF membrane and SiC-UF membrane by using sodium alginate as foulant (SA) solution in multi-stage experiments. When fouling experiments operated with pure SA solution or SA solution with a low calcium ion concentration, SiC UF membrane has a better anti-fouling ability compared with pristine Al2O3 UF membrane due to a lower reversible and irreversible fouling resistance and a slower increase of TMP.","Threshold flux; Ceramic membranes; Silicon carbide membrane; Oil-in-water emulsion; Sodium Alginate; Low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD); Membrane fouling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-08-31","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Universiteit Leiden (degree granting institution)","2021","The building and civil engineering sector is the most polluting sector in the Netherlands. Therefore, there is an increasing need for circular and sustainable products and processes. High demand for raw materials and high environmental pressure of this sector could be reduced by implementing the Circular Economy (CE) principles in the public procurement, which is called circular public procurement (CPP). There are different ways to circular public procurement (CPP), among which is the implementation of new business concepts such as Product-Service System (PSS). An example of a business concept that is relatively new in the Dutch infrastructure sector, is the concept of infrastructure-as-a-service, which is a type of PSS. Even though some of CE principles are incorporated in PSS, PSS does not always lead to higher circularity or environmental improvements. Therefore, in this study, the following research question is answered: Does PSS lead to a higher circularity and lower environmental pressure when implemented in the municipal procuring process of a slow traffic road? The research question was answered by performing semi-structured interviews with the experts from the field, by providing the first comparative LCA of a traditional road and its product-service alternatives, and by calculating and comparing the Material Circularity Indicator (MCI) of each alternative.<br/><br/>The scope of this study considers the upper layer of the road and the following life cycle stages: extraction of raw materials, transport of raw materials, production and transport of road components, use, maintenance, replacement, transport of waste and other released material, recycling and waste treatment. The function studied was the availability of 11,200 m2 of paving brick slow traffic road surface for 40 years’.<br/><br/>Based on the set scenarios, the LCA results showed that product-service alternatives do have significant environmental benefits over the reference system. The product-service scenarios were based on the two environmental strategies that were mentioned in both the interviews and in literature: i) extending the useful lifetime of the product and ii) reducing waste and optimizing end-of-life treatment. Relative to the baseline scenario, the biggest environmental gains and the biggest increase in circularity can be achieved when the currently downcycled material is reused or repurposed instead of recycled. By reusing all residual paving material at the end of its use, the CO2-eq emissions can be reduced by 77%, and circularity can be increased by 8%. The other two assessed improvements of the use and end-of-life phase were the reduction of breaking percentage and the increased utility of concrete components through a material passport. The last initiative led to 3% higher circularity but it did not lead to significant environmental improvements while the reduction of breaking percentage did lead to improved environmental impacts but it did not lead to a change in circularity. When combining all three initiatives, which was done in the product-service++ scenario, CO2-eq emissions can be reduced by 95%, freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity by 98% and stratospheric ozone depletion by 90%, relative to the baseline scenario. In addition, this study identifies the supply of road components that includes extraction of raw materials, production and transport as the hotspot of each alternative, which indicates the importance of material reuse. Furthermore, over the whole life cycle of each alternative, electricity was identified as the biggest contributor to the characterization results due to the high share of fossil fuels in its generation.<br/><br/>Even though the possible product-service scenarios lead to improved environmental performance and circularity, the results from the interviews indicated that the concept of infrastructure-as-a-service is still in its infancy and that several issues need to be addressed before it can be implemented on a large scale. The issues that need to be addressed are the separation of economic and legal ownership by law, additional burden in contract management and contractual risk inclusion. Furthermore, the concept of infrastructure-as-a-service seemed to fit more to infrastructural objects that are located in the countryside because an object in the countryside has less direct connections to other infrastructure meaning the influences from the surroundings are minimized, which poses less risk to the provision of the functional unit. Before the above-mentioned issues are solved, infrastructure-as-a-service is not recommendable. Instead, municipalities as the owner of an infrastructure should take their responsibility to properly reuse paving material.<br","Product-Service System; Product as a Service; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Circular economy (CE); Infrastructure-as-a-service","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

P2P markets give peers the autonomy to make individual decisions and cooperative behaviors between the peers may emerge. However, existing studies on cooperative behaviors in P2P markets focus mostly on the electricity sector, P2P multi-energy markets are rarely studied. In fact, other energy carriers not only constitute a large part of the total energy demand, but their coupling can potentially benefit the system as well as the end-users. In this paper, we propose a P2P multi-energy market mechanism that allows peers to trade both electricity and heat, where the peers can join two predefined trading coalitions. The proposed system model thus explores the integrated effects of the multi-energy coupling and the cooperative behaviors in the P2P market. In order to maximize the net benefits of the peers, price conditions are derived, based on which the peers will join either of the coalitions and determine their trading volumes. Then, the electricity and the heat markets are cleared separately by a market operator. Lastly, the market mechanism is illustrated by a case study on a neighborhood in the Netherlands using realistic data.","Peer-to-peer energy trading; Local energy market; Multi-energy system; Distributed energy resource; Game theory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-12-31","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

This logistical planning problem is manually solved by planners on a daily basis. Within this research it is investigated to what extent reinforcement learning could be applied for solving this planning problem of moving containers in an automated way. A simulation environment was constructed which represents the container planning dynamics. It was made as accurate as reasonably possible with the help of historic data. Three reinforcement learning models, the OnePass, Iterative and Attention model, have been developed and tested for their ability to learn to choose proper orders such that the orders are as much on time as possible. A main challenge in constructing these models was to design them such that they could cope with a varying state and action space. In an experimental evaluation, it was found that the models are able to learn to make better decisions over time and eventually perform similar to the heuristic baseline tested out in terms of total lateness observed. In terms of driven distance and fraction on time orders, the OnePass and Iterative model were able to beat the heuristic choices. Overall, the Iterative model has shown the best performance and is able to learn scenarios as big as real-life scenarios van Berkel Logistics deals with. However, it also tends to be slower than the other models due to its iterative approach.","Reinforcement Learning; Self-organizing logistics; Deep Q-Learning; Attention; Container Transport; Machine Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Observing dust obscured high redshift galaxies is vital to understand the evolution of the early universe and the formation of stars and galaxies. HFLS3 is such a galaxy, and its emission spectrum can be detected at submillimeter wavelengths. With the Deep Spectroscopic High-redshift Mapper 2.0 (DESHIMA 2.0) it is pos- sible to observe these high redshift galaxies at the ASTE telescope in Chile. With the recently developed Time- dependent End-to-end Model for Post-process Optimization (TiEMPO) it is possible to simulate observations of DESHIMA2.0.<br/>With TiEMPO it is possible to simulate different sky positions to accommodate different scenarios of wind direction. However, since TiEMPO is fairly new there are still some problems with the simulation of several of the the possible sky positions. More importantly, the model has to be tested with realistic high-redshift sources that are interesting for observations with DESHIMA 2.0. To predict whether a source can be observed with DESHIMA 2.0 it is necessary to estimate what the signal to noise ratio will be. Parameters like the pre- cipitable water vapor and the observation time determine if a source can be measured.<br/>In this report, a solution is introduced to make it possible to use 6 different sky positions while simulating DESHIMA 2.0 measurements with TiEMPO. This solution is part of the current TiEMPO version, and can be used in future simulations.<br/>With the improved model we simulate an observation of the dusty starburst galaxy HFLS3. The CII line in the emission spectrum is fainter than simulations done so far. A new model to simulate the emission spectrum was made to accommodate for this. With the use of beam switching some of the noise from the atmosphere is removed from the data. The simulation is compared to previously made observations as described in [2]. From the resulting signal we calculate the standard deviation σ to determine the signal to noise ratio (SNR). The values found for σ correspond well with the expected relation between σ and integration time. We say that a emission line is detected if the SNR is greater than 5. The calculated SNR of a 16 hour observation with a pwv value of 1.0 mm is 5.2, which shows that HFLS3 can be detected with DESHIMA 2.0. Two simulations of 8 hours with pwv values of 1.0 and 0.5 mm are compared as well. After 8 hours of observation, the SNR is 3.9 for a pwv value of 1.0 mm and 6.0 for a pwv value of 0.5 mm. With this lower pwv value the galaxy can be detected after 8 hours.<br/>The analysis of this project can be repeated on other sources to make a database for future DESHIMA 2.0 simulations. Hereby it is key to have models which can predict the emission lines of a galaxy accurately.","TiEMPO; Galaxy simulation","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

This layer is key in deciphering the evolution of the Moon and the terrestrial planets, including Earth. It is also a protagonist in the return of humanity to the Moon after its last visit over half a century ago. The main concern for lunar regolith studies is the determination of compactness. Compactness may be expressed as porosity and can be determined by the discrepancy between bulk density estimates from the gravity field and grain density estimates from material composition. New state-of-the-art gravity models of the Moon allow for small-scale gravity studies of regolith porosity, which have resulted in better understanding of the Moon's thermal evolution. However, regional variations in compactness are currently poorly known due to the ambiguous nature of gravity data. Ideally, an additional information source is desired to provide constraints on regolith compaction. It might be that the amount of reflected sunlight from the lunar surface provides additional constraints on regolith compactness. For example, incident light can enter a more porous material deeper, increasing the probability of absorption and decreasing the amount of reflected light. Therefore, this thesis will explore the scattering behaviour of reflected sunlight from the lunar surface as a potential additional information source.","Moon; Gravity; Light Polarisation; Moondust; Compaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The communication between these ICS devices is performed using industrial communication protocols such as Modbus, EtherCAT, etc. With the advancements in the use of the internet, ICS are being enabled to share real-time information over the internet worldwide. While these features make the ICS more accessible for remote supervisory control, they also make them vulnerable to cyber-attacks. This makes it the need of the hour to investigate risks and impacts of cyber attacks on ICS. Generating, injecting and testing cyber attacks on real world ICS, controlling critical infrastructure will involve several financial risks and safety issues. This gives rise to the necessity of an ICS testbed, with the ability to inject and test cyber attacks, in a safe and secure environment. A testbed provides a cheaper alternative for testing impacts of cyber attacks and also offers more flexibility to simulate multiple industrial scenarios. Together, these aspects form the core reasons behind the requirement of an ICS testbed. As the real world ICSs are often costly and specialized for industrial usage, there are not many research laboratories around the world with the availability of a testbed to study cyber attacks. Therefore, this Master of science thesis, through its primary research question, investigates if a cyber-attack testbed can be built in the NERD lab at the Delft University of Technology, which is able to replicate a real-world ICS network to identify and test vulnerabilities of ICSs working on Modbus protocol to cyber-attacks? To answer this question, this report studies the vulnerabilities in ICS working with Modbus protocol. A novel design for an ICS testbed for generating and testing cyber attacks at NERD Lab in TU Delft is presented during this thesis. The proposed testbed utilizes real world ICS components such as PLC and HMI, combined with a plant simulator, which is used for simulating an industrial process. The testbed utilizes a Linux based attack PC to generate and inject various cyber attacks. A virtualization platform connects the attack PC to the ICS network, giving the flexibility of injecting attacks on the testbed, without the attacker being physically present on the plant site. With the use of real world ICS, the testbed therefore allows to replicate a typical ICS scenario in the real world industry. Further, a simulated version of the actual testbed, with open source softwares, mimicking the ICS systems has been developed in this report. This simulated version provides a cheaper and flexible platform to perform initial testing on the working of the testbed and checks the feasibility of the actual testbed. The testbed simulates a plant, controller, and HMI in Matlab/Simulink on different physical PCs, which communicate with the Modbus protocol. An attack PC with a virtualization environment has been used to launch cyber attacks on the simulated testbed, same as that to be used in the proposed testbed at Delft University of Technology. Two main types of cyber attacks namely, Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack have been successfully implemented on this simulated testbed. To conclude this thesis, advanced versions of these attacks have also been developed and their impacts have been analysed.","industrial control systems; Cyber Security; Testbed; Man-In-The_Middle attacks; Denial-of-Service attacks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

The lack of a feasible roadmap to carbon-­neutral air traffic, especially for long-­range flights, using the traditional tube-­and-wing form factor shows that a disruptive technology is necessary to bridge this gap. The Flying V is a newly proposed aircraft configuration which promises to enable a leap in long-­range passenger aircraft efficiency. Integration of passengers and cargo within the wing allows for a design which is more efficient both aerodynamically thanks to the lack of the non-­lifting fuselage, and structurally since the weight is distributed more in line with the lift distribution, reducing the need for long load­-paths. This study aims to evaluate the entire Flying V concept, integrating several disciplines. Building on the lessons learned from previous in­-depth studies into the separate disciplines, a performance model is constructed for the overall aircraft, resulting in an estimate of important characteristics of the complete aircraft, mainly a 31% decrease in mission fuel burn compared to the latest generation of long-­range conventional aircraft with a maximum takeoff weight reduction of 21%. Subsequently, a design optimisation aimed at minimising mission fuel burn is executed using the developed performance model, resulting in an updated design for the Flying V concept achieving a 35% decrease in mission fuel burn with a reduction in maximum takeoff weight of 25% compared to the same conventional aircraft. This optimised design features a narrower but longer cabin as compared to the baseline Flying V, which necessitates a modified cabin layout with 9­abreast seating in a 3­3­3 configuration instead of the 10­abreast 3­4­3 configuration of the baseline. This adjustment distributes the payload over the span to a greater extent, improving the match between the lift and weight distributions. Additionally, the sweep of the inner wing is decreased, with the constraint on both inner and outer wing sweep active. This shows that the wave drag of this configuration on both the inner and the outer wing is an important aspect of this design in terms of impact on the mission performance.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a relatively new concept part of a movement aspiring to create a universal identity layer for the Internet. SSI aims to put the citizen at the centre of their data, making them the sovereign over their digital presence. Wherein the current ecosystem personal information is stored in centralised or federated settings, SSI delegates this responsibility entirely to the user. Functioning SSI schemes have been proposed and deployed, even with governmental support. However, we identify that the key issue that remains to be solved is revocation: the invalidation of credentials. Proposed revocation mechanisms typically rely on centralised infrastructure for revocations, defying the principles of SSI itself and, furthermore, lack offline verification capabilities. This research addresses these issues and proposes the first fully distributed revocation mechanism in SSI, using a gossip-based propagation algorithm. Our revocation mechanism requires no centralised infrastructure or strict network requirements and enables offline verification of credentials in case of disaster. Propagation is handled by honest clients, requires no direct communication with authorities and is shown to be robust in case of unreliable communication links. Furthermore, revocation acceptance is at the discretion of individual clients, making our mechanism fully adhere to the principles of Self-Sovereignty. This revocation and verification structure is part of our Industry-Grade Self-Sovereign Identity (IG-SSI) architecture. IG-SSI is a purely academic fully distributed SSI scheme with intrinsic equality across the network. Furthermore, communication is facilitated peer-to-peer, requiring no specialised infrastructure. The architecture allows for the signing, verification and presentation of credentials using Zero-Knowledge Proofs. We believe that the characteristics of our system provide it with use for decades to come, hence, we deem it to be industry-grade. Our simulation portrays that a network comprised of 10,000 clients gossips 1 million revocations within 25 seconds. Feasibility on smartphones is shown through a government-backed real-life trial. Based on our results, we claim that IG-SSI is a viable candidate for facilitating the needs for a digital identity of the European Union.","Self-Sovereign Identity; Revocation; Digital Identity; Gossip Protocol; Distributed Systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

This large amount of image and video sources combined with more powerful and inexpensive computational capabilities brought by the cloud computing paradigm has facilitated the rapid growth of new machine learning models capable of extracting information faster and more accurately. However, the complexity to develop machine learning models has also grown, involving multiple steps, from the acquisition and preparation of data to the training, evaluation and deployment of models. To alleviate this, the leading database providers have started to integrate the predictive capabilities of machine learning directly into their systems. This new approach is known as in-database machine learning, and it brings new interesting properties such as the exploitation of the inherent relational structure of data or the preservation of its privacy and integrity since the inference occurs directly where the data lives. In this work, we present a cloud-native approach to perform in-database machine learning. We have extended SQLFlow, a bridge between SQL engines and machine learning toolkits to support models trained to solve image recognition tasks over image datasets, which meta-information is persisted on a relational database. Furthermore, we have encapsulated the definition of machine learning models on cloud-native workflows that are able to exploit the GPU resources available in a Kubernetes environment. Our research evaluates the scalability of the proposed system regarding the total execution time and GPU utilization. Besides, we are interested in exploring the design of optimized machine learning query plans, where the goal is to choose the optimal among multiple models that cover a range of specific classes to predict from attending its accuracy and execution cost. For that purpose, we have implemented a model repository containing different model variations and evaluated different strategies to optimize the model selection. Our experiments show that optimizing the model selection will lead to more accurate and faster results, especially when a query covers a high number of classes and the number of models that are able to answer them is limited.","Kubernetes; Machine Learning; Relational Database; Image recognition; Cloud Computing; Workflow Orchestration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

And this multilateral attempt to combat environmental and climate change has its focus perfectly poised to embrace the infinite energy source - solar energy as an alternative. Thin-film photovoltaic technology also referred to as second-generation technology is an alternative family of solar technology in the market which holds rich market prospects such as potential advantages of cost-effective substrates, low transportation-installation costs due to its lightweight property and the possibility of direct integration in building materials. HyET solar is focusing its production on Roll-to-Roll manufacturing of thin films. The utilisation of R2R production with efficient deposition in substrate configuration, and the serial interconnections of cells done during production can bring down the cost of production and contribute to manufacturing flexible solar cells on polymers. The thin-film solar energy technology is looking at a possible re-entry to the market with these advantages. Integrating the micromorph configuration into this technology is challenging. To start we have taken two base models and tried to fabricate tandem samples on the aluminium substrate. These substrates are temporary foils with modulated surface texturing implemented on them for better light utilization. The initial lab-scale samples yielded less than 35%of the total. The lab-scale samples showed highly defective μc-Si :H subcells. An investigation on the layers used in the samples was conducted and it suggested conclusively that the μc-SiOx n layers with low activation energies were the main reason for the very low shunt resistances in the cells. The power of optoelectronic modelling is taken advantage of to improve the performances is done. This study resulted in a model of optimised efficiency of 12.2%. A study on doping of the tunnelling recombination junctions suggested that with poorly doped layers, the objective of TRJ to facilitate tunnelling recombination at the junction is not satisfied and ultimately affect the cell behaviour forming a reverse biased n-p junction. The use of a highly reflective intermediate reflective layer for the tandems is detrimental to the bottom cell performance. But at the same time, a reflective behaviour in the TRJ p-doped layer, when using a p-doped μc-SiOx layer fabricated at 3.2 sccm CO2 flow rate, the reflection is moderate and can be proved beneficial resulting in a thinner top cell. The possibility of modelling to predict the performance, out of standard test conditions suggests a drop in the open-circuit voltage of our cell by 4.9mV per Kelvin increase and a fall in the efficiency by 0.058% per Kelvin. <br/>In summary, the tandem flexible solar cells once overcome the challenges in fabrications, it can facilitate cheap, high-efficiency modules. The simulations on this same structure point towards several potential spaces for the micromorph configuration for improvement within itself and certainly a bright future ahead of us powered by thin-film flexible tandem solar cells.<br","Micromorph; ASA; GenPro; Flexible; tandem; solar cells; Thin film; nano crystalline silicon; amorphous silicon","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-31","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

A Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) was generated to resemble the fracture network in the Lower Cretaceous carbonate reservoir. The DFN modelling approach is using a novel workflow that is based on a geomechanical forward modelling simulation approach. Two 2D seismic lines and well data, including interpreted fractures using Borehole Image (BHI) log, were used to prepare the model inputs. Some results were derived from the fracture data that were also used to prepare the model inputs. In general, the fracture data have fairly constant orientation along the Lower Cretaceous interval. In this study the fractures are assumed to be formed under a single tectonic regime. However, when partitioning the fractures in different stratigraphic formations, a change in the direction of the fractures with depth is observed. This observation could be explained by the variation in rock's stiffness between different stratigraphic formations.<br/>Two techniques were used to model the subsurface fracture network: paleo-tectonic stress inversion and fracture network forward modelling techniques. The modelled DFN resembles the fractures geometry at the well location whereas away from the well the model is constrained by the subsurface fault geometry and far-field tectonic stress. Moreover, the modelled DFN consists of multiple 2 meters thick layers where each layer include a layer-bound fracture network. One of the main limitations of this approach is that it can not consider multiple tectonic regimes to simulate the fracture network. In addition, this approach requires large computational power.","Geothermal Exploration; Natural Fracture Networks; discrete fracture network; Geomechanical Modelling; Geneva Basin; Lower Cretaceous Carbonates","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The world is currently in the middle of an energy crisis, with a growing demand for energy playing catch up with an increasing population. The problem stems from the fact that we rely heavily on fossil fuels to meet our energy needs, and the combustion of these fuels are the primary source of greenhouse gas emissions. An accelerated rate of emissions of greenhouse gases has led and continues to lead to an increase in the average temperature of the planet, stated: Global Warming.<br/>Shifting the balance in our favour requires arresting and lowering our emissions. Direct air capture of Carbon dioxide is one solution that has garnered massive traction in the global scientific community. Zero Emission Fuels is a visionary start-up operating out of Delft that aims to build a micro-plant capable of producing methanol using energy derived from the sun and raw material (CO2and H2O)harnessed from the atmosphere. The heart of their concept is liquid amine-based direct air capture. ZEF has pioneered the continuous process that involves the simultaneous absorption and desorption of CO2and water as the amine circulates from the absorber to the desorption column. The raw material and the energy to drive the process is harnessed from the environment. Thus these inputs remain outside the control of the ZEF system and are treated as external disturbances. This research aims to analyse the impact of the varying environmental conditions, i.e. the ambient temperature, absolute humidity and incident solar radiation, on the performance of the desorption column. Following which a control scheme is developed to ensure the system meets the requirements of ZEF, i.e. production of CO2and water in a 3:1 molar ratio and an energy consumption limit of 450 kJ/mole of CO2desorbed.Firstly, a set of experiments with a trayed stripping column were performed to understand the start-up and shut-down behaviour of the column. Based on the observations, a simplistic model of the reboiler was developed to predict the transient behaviour of the column during start-up. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to gain insights into the parameters influencing start-up time and energy demand. Furthermore, different scenarios to start up a column were identified and based on the results, the batch mode is adopted as the eﬀicient way to start up a column. The model predicts that start-up and shut-down account for less than 10% of the total operating time available. Moreover, start-up accounts for a maximum of 6% of the total available energy for production. <br/>Secondly, a set of single-stage kinetic experiments were performed at different temperatures to understand the limitations of the desorption process inside the column. A vapour-liquid equilibrium based stage-by-stage model of a desorption column integrated with a varying space-time yield based absorber model. Design parameters of the integrated DAC model were tweaked, and a base case was developed, to understand the impact of a varying sorbent composition and PV panel output on the performance of the DAC subsystem. It was clear the open model was not capable of meeting the 3:1top ratio specifications of ZEF. Which prompted the implementation of control structures. Single loop mass-flow control, pressure control and cascade mass flow-temperature control schemes were individually tested with the aid of the integrated DAC model. Finally, based on the performance of the individual control schemes, a final parallel control scheme was developed. Wherein the temperature and the pressure of the system adjusts according to the varying power input and the absolute humidity conditions that impact the top ratio of products. The parallel control scheme was found to be adequate in maintaining the top ratio at desired levels.","Carbon capture; Desorption; Dynamic Analysis; Process control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-30","","","","","",""

Such type of failure may present itself as flexural buckling, which is the sudden change of configuration of one state to another at a critical compressive load. Actual structure characteristics, such as cracks, real joints, sudden changes of flexural stiffness, bracing, and actual boundary conditions, make current analytical buckling methods inefficient. For this reason, most structures are evaluated using Finite Element (FE) software based on the Finite Element Method (FEM). However, such a numerical method may have a high computational cost when parametric studies need to be performed. The motivation for this thesis was to develop an analytical alternative for the buckling analysis of columns and beam-columns. <br/>The thesis analyses jointed Euler-Bernoulli columns and beam-columns with N discontinuities due to step-changes of flexural stiffness, and influence of open edge cracks, real joints, bracing, and actual support conditions. The approach considered utilizes the Heaviside function to obtain a single piecewise expression for the deflection, slope, moment, and shear of columns and beam-columns. The use of the Heaviside function, along with proposed closed-form expressions, reduce the number of unknown integration constants to only four. <br/>Main findings are listed as following: (i) Linear buckling analysis of a column only depends on solving the determinant of the 4x4 matrix of unknown coefficients, obtained by imposing four boundary conditions. (ii) Solving the four unknown constants of integration results in performing a geometrical non-linear static analysis of the beam-column, which perfectly agrees with results obtained through FE software. (iii) Closed-form expressions reduce the number of unknown constants of integrations to only four, regardless of the number of sections composing a column or beam-column.<br/>Concluding remarks and recommendations include: (i) Closed-form expressions accurately provide linear buckling loads for columns and geometrical non-linear expressions for beam-columns. (ii) Equations solved algebraically can be stored and used for future analysis, saving the computation time of rerunning the analysis for specific columns or beam-columns. Having the equations expressed algebraically allows for the ease of performing parametric analysis and exploring the performance of new designs. (iii) Computational cost (time needed for the computer to obtain the results) may depend on the mathematical software used for the calculations. Other software may result in having lower computational time for the same calculations.<br","column buckling; closed-form expression; beam-column buckling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The design goal was to develop a diagnostic device that can be used to measure nocturnal (i.e. nightly) erections. The current device used to measure nocturnal erections was developed in the 1980s. There is a need for a modern tool that can be used in the diagnosis of erectile dysfunction. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is defined as the inability to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient to permit satisfactory sexual intercourse (Shamloul et al. 2013). A study from 2017, for the Rutgers Institute, found that in the Netherlands 9% of men suffer from ED (Seksuele gezondheid in Nederland 2017) Broadly there are two categories of ED, (1) psychogenic and (2) organic, each having their own underlying causes. Currently, there are limited diagnostic tools for patients with ED. These diagnostic tools are unable to provide reliable, or accurate data. In addition, these tools are often uncomfortable for the patient or are invasive. The most common diagnostic tool for ED is obtaining a detailed medical history followed by a sexual health questionnaire. The questionnaire asks a series of questions regarding sexual health and is often paired with a doctor's appointment where the patient will verbally communicate with a urologist regarding their symptoms and complaints. This can be an intimate or sensitive subject to discuss and miscommunications between patients and physicians about specific problems are common. Following the conclusion of the project, I plan to present a device that can measure the number, duration and intensity of nocturnal erections. The device should provide urologists and researchers insight into the physiology during a nocturnal erection. My results show that it is possible to obtain STO2 measurements in the penis using a tissue oximeter in both flaccid and erect penises. The final design includes the tissue oximeter prototype, an ergonomic design for the device and a design for the user interaction.","Tissue Oximetry; Erectile Dysfunction; Medical; NIRS; Monitoring; IPD; Ergonomics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

While renewable energy technologies are effective in cutting CO2 levels, they also bring challenges like variability and unpredictability which affect power system stability. The TradeRES project was founded in order to create and test new innovative electricity market designs that incorporate near 100% renewable energy generation. Multiple research groups across the EU participate in TradeRES, including TU Delft and TNO. In order to be able to research future system stability, this project seeks to improve investment decision-making in the energy models EM-Lab and COMPETES, provided by TU Delft and TNO respectively. To fully utilize the sophistication of both models and to prevent development of a new model, this thesis focuses on the coupling of the models through soft-linking and its validation in a Dutch energy transition context.<br/><br/>This thesis presents a conceptual approach and implementation towards the aforementioned soft-linking. First, the definition and requirements of soft-linking are defined to mitigate ambiguity created by previous work. These requirements are then implemented in a conceptual model describing data exchange, data mapping and timing of the models in the context of soft-linking. The conceptual model describes how the strengths of both models are utilized in the coupling. EM-Lab is an agent-based model used for studying investment behavior and has strong policy and market modules. COMPETES is an optimization model that has a very sophisticated and detailed dispatch module. The nature of these models provide coupling potential and constraints. A series of design choices describe how these models interact in the soft-linking, and how the decision was made to couple specific modules from EM-Lab with COMPETES to improve overall investment decision-making.<br/><br/>The implementation entails the recreation of EM-Lab market modules with Python and the soft-linking of these modules with COMPETES using the software kit SpineToolbox. From EM-Lab, the CO2 market and the capacity market were recreated in Python. These modules could be used to complement COMPETES and improve overall investment decision-making. Pseudo-code of the implemented algorithms is provided and a thorough description of the programmatic interactions of the models is given. Also, the SpineToolbox implementation is shown and elaborated on.<br/><br/>To ensure correctness, the soft-linking is validated and verified. Standard verification methods like face validity and static functional testing are used. For validation, the soft-linking is used to generate results in case studies which have been used to validate COMPETES. These case studies resemble a Dutch energy transition scenario. The results from the soft-linking are then compared to the validated COMPETES results. As the differences in results could all be explained, there is no reason to assume the soft-linking is invalid. <br/><br/>Results of the soft-linking are provided and contain graphs regarding the CO2 market, capacity market, dispatch, and investment and decommissioning decisions. The CO2 market presents volatile and extreme results, begging the question whether the current implementation is sufficient for future power system analysis. However, the results do suggest that the soft-linking has effect on investment and decommissioning decision-making. In conclusion, additional work, like representation of mechanisms that help stabilize the CO2 prices, is required in order to use this soft-linking for future power system analysis. The potentials of soft-linking are explored and suggestions are made for future work.","Soft-Linking; Model Coupling; Agent-Based Modeling; Optimization Modeling; CO2 Market; Capacity Mechanism","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Electrical Power Engineering","",""

It is fundamental for our dignity and privacy. As centralized government has been observed to be limited in addressing complex problems, many developing countries resorted to decentralization. In theory, decentralization can improve the provision of public goods and services, including sanitation. Social and political factors are believed to be the leading cause of limiting the progress in the sanitation sector. Multiple studies have demonstrated the importance of social networks in sanitation governance. We propose to further explore interaction between actors based on key activities in sanitation sectors. We choose Jakarta, Indonesia, as our case study. Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia, is inhabited by 10.56 million people (measured in September 2020). It is estimated that 86% of the population have not received access to properly managed domestic wastewater. The main research question to be answered is “How do the interactions among various actors influence sanitation service provision in Jakarta?”. This thesis explores the influence of multiple key activities to contextualize the current provision of sanitation services in Jakarta, Indonesia. We use the Network of Adjacent Action Situations (NAAS) framework proposed by McGinnis (2011). To identify the action situations, we use the sanitation service delivery function categories used by Mason et al. (2020). The sanitation service systems encompass the provision of related infrastructure, namely sewer network, septic tank, vacuum truck, sewage treatment plant, and fecal sludge treatment plants. Constitutionally, the provision of sanitation services in Indonesia are carried out by provincial and district governments. The provision started to be mandated by minimum public good and service standards in 2014. There is no sanitation law, nor it is integrated with the latest water resource law. Sanitation policies are mainly initiated on the national level. They largely came from four actors: (1) Ministry of Public Works and Housing, (2) Ministry of Health, (3) Ministry of Environment and Forestry, and (4) National Sanitation Working Group which comprise aforementioned ministries and other ministries. These three aforementioned ministries are the most active for sanitation service provision in the national stakeholders. In the subnational government, Jakarta Province, PD PAL Jaya is the technical operator of major sanitation infrastructures in Jakarta. The DKIJ Water Resource Agency is the counterpart of PD PAL Jaya in terms of sanitation service development. The development is additionally influenced by the DKIJ Regional Development Planning Agency, the governor, and the Governor Advisory Team. The DKIJ Environmental Agency is the enforcer of the wastewater standard. This thesis presents seven action situations (AS) constituting the NAAS of Jakarta’s sanitation service intended to describe the current sanitation governance: the National Policy AS, the Jakarta Policy AS, the National Regulation AS, the Jakarta Regulation AS, the National Financing AS, the Jakarta Financing AS, and the Jakarta Production &amp; Provision AS. We found two leverage points where the outcome could cascade over to most other action situations. These are Jakarta Policy AS, which is mostly about planning, and the Jakarta Production &amp; Provision AS which is concerned with implementation.","Sanitation; Public governance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

This is due to the advantages they have over conventional solar cells. The advantages are that they are lightweight, flexible, cheaper and also have better aesthetics than conventional solar cells. Thin-film cells are being processed on a flexible aluminium substrate at HyET Solar which is a Netherlands based company. Their processing technique involves depositing thin-film silicon solar cells on a temporary flexible aluminium substrate. The cells are laminated on a plastic carrier foil and the Al substrate is etched away. HyET solar produces tandem and amorphous single-junction solar cells. For their tandem solar cells, the bottom layer is crystalline. Hence, single-junction crystalline silicon cells are developed at TU Delft to incorporate them into the tandem modules at HyET solar. The crystalline silicon cells deposited at TU Delft are characterized using SEM and raman. The cells deposited at Delft are processed at HyET solar and characterized. Upon characterization, the crystalline fraction and deposition rates increase with an increase in deposition power in the intrinsic layer. The crystalline fraction and deposition rate of a cell does not change by changing the cell thickness of the i-layer. The cell characteristics also change with a change in the silane flow rate in the i-layer. The optimal deposition power with an optimal crystalline fraction was 40W and the corresponding silane flow rate was 3.3 sccm. The deposition rate for a 40W deposition power was 0.41 nm/s. Cells deposited using these parameters were then processed at HyET solar. The cells developed at HyET Solar was shunted. The cause of the shunts was critically analyzed and depositing an amorphous n-layer with a thickness of 80nm seemed to get rid of the shunts. The JV characteristics of the cell were not significant under illumination but the cells displayed diode behaviour when measured in the dark (dark JV). All the deposition parameters except for the deposition time (thickness of deposition) have been optimized for an nc-Si single-junction cell. Further dedicated research on thin-film silicon cells can be performed to improve the electrical characteristics of the cell.","Thin-film silicon solar cells; Aluminum substrate; Single-Junction solar cell; nanocrystalline silicon","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","FlamingoPV project",""

Due to failure of the flood defences along the IJssel, the protected areas will flood and water will flow out of the river. The discharge in the river will decrease and thus the water level at the downstream ends of the river will also decrease. This will have an impact on the required dimensions of the flood defences downstream as the loads will be lowered due to the decrease in water level. The design of the dimensions will change and the costs of the flood defences downstream are lower. In this research, flood simulations are done in the dike-rings along the river IJssel due to overtopping with and without breach formation. The simulations are done in a developed HEC-RAS model and eventually the decrease in water level is generated within the model computations. The tool OKADER is used for the calculations of the required dimensions of the flood defences in 2050 and the associated costs when changes in water level is incorporated. At the end the interest is to quantify the positive effects of system behaviour in terms of differences in required dimensions of the flood defences along the river IJssel and the amount of saved costs.","System behaviour; HEC-RAS; OKADER; Overtopping; Breach; IJssel; Failure; Flood defences","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Two main components of the target are a glass reticle and a stainless steel carrier that are bonded together. These two components need to be precisely aligned w.r.t. each other. Till now, the alignment between the reticle and carrier has been performed manually by relative movement between them created by hand.

The research starts with the formulation of design requirements, followed by concept design, evaluation and selection, and finally a detailed design of the mechanism. A flexure-based alignment mechanism was proposed and designed that uses fine screws for actuation. Various design principles were applied to construct a stiff and compact mechanism that uses a limited number of adjustment steps for the alignment. The process was supported by calculations and analyses that contributed to decision making. Besides, the assembly and alignment procedures of the alignment mechanism were described.

StarDetect, founded in Beijing in 2020, is a startup focusing on small satellite technology, developing functional payloads and providing customised services within the needs of space astronomy or earth geography observation. However, due to the relatively short and immature development of China's small satellite commercial industry, the current satellite service targets is limited, and most of the end-users are government and research institutes. StarDetect's has to reach out to more potential customers and develop new satellite application scenarios. Therefore, the goal of this thesis is to investigate a new commercial market for StarDetect and formulate a strategy for its entry. The thesis employed the double diamond design process to provide structure for the creation process and obtain solutions by using iterative analysis. As the result, a roadmap is designed for StarDetect to enter the Smart Tourism market. In the first horizon, Destination Discovery Service based on mature technology is launched to open new businesses in the market with price penetration, to meet the needs of tourism project developers for quick access to destination information. And a 3D visualization service is available as an add-on value. In the second horizon, the Destination Environmental Monitoring service is introduced for increasing sales, which meet the demands of management organizations for monitoring the sustainability of natural destinations. At the same time, a website providing sustainable travel information to responsible travellers is offered, to develop StarDetect's brand recognition and build connections with potential consumers in preparation for the next horizon's B2C business. Finally, Horizon 3 continue to grow market segments by launching Disaster warning and Safety monitoring services. Meanwhile, StarDetect started to serve consumers directly by providing a one-stop service platform for outdoor adventure to capture new business opportunities.","Roadmap; small satellite; Smart Tourism; Strategy design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

A number of regions are especially vulnerable and prone to experience such a devastating event, and while there are existing initiatives aiming to raise awareness and improve airports’ preparedness, authorities are often isolated in their efforts to become more resilient. This research is an exploration of how data science and novel machine learning algorithms could help in establishing a base for forming collaborations between airports that might face similar challenges when it comes to disaster preparedness efforts. The goal was to build a comprehensive data set describing airports from the perspective of their disaster preparedness and find similarities between them, based on their intrinsic sociotechnical features, so that perhaps an airport in Indonesia could be matched with its ’sibling’ airport in the Caribbeans.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","With the advent of a smart society and an era of connectivity, there remain a numerous amount of challenges yet to be solved. One of the key IoT innovations analysed in this research is known as Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). UAS, or drone technologies, allow carrying out repetitive and dangerous tasks with almost no human intervention or supervision (Fernández-Caramés, Blanco-Novoa, Froiz-Míguez &amp; Fraga-Lamas, 2019). The advent of drone utilisation in both public and civil domains has led to application areas such as realtimemonitoring and surveillance, parcel delivery, search and rescue missions (e.g. ER), remote sensing in agriculture and multiple other application domains (Valavanis &amp; Vachtsevanos, 2015). However, the fast pacing development of interconnected devices and systems has outrun the human understanding and experience of usage, imposing challenges with regards to technical security, trust and of course privacy (Coetzee &amp; Eksteen, 2011). Subsequently, most drones are limited to computing, storing and sharing data, making them vulnerable to adversarialattacks. A need for a more responsible adoption of drone-use exists and must be fulfilled with care. To this, a blockchain-based solution is proposed.The focus of this research is on a Dutch independent agency part of the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality, called the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA). They have been actively using drones since 2017 and their main tasks consist of supervision, risk assessment and risk communication with the goal to protect the human and animal welfare (NVWA,n.d.). An explorative research approach was taken whereby the current bottlenecks experienced by the NVWA were identified and visualised, by means of desk research and semi-structured interviews. Subsequently, the sociotechnical effects of the use of drone detecting services by the NVWA were identified to obtain the key values for a responsible redesign. In this way, the role of the values, an understanding of the roles of institutions realizing these values, and the stakeholder engagement is understood. After identifying the open issues and conflicting values, a redesign phase began with the trade off between three mitigating security techniques.Blockchain technology is found to be the most suitable security technique in this research and fills in the ’lack of transparency’ gap which is crucial for a responsible redesign. Although it hasn’t reached full maturity and could induce undesired delays, it increases the security level of the organisation significantlyand takes into account the key values security and privacy. Moreover, the data managing method allows users to validate, maintain and synchronize the content of a transaction ledger which is replicated across the other users in the network (Tapscott &amp; Tapscott, 2017).The solution has proven to work in existing literature and automotive contexts and is therefore generalisable in multiple on-going projects of the NVWA. Subsequently, the novel data managing method could be used as for revenue models such as digitised inspections. This indicates future growth options andpotential competitive advantages. All in all, the benefits outweigh the uncertainties of this technologyand it is believed that a blockchain based solution will be the next big step to achieve more responsible implementation of drones.","Drones; IoT Management; Blockchain Technology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(mentor); Enserink, B. (graduation committee); Itten, A.V. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Onshore wind farms play an important role in realizing the 2030 climate targets. According to the Climate Agreement, onshore energy production should be increased to 35 TWh by 2030. This means that up to 600 additional wind turbines should be developed, which is a challenging task. The development of onshore wind farms often meets the resistance of local residents. This opposition can, inter alia, result in project delays or cancellations. Citizen participation is a widely discussed manner to prevent and deal with local opposition. In this thesis, exploratory qualitative analysis is conducted to address the following research question: How does citizen participation influence decision-making processes of four selected Dutch onshore wind farms? The present research focuses on the interaction between the most important actors within the participation process: local residents, the government, and the wind farm initiators. A multiple-case study is conducted to analyse the decision-making processes and to answer the main research question. Four Dutch cases are analysed; Jaap Rodenburg II, Nij Hiddum-Houw, Windplanblauw and Wind Farm Moerdijk. First, each case was studied separately by conducting four within case studies. Afterwards, the analyses have been compared in a cross-case study. The theoretical framework, Teisman's Rounds Model and Contextual Interaction Theory (CIT), were used to code qualitative data in a thematic analysis. The data is collected by conducting semi-structured interviews conducted and studying policy documents. This way, citizen participation, decision-making processes, and the actors' roles could be described meticulously. The findings of the analyses are presented in the Rounds Model and the CIT. The Rounds Model is used to graphically represent the decision-making processes and the role of the actors. Since the Rounds Model pays little attention to contextual factors and governance levels affecting the decision-making process, the CIT contributes to the Rounds Model. As mentioned before, the CIT and the Rounds Model functioned as a theoretical framework to conduct the cross-case study. The Rounds model facilitated a comparison of the four participation and decision-making processes. The rounds model has provided information about the interrelation of the decisions made, the relation between actors, the intensity of the participation rounds and the most influential moments at a glance. The CIT is used to study the most important participation rounds more in-depth and provided information about governance and other contextual factors influencing those events. The combination of the two models led to a broad understanding of the decision-making processes and an in-depth insight into the factors of influence. The analyses have shown that citizen participation is used to equally distribute benefits and burdens of winds farms, reduce nuisance, convince the responsible authority that the interests of local residents are considered, improve the wind farm design, and reduce local opposition. Multiple forms of citizen participation are found in the decision-making processes: wind farm cooperatives and associations, options for financial investment, community funds, design workshops, surveys about the wind farm layout, working groups and advisory boards. In all of the cases studies, local opposition led to a more intensive citizen participation process. The different forms of participation, as described above, have led to the re-location of wind turbines, a reduction of the turbine height, additional nuisance reducing measures, additional financial benefits and once even to a totally new wind farm layout. Several factors were discerned to stimulate the decision-making process. Especially co-ownership, representativeness of the participating local residents and early engagement have improved the citizen participation process. Additionally, a stringent policy and an independent party to advise local residents during the participation process can facilitate efficient decision-making. Therefore, it is recommended to 1) the initiators and the responsible authority to immediately start the citizen participation process, 2) actively invite local residents of all surrounding districts to the participation process, 3) provide local residents with an option for co-ownership, 4) the municipalities and provinces to define clear participation in policy documents on before, and 5) to ensure local residents have an independent advisor during the participation process. Lastly, several subjects for further research are identified. First of all, it would be interesting to combine or compare the findings of the four cases with findings from other studies developed by different parties. Here, additional knowledge can be collected that can be used to investigate potential influencing factors further as identified here; the influence of the responsible authority and the room for negotiation. Above all, it should be studied how to ensure a representation of local residents and how to interest local residents to participate in an early stage. And, how will participation influence the decision-making process in the new situation: where the Climate Agreement, the RES and the new Environment and Planning Act are guiding.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

The product produced by Thrivey is an automatic tracking application (mobility tracker), also named Thrivey, that can track the movement of the user when they carry their smartphone with them. Furthermore, the future vision of Thrivey is to expand its user group and promote more sustainable mobility activities.Global warming and climate-changing are topics that raise many concerns at all levels in society. Many aspects result in the extreme condition we are facing now. Among them, mobility contributes to significant pollution on the air quality due to the emission of carbon dioxide and other substances, such as SO2. During the COVID-19 pandemic, people’s mobility activities have been reduced significantly. However, how people will travel after the pandemic ends is still unknown. Therefore, it creates an opportunity for this project to investigate how to support people toward more sustainable mobility decisions during and after the pandemic.The main objective of this project is to use self-tracking travel data to support people toward more sustainable mobility decisions.A series of literature research and qualitative user research was carried out. Through the research, the design goal and the final design direction were refined. The design also went through iterations, inspired by insights gathered from user-involved sessions. The final design presented four features that support users toward sustainable mobility decisions. These four features are: personalized advice &amp; indicating restrictions (see chapter 5.3.1), community (see chapter 5.3.2), challenges (see chapter 5.3.3), and informed infographics (see chapter 5.3.4). Through the final design evaluation, the four features were evaluated. The community (with group challenges) feature was found out to be the most motivating feature that can keep the users engaged with the mobility tracking application and hold on to their sustainable mobility goals. Moreover, personalized advice was found out to be the most supportive feature that enables and guides users to travel more sustainably. Additionally, the “indicating restrictions” feature provides a feeling of being understood by the mobility tracker.Furthermore, the informed infographic provides users with insights about their travel behaviour they usually do not aware of. By showing how much restriction the users were facing and what keeps them from travelling more sustainably, users were given a new perspective into their travel behaviour. As a result, this supports, motivates and inspires them to make sustainable mobility decisions.","sustainable mobility; self-tracking data; personal informatics; Sustainability; Mobility; mobility tracker","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

We investigate the recoverability of network controllability under link-based perturbations and node-based perturbations.

For node-based perturbations, we also investigate two recovery scenarios: (1) only the nodes and their original links that are removed in the failure process are recovered; (2) the nodes are removed during the failure process are recovered, and the same number of removed links are added at random.

NSAs are increasingly joining climate agreements such as the Science-Based Targets initiatives (SBTi).. SBTi have the potential to decrease CO2 by 2.7 GtCO2e per year, in case at least 2000 companies join.

We use the Institutional Network analysis (INA) approach that builds on the Institutional grammar.

In the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh, the camps were locked down for months. As a result, economic dependencies between the refugees and host communities which were built in previous decades were cut-off for months. So far, no research has been published on how to release the burden of limited refugee-host interactions, which can be a vital source of livelihood generation. In this research, the implementation of different vaccine allocation strategies were analysed and compared, to analyse what prioritization strategy can best be introduced to most effectively revive these interactions and control the COVID-19 outbreak. Results show that either prioritizing elderly or high-risk transmission groups can be effective. Prioritizing elderly distinguishes itself as it most effectively reduces severely &amp; critically symptomatic infections. Prioritizing transmission-groups shows maximize refugee-host interactions. When combining both strategies with a dynamic approach of opening/closing the camp from host communities, a more effective strategy is possible for protecting the vital economic functions of an open-system refugee camp. An implication of this research is reflected by the granularity of the model. As the model has a high resolution and is highly computational, insufficient model experiments could be conducted to cover a complete solution space of the model. However, as this research proposes unique study in the dynamics between vaccine allocation and open-system refugee camp, a foundation is grounded for further research.","Refugee camps; Rohingya refugees; COVID-19; vaccine allocation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

This results in rejection of the prosthesis or overuse injuries due to compensatory movements. The comfort and functionality should be improved by reducing weight and increasing the degrees of freedom. The wrist is an important joint for increasing the mobility. And for reducing the weight, another actuation method than the most available and heavy electrically driven device should be used. Methods: This study designs a hydraulic curved cylinder for the application of a wrist joint. Because of the complex and curved shape the manufacturing method used is 3D printing. The functionality of three 3D printing methods (FDM, MJF and SLA) and three sealing techniques (O-ring, X-ring, and Conus) will be evaluated by testing the amount of friction and leakage to find which configuration performs best and whether it results in an efficient actuator. Results: The SLA-cylinders and the Conus allowed the least leakage. The combination of these two even resulted in zero leakage. For friction the SLA and FDM-cylinders performed equally, only the MJF-cylinder caused more friction. The SLAcylinder is the only cylinder that can hold a constant pressure without leakage for 5 out of 8 pistons, when a 4 kg weight is attached. Finally, only piston-cylinder combinations with piston O-25 or Cylinder X.MJF do not match the requirements for the maximum allowed leakage and adjustment torque. Conclusions: The piston-cylinder combination of SLA-parts and Conus perform the best. For the application of a wrist joint in prostheses more research needed for the repeatability, scalability and long-term performance.","prosthetic wrist; 3D printing; hydraulic cylinder","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering | BioMechatronics","",""

Intracellular recordings with nanoelectrodes that penetrate the cell allow better signal quality and additional functions such as voltage clamping to set the neuron's transmembrane voltage. The voltage clamp aims to facilitate the independent study of the ionic channel contributions to the overall neuron's transmembrane current for applications such as drug screening. This thesis aims to design a voltage clamp with CMOS technology to integrate into an intracellular neural interface system. The circuit, a trans-impedance amplifier, needs to be low-noise, small, and have wide clamping and output voltage ranges. The amplifier's design follows a structured methodology and uses symbolic analysis with the software SLiCAP and simplified EKV models aiming for easier readjustments and transparency for other researchers. The controller is an Operational Amplifier with a differential pair input-stage, an unbalanced common-source output-stage, and frequency compensation. The feedback network is a pseudo-resistor due to the enormous gains required to record the currents in the electrode of about 100 pA - 1 nA. The final simulations estimate a trans-impedance gain from the electrode to the load range of [2 M,1 G] V/A, a clamping voltage range of [0.90, 3.16] V, an output voltage range of [0.50, 3.16] V, and an output-referred noise between 0.095 and 0.41 mV<sub>rms</sub> depending on the gain. The power usage is 49.1 uW/pixel and the area 0.0092 mm<sup>2</sup>/pixel.

Both approach the problem that camera inputs, attached to the head segment, are disturbed due to the participation of the head in the locomotion gait of the robot. Head stabilization is designed to stabilize the head segment itself, and head-led target tracking is designed to stabilize the target in the field of view of the cameras. The head stabilization and head-led target tracking designs are build upon the Ijspeert model. The Ijspeert model is an biologically inspired oscillator-based central pattern generator, capable of producing locomotion signals to achieve a lateral undulation gait. Analysis of this Ijspeert model is done by rewriting the model as a network of Kuramoto oscillators. This analysis concludes with a proof for the convergence of the phase differences of the Ijspeert oscillators. Although methods that mitigate the head stabilization problem for robotic lampreys have been designed before, the head stabilization method in this thesis approaches the head stabilization problem as a control problem for the fist time, to the best of our knowledge. The head stabilization method is designed to align the head segment with the average body direction, by providing head stabilizing parameters to the Ijspeert model. Perfect head stabilization is achieved, under the assumption that the motor dynamics are instant. Even though head stabilization is not perfectly achieved in reality with non-instant motor dynamics, we have verified that the head stabilized Ijspeert model is an improvement in terms of head stability, compared to the Ijspeert model without head stabilization. The designed head stabilization method is applied to a novel head-led target tracking design. This method combines a forward locomotion gait with a turning controller to perform target tracking, and is designed to increase the accuracy of visual information by directing the head segment towards the target. The head-led target tracking design is verified by placing the robotic lamprey in a virtual fluid environment with a target, which showed that the target is reached by the robot. Furthermore, the head-led target tracking design is compared to a design from the literature that does not direct the head segment towards the target. The head-led target tracking design shows improvements to the design from the literature in terms of the used performance measures.","thesis; msc; lamprey; CPG; control; target tracking; visually guided; oscillator; robot; stabilization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The absence of medicines to cure COVID-19 calls for preventive strategies, including mask-wearing. Despite its protection against exposure to coronavirus, not everyone chooses to wear a mask. Some studies addressed mask-wearing behaviour from the standpoint of behavioural economics, one being the effect of herding behaviour. This occurs when people base their decision on the decisions of others. A literature review shows that herding can play a role, yet it has only been empirically studied up to a correlational relationship and not a causal relationship. This study focuses on quantifying the effect of factors that influence mask-wearing, emphasising herding. This study can be used in a more realistic epidemic transmission study that involves preventive health behaviours and can also help policymakers simulate the impacts of their policy designs more accurately. The study comprises two phases: choice and agent-based modelling. A literature review is performed to identify possible factors. Four possible factors are identified: Health Belief Model (HBM), herding-related, situational cues, and demographics. After collecting 151 questionnaire respondents within the Netherlands, a Latent Class Cluster Analysis identifies two clusters representing health beliefs. Class 1 are people who are more risk-averse towards COVID-19 and believe more in mask-wearing efficacy. Class 2 is the opposite. The choice modelling confirms a statistically significant effect of herding, only within friends and/or family and the random people. To explore the macro-level population dynamics, the interdependent behaviour between people is considered. An agent-based model (ABM) has been formalised, implemented, verified, and validated. The main insight is that the herding effect is stronger when the majority is not wearing masks than when the majority is wearing masks. In other words, there is a tendency towards no-mask-wearing, instead of the opposite. These discoveries unveils a new insight on how herding affects mask-wearing using an under-explored way of combining static and dynamic research methods. This study has several limitations. First, the risk of low-quality responses from online survey is uncertain. Second, care should be taken in generalising the result to the Netherlands population. Third, the literature review may miss important factors that were undiscovered in the previous literature up to April 2021. Fourth, this study generalises the factors in a broad categorisation. Finally, the ABM employs simplified input values. Future studies may also incorporate interviews, a more representative sampling method, and a more fine-grained specification of factors. Finally, five recommendations are derived for the policy-making process. First, this study recommends policy-makers maintain clarity in communicating mask-wearing policy. Second, enforcement of mandatory policy is recommended, especially in outdoor spaces. Third, mask-wearing can be encouraged through social campaigns, if necessary. Such campaigns may contain figures that people can closely relate to. Another alternative is to increase the importance of policy by putting signs in more prominent places and informing people about the enforcement. Fourth, the modellers in the policy-making domain could look at incorporating herding to such research and enrich its realism. Lastly, this study can also be utilised for other policy-making processes outside the mask-wearing context and/or outside the COVID-19 context.","Mask-wearing; Herding behaviour; COVID-19; Choice modelling; Agent-based modelling; Latent Class Cluster Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Unlike asynchronous handshake circuits or synchronous circuits, this design style does not require any feedback control blocks, which can increase latency, or any clock recovery circuits, which can increase energy consumption and overhead. In addition, the serial link design strategy can reduce resource consumption and the complexity of wire and pins to facilitate placement and routing. In this dissertation, a self-timed asynchronous circuit is used, which necessitates the usage of the pulse logic family. The link also includes the two-wire burst mode protocol. The time notion is included in the zero-line and one-line of the link, and the timing information is included in the transmitted pulse signal without the use of a clock. <br/><br/>The overall design process follows a hierarchical structure. Firstly, to achieve the logic function, the link is designed at the behavior level with VHDL code. The serializer and deserializer functions should therefore be performed at the transistor level. They are based on the pulse-logic library, which should be built initially. The transistors utilized in the design are all HVT transistors, which reduce current leakage and power consumption. The final step is to do timing characterization and optimization to ensure that the design works properly under various conditions. The entire point-to-point link can be built by using 28nm technology and can function at 5Gb/s with a power consumption of 0.5mW.","AER; Asynchronous link; pulse-mode","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-02","","","","Electrical Engineering | Circuits and Systems","",""

Digitally restrictive regimes occasionally still allow access to blockchain applications such as cryptocurrencies, albeit in limited form. Blockchains often enjoy a global nature, but traditional and well established cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin often do not have high performance. Second layer solutions, also known as off-chain solutions, offer a network of payment channels where transactions can be completed in peer-to-peer fashion with little interaction with the slow blockchain. In this thesis we investigate how Bitcoin's off-chain solution, the Lightning Network, can be employed to circumvent digital censorship. We introduce Periscope, a protocol that allows for tunneling of internet traffic between two hosts over a stream of micro-transactions embedded with data. Next, we thoroughly analyse its security and the network's suitability from a theoretical perspective. Following this, an empirical evaluation study is done to get an understanding of the performance of the protocol under various circumstances.

Due to this reason, 5G systems should employ capacity­-oriented base station antenna arrays and beamforming techniques. In this regard, multibeam antenna systems have gained immense attention. Currently, there is a missing link between antenna engineering and communication system design. Traditionally, antenna array design focused on optimizing free space propagation parameters like gain, directivity, sidelobe levels, etc. However, in order to achieve maximum network capacity, antenna array and beamforming techniques should consider a realistic system model and propagation environment. In this thesis work, we bridge the gap between antenna engineering and communication system design by proposing a multi­user communication system model that considers channel modeling, modulation, and RF aspects. Further, we use this model to assess the user performance in terms of Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) and Bit Error Rate (BER) for various base station antenna configurations and user positions. The results obtained showed that using an irregular antenna array at the base station with 64 elements shows an improvement in the performance of the users. With the presented simulation results, the system engineers can design efficient antenna arrays at the base station to achieve good performance on the millimeter wave frequency bands.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They are extensively used in every industry because of their robust construction, easy operation, controllable and adaptable features. Therefore, occurrence of faults in these machines are a major concern. The protection schemes implemented in a network plays an important role in the safe operation of the machine. The key component of common protection schemes is a relay that senses abnormalities in the network and separates the faulty section from the healthy network. Large faults such as phase faults, phase-to-phase faults are easily detected as they impact the whole network. However, commonly occurring faults such as stator winding faults, bearing faults, etc. are difficult to detect using the standardised protection schemes. Stator winding faults create localised heating that can rapidly incite phase faults. Thus, additional protection schemes are required to detect them in time.

In this thesis, a set of criteria to assess the resilience of the electricity grid is defined. Then the electricity grid sectors of Harris County, Texas are assessed by applying the developed and operationalized resilience criteria. This is done to understand the current resilience conditions of electricity grid sectors. The criteria are applied for assessment purposes by using the MultiAttribute Value Theory (MAVT) method of MultiCriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA). The results of this method are displayed using a series of maps. Results from the electricity grid sectors’ assessment provide an understanding of the resilience of a city’s electricity grid sectors, highlighting which low scoring sectors need more attention.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Modelling of power transformers to predict and examine its performance in the presence of Geomagnetic Induced Currents (GICs) is of particular interest in research since these currents that are quasi-DC in nature drive the transformer into half-cycle saturation. During the half-cycle saturation, the increased leakage flux and harmonics have undesirable effects on the windings and the structural components of the transformer, which can possibly lead to their permanent damage. This prompts the need to perform a precautionary study of the transformer validating its robustness when subject to GICs. This thesis proposes a method to model the transformer and its electromagnetic (EM) behaviour under GICs that combines the accuracy of Finite Element Modelling (FEM) with the speed of Magnetic Equivalent Modelling (MEM) to produce a fast-computing yet detailed modelling method using simulation tools, COMSOL and MATLAB Simulink, respectively. The transformer under study in this thesis is a single-phase 280MVA, 500/230kV auto transformer designed by Royal Smit Transformers. It was first modelled using FEM in COMSOL, providing details of the equivalent 2D axisymmetric geometry of the core and the windings and the material properties to each component. The model was then computed and validated against factory measurements done by Royal SMIT for the transformer when not subjected to GICs. After which, the model was run for the condition in which the transformer is subject to a GIC. The main problem of failure of the model to converge before reaching steady-state condition under GIC was overcome after optimizing the solver settings of the FEM software. The difference in the EM behaviour of the transformer with and without GIC were studied. After ensuring that the FEM model was robust and accurately represents the transformer under GIC as well, the time-consuming part of computing the FEM model till it reached steady-state under GIC was then made to be taken care of by a MEM model developed in Simulink. Induced flux versus magnetizing current characteristics of the transformer were obtained from the FEM model, and fed to the MEM model, which only took a few seconds to run. The magnetizing current waveform obtained for a few cycles after reaching steady-state under GIC was then transferred to the FEM model, which could finally compute - for those values of magnetizing current - the detailed EM effects of GICs on the transformer, spatially. An important EM study needing the spatial distribution of the EM properties within the transformer is the calculation of eddy current losses in the windings. In this thesis, a method that only considers the envelope of the set of windings as opposed to modelling every strand to calculate their losses is developed using an analytical formula found in literature. This is validated against the losses calculated by Royal SMIT as well as the FEM software for a detailed model of the windings. The timesaving method to study the EM behaviour of transformers subject to GIC proposed in this thesis accurately models the transformer in the saturation region that should enable conducting EM studies furthermore to winding loss calculation with ease.","geomagnetically induced currents; power transformers; numerical modelling; finite element modelling; magnetic equivalent modelling; electromagnetic modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-12-31","","","","Electrical Engineering | Electrical Power Engineering","",""

However, quantum processors with thousands to millions of quantum bits (qubits) are needed. Room-temperature electronics are used to control and readout today's qubits operating at cryogenic temperature. As the number of wires that can be placed between room temperature and the cryogenic chamber is limited, this creates a bottleneck in the scaling of quantum computers. Cryogenic CMOS (cryo-CMOS) electronics has been proposed to overcome this bottleneck. Operating the control electronics at cryogenic temperature, very close to the qubit, and controlling and reading out the qubits by frequency multiplexing relaxes the interconnect bottleneck. This work tackles this challenge by focusing on the qubit readout system and more specifically on the spin-qubit readout. The main target is to develop a cryo-CMOS analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for such an application. <br/>The readout of frequency multiplexed spin-qubits using RF reflectometry is considered the target application. The non-idealities of the RF-reflectometry scheme are simulated and analyzed for the qubit multiplexing and included in the system-level modeling of the readout chain. The target design specifications of the ADC are derived from such system-level simulations, resulting in the need for a 1 GSa/s ADC with ENOB &gt; 6 bits operating at 4 K for the readout ~20 frequency-multiplexed spin-qubits with a BER of 1e-03.<br/>Based on those specifications, this work proposes a 2-channel time-interleaved ADC using a Loop-Unrolled Successive Approximation Register (LU-SAR) ADC. The loop unrolling technique in combination with time-interleaving achieves the sampling rate of 1.1 GSa/s. The design includes the integration of a dynamic amplifier as an input driver and the generation of all required timing for the ADC core and the dynamic amplifier. Foreground calibration of the SAR comparator offset is included to achieve the linearity specifications. The ADC has been designed in TSMC 40nm CMOS technology and taped out for fabrication. After  calibration of comparator offset and calibration of the delay/gain mismatch between the two time-interleaved channels, the simulated performance of the ADC demonstrates an ENOB of 6.35 bits, SNDR of 40 dB, SFDR &gt;50 dBc. The Figure-of-Merit of the designed ADC is 25.2 fJ/conv at 1 GSa/s sampling rate (including the driving amplifier and the clocking circuitry), which is significantly higher than the prior cryogenic ADCs and on-par with room-temperature state-of-the-art ADCs. The proposed ADC contributes towards the realization of future large-scale quantum computers, comprising million-qubit quantum processors integrated with cryogenic CMOS interface electronics.","Quantum Computing; Cryogenic electronics; Analog-to-Digital converters; Time-interleaved Loop-Unrolled SAR; Cryo-CMOS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-12-31","","","","Electrical Engineering | Microelectronics","",""

Data-driven turbulence modelling methods aim to derive novel turbulence models with lower uncertainties, which generalize well to a certain class of flows. These state-of-the-art constitutes to first derive model-form corrections of a selected baseline model from high fidelity reference data, followed by regressing the corrections in terms of RANS-known flow features. For data-driven wind turbine wake modelling, industrial-scale wind turbines and non-neutral atmospheric boundary layers have yet to be considered. In this thesis, the first steps are made to address this research gap. First, Large-Eddy Simulation data is generated and validated against literature. The considered cases are under neutral, convective and stable atmospheric conditions. The frozen-RANS methodology, a technique used to derive turbulence model corrections given the high fidelity data, is then extended to for non-neutral conditions. The new framework now provides corrections to both the Boussinesq eddy viscosity hypothesis for the Reynolds stress and the gradient-diffusion hypothesis for the turbulent heat flux. By injecting the obtained corrections into dynamic RANS simulation, the baseline turbulence model deficiencies are corrected. In particular, high rate-of-strain regions now no longer show an overproduction of mechanical turbulence. Similarly, the lack of buoyant turbulence production in the free-stream atmosphere under convective conditions is solved. In the stable case, buoyant destruction is too large in the free-stream but not large enough in the wake. For the neutral and stable case, the corrected models produce wake velocity profiles that show excellent agreement with the large-eddy simulation reference data. Issues in the wall stress solution of the convective large-eddy simulation propagate to issues in the corrected RANS solutions, proving the necessity of high-quality data. Furthermore, it is shown that for most cases a single scalar correction to the turbulent heat flux, as opposed to the full vector correction, is sufficient for improving the error introduced by the gradient-diffusion hypothesis. This result is considerable since the simpler correction would be much easier to regress in terms of mean RANS-known quantities. The computational cost of the corrected RANS models is around the same as that of baseline RANS models; only 2\%-5\% of the large-eddy simulation computational cost.","Turbulence; Turbulence modeling; Aerodynamic; wind energy; CFD; large eddy simulation; RANS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","",""

Without a metal grid at the front side, the metal shading loss is eliminated. However, the fabrication process of an IBC cell is much more complicated than that of a FBC cell. Within the PVMD group, two poly-Si carrier-selective passivating contacts (CSPCs) IBC cell fabrication methods were developed, namely Self-aligned and Etch-back method. These two methods require respectively to pattern the IBC rear side twice and three times to define the emitter and BSF area. In this project, a novel poly-Si/SHJ hybrid IBC solar cell design using tunneling recombination junction (TRJ) is proposed, which only requires one pattern step to define the emitter and BSF area, thus, significantly simplifies the flowcharts of IBC cells.<br/>The main objective of this thesis is to demonstrate the novel poly-Si/SHJ hybrid TRJ IBC cell concept by fabricating such high-efficiency hybrid IBC cells. With the proposed hybrid IBC cell design, the BSF layers are deposited on the full rear side after the emitter patterning. Thus, a TRJ is introduced at the emitter ((p+)poly-Si). The carrier tunneling efficiency across the TRJ layers should be guaranteed. The BSF layers passivation quality is also crucial for hybrid IBC cell performance, and the shunting due to the full area deposited BSF layers should be limited as well.<br/>The TRJ proof-of-concept was firstly demonstrated in FBC cells due to their easier fabrication processes. And different materials combinations of (i)a-Si:H, (n)a-Si:H and (n)nc-Si:H were used to form TRJ with (p+)poly-SiOx. Firstly, it was found that the existence of (i)a-Si:H is detrimental to the device performance, especially for the cell FF. Secondly, for cells without (i)a-Si:H layer, the cell performance was improved by replacing (n)a-Si:H with more conductive and low activation energy (n)nc-Si:H layer. At last, the TRJ with dual-n-layer, (p+)poly-SiOx/(n)a-Si:H/(n)nc-Si:H, was found to be most promising. And the cell FF decreases with (n)a-Si:H layer thickness. However, instead of only depositing (n)nc-Si:H, the (n)a-Si:H was kept for its better passivation ability than (n)nc-Si:H, as it is directly deposited on the c-Si surface at BSF in hybrid IBC cells.<br/>Then the hybrid design with dual-n-layer was demonstrated and optimized regarding the passivation quality, TRJ efficiency and the Rshunt in IBC cells. We firstly demonstrated that poly-Si delivers better performance than poly-SiOx due to its lower resistivity. With 18 nm(at textured BSF)(n)n-Si:H, the (n)a-Si:H layer thickness optimizes at 3 nm in poly-Si/SHJ hybrid cells. The pitch width was also found to have an influence on cell external parameters as the number of fingers decreases with pitch width. The cell FF increases and the Jsc decreases with pitch widening. The best cell obtained in this project has 3/18 nm (n)a-Si:H/(n)nc-Si:H and a medium pitch width (650 μm). It has a Voc of 665 mV, a Jsc of 39.36 mA/cm2, a FF of 74.33% and an efficiency of 19.45%.","Hybrid IBC Solar cell; Tunnel recombination junction; carrier-selective passivating contacts; SHJ solar cells","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Turbidity currents are highly erosive and can be damaging to structures on the sea bottom such as telecommunication cables. Understanding the mechanisms of sediment transport and deposition is required to predict the erosive powers of turbidity currents (and of the distribution of turbidite deposits) which are fully dependent on the behavior of gravity currents. For this reason, the main question of this thesis was formulated: Which physical parameters of the gravity current are of importance for its behaviour?<br/><br/> The lock-exchange release experiment is a frequently used method to study gravity currents in a laboratory and was also used in this thesis. In order to answer the main question, the following parameters were investigated and their influence specifically on the 4 phases, the run-out length and the PSD: particle size, bed roughness and temperature. The influence of particles size was researched using mono-dispersed vs bi-dispersed experiments. In the bed roughness experiments, sandpaper was attached to the bottom and compared to smooth bed experiments. Finally, to investigate the influence of temperature on the gravity current, experiments with warm water were compared to experiments with colder water.<br/><br/> From these experiments, the most notable results are summarized below.<br/>PSD : For all experiments applies that at low concentration the particles segregate over the run-out length of the gravity current. Smaller particles travelled further than the bigger particles with a higher settling velocity. This does not occur at higher concentrations and the PSD over the entire run-out length is similar.<br/>Four Phases: In all experiments, the four phases could clearly be identified with one exception: the first phase in the rough bed experiments was difficult to distinguish.<br/>Run out length: Some interesting findings were made that were in line with literature: adding fine particles to the mixture of the current cause the run-out length of the current to increase. However, it was also found that if the initial concentration is increased, this effect decreases.<br/>Furthermore experiments showed that an increase in temperature can cause the current to travel less far when compared to experiments performed with water with lower temperature.<br/><br/> In the light of this research, the following recommendation are made:<br/>Temperature should be taken into account for modelling gravity currents. Otherwise this can lead to an overestimation regarding the run-out length and an underestimation of the deposit density.<br/>Furthermore, to get more insight in the effect of the particle sizes in the currents, it would be highly recommended to conduct more experiments with a greater difference between particle sizes. This would allow for a better assessment of the magnitude of the effect of hindered settling","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-08-30","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Additionally, a new trend of 800 V battery architectures has appeared to allow for faster charging than the now common 400 V architectures. Future proof charging topologies should, therefore, be able to provide a wide output voltage range. This study investigates how DC-DC resonant power converters can be employed to achieve a wide output voltage range of 150-1000 V for EV charging. After the literature study, a two-stage topology consisting of a LLC converter and Interleaved TCM Buck converter is selected for this purpose. Additionally, the competitiveness of an IGBT based solution is examined in comparison with a SiC MOSFET based solution. An analytical model is created in MATLAB and verified using LTSpice, after which different configurations of the 11kW two-stage converter are compared analytically. This comparison is performed by developing a method to assess the efficiency of a converter based on real-world Charging cycles. A trade-off is made between efficiency and costs. In the end, one stage is equipped with IGBTs in the final design. After this, a PCB is designed and used to implement the prototype of the final design. The analytical and simulation models are verified experimentally using the prototype. The maximum measured efficiency of the converter is 97.66%, with a 95+% efficiency over the complete 150-1000 V range at full power. The obtained efficiency for the 11 kW-400 V Charging cycle is 96.85% and 95.67% for the 11 kW-800 V Charging cycle.

Through continuous monitoring and control of the power system, the TSO maintains stability through emergency actions. Until now, the conventional Static State Estimation has been the Energy Management System (EMS) tool for estimating and monitoring the grid state - bus voltages, currents, and powers. However, energy transition, which involves the decommissioning of conventional generation and their replacement by renewables, leads to a more dynamic grid. In such a case, the information provided by the static state estimator is insufficient. This has, hence, led to the development of the Dynamic State Estimator (DSE), to provide insight into the dynamic properties of a power system, such as rotor angle and rotor speed. The DSE typically uses a Wide-Area Monitoring (WAMS) architecture consisting of Phasor Measurement Units (PMU), to dynamically estimate the internal states of the generators under observation. Hence, the DSE provides improved situational awareness to the TSO. However, the existing literature do not elaborate on how their proposed DSE can be implemented in an online fashion to estimate the dynamic states in near real-time. Such an online implementation is of utmost importance as it showcases how a TSO can deploy the DSE in a real world scenario. Hence, this thesis proposes an online DSE algorithm that performs batch-wise estimation of dynamic states in a near real-time setting. By collecting measurements in batches and introducing the pre-processing steps necessary for these PMU measurements, the algorithm forms the premise for the real-world application of DSE. This algorithm is validated using a cyber-physical testbed comprising a Real Time Digital Simulator and a Synchrophasor Application Development Framework. Additionally, its performance is evaluated and a sensitivity study is conducted to find deterministic relationships between the input error introduced and the estimation error. Finally, future improvements are proposed to make the implementation more suitable to real-world application.","Dynamic State Estimator; phasor measurement units; Sensitivity Analysis; Power system monitoring; DFIG wind farms","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-08-31","","","","Electrical Engineering","Control Room of the Future Research Programme",""

CSPCs enabled using an ultra-thin interfacial tunnel oxide layer (SiOx) capped by a doped polycrystalline Silicon (poly-Si) layer also referred to as Tunnel Oxide Passivating Contacts (TOPCon) have resulted in efficiencies as high as 25.8%. This thesis project addresses the development of oxygen alloyed poly-Si (poly-SiOx) in combination with an interfacial oxide layer grown by dry thermal oxidation. The limited transparency of poly-Si based contacts brought on by high free carrier absorption (FCA) can be mitigated by the use of poly-SiOx based passivating contacts owing to their wider bandgaps which induce stronger band bending.<br/>To begin with, poly-SiOx CSPC were optimised by determining the optimum thermal budgets for tunnel oxide growth and hydrogenation scheme. Tunnel oxide layers grown at 675 ͦC 6 minutes demonstrated very good passivation for p-type polished and n-type textured CSPCs indicated by their implied Voc of 709 mV and 711 mV respectively. For the p-type textured CSPC identified as the primary limiting factor when deploying in c-Si solar cells, a tunnel oxide layer grown at 675 ͦC 3 minutes in conjunction with a two-step annealing scheme showed a crucial enhancement in passivation quality with a final implied Voc of 687 mV.<br/>The single side textured front back contacted (FBC) solar cell fabricated using the optimised p-type polished and n-type textured poly-SiOx CSPC recorded a conversion efficiency of 20.94% on a 4 cm2 screen printed solar cell.

Effective carrier transport and carrier collection was illustrated by a fill factor (FF) of 79.6%. A Jsc of 37.91 mA/cm2 was recorded for the same.

Among most pending issues, air pollution and heat stress have been highlighted by significant amount of the scientific research. In the Netherlands, air pollution shortens societal life expectancy by 13 months. Heat stress, on the other side is responsible for the increase in societal morality by 12% during the heat waves. The effects of climate change are predicted to bring more heatwaves in the future creating a significant risk to the vulnerable groups of the society.

The reference studies represent four different monitoring initiatives. In Chicago program called Array of Things is being implemented; Barcelona’s smart initiative is called Sentilo; Copenhagen deploys smart solutions through Copenhagen Connecting; Singapore has its Smart Nation Sensor Platform.

Together with the increased attention to responsible innovation, the polycentric development of multiple governing authorities gives room for social innovation. This empowers citizens to become prosumers via Local Renewable Energy Communities (LREOs). Despite the trend towards more polycentricity, the mismatch between the existing regulations and rules - with focus on system efficiency, reliability and affordability – and the growing attention to new sustainability related concerns of social equality, environmental well-being and energy autarky is seen as the cause for the emergence of LREOs. This manuscript explores how these new sustainability related concerns, evoked by climate events, influences the value systems of citizens and subsequently lead to the emergence of LREOs. By using agent based modelling approach, this research incorporates multiple scales of analysis, diverse agent configuration and focus on the emergence of structures at the societal level from individual actions. <br/><br/>The constructed agent based model uses an illustrative approach to showcase how the impact of disruptive climate events changes the value systems of citizens. Over the course of the simulation the citizens take part in the three core mechanisms of the model. First citizens slowly become responsible citizen by recognizing the sustainability related concerns evoked due to climatic disrupting events. Second, due to social learning and the recognition of the sustainability related concerns, citizens change their value prioritization. Third, citizens decide, based on their responsibility, value prioritization (motives) and leadership capacities, to adjust their energy provision by choosing between i) Fossil fuel market (market entity that supplies fossil fuel generated electricity), ii) Sustainable market (market entity that supplies sustainable generated electricity), iii) individual pv-owner (citizens buy solar pv panels for individual use), and iv) joining/initiating an LREO. In this thesis I will show that in each of these core mechanisms, values and value change play a dominant role. The experiments show that during the process of recognizing the sustainability related concerns, citizens from the value orientation Growth and Personal-Focus mainly struggle to acknowledge their own contribution to the problem of climate change, while citizens from the Social-Focus and Self-Protection-Focus population scenarios tend to stagnate because of disbelieve in the impact of individual actions. For the second mechanism, change in value prioritization, the analysis have shown that within the Mixed population scenario, the social pressure of friends hinder citizens to ascribe more priority to sustainable related values. Interestingly, within populations with a homogeneous value prioritization the combination of social learning and the completion of the responsibility-cycle led to the increased prioritization of the sustainability related values of universalism and benevolence. These so-called divergent patterns of change in value prioritization is more often observed among social networks with citizens who were social competent and receptive to new opinions (Growth and Personal-Focusvalue orientations).For the third mechanism, the emergence of LREOs, the experiments demonstrate that only within the population scenarios with the Growth and Mixed value orientations the emergence of LREOs was visible. This was due to the fact that only within these two scenarios, populations contained a large group of citizens i) who recognized the concerns of sustainability, ii) who were community-oriented, iii) who were willing to act, iv) whom of which a small group was capable to lead, and v) who jointly agreed on the organisational form and technology in-use. The experiments have shown a big diversity in the agency, goals and preferences between different population-scenarios. This research made a methodological contribution by introducing the new concept of perception thermometers to study the impact of value-weighted experiences, events and information on the value prioritization system of citizens. Next to the perception thermometers, the scientific contribution of this research study showcases how to integrate new values (e.g. energy justice) within the existing Value Circumplex of Schwartz by considering it as a change in value specification. Moreover, this research used a holistic approach of analysing the emergence of LREOs as it combines external factors (e.g. consistent energy policies) with social factors (e.g. disagreements during board meetings due to the different motives of individuals) and individual characteristics (e.g. responsibility, motives, leadership capacities). Applying this multiple perspective of studying the emergence of LREOs in practise, creates a better understanding why LREOs emerge and how to stimulate/facilitate their founding process. These insights allow a more in-depth understanding of the emergence LREOs and can equip relevant researchers and practitioners with fruitful knowledge.","ABM; Community Energy; Value change; Prosumerism; Responsibility","en","master thesis","","","","","","The Master's programme Industrial Ecology is jointly organised by Leiden University and Delft University of Technology.","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

Numerical tracers in CTMs track the concentration of chemical species, while operators simulate various physical processes such as advection. One such CTM, LOTOS-EUROS, uses a volatility basis set (VBS) approach to represent the formation of organic aerosol (OA) in the atmosphere, which contributes to the concentration of total particulate matter. The added dimensionality of the VBS tracers in LOTOS-EUROS slowed down computation of the advection operator by a factor of two, limiting their representation in operational forecasts.<br/>To keep the detailed process representation of OA formation, while reducing the computational costs, we develop an unsupervised machine learning method to compress the VBS tracers to a set of superspecies for use in advection, and subsequently decompress superspecies back to the tracer space for OA-relevant calculations. The focus of this machine learning method is physical interpretability, allowing for operators to resolve equations using the superspecies. This method conserves mass to machine precision and retains important information like phase (gas or aerosol) on compression. This data-driven approach reduces the dimensionality of the system more than a second proposed approach based on partitioning theory. The ML superspecies approach was integrated into LOTOS-EUROS for online calculations, showing numerical stability over a model simulation time of two weeks under various conditions. With the superspecies, the computation time for advection is reduced by 56% to 66% of the time for advection of the VBS tracers. The results of this approach show potential for use in accelerating air quality operational forecasts, as well as pathways forward for integration of ML box models of atmospheric chemistry into CTMs.","aerosols; machine learning; atmospheric chemistry; LOTOS-EUROS; air quality","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | COSSE (Computer Simulations for Science and Engineering)","",""

Rather, the imperfect edges, transitional areas and left-over pockets that typify high streets like the Tottenham high street can be used to reposition the high street making it a interactional and social public space.","High Street; London; architecture; Urbanism; interaction; Open City","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Architectural Design Crossovers","","51.595300, -0.067895"

Linear crossed roller bearings play an essential role in the high-tech industry, this kind of bearing is used for precision applications such as microscopes, optical systems, and semiconductor production equipment. The performance of all these systems is related to the ability to produce and control a certain motion of a body. Bearings facilitate this motion, they are designed such that the resistance in the direction of movement is minimal. Generally, in all other directions, the bearing should be as stiff as possible as a high bearing stiffness is beneficial for controlling the motion. Stiffness is beneficial as it contributes to achieving a high control bandwidth and minimizes sensitivity to external forces or vibrations. Mechatronic systems have to meet very strict targets in terms of positioning accuracy and settling times. The dynamics of mechatronic systems is dominantly dependent on the performance of their bearings. Nowadays, the performance of a machine is predicted before building the physical machine through virtual prototyping. Virtual prototyping is becoming increasingly important: an accurate model in an early stage of a development project minimizes the risk of not achieving specifications in a later stage. For accurate modelling of precision machines using linear cross roller bearings, reliable data on the stiffness characteristics of these bearings is required. This thesis performs a step-by-step validation of models. Starting with an empiric determination of the load-stiffness relation for an individual cylindrical roller-rail contact as this is not affected by the uncertainties present in bearing assemblies. This is followed by an analysis of the tangential effects that come into play when a roller is loaded at 45°. Once the roller-rail model at 45° is validated, this empirical roller-rail model is used to develop a model that predicts the stiffness of linear roller bearing assemblies.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-28","","","","","",""

This can result in severely detrimental effects. It is complicated for municipal actors to effectively manage these events, as it requires judgement on probabilities, costs, and uncertain impacts. As a result, obtaining scientific knowledge through climate tools and model results has become increasingly important in informing policy-making processes. While model results and climate tools have been shown to create an imperative to act for municipal actors, a clarification of how a certain approach might offer support in a specific context is scarce. By simplifying model simulations for municipal actors, information gets lost and becomes (unconsciously) framed, leaving room for the personal interpretation of municipal actors. Framing can change the actor’s perception without altering the scientific information they were initially provided, which might result in different decisions taken on water management. Decision-making is not an individual process. It involves interaction between a multitude of stakeholders of various disciplines, all with own individual contextual factors. It is essential for effective decision-making on extreme rainfall events that interaction is well-coordinated.<br/><br/>This integrated master thesis for the master’s degrees in International Land and Water Management and Communication Design for Innovation, therefore, aims to explore the influence of visually framed extreme rainfall model results on the interaction between municipal actors. This is explored in the Municipality of The Hague and the Huygenspark neighbourhood. The model results have been adjusted to two contrasting frames: in terms of gains or losses and psychological distant or near impacts.<br/><br/>These two contrasting frames have resulted in the development of four visually-framed extreme rainfall model results, hereafter named maps. For the distant loss map, water nuisance has been assessed in the Tygron Geodesign Platform. The water nuisance map shows that especially the Stationsweg, the tunnel at the Rijswijkseweg, and the tunnel underneath the train tracks will have water nuisance issues during extreme rainfall events. For the near loss map, the framing of adaptation tipping points has been applied. Adaptation tipping points frame the issue from the socio-political objectives and show the moments in time at which a change in the current management strategy no longer meets the municipal actors’ objectives. The socio-political objective has been identified to focus on maintaining the accessibility of roads for cars and ambulances. The model shows that the Stationsweg and the tram tunnel cross this threshold during a once a 25 years rain shower (40 mm/hour), while the Rijswijkseweg tunnel reaches the threshold already at a rain shower of less than once a 10 years (30 mm/hour). This return period will become more frequent to once every 13 years and an unspecified low non-extreme return period in the upper scenario of 2050 respectively. The two main chances to tackle this issue are either spatially, in the Oranjeplein and Huijgenspark or through adaptation mainstreaming opportunities.<br/><br/>The four maps were interpreted by fourteen municipal actors within the Municipality of The Hague through semi-structured interviews. Visual framing was found to have a profound effect on the interpretation of municipal actors. The near-framed adaptation tipping points map made the issue more concrete and expressed urgency as well as the necessity to take action compared to the distant-framed water nuisance map. The chance maps created a more positive interpretation than the loss maps. Besides, the interpretation of maps was also determined by the pre-existing knowledge structures and ways of looking at the issue, resulting in three distinct interpretations for the adaptation tipping points map. While every map has its own main interpretation, most municipal actors emphasised that the maps should be combined to create an overall story. This story can be used during interaction to convince others, but it can also be to start a discussion or to weigh different options. The visual maps can, therefore, be seen as a ‘story support tool’ for interaction.","visual framing; framing; extreme rainfall; model results; sense-making; interpretation; risk perception; interaction; decision-making; adaptation mainstreaming; cognitive biases; adaptation tipping points","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences | Science Education and Communication","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Increasing flexibility requirements and skill gaps resulting from today’s world of globalisation and digitisation pose constant challenges for manufacturing companies. Augmented Reality (AR) applications offer an efficient way to overcome these tensions by enhancing the interaction between people and technology. However, individual models in the scientific literature show ambiguous findings, and a statistically powerful empirical assessment is still missing. Hence, this research project aims to understand the potential of AR applications in manufacturing environments by aggregating the empirical findings. For this purpose, the following research question is posed: ’Can the use of AR solutions benefit manufacturing activities and if so, how?’. Following the media naturalness theory by Kock [2005], this research hypothesises that AR solutions in comparison to classical instructions have a reducing effect on processing times, errors rates, and cognitive load levels of workers during manufacturing activities. To answer the research question and prove the hypotheses, this research project conducts three meta-analyses in which several small studies are synthesised into one large study. Specifically, the meta-analyses address the evaluation criteria ’time’, ’errors’, and ’cognitive load’. The underlying systematic literature search to collect and evaluate relevant data follows the framework by Vom Brocke et al. [2009]. What is more, this research project examines the interrelationships between the evaluation criteria and moderating variables using meta-regressions. Finally, surveys with industrial experts in a consumer goods and chemical company support and expand the findings from the meta-analyses and the meta-regressions. The meta-analyses show that AR applications in comparison to classical instructions indeed have a reducing effect on the described evaluation criteria. In particular, based on the studies, a small, reducing effect can be achieved for ’time’, a medium, reducing effect for ’errors’, and a small to medium, reducing effect for ’cognitive load’. For this reason, all three previously formulated hypotheses are accepted. Furthermore, in line with the media naturalness hypothesis by Kock [2005, p. 122], the meta-regressions show that ’cognitive load’ moderates the evaluation criterion ’time’. The results are validated with the help of the expert surveys in the company context, with time savings being identified as the greatest potential and lack of proven profitable business models as the greatest challenge. Further research could, on the one hand, focus on repeating the meta-analyses as soon as new empirical studies are available and on the analysis of moderating variables. On the other hand, a long-term validation in manufacturing environments across industries is still missing and could show further scientific and practical relevance.","Augmented Reality; Manufacturing; Meta-Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This study is an attempt to develop a preliminary composite fuselage sizing tool for the decision making process utilizing analytical structural analysis equations and a bottom-up cost approach to estimate weight and cost. Previous research by several authors and companies is reviewed in order to define the knowledge gaps that the project is going to fill. The objectives of this project are divided into two directions. The first one is the weight and cost fuselage design, and the second, is the weight and cost optimization process. After examining the existing literature both from academia and industry a different approach is proposed for each sector. In the structural design an analytical based model is proposed to assess the components integrity while cost equations for fully learned manufacturing processes are used based on the Advanced Composites Cost Estimation Manual (ACCEM). An experience-driven optimization algorithm is proposed afterwards, taking into account manufacturing considerations and design rules of thumb. By combining these tools, a general tool for fuselage design that is completely suited for the preliminary design phase is proposed. Τhe trade-off studies can provide important knowledge on the effect of different decisions and establish new design guidelines. The study concludes that an increase of the number of stiffeners and frames, in a fuselage structure, leads to a general decrease in weight and an increase in manufacturing cost. The addition of more stringers or frames after a certain level leads to an increase in weight, while the cost follows the same trend. The manufacturing constraints and the design rules-of-thumb applied lead to an increase in structural weight. Finally, the comparison between skin-stiffened and sandwich designs, shows that the weight saving potential is comparable for both configurations, and the cost saving potential is higher for the sandwich design.","Trade-offs; Aircraft design; Composite fuselage design; Mass/weight estimation; Manufacturing cost; Skin buckling; Stiffener buckling; Composite structures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Ronse, Alexander (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Due to the increasing demand for sustainable wind energy, larger wind farms with more giant turbines are required. Therefore, more is expected of the existing installation vessels for wind turbines. These changes make it increasingly difficult to find capable jack-up vessels to transport and install these new ""mega turbines"". Another trend in the wind industry is that the demand for wind farms is increasing outside of Europe, where protective laws often apply, such as the Jones Act. The Tetrahedron crane can lift higher without increasing the weight or size of the crane. Installing wind turbines with a Tetrahedron crane whilst supplying the wind turbine components with a feeder vessel would mitigate most problems with the current trends in the offshore wind industry. However, no research is done on performing lifts with a Tetrahedron crane from a moving vessel. This research aims to determine whether it is feasible to perform lifts from a feeder vessel subjected to heave motion with a Tetrahedron crane and analyse this feasibility for large quantities of data points in a relatively short period. <br/>A case study is used to assess the feasibility of executing feeder lifts. The case study is used to provide constraints and parameters for two models that simulate a lifting operation. Both models describe the location of the load from the start of the lifting process till it is safely suspended far above the deck of the feeder vessel. The first model, the 1D model, is based on a free body diagram that provides a simplified representation of the Tetrahedron crane. This model can assess the feasibility of executing feeder lifts for entire data sets. The second model, the 2D model, represents the Tetrahedron crane as a system of elements and nodes. This model is used to validate the single lifting operations of the first model. Both models generate output data that provides insight into the dynamic forces that the crane and components endure during a lifting operation and if the load that is lifted experiences a re-hit or not. From this, it can be concluded whether a lifting operation is successful or not. Successful in this sense means no re-hit takes place, and the dynamic forces remain within limits set by the turbine and crane manufacturer. <br/>While comparing the results of the two models, the 2D model approximates reality better because the dead weight of the crane construction is included where the 1D model does not. By adjusting the 1D model to account for the dead weight, results can be determined for entire data sets. A Tetrahedron crane has a higher lifting speed and a lower crane stiffness than a commonly used luffing boom crane. When both cranes have a comparable re-hit percentage, the results showed that the dynamic forces in the lift operations with the Tetrahedron crane are lower than with a luffing boom crane. In addition, analyses were made regarding the re-hit percentage for varying wave heights, wave periods and masses. <br/>The outlined case study represents a realistic situation, and re-hit percentages within this case study are low. The re-hits that occur can be indicated, and it is also evident in which period lifting operations can be started safely. However, measures must be taken to ensure that the dynamic forces remain within the limits of the crane and turbine components. For the crane, this means that a greater lifting capacity is required. For the vulnerable turbine components, the dynamic forces must be reduced by, for example, a passive heave compensator.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-27","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","With issues such as climate change and global warming worsening with each passing day, sustainability has become more important now then ever. The world needs to employ sustainable means of energy in order to overcome the global challenges we are faced with and mitigate the damage already done. Energy from biomass in the form of biofuels is one of the answers to our problem. Biomass is a carbon neutral fuel, and the biofuels produced from treating biomass have the advantage of being readily used in the current energy infrastructure. Lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks are a type of biomass that are available from a variety of sources and do not compete with the food chain. Gasification is a type of thermochemical method for treating biomass, by heating the biomass at temperatures greater than 700°C in the presence of one or more gasifying agents such as air or steam. Gasification of biomass produces a high calorific value gas called syngas which is composed of CO, H2, CO2 and CH4. This syngas has a lot of applications, and can be further processed to form various biofuels. The aim of this study was to determine the various sources of lignocellulosic biomass available in the European Union, and to estimate their current and future (2050) production potential, in order to meet some of the energy demands of the EU. This study also dealt with creating a kinetic model in ASPEN Plus of a steam gasifier after the Indirectly Heated Bubbling Fluidized Bed Steam Reformer at TU Delft. The model was validated with experimental results obtained fromthe setup at TU Delft, and evaluated its efficiency. Furthermore, two case studies were undertaken, each to model a process to produce a biofuel, in a biorefinery context. The two kinetic models made were for the production of Synthetic Natural Gas and Hydrogen, both of which have a number of applications in the European context. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was also performed to study the effect of various parameters on each of the models. The results from the model indicated that the model was validated by the experimental results fairly well, with a maximum relative error of 18% for the primary components. Also, the final product streams from the SNG and the Hydrogen models, were composed of a majority of the desired fuel, and can be used for any desired application once the Nitrogen is removed from them, which was not implemented in the model. Each of the two models have their own merits and demerits, but purely from a process standpoint, it was determined that the SNG model was more attractive as a process due to better efficiency (34.6% for SNG model compared to 20.5% for the Hydrogen model) and lower heat requirements. In the end, the main conclusions of the thesis were drawn and compiled in the form of five research questions, and some recommendations for future work was suggested.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-31","","","","","",""

For appliance-oriented brands, such as Philips (PH), this raises crucial questions about the extent to which a brand can be extended into new product categories within the coffee market to provide holistic services to consumers. Research showed that the generation of “millennials” in particular should be addressed as a target segment: The group places high value on digital experiences and values high quality of coffee and beans. At the same time, it was identified that they have little confidence in broad appliance brands, such as PH, to offer a holistic coffee service that provides them with coffee beans. It is, therefore, necessary to offer a trustworthy experience through the creation of a new brand. To provide a trustworthy value-added brand experience, two key steps were identified. First, a new brand is needed that evokes desired brand associations in the coffee and coffee bean sector. Secondly, once this brand has become associated with high-quality coffee beans in the consumers’ minds, it is necessary to build a connected coffee machine app in collaboration between the new brand and the existing appliance brand (PH).

From this analysis charts were generated from which it could be determined which design requirement is governing. In this way opportunities for the application of supplemental damping could be determined.

(mentor); Limodio, G. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The use of clean energy sources for meeting the world’s energy requirements is increasing at an exponential rate, thus opening up new areas for research and development. The second generation of photovoltaics, especially flexible thin-film solar cells, are increasingly being used over the first generation crystalline silicon technologies due to their lightweight, flexibility, low cost, and decent efficiency. The low cost is possible mainly as a result of using a thinner absorber layer compared to crystalline silicon technologies. However, the thin absorber layer mandates the use of efficient light management techniques in order to increase the solar cell performance, as otherwise, the thin absorber layer will lead to very low photon absorption. Modulated surface texturing is one such light management technique where different textures are introduced at different interfaces and finally stacked together in order to superimpose various scattering mechanisms, thus increasing the optical path length of light. The modulated surface texturing principle has two goals: first, to provide efficient light trapping, and second, to promote the growth of smooth &amp; dense high-quality nc-Si layers. <br/>HyET Solar B.V. is a company located in the Netherlands that uses state of the art roll-to-roll technology to manufacture flexible thin-film silicon solar cells. This thesis is a part of the ongoing FLAMINGO PV project in collaboration with TU Delft and HyET Solar B.V, to develop tandem &amp; triple-junction solar cells with high efficiency &amp; lifetime. HyET Solar B.V. uses an aluminum foil as a temporary substrate on which the TCO and subsequent solar cell layers are deposited. The goal of this thesis is to implement optimized modulated surface texturing for the solar cells developed at HyET Solar B.V, by creating ’U’ shaped micro-sized craters on the aluminum foil and subsequently depositing ’V’ shaped, naturally nanotextured FTO on it. The microtextures are created on the aluminum foil by the process of wet chemical etching, where the three main etching parameters- temperature, concentration, and time are varied in order to obtain the most suited recipe. An alkaline-based etchant (NaOH) is used for the wet chemical etching process. The textured features on the aluminum foil are analyzed for its morphological and optical properties. The morphological analysis using a 3D laser scanning microscope &amp; SEM helps in obtaining the surface roughness properties while the optical analysis using Integrating sphere and ARTA helps in measuring the light scattering effectiveness. To ensure the mechanical stability of the roll-to-roll machine, a minimum foil thickness of 95μm is required after etching. Taking this as the first requirement, the etching recipes were varied and optimal results were obtained when the aluminum foil was textured with 60g/L NaOH at 60°C for 2.5 mins (NaOH60) and 60g/L NaOH at 70°C for 1.5 mins (NaOH70). Further analysis showed that texturing using NaOH60 resulted in better surface roughness and scattering properties compared to the aluminum foil textured with NaOH70, and it was thus chosen as the optimal recipe. This optimized recipe is known as FLAM02. <br/> The TCO leak tests at HyET Solar B.V. showed that the aluminum foil contains pinholes &amp; milling tracks, which are further enhanced after texturing using the factory baseline and FLAM01 process. Initial results showed that annealing the foil before texturing leads to a reduction in pinhole density &amp; surface roughness caused due to milling tracks. Experiments were designed to validate this where the two annealing parameters - temperature and time were varied. The aluminum foils were textured after annealing using the factory baseline, FLAM01, and FLAM02 processes. Morphological analysis, which was conducted before and after texturing, showed that annealing the foil before texturing does not lead to a decrease in pinhole density and surface roughness due to the milling tracks. The optical analysis using laser scattering validated this. One observation was that texturing using the FLAM02 process led to the significant amount of aluminum foil being etched away, thus resulting in the reduction of milling track roughness and pinhole density.","Flexible thin film solar; modulated surface texture; etching; efficiency-enhancement; light management; optics; aluminum texturing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-27","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","Flamingo PV",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Heart failure, caused by a weakened heart muscle that is not able to pump enough blood through the entire body, causes many deaths worldwide. The current heart assist devices designed to treat this acute condition cause a myriad of life threatening complications mainly caused by direct contact with the circulatory blood. A new generation of heart assist is needed that can circumvent this by mechanically assisting the outer surface of the heart. However, for such a concept to succeed, it is required to distribute the actuation, such that it can provide sufficient actuation resolution to realistically follow the natural motion of the heart without the risk of damaging it. This concept is called an extra-cardiac heart assistive device (ECHAD), and it is composed of a number of actuation units that will be actuated locally and individually to make up a distributed actuation surface that envelops the heart. Suitable actuation solutions that facilitate distributed actuation while at the same time providing the required performance, are lacking. In order to distribute the actuation, sufficiently compact, simple and modular actuation solutions are needed and therefore this thesis focuses on actuation. First efforts should be made towards developing the actuation units for this application. As such this thesis makes the first efforts towards making the ECHAD application feasible, by laying the foundation for a methodology that enables a first ECHAD actuation unit to be developed. The study bases on the fluidic actuation principle, chosen because of its high power densities, low heat dissipation, and ease of implementation, and this thesis aims to assess the feasibility of soft fluidic actuation for implementation into the ECHAD application. For this purpose first a literature review is conducted in order to identify and analyse the state-of-the-art of soft fluidic actuation, after which actuator development is addressed in the following steps: a first actuation unit design is proposed, and it is analysed both theoretically by means of FEM simulations, and experimentally by fabricating a prototype that is actuated by means of air pressure and characterised in experiments. The key challenge is to characterise the actuation unit’s performance such that it can be compared against the requirements, that were established during an internship prior to the thesis. Analysis shows that the first actuation unit design is not aligned with the requirements and implementation of several design improvements through COMSOL simulations succeeded to significantly improve the actuation unit’s performance. The first realisation of an ECHAD actuation unit highlights the potential of soft fluidic actuation for this application and the main findings show that soft fluidic actuation is feasible for implementation into the ECHAD application in terms of size, simplicity, weight, modularity, and power density. Furthermore, it is expected that the proposed methodology of analysing and validating the design will provide a solid basis for further actuator development for this application, because the understanding as it has been obtained throughout the entire design process will allow future actuation unit design concepts to be iterated and their performance characterised.","heart assist; distributed actuation; actuation unit; soft fluidic actuation; design; analysis and validation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-27","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

(mentor); Noteboom, C. (mentor); Bilow, M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","On April 15th, 2019 a devastating fire burned down Notre Dame de Paris and left the cathedral without its central spire and ancient gable roof, better known as The Forest. The required reconstruction initiated a global debate between architects, engineers, and other stakeholders. The discussion was put to an end by the French authorities, who proposed an identical reconstruction within a timeframe of 5 years. The decision forced the construction crew into a difficult job of finding identical construction materials, eventually leading to environmental and humanitarian suffering in Ghana, where a tropical underwater forest was felled. Besides, the time pressure put the quality of the reconstruction at risk.<br/><br/>In the presented thesis, an alternative design for Notre Dame’s roof is proposed. First, the authorities’ reconstruction plans are analyzed to see which practical challenges will have to be tackled. An alternative reconstruction strategy is then developed for the choir and nave of the cathedral. Inspiration is drawn from Notre Dame’s initial construction in the 12th and 13th centuries, during which time pressure also played a key role in the design. The Master Builders’ clever construction strategies like integrated support structures and utilization during construction are indispensable parts of Gothic engineering and are used to tackle current problems. <br/><br/>The proposed alternative construction process consists out of three phases: Fast Fix, Field Factory, and Former Finishing. The resulting structure, The Timber Skeleton – named after Professor Jacques Heyman’s book: The Stone Skeleton -, consists out of stabilizing cassettes (Fast Fix), expandable roof segments (Field Factory), covered by a roof cladding with the same external appearance as before the fire (Former Finishing). Notre Dame’s attic is imagined to function as a publicly accessible workshop, dedicated to the constant maintenance of the cathedral and all its Gothic ornamentation. As an alternative to the difficulties the authorities are facing in finding proper timber, modern construction materials and prefabrication strategies are investigated. They are utilized to facilitate a relatively quick construction without obstructing other on-site restoration works. Laminated veneer lumber with cross-plies is used to design openworked members with structural expression. <br/><br/>For the particular geometry of the rafters, the boundaries of current analytical engineering tools have been explored. Different verification strategies have been assessed and compared to analyze the structural functioning and feasibility of The Timber Skeleton. A conventional stress analysis is eventually used for the structural verifications of The Timber Skeleton and its most important joints. Recommendations are given for further development of the design, in which mainly the moment rigid connections of the rafters will require numerical and physical testing. A Master Builder’s mentality of prototyping and trial and error will be needed to realize the proposed design.<br/><br/>The research shows how an alternative reconstruction strategy for Notre Dame de Paris could result in a good functioning structural design that pays homage to Gothic engineering principles. The design functions as an innovative example for how modern production processes could help to arrive at a contemporary interpretation of The Forest that functionally and structurally better fulfills the contemporary requirements. <br","Notre Dame de Paris; The Forest; Gothic Architecture; Gothic Engineering; Master Builders; Structural Expression; Laminated Veneer Lumber; Openwork","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The miniaturisation of implants necessitates the need to find an efficient way to transfer power wirelessly. Ultrasound energy transfer with its short wavelength, small receiving transducer size, beamforming capability makes deep tissue penetration possible making it a good alternative for powering deep implants. There is also the advantage of using the reflected energy (ultrasound echo) from the implants to perform passive uplink data telemetry. The ultrasound power transfer efficiency depends on how well the energy is focused on the implant. So, the implant needs to be located first and then an initial contact needs to be established that can then be used to fine-tune beam forming attributes such as focus depth and steering angle. <br/>In this work, a simple low power uplink data telemetry circuit to establish the 'first contact' that sends information on the implant's energy status to the transmitter is designed. The telemetry uses load impedance modulation to passively transmit back information. This principle is tested using an experimental setup with a 4 MHz burst frequency and different resistive loads varied from 0 Ω to 2000 Ω. Next, an algorithm was developed that automatically finds the optimal focus and steering angle settings so that the maximum amount of power is transferred to the ultrasound energy scavenger. This algorithm works based on the information sent from the uplink data telemetry circuit.<br/>The results show that load impedance modulation can effectively be used for backscatter communication. A reflected energy change of up to 40% is observed between matched and mismatched load conditions. This load modulation was implemented in the uplink data telemetry circuit. A simple low power circuit that consumes less than 0.5 μW was designed for this. The uplink telemetry protocol uses pulse width modulation to send the storage capacitor voltage which powers the implant, and an almost linear correlation was found between the pulse width and the supply voltage. The algorithm produces a heat plot showing the maximum power transferred at the location where CMUT was placed and gives the optimal value of focus and steering angle. <br","Uplink data telemetry; Beamforming; Implant localization; Ultrasound; Power transfer; Load modulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Diamond, which is normally formed in high pressure and temperature environments, can also be produced as polycrystalline thin films in reduced pressure environments through chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Microfabricated diamond microstructures find their applications in a variety of micro­devices and sensors exploiting diamond’s physical and chemical properties. Current diamond microfabrication methods are limited to simple 2D and 2.5D structures, and rely on costly processes to pattern the diamond films after their growth. At present, a method to produce ar­ bitrary 3D diamond microstructures is not available, thereby limiting the exploitation of microstructured diamond . Therefore, a novel bottom­up approach to produce diamond loaded microstructures using the principle of two­photon polymerization (2PP) was explored in this MSc thesis project. The diamond loaded microstructures were developed through a monodispersed nanodiamond loaded photoresist (1 weight percentage), produced by mixing photoresist SU­8 2075 with an acetone based nanofluid containing diamond nanoparticles ranging from 3.5 to 6.0 nm in size. Using the loaded resin, the 2PP process was optimized for micropillar arrays of 20 microns in diameter and height. As a result, by utilizing the optimized parameters, microstructures with features of 2 microns and aspect ratios of 1:5 were obtained. Furthermore, the loaded microstructures showed to have a Young’s modulus of 3.2 ± 0.22 GPa compared to 2.4 ± 0.10 GPa for the base resin, thus exhibiting an increase of 33%. The obtained diamond loaded microstructures are expected to form a base for future pyrolysis and CVD processes, thereby enabling the fabrication of complex 3D diamond coated glassy carbon core­ shell microstructures. These microstructures with high surface­to­volume ratios might solve the largest bottleneck in the advance of hierarchical boron­doped diamond microelectrodes for various electro­ chemical applications.","two-photon polymerization; nanodiamond; SU-8; loaded photoresist; composite; Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD); bottom-up fabrication","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-01","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Micro and Nano Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Self-healing ability in polymers is typically probed by monitoring restorative properties after localized macroscopic damage or repetitive cycles of destructive testing followed by a healing cycle (e.g. cut-and-heal tests). However, the restoration of homogeneously distributed damage before ultimate failure remains largely unattended in literature. This work investigates whether damage degree and damage restoration after plastic deformation in self-healing polymer networks can be identified via continuous relaxation spectra from rheology, which were recently successfully employed to identify energy contributions in self-healing polyurethanes. As a model system a self-healing epoxy-silane dual network with dynamic sulfur-sulfur bonds is used together with a non-healing reference epoxy. Three levels of deformation are probed: pristine, partially plastic (near yield), and fully plastic (near failure). Compared to the non-healing reference epoxy, the self-healing epoxy is observed to have faster dynamics of the main relaxation peak and to dissipate more energy at very fast (10-9 s) relaxation times. It is found that any level of plastic deformation (near yield or near failure) induces clear changes in the energy profile compared to the pristine state (e.g. relaxation peak height drop). Between the two levels of plastic deformation, no clear distinction could be made. An oven treatment, intended to repair any induced damage by stimulating network mobility through sulfur-sulfur bond reshuffling above Tg, was found to shift the energy profile to longer relaxation times for both pristine and plastically deformed samples not observed in the non-healing polymer. However, this time shift could be undone by allowing a one week recovery period after the oven treatment. It is proposed that the observed behavior can be explained by trapping, in self-healing polymers, a non-equilibrium polymer state through quenching. Despite the necessary further research, the results confirm the potential of continuous relaxation spectra to evaluate damage degree and damage restoration in plastically deformed self-healing polymers.","self-healing; continuous relaxation spectrum; damage healing; epoxy; silane; organic-inorganic; viscoelasticity; strain damage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The generic nature of current departure procedures leaves room for improvement in the form of aircraft type dependent departure trajectories. In this study a trajectory optimization model is implemented that uses a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to optimize departure trajectories for fuel consumption and awakenings from noise. A parameterization technique is applied that reduces the number of optimization parameters by splitting the horizontal and vertical profiles into segments, thereby reducing the complexity of the problem. The model is used to optimize a specific departure trajectory at Schiphol Airport. A 15% reduction in fuel and a 60% decrease in number of awakenings is possible when an aircraft flies a fuel or noise optimal trajectory respectively. An intermediate trajectory provides a trade-off between the two objectives that is still superior to the reference. Medium aircraft can share an optimal trajectory without significant deterioration in performance while this does not apply for heavy aircraft. The achieved fuel savings translate to lower CO2 emissions which contribute to reaching EU climate goals, while the reduction in number of awakenings results in fewer restrictions on the maximum number of aircraft movements.

The rate at which new technology is developed cannot suffice the emission reduction requirements for the growth of this industry. Therefore, new areas of improvement, such as operational changes, should be considered. The inclusion of stop-overs in long-haul routes can potentially result in a reduction of the fuel required for certain routes. This strategy is known as intermediate stop operations (ISO) and in order to test its performance, it is necessary to study economic, environmental and operational consequences. The implications of ISO are best represented with the model of an airline network. The simulation within which ISO is tested is built using a dynamic programming approach to obtain an optimal fleet assignment and network schedule. Dynamic programming allows for a division of the optimization problem into smaller subroutines, which significantly reduces computational time. Moreover, this approach allows solving the optimization problem such that the level of the activity of the airline is not directly proportional to the outcome. The case study under which the proposed methodology is tested belongs to the weekly operations of the airline Alitalia. Long haul operations are evaluated for the base scenario which imitates current operations and then compared to the introduction of a stop-over. Splitting flights into two legs results in a reduction of the fuel consumption per passenger transported of around 5% and a subsequent reduction in climate impact of 0.1%. These values are achieved compromising total flight time, however, no reduction in the profit generated per passenger is observed.","Climate impact; Airline Planning; Intermediate Stop Operations; Dynamic Programming; Fleet Assingment; Network Schedule; emissions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(Jan) (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","A parking garage of Eindhoven airport partially collapsed in 2017. It was caused by failure of the longitudinal joint (long-side) of the composite plank floor or breedplaatvloer on the roof level. Experimental and numerical research showed that the joint suffered high positive bending moment in its transverse direction. However, from the investigation results, there was not enough resistance at the concrete-to-concrete interface around the joint to transfer the tensile force from the precast to the cast-in-situ section, which led to delamination of the two layers of concrete and resulting in failure when the delamination crack reaches the end of the coupling reinforcements. As happened in that case, the concrete-to-concrete interface usually is the weakest link and has a critical role on behaviour of a composite concrete system, especially the one which has unreinforced interface (no stirrup near joint). Further studies have been conducted to understand the influence of various details around the joint on the interface behaviour. In this thesis, details in spacing between lap splices (coupling reinforcements in cast-in-situ layer and bottom reinforcements in precast layer), spacing between connecting reinforcements (stirrups crossing the interface near the joint), the role of connecting reinforcement, and the sensitivity of interface parameters were studied numerically using DIANA finite element analysis software. Since the spacings are in direction of the specimen’s width, interface behaviour was analysed in both longitudinal and transverse directions. An additional study about compressive membrane action or arching was also conducted to understand the influence of lateral restraint, which usually occurs in composite plank floor systems used in buildings, including the one used in Eindhoven parking garage, to the capacity of the structure. This action was suspected of providing additional strength to the existing composite plank floor <br/><br/>Two composite SHCC-concrete beam specimens from the experimental research by Harrass [1] were used in this numerical study since the experiment had both unreinforced and reinforced interface specimens which were important for this study. The unreinforced interface beam (Sample 1) was suitable for the study of lap splice spacing and lateral restraint without any influence from reinforcement crossing the interface, while the reinforced interface beam (Sample 7) was suitable for the study of stirrups spacing. The specimens are solid beams (without weight-saving element) consisting of a SHCC (Strain Hardening Cementitious Concrete) precast layer with a joint in the mid-span, and a regular concrete cast-in-situ layer. By using DIANA 10.4 finite element analysis software, this study is able to simulate both specimens in 2D and 3D numerical models. The models represented Sample 1 failed with a horizontal crack along the interface and a flexural crack at the end of coupling reinforcement reaches the top of the cast-in-situ layer, while the models represented Sample 7 failed with a horizontal crack along the interface, a flexural crack at the end of coupling reinforcement, and a crack at the stirrup location in precast layer. From the verification study, the reinforcement bond-slip function (CEB-FIB 2010) was chosen not to be used for the rest of the study since it did not affect much the load capacity and the failure mechanism of the specimens. Consequently, pull-out failure of the stirrup is excluded for the rest of this study. <br/><br/>Prior to the main study, the influence of each interface parameter was studied in both unreinforced and reinforced interface models by varying the interface parameters. It was observed that interface tensile strength and stiffness are governing in the unreinforced interface model. Within the range of those parameters, the load capacity was increased and decreased by more than 50% in compared to the reference model verified by Sample 1. By adding a rectangular stirrup near the joint of unreinforced interface model, the model with reinforced interface has a different governing parameter, the cohesion, and the variability of the results decrease. Within the range of the cohesion, the load capacity was increased and decreased up to 30% in compared to the reference model verified by Sample 7. Since the interface parameters influence the capacity of both unreinforced and reinforced interface beams, two different interface types are used for the whole of the study. They are known as “smooth interface” which uses the parameters obtained from the verification with the experimental specimen, and “perfect bonded interface” which use rigid connection between the elements of the two concrete layers. <br/><br/>To study the influence of lap splices spacing, models with three lap splices setup from Harrass’ experiment (three coupling reinforcements and three bottom reinforcements) were compared to models with a single lap splice (one coupling reinforcement and one bottom reinforcement) with the same total reinforcement area. As a result, with perfect bonded interface, model with single lap splice has higher load capacity by more than 10% in compared to model with three lap splices though both models failed with the same failure mechanism which was the horizontal crack along coupling reinforcement and a flexural crack at the end of coupling reinforcement reaches the top of the cast-in-situ layer. Stress concentration around coupling reinforcements were observed in all models, especially in model with single coupling reinforcement. However, different horizontal crack propagation occurred in each models. Uniform horizontal crack propagation along the interface were observed in models with smooth interface, while more concentrated crack propagation around the coupling reinforcements were observed in models with perfect bonded interface, especially in model with single lap splice. This different crack propagation in models with perfect bonded interface could be the cause of different load capacity since more uncracked elements could provide more tensile force transfer from precast layer to cast-in-situ layer. <br/><br/>In the study of the influence of stirrups spacing, models with rectangular stirrup (two legs) setup were compared to models with a single leg vertical stirrup setup with the same total reinforcement area. In both cases the presence of the stirrup near the joint stopped the propagation of the horizontal crack. As a result, all models could reach yielding of the coupling reinforcement for both interface types although different structural stiffness is observed. The plausible cause for this difference in structural stiffness was the higher tensile stress in stirrups of model with two legs stirrups compared to model with single leg stirrup. This higher tensile stress might be resulted by the more distributed stirrups across the width of the beam. <br/><br/>In the additional study, models with full height lateral restraint at the support were compared with models with simple support. As a result, with perfect bonded interface, model with lateral restraint has higher load and displacement capacity by more than 14 and 2.5 times consecutively compared to the model without lateral restraint. In compared to the collapse load, the numerical result of model with lateral restraint has higher load capacity by almost 4 times. With smooth interface, model with lateral restraint has higher load and displacement capacity by more than 10 and 5.5 times consecutively compared to the model without lateral restraint. In compared to the collapse load, the numerical result of model with lateral restraint has higher load capacity by more than 2 times. These increases are in accordance with a research by Ockleston [2] which found a considerable increase of load capacity on concrete slab with lateral restraint compared to the yield line theory. Part of the increase of capacity was resulted by the fix boundary action due to bending moment at support. However, it was observed that compressive membrane action started to develop after the first flexural crack as the horizontal force at support rapidly increased after that crack. Although the models with lateral restraint of both interface types had a different failure mechanism compared to the models without lateral restraint, they have a similar final stage of the failure mechanism, which is the flexural crack at the end of coupling reinforcement. This flexural crack propagation can be prevented from occurring earlier due to the high compressive stress at the top part of the cast-in-situ layer. When the concrete crushed at the support due to limited rotation capacity of the concrete, the compressive stress dropped causing the flexural crack at the end of coupling reinforcement to develop.<br/><br/>In conclusion, there was an influence of the interface behaviour to the failure and the capacity of composite SHCC-concrete beam. However, the influence was varied, depending on the coupling reinforcement spacing, presence of stirrup crossing the interface near the joint, spacing of stirrup, and interface type. It is also concluded that compressive membrane action in addition to fix bending action, which occurred due to the lateral restraint, increased the capacity of the structure. This increase depended on the interface type and rotation capacity of the concrete. A wider range of the influencing parameters are needed in future studies to get a more robust results which are beneficial for a more general conclusions. However, the series of experimental research based on this study are essential to provide a verification on the results of this numerical study.","Interface behaviour; SHCC-concrete beam; lap splice; connecting reinforcement; interface parameters; lateral restraint; compressive membrane action; stress concentration; horizontal crack propagation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","A reverse osmosis (RO) membrane followed by a packed tower aerator and rapid sand filter are used by an agricultural company in Emmen to treat brackish groundwater to supply water for growing crops and cleaning purposes. The iron removal by the treatment plant is sufficient most of the time throughout the year. However, the farmer periodically (once per year) reported yellowish treated water, indicating insufficient iron removal. Nevertheless, it is still not clear what is the cause of the insufficiency of the iron removal. This thesis aimed to investigate the iron removal in the water treatment plant in Emmen and propose a solution to improve the iron removal. The iron removal of the treatment plant was investigated through a set of batch iron oxidation, flocculation, and filtration experiments. The pH of the water was the main parameter that influenced the oxidation of Fe(II). It was found that within the retention time that was available in the treatment plant’s tower aerator and the rapid sand filter (20 minutes), the Fe(II) was not fully oxidized and flocculated. At pH of the permeate in the range of 6 – 7, only &lt;11.5% of the initial Fe(II) was oxidized in 20 minutes. Increasing the pH to 8 accelerated the oxidation of Fe(II), and the Fe(II) was completely oxidized within 30 minutes.Although removal of iron that is dominated by floc filtration was not achieved, the treatment plant also removed the iron through adsorption on iron hydroxide deposit in the packed tower aerator and sand particle. However, the Fe(II) adsorption capacity of adsorbents was low at low pH. The regeneration of the adsorption capacity was achieved through oxidation of the adsorbed Fe(II) which is also influenced by pH. COMSOL model showed that without regeneration, the adsorption capacity of new sand and iron oxide-coated sand was exhausted after 24 hours and 230 hours, respectively.When the concentration of CO2 in the permeate is in equilibrium with air, the pH of the permeate should be in the range of 7.9 – 8. However, the maximum pH of the permeate was 7 after aeration because the contact time of the tower aerator was not sufficient to completely strip the CO2. The tower aerator was also clogged by iron deposits that reduces the airflow and causes short-circuiting that decrease the CO2 stripping efficiency over time.Installation of a bubble column reactor was proposed to improve the CO2 stripping and increase the pH of the permeate. The Phreeqc model showed that the CO2 could be stripped until approx. 1 mg/L within 4 minutes, and the pH also increased to approx. 7.9. Moreover, the bubble column reactor will provide additional retention time for Fe(II) oxidation, and approx. 20 – 30% of the initial Fe(II) concentration can be oxidized within 4 minutes. The bubble column was considered preferable compared to the packed tower aerator because it was not susceptible to clogging by iron deposits and requires lower maintenance.","Iron; Iron Floc; Rapid sand filters; aeration; packed tower aerator; Oxidation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","One of the critical questions in the current era is how to provide broadband internet for all and second how to realise the digitally connected city of the future. The Covid-19 pandemic painfully exposed a crisis of internet access in many low-income and rural areas in the world. While many people in the Western world could easily shift to teleworking and online education, still 3.7 billion people worldwide do not have access to reliable and high-speed internet (United Nations, 2021). Terragraph, an intellectual property technology that emerged from the Facebook Connectivity group, aims to bridge this digital divide and has a mission to bring more people online to a faster internet. This thesis is executed at BrightSites, a technology venture within Signify. It is the result of almost six months of work covering multiple domains in the intelligent street lighting industry. The main research question of this thesis was to analyse the role of Gbit luminaires in the digitally connected city of the future. Gbit luminaires are innovative fixtures that can enable wireless connectivity on the outdoor lighting grid. These fixtures can provide fibre-like speeds due to the incorporation of mmWave radios that utilise Terragraphs' technology. ​​One of the research outcomes is a theoretical framework that shows stakeholders value capture and value creation motivations. In this project context, value capture is defined as how a particular stakeholder wants to be rewarded for becoming part of the Gbit luminaire ecosystem. On the other hand, value creation is defined as how a specific stakeholder can deliver value and strengthen the Gbit luminaire ecosystem. The findings show that the Gbit luminaire is part of a conservative regulatory environment in an interdependent ecosystem. Furthermore, the framework sheds some new light on the gaps between BrightSites, market players and municipalities. In the Gbit luminaire ecosystem, the following gaps are perceived: 1. The value gap, 2. The knowledge gap, 3. The financial gap, and 4. The urgency gap. The opportunities for technology-driven organisations to solve gaps and prepare for the future lay in user-centred roadmaps. The type of roadmap developed in this project is a design roadmap, which is still limited in use but getting more attention in the literature and across industries. Design roadmaps differ from traditional technology or product roadmaps as it centres on end-user's values, rather than the technology portfolio and organisational goals. The design roadmap is developed from a European municipal decision-maker perspective while considering the shared desirability in the ecosystem. The main conclusion that can be drafted is that the product proposition should be perceived, developed and pitched from an ecosystem level. In addition, the author suggests that the (Gbit) luminaire should be positioned as a hosting solution rather than a wireless fibre extender. The main argument is that every stakeholder in the Gbit luminaire ecosystem should feel that a specific problem is solved since this is considered as the only way to succeed and achieve widespread deployment.","Intelligent Street Lighting; Ecosystem Mapping; Design Roadmapping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Goyal, N. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","During the 1990s, Dutch bicycle policy took shape within the Bicycle Master Plan (BMP) framework, part of the Second Transport Structure Plan (Tweede Structuurschema Verkeer en Vervoer SVV-II a) for the period 1990-2010. A decentralized policy execution approach was followed, where the municipalities were encouraged to form their policy instruments related to bicycles and execution plans. The term ""Cycling Climate"" will be used in this research project about the cycling levels and bicycle use. The cycling climate success cannot be credited to the standalone policy but a combination of procedures such as transport, land-use, urban development, housing, environment, taxation, and parking sectors. These policies can be termed ""Policy Mix "", contributing to the transition from motorized transport to sustainable active transport. Apart from the policy mixes, various other exogenous factors influence the cycling climate in municipalities. Studies have tried to evaluate the factors and policy instruments contributing to the uptake of cycling activities in The Netherlands. Still, scarce research or literature is available examining the combined effort of the policy mix in influencing cycling climate in the respective municipalities. Therefore, a comparative case study of Zwolle and Enschede municipalities is conducted to understand the impact of the policy mix approach on the cycling climate in the Netherlands. In Zwolle, the cycling climate has witnessed continuous improvements between 2000 and 2020. However, the policy mix during this period is characterized by weak consistency and credibility. The policy formulation process had remained coherent, whereas the policy implementation process had changed from being coherent to non-coherent during 2009-2020. These characteristics have remained the vital drivers of the policy mix success and seem to have influenced the cycling climate in the city. In Enschede, the cycling climate had declined during 2000 and 2010, before recovering and improving between 2010 and 2020. During the first decade, the policy mix did not exhibit any of the visible characteristics. However, during the second decade, the policy mix was characterized by credibility and consistent policy instruments. In addition, the process of policy formulation and implementation was coherent. These characteristics were the vital drivers of the policy mix success and could have influenced the rapid improvement in the cycling climate. The absence of a consistent and coherent policy mix coincided with the decline in cycling climate in Enschede during the period 2000-2008. The resurgence in cycling climate happened during the next decade when the municipality adopted a consistent, coherent, and credible policy mix. In Zwolle, a sustained and slightly improving cycling climate has coincided with the existence of a credible and weak-consistent policy mix. The consistency and coherency of the policy mix have changed in Zwolle over the two decades, but the policy mix has been supported by leadership and administrators. Hence, the policy mix design seems to influence the cycling climate and cycling policies in Zwolle and Enschede. The evidence from both the municipalities shows that following a policy mix approach has benefited the cycling climate within the municipalities. Furthermore, the political and administrative support and the participation of the interest groups have contributed to the success of the policy mix in both Zwolle and Enschede. Therefore, municipalities and policy researchers or consultants working towards improving the cycling climate can try the policy mix approach to improve the cycling climate within their respective municipalities.","Policy Mix; Cycling Policy; Bicycle; Case Study Research; Sustainabilty; Transport policy; Zwolle; Enschede; Policy success","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","","52.0126341,4.3555860"

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and sequestration (CCS) can play a significant role in reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions while allowing society to slowly phase out traditional energy sources. One of the main challenge in CCS is the current absence of a clear revenue model. One idea is to use the sequestered supercritical CO2 as a working fluid for geothermal energy extraction from sedimentary reservoirs (Carbon-dioxide Plume Geothermal or CPG). Due to the large variability in density and mobility of CO2 under different temperatures, reservoir heterogeneities can give a rise to a combination of convective and conductive heat transfer. In this work, qualitative and quantitative descriptions<br/>of the effect of reservoir properties on the performance of CPG in depleted<br/>gas fields are provided using an example realistic depleted gas field. The primary focus is on the behaviour of the CO2 plume with regards to different reservoir properties such as porosity, permeability and thermal properties. The effect of large-scale reservoir structure, such as a presence of an aquifer, net-to-gross ratio and layering is also studied. In order to accurately model these effects, a thermal multi-component multiphase model based on a fugacity-activity Equation of State is built and validated for for pressures from 50-400 bar and temperatures from 35°C to 130°C. The developed thermodynamic model<br/>is implemented into the Delft Advanced Research Terra Simulator. Numerous studies of 2D and 3D ensembles and sensitivity studies are carried out to examine the effects of isolated parameters on CPG performance. Results reveal that increased net-to-gross (N/G) ratio is associated with increased recovery factor. In addition, layering architecture becomes an important factor for the importance of conductive flux only at low N/G. Variations in the required pressure to sustain a production rate is associated with fluctuations<br/>in production temperature and density due to expansive cooling. Varying reservoir properties and state also have a significant effect on brine upconing, which is detrimental to CPG performance. It appears that an increase in injection rate have a positive effect on the performance of CPG, but this should be studied in conjunction with a coupled wellbore and power plant model. Heterogeneous porosity-permeability realizations show a strong decrease in reservoir lifetime compared to their upscaled homogeneous counterparts, which is caused by a combination of preferential flow, reduced conductive flux and lower production BHP associated with the upscaled realizations. It was also found that reducing production rate delays the time of thermal breakthrough due to the combined effect of these factors.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Petroleum Engineering and Geo-sciences","",""

At the same time, developing models for stochastic phenomena for traditional aircraft configurations are costly, and classical control methods cannot operate beyond the predefined operation points or adapt to unexpected changes to the aircraft.

This research contributes to the development and analysis of online adaptive flight control by comparing PPOC against a non-hierarchical method called Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and PPOC with a single Option (PPOC-1). The methods are tested on an extendable mass-spring-damper system and aircraft model. Subsequently, the agents are evaluated by their sample efficiency, reference tracking capability and adaptivity. The results show, unexpectedly, that PPO and PPOC-1 are more sample efficient than PPOC. Furthermore, both PPOC agents are able to successfully track the height profile, though the agents learn a policy that results in noisy actuator inputs. Finally, PPOC with multiple learned Options has the best adaptivity, as it is able to adapt to structural failure of the horizontal tailplane, sign change of pitch damping, and generalize to different aircraft.","Reinforcement Learning; Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning; Flight Control Systems; Policy Gradient; Proximal Policy Optimization; Option-Critic architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Glass is already used in facades, staircases, fins, floors, and beams. Nevertheless, free-standing load-bearing glass columns are rarely used. It needs to be robust, which means that it needs to give a warning before failure so that people can evacuate. Glass is a brittle material and has a sudden failure, which means that it is not directly logical to use solid glass as a load-bearing structural column. Rather despite the high compressive strength, due to complications with manufacturing, spontaneous failure, and lack of satisfactory of fireproof performance, more research needs to be done on the manufacturing, the fire safety, and the robustness of glass columns. In the literature study, the layered tubular glass column was found to be most promising for further investigating. The aim of this research is to design and engineer a transparent tubular glass column as a structural element, which is robust and fireproof. In the literature study a few aspects emerged: the tubular shape, the column needs to be sealed to avoid the column from becoming dirty, end connections, the geometric tolerances in the glass tubes and the robustness. The designs were engineered for the case study Bouwdeel D in Delft, but the designs can also be applied to other buildings: the fire resistance, demountability, the dimensions and the calculated compression loads. With these aspects in mind, three designs were engineered, the MLA (Multi Layered with Air) (2x) and the SLW (Single Layered with water) (1x) which fulfil the defined design criteria/main concerns. Six small samples with a length of 300 mm were produced to test the lamination process with regard to bubble formation and possible breakage of the glass by internal stresses. Three laminated DURAN (annealed) samples and three laminated DURATAN (heat-strengthened) samples were tested. The glass tubes were manufactured by extruding and were made by SCHOTT. H.B.Fuller Kӧmmerling carried out the lamination process. Furthermore, the connection components (steel and POM) were produced and arranged by Octatube, the steel hinges were arranged by Techniparts, and the Hilti mortar was arranged by Hilti. Afterwards, these samples were tested on compression strength, to investigate the behaviour of the interlayer material, the post-failure behaviour of the designs, the differences between annealed and heat-strengthened glass samples, the behaviour of the connections under pressure, and the capacity of the glass tubes and the connections. The first cracks appeared earlier than expected. Nevertheless, the samples seemed to be really robust, because the samples had a large load-bearing capacity even after the first cracks occurred. The first crack appeared between 95-160 kN in the DURAN samples, and after that the samples were still able to carry a load of 700-750 kN. So, after the first crack, the specimens were able to have around 4-5 times more load. The heat-strengthened samples first cracked at 120-160 kN. The maximum force of these samples was 390-490 kN. This means that after the first crack, the specimens were able to have around 3 times more load.","Tubular Columns; Glass; Experiments; Compression strength","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering - Structural Design","",""

(mentor); Izelaar, B. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","One of the greatest concerns of this century is climate change due to rising greenhouse gas emissions. The ammonia industry is responsible for 1.4% of the global CO2 emissions, thereby having a negative climate impact. However, ammonia is an essential ingredient in nitrogen fertilisers and is also considered as a potential energy carrier. Ammonia is currently produced in the energy intensive Haber-Bosch process, where natural gas, coal or oil are used as the hydrogen and energy source. For these reasons, it is necessary to investigate more sustainable alternatives. One of the alternatives is electrochemical ammonia synthesis, where ammonia is formed out of nitrogen and water, and renewable energy sources fuel the process. The goal of this thesis is to give insight into the required performance metrics of the electrolyser and its production process in order for this technology to become technologically feasible and competitive with a Haber-Bosch process. This is done by investigating different options for the pre-treatment, electrochemical ammonia synthesis and separation steps, and comparing their energy requirements. The final product of this thesis is a process design for an electrochemical ammonia synthesis plant with a production capacity of 1,500 tonnes per day. Cryogenic distillation and pressure swing adsorption are researched and modeled as nitrogen generators. An adsorption column for the pressure swing adsorption unit is modeled in Matlab, while Aspen is used for modeling of the distillation column. Subsequently, an alkaline and a proton exchange membrane electrolyser are considered as ammonia synthesisers. The electrochemical cells are modeled as black boxes, operating at 353 K and 1 bar and 30 bar respectively. Next, a distillation column and a flash drum are modeled in Aspen as ammonia separators. Finally, four different process diagrams are created, two that are based on an alkaline electrolyser and two based on a proton exchange membrane electrolyser. Their overall energy consumptions are analysed and for both types of electrolysers the most optimal route for ammonia production is found. The results of this thesis point out that cryogenic distillation is preferred over adsorption for the generation of nitrogen, with an energy consumption of 0.56 kWh/kg nitrogen for compression, cooling and distillation. Adsorption can be competitive with cryogenic distillation when the nitrogen recovery rate is increased, or at lower production capacities. In a reasonable case for future electrolysers, operating at a cell voltage of 1.77 V and a Faradaic efficiency of 100%, the energy consumption for an alkaline electrolyser amounts to 12.00 kWh/kg ammonia and to 11.95 kWh/kg ammonia for a proton exchange membrane electrolyser. A distillation column was considered as utility for the separation of ammonia from the KOH solute product stream from an alkaline electrolyser. For the cathodic product stream from a proton exchange membrane electrolyser, containing only ammonia, hydrogen and nitrogen, flash separation was determined to be the best separation technology. For both separation options, it was found that an ammonia concentration of at least 10 mol% in the cell’s product stream is required for an efficient separation. Ultimately, with electrolysers operating at 1.77 V and a Faradaic efficiency of 70%, the total energy consumption of an alkaline based process is equal to 17.30 kWh/ kg ammonia and 15.45 kWh/kg ammonia for a proton exchange membrane based process, with overall energy efficiencies of 30% and 33% respectively. Based on the energy consumption of their respective pre¬treatment and separation steps, a proton exchange membrane electrolyser is favoured over an alkaline electrolyser. In order for an alkaline based process to be advantageous, its electrochemical cell should consume at least 1.80 kWh/kg ammonia less than a proton exchange membrane electrolyser. Finally, currently it is not possible for AEL or PEMEL based ammonia synthesis processes to be competitive with the Haber-Bosch production process in terms of energy consumption. However, with Faradaic efficiencies of 100% and minimal overpotentials, a PEMEL based process does come close to reaching this objective.","Ammonia production; Electrochemistry; Process modeling; Separation technologies; Energy analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this thesis it is argued that exposing this internal state to outside applications by making it queryable, opens the road for novel use-cases. To this end, we introduce S-Query: a system and reference architecture where the state of stream operators can be queried - either live or through snapshots, achieving different isolation levels. It is shown how this can be implemented in an existing open-source stream processor and how queryable state can affect the performance of such a system.

In order to face this challenge, stormwater harvesting for aquifer storage and recovery has gained interest over the past decades. However, pollutants from various surfaces are transported with the runoff, posing a threat for receiving groundwater upon aquifer infiltration. Biofiltration is a low-cost and low-energy technology that uses natural processes to improve the stormwater quality. Heavy metals are a contaminant of concern, because of their lack of degradability and toxicity at low levels. So far, removal potential has been shown in lab and column tests, but field research is limited. Furthermore, most biofiltration studies focused on removal of total metals, whereas dissolved metals are known to have higher bioavailibilities and thus toxicities. This research aims to gain more insight in the processes in field scale biofilters, by monitoring and analysing the concentrations of metals (Fe, Mn, As, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn) in the inlet and the outlet of a stormwater biofilter in Spangen, Rotterdam. In the analysis, a distinction was made between the total metal concentrations, consisting of dissolved and suspended metals, and dissolved metal concentrations. The main chemical water composition was also monitored, to get a better picture of the conditions in which the biofilter was operated. This information was used to identify how the design and operation of the system can be improved with regards to metal removal. Additionally, a transport model in PHREEQC was used to estimate the lifetime of the biofilter before breakthrough occurs, and how operational choices affect this lifetime. Preferential flows and short-circuiting as a result of design- and operational choices were uncovered by analysis of the electrical conductivity. Heterogeneous distribution of water on the filter and the inlet located closely to the outlet contributed to this. A great variation in hydraulic conductivity supported these observations. The hydraulic conductivity was generally much higher than is recommended for biofilters. Additionally, the system was irrigated with recovered water from the aquifer to avoid a foul smell of extracted water and keep the biofilter wet during longer dry periods. This means that the system was not only fed with stormwater, but also with water from the aquifer. Feeding of two different water sources with different compositions lead to the increase of total and dissolved concentrations of As, Co, Cu, Ni \&amp; Pb in the outlet, as well as higher dissolved Zn concentrations. Phoshate, ammonium, and total and dissolved concentrations of Fe, Mn, and Cr on the other hand decreased. The effect of mixing of two different waters was accounted for, by estimating the expected concentration of each pollutant if mixing was the only mechanism effecting their concentration. This was done using mixing fractions based on the electrical conductivity. Differences in estimated and measured concentrations showed that the release and removal of various pollutants was not a mere result of mixing only. The change in water composition and subsequent competition for sorption spots was found to be the main mechanism involved. The transport model showed that preferential flows resulted in C/C0 = 0.8 breakthrough of metals occurring much faster than in a plug flow. These observations show that the current design and operation of the biofilter do not provide adequate removal of metals in the biofilter.","Stormwater Biofiltration; Heavy Metals; PHREEQC; Urban stormwater management; Adsorption; Surface Complexation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","","51.920219, 4.434852"

This research deployed an experimental study through an online questionnaire, in which people were asked to evaluate their attitudes towards a novel design and a typical design for electric water kettles and Bluetooth speakers. Contrasting to the hypotheses, the results show that people more strongly prefer a typical-looking product for a strong brand than a weak brand. Moreover, the preference for a typical design is weaker and less significant for a weak brand. The possible reason could be that the product categories used in this research are mainly driven by utilitarian motivations instead of the predefined utilitarian and expressive motivations. People pursue little expressive need, so a visually novel product may be unnecessary for self-expression of uniqueness. Conversely, a more typical design might better fulfill the practical need for products and hence is preferred. Meanwhile, a strong brand helps to create more confidence about the possible performance quality and hence product choices than a weak brand, so the preference for a typical design is stronger for a strong brand than a weak brand.","visual novelty; brand strength; Product Design; consumer perceptions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Reset control, as one of the nonlinear controllers, has more simple structure and easier to implement thus make more and more people pay attention to it. Integrator in PID creates high gain at low frequencies which gives benefits for reference tracking ability of the system so for high-tech industrial field more integrators are needed. The problem for more integrators in the system will introduce more phase loss at bandwidth which leads instability into the system. Reset control thus can help with dealing the problem by overcoming the limitation of linear controller. In current literature, frequency domain performance of using reset control is mainly focused. The performance in time domain should be also investigated.

This means that theconstruction industry should shift from its current ‘take-make-waste’ approachtowards a circular approach. The number of buildings of more than 100 m inheight are increasing in the Netherlands, due to the lack of horizontal space.This means that strategies should be investigated on how high-rise buildingscan be constructed in a circular manner. It is found that there are currently alarge number of high-rise buildings that are being demolished. The main reasonfor these demolition cases is that building owners want to replace theirbuilding with a new one, with new technologies and perhaps a new buildingfunction. Abuilding that is adaptable to these changes would not have to bedemolished,  which is why the circularitystrategy of Design for Adaptability is interesting for high-rise buildings.There is a lack of research on the measurement of theDesign for Adaptabilitystrategy on the building level. Therefore, in this research a BuildingAdaptability Indicator is created to measure the adaptability of a building. TheBuilding Adaptability Indicator is constructed from a study on how adaptabilitycan be achieved in a building. It is found that building adaptability isgoverned by three sub-indicators: openness, reserved capacity, andfloor-to-floor height. The Building Adaptability Indicator helps structuraldesigners to prove what amount of adaptability can be achieved with a certainextra material use. It is found that the adaptability can be increased with126% by increasing the structural element dimensions by up to 60%, leading to atotal material volume increase of 38%. Additionally, it is found that purelyfrom amicro economics point of view, the investment into a high adaptabilitycannot be justified due to the high initial investment combined with a low rentincome. However, from a macroeconomics point of view, policy makers caninfluence the construction industry to invest in buildings with a lowenvironmental impact, which is already done by the Dutch government throughsubsidies. Currently, adaptability is not considered in the calculation of theenvironmental impact, which means that investors do not have an incentive toimplement adaptability in their buildings. In this research, the BuildingAdaptability Indicator I simplemented in the calculation of the environmentalimpact, which leads to the conclusion that buildings with a high adaptabilityare more interesting from a circularity point of view. It is concluded that atthe moment, only investors with circularity ambitions will invest in adaptablebuildings. Investors that lack circularity ambitions can be encouraged toinvest in adaptable buildings as well. This can be done by implementingadaptability in the calculation of the environmental impact, for which ownersof adaptable buildings will receive subsidies. This will shift the constructionindustry more towards adaptable buildings, which will prevent demolition andlead to a lower environmental impact across the industry.   ","Design for Adaptability; High-rise Buildings; Circularity Assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

(mentor); van Hoof, C.A. (graduation committee); Della Santina, C. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Active inference is a novel brain theory based on the free energy principle, stating that every organism, in order to stay alive, minimizes a certain free energy. This theory is being translated into robot control, hoping to mimic the capabilities of the brain. Research in this field of robotics is still quite young, and active inference has yet to mature into a reliable control theory. Implementations of active inference are scarce, and hierarchical implementations, containing multiple layers of active inference, are almost non-existent. This work presents the first implementation of hierarchical active inference performing online control on a robot in continuous state-space. The robot in question is a skid-steering mobile robot, on which two different active inference controllers are implemented and compared. The first controller is a non-hierarchical active inference controller giving wheel speed commands to the default PID controller of the robot manufacturer based on desired body velocities. The second controller is a novel implementation of a hierarchical active inference controller, that besides the function of the first controller, also replaces the low-level PID control with active inference, resulting in two-layers of active inference ultimately taking desired body velocities as inputs and translating it into open loop voltage commands for the motors. Both controllers are tuned to give roughly the same step responses in order to get a clearer view on the differences between non-hierarchical and hierarchical active inference. During the tuning process of the hierarchical controller, it became clear that no amount of tuning could get the (causal) states to convergence sufficiently fast. This problem was identified to be caused by the message passing in between the layers of active inference, where the prediction error from below negatively impacts convergence. This impact scales together with the tuning parameters, and therefore is not easily fixed by tuning alone. A potential solution is given in the form a an extra parameter in front of the upwards prediction error, giving the ability the independently tune the impact of this error on the behaviour of the system. This solution is used to fully tune the hierarchical controller, after which the performance is compared to the non-hierarchical controller, using a series of experiments. A total of 8 experiments are done where both controllers are tested performing two driving actions in two situations, namely cornering and pivoting on the ground and with the wheels suspended. The non-hierachical controller, as a baseline, performed satisfactory, but the hierarchical controller does not run smoothly on the ground, potentially struggling with the stick-slip of the wheel-ground interactions. From this it seems that using active inference for the low-level, as compared to something like PID, is less suitable. However, that conclusion is too premature for this work as the available encoder feedback frequency for the active inference is way lower than what the MCU-level PID has access to, making the comparison less fair. The main contribution of this work lies in the insight in the implementation structure of hierachical active inference for continuous state-space control, which can be further built upon, using the lessons learned during implementation.","Active Inference; Hierarchical; skid steer mobile robot; Free Energy Principle; Implementation; Robot Control; Online control; Continuous state-space","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Janssen, M.F.W.H.A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Digital transformation in procurement is important for Purchasing and Supply Management (PSM) organisations to develop global organisational competitiveness. Generally, procurement performance can be determined and improved through the use of a maturity model. Existing models do not cover the latest (e-)procurement processes (E-Sourcing, Procure-to-Pay, and Supplier Relationship Management) resulting from digitalisation. Therefore, an extension to existing maturity models was required to assess company performance. A literature study was conducted to describe and explain meaningful concepts and several maturity models were selected to review and compare the frameworks most suitable for an extension. Experiences of a major PSM organisation called the Corporate Group strengthened the research study by determining key topics and industry best practices, providing a foundation for the extension. A company analysis resulted in an understanding of (digital) procurement and the selection of Schiele (2007) due to its comprehensiveness. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with procurement experts to review Schiele's model and develop an extension. The extended model contains an additional spend management domain and a new dimension covering e-procurement. Multiple purchasing functions and stage descriptions were developed, whereby the model consists of 56 original and 22 new assessment questions. The new dimension includes Spend &amp; Data Management, Contract Management, Market Intelligence, E-Sourcing, Transactional Procurement, and Supplier Relationship Management. Entity A is part of The Corporate Group and provided the ideal opportunity to test the extended model through a multiple-case study. Maturity assessments were conducted of several operating companies (OpCos) to determine maturity levels and whether the extended model actually measured purchasing maturity. The extended model was able to quickly provide a performance overview and guide the OpCos towards improvement. Self-assessments as an alternative for third-party audits were provided, including a digitalised approach to process data easily. However, comparing results among OpCos outside of their sub-unit delivered an unexpected outcome. It was questionable whether the model measured purchasing maturity or rather the perception of it. Although the results were unexpected, the extension appeared to be more accurate. This was most likely due to the elaborate stage descriptions, enabling assessors to identify stage levels more easily. This research study provided a foundation for assessing e-procurement using an extended maturity model but limited itself to the Corporate Group. Thereby, it confirmed the criticism regarding the four stages being too rigid. Potential future research is recommended to improve both the extended model and the assessment approach. First, it must be shown to what extent e-procurement is covered in the new dimension and whether the extended model can be sufficiently generalised. Interviews should be conducted with procurement experts from different companies or industries to validate the extension through statistical analysis. Secondly, the assessment approach could be improved by including a control person and more experienced people, ensuring critical thinking and more realistic maturity levels. Self-assessments are not necessarily less reliable compared to external audits, but they rather need support to guide the process through a standard protocol. The subsequent step should be to formalise a proper action plan to initiate improvement.","Purchasing Maturity; E-procurement; Maturity Model; Assessment; Measurement; Extension","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

For some emerging countries, ill-advised policies, unfortunate market development, and a bad starting position together with the already complex nature of the electricity sector caused circular debt to accumulate. Circular debt is a self-reinforcing shortfall of revenue throughout the value chain that tends to look like a “vicious circle” without a proper solution. This study focuses on one of the root causes of circular debt: expensive and inefficient electricity generation. This thesis aims to research the effect of investors’ investment behaviour and the price-setting strategy of market regulators on circular debt in the context of the energy transition. Therefore, this study follows two main steps: (i) an agent-based investment model is used to link actor behaviour to the contracted market prices and the variable renewable energy share, (ii) a qualitative analysis links the model results to the development of circular debt. The results of the agent-based investment model show a decreasing electricity price in all scenarios. Furthermore, the market regulator’s price-setting strategy has a more significant influence on the contracted market price than investors’ investment attitude. In addition, this study’s qualitative research confirms the positive causal relationship between contracted market prices and circular debt of previous studies. However, no conclusions can be drawn about the degree of causality between lower contracted market prices and an improved circular debt position. Finally, the analysis also shows a mismatch between the short-term problem of circular debt and the long-term solution of integrating renewable energy. Integration of variable renewable energy is not a solution for the current circular debt crisis but a vital long-term driver to prevent the repetition of circular debt crises.","Agent-Based Modeling; Emerging countries; Circular debt; Pakistan; Electricity system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Now we know that this is not the case: 72% of children with ADHD still have it as adults, meaning that an estimated 2.1% of adults in the Netherlands have some form of ADHD. This means that these people still have symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and/or impulsivity at a later age. Besides that, self-regulation can be difficult, among other so-called 'executive functioning' skills. This can lead to difficulty focusing and finishing tasks, through procrastination and distraction. This project focuses on just that: how adults with ADHD be helped to focus and get things done, through design. At the start of this project, all adults with ADHD in the scope of the project, which is narrowed down this to students in the second phase of ideation. As a graduation project in the master Design for Interaction, this project draws from Human- Centered Design. The perspectives and needs of the people involved are explored through design research methods, such as generative research. The project then focuses on procrastination as its intervention point, as nearly all students with ADHD experience this, and for them a good or bad start of a study session can determine whether something gets done that day at all. It was found that one of the most consistent ways to motivate people with ADHD to start and keep studying is a study buddy. The rest of the project explores how to make finding new study buddies as low-threshold as possible. The result of this project is a concept called ConnectMe, an online study platform that promises to instantly match a student with ADHD to another student with ADHD, with the click of a button. ConnectMe mediates the study session with a stranger by offering an ice breaker, and guiding the two study partners through setting a study schedule for the day. The platform helps sticking to the set study periods (bursts) and breaks, and evaluating the study day. ConnectMe allows students with ADHD to send buddy requests if their study session was a success, invite outside friends to the platform to study together, and so build out their personal study community. The concept is evaluated with students with ADHD by way of a walkthrough of an online prototype. The students were positive about the design, expecting it to do a good job of helping them deal with procrastination, distractions, and creating a working atmosphere. Overall, it is well-designed, and students especially liked the time planner system.","ADHD; ADD; Human-Centered Design; Generative research; Platform; UX Design; Design for Interaction; Adults; Students; Co-creation; Procrastination; Distraction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Furthermore, in addition to the proprietary ISAs that have been prevalent, the free and open RISC-V ISA has seen major interest. The modularity of the RISC-V ISA allows it to be extended with many instruction set extensions. One such extension that aids in the processing of large amounts of data is the P-extension, which introduces packed-SIMD instructions. In this thesis, the RISC-V based open-source CVA6 processor is extended to support the SIMD instructions defined by the P-extension. In order to do so, the 332 instructions of the P-extension are divided into subsets based on the type of instructions used by applications that make use of SIMD instructions and the hardware needed to implement those instructions. Due to time constraints 268, or 80.7%, of the total 332 instructions were implemented. However, this includes all the instructions that could be utilized by the used benchmarks. Therefore, the benchmark results show the full performance achievable by the P-extension. These 268 instructions make up the basic, MAC 8-bit, MAC 16-bit, and MAC 32-bit subsets. The ALU has been modified to operate in a SIMD manner on 8 8-bit, 4 16-bit, 2 32-bit, and 64-bit elements. Moreover, it has been extended to support new operations like data movement or reorganization instructions. Like the ALU, the multiplier has also been converted into a SIMD multiplier using a SIMD Baugh-Wooley scheme. Furthermore, the multiplier has been extended to also function as a MAC unit. The impact of these newly added SIMD instructions is tested in an ideal scenario of matrix multiplication as well as in a real-world machine learning application. In matrix multiplication, a speedup of up to 8.8x and 7.2x is seen for 8-bit and Q7 elements and 4.9x and 3.8x for 16-bit and Q15 elements when only using instructions from the basic subset. When also using the MAC instructions, the speedup increases to up to 12.3x and 12.6x for 8-bit and Q7 elements and 6.7x and 6.5x for 16-bit and Q15 elements. The real-world benchmark consists of an image recognition convolutional neural network based on the CIFAR-10 data set. In this benchmark, a speedup of 2.1x and 3.3x is obtained for respectively the basic subset and with MAC instructions. However, the additional hardware comes at a cost, specifically an increase of 5.0% LUT and 0.05% flip-flop usage for the basic subset or 7.2% increased LUT and 0.56% increased flip-flop usage with the basic and MAC subsets. While the additional hardware can have an impact on the maximum achievable clock frequency, the critical path remains in the FPU. The maximum achievable clock frequency is therefore not impacted and reaches 70 MHz on a Xilinx Kintex-7 FPGA.","RISC-V; SIMD; FPGA; CPU; Processor; CVA6; P-extension","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research is done on different collaborative relationships, but the contractor and engineering agency collaboration is relatively new, as it did not exist before the major contractual change from traditional contracts to integrated contracts. The most commonly used integrated contract is the design and construct contract, which therefore is the contract focused on in this research. As project managers are the ones who facilitate collaboration, the main research question is defined as: ‘How can project managers improve the collaboration between contractors and engineering agencies in a design and construct contract in order to realize a better integral design?’ The collaborative process between the two organizations is identified, which in the Netherlands is contractually based upon The New Rules (DNR 2011). The iterative process to realize an integral project design is carried out by a project team, which is supported by the usage of digital systems and managed focusing on the project design and outcome. This collaborative process can be facilitated by several collaboration conditions, of which the most and least important ones to improve the collaboration are identified. This means that the research is focused on what is most important to improve the collaboration, and not what is most important within the collaboration. The collaboration conditions ranked highest are the basis of the three views that are most important to improve the collaboration: project driven members, similar project focus and integral overview. These views are the starting point of six managerial implications that a project manager should implement in the collaborative design process to improve the collaboration between contractors and engineering agencies. Although applying these managerial implications into the process do not guarantee an improved collaborative relationship, they can be seen as the most important aspects to focus on.","Collaboration; Contractor; Engineering Agency; Design Process","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This thesis is conducted in collaboration with Directie X of the Ministry of Justice and Security (JenV), who aims to strengthen the innovation capacity within JenV to keep up with societal needs. One way they do this is by supporting AI experiments. These experiments are procedures undertaken to improve the current way of working, not just to validate hypotheses.The experiments are driven by two drivers: innovation and AI, which bring along some challenges: currently, JenV learns from the AI experiments, but the result is not an innovation. In addition, JenV is reluctant to implement innovative improvements as they are closely watched by society. Besides, the magnitude of these challenges increases when AI is involved. Hence, most of these AI experiments end after the proof of concept and experience a silent death.A strategy supported by a tool is desired to prevent the experiments’ results from being left unharnessed. Therefore, this graduation project will implement these takeaways by solving the following research question: “Why does experimenting with AI rarely lead to a new way of working at JenV?”<br/>The research has provided insights into the many challenges behind this question; the challenges can be subdivided into five perspectives: strategy, ecosystem, results, process &amp; governance and culture.During the research, it became clear that the technology (AI) was not a limiting factor of significant importance for implementing the outcome. However, the scope of this master thesis does not reach all experiments conducted at JenV but is specifically focused on AI experiments. The research has resulted in the following problem statement: “Initiators experience uncertainty prior to AI experiments because they have no clarity about the trajectory of the AI experiment and mainly lack clarity about who the stakeholders are and how they should approach them. This unclarity about the stakeholders, in turn, results in more uncertainty about the AI experiment.”Directie X should support the initiators to bring about implementation without being part of the whole process. Therefore, three principles have been developed. Directie X hands over to the initiators by translating the principles into a tool. The tool, therefore, only serves as a means of communication of the principles and acts as a hands-on concept that the initiators can get started with.The three principles:1. It’s all clear! (Clarity)2. Doing it with! (Engagement)3. It’s clear to all! (Transparency)<br/>Ultimately, based on several design requirements, a toolkit has been developed that complies with the three principles: The CET toolkit. The CET toolkit helps to reduce the uncertainties of the initiators prior to an AI experiment by focusing on clarity about the stakeholders, engaging the stakeholders and transparency.The CET toolkit consists of an introductory page, Experience stories, six Stakeholder canvases and eight Reflection canvases.<br/>The purposes of the different parts of the CET toolkit are the following:- The purpose of The Experience stories is that the initiators learn from others without there being consequences.- The purpose of the Stakeholder canvases is to clarify the stakeholders to the initiator to reduce the uncertainty prior to the experiment. In addition, it entails engagement by providing insights about the roles’ wants &amp; needs, and concerns, which can function as guidelines for involving the roles.- The purpose of the Reflection canvases is to help the next initiator gain insights that can be incorporated in the Experience stories and learn by letting the initiator become aware of the actions taken during the AI experiment.<br/>An evaluation of the concept answers whether the CET toolkit is viable, desirable and feasible and meets the design requirements. The assessment is done through an online collaborative validation session and an online survey. The review has led to a few adjustments. Therefore, the thesis finishes with recommendations in the field of exploring, designing and sharing.The CET toolkit is a validated first step to reduce the initiators’ uncertainties through clarity, engagement and transparency.<br/>This thesis aims to contribute to the way of working of JenV. The result is a strategy supported by a tool. This thesis helps Directie X increase the chance AI experiments go into practice and lead to innovation.","Experimenting; Innovation; Implementation; Government; Artificial Intelligence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In order to find the possibilities of implementation of e-flows in Dutch water management, it is necessary to first explore the current role of e-flows in projects, plans and policies. Data collection is primarily done through interviews. In addition to this, analysis of policy documents is used as a method of data collection. The collected qualitative data is analysed to provide an overview of the key factors of implementation in Dutch water management. Whether these factors provide challenges for implementation or act as enabling factors provides insight into the opportunities and methods for additional implementation of e-flows in Dutch water management. The results of this research show that e-flows efforts have been made in the Netherlands, but are not defined as e-flows. Examples are meandering of rivers to increase natural flow and water retention, removing weirs to stimulate fish migration and changing creek dimensions, a drought displacement series, increasing tidal dynamics and secondary channels. The motivation behind these projects often are European policies, the Water Framework Directive and Natura 2000. Key factor influencing e-flows implementation in Dutch water management are trade-offs of water users and functions, justification and support, government, management and success. Challenges rising when implementing e-flows are navigating politics dynamics, land availability, performing proper trade-offs, no natural flow reference and sectoral administration. Opportunities present in Dutch water management are a system approach, adaptive, integral management, raising justification and support and creating a coherent narrative. By using opportunities to navigate the challenges, recommendations for Dutch water management follow for further implementation of e-flows to reach ecological objectives. Recommendations are creating a coherent narrative around e-flows, using the nitrogen crisis and the effects of climate change to increase discussion on land use, water use and current lay-out of the water system, developing of better trade-off tools and facilitating change in government administration. In general, many similarities are present between e-flows implementation in Dutch water management and literature. These similarities mostly involve water management in general and the role of ecology in it, like the need for adaptive management, integral solutions and difficulties in measuring success. A lack of room as a large challenge for e-flows implementation is not encountered before in studies. In the USA, Australia and South-Africa, countries with the highest e-flows implementation rate, land use is much less intensive and water system modifications are more guided by the construction of (hydro-power) dams and large scale irrigation water use instead of shipping and flood control. It is likely the reason why dam flow regulation and water allocation receives much attention in e-flows literature instead of land availability.","Environmental flows; Water management; Netherlands; Ecology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

Searching any of the sections of the play field has a certain probability of failing; the searcher might get lost, trapped or captured herself. The goal is to find the search that maximises the probability of finding all targets, and to find the hiding spot that minimises it. We define and solve the search and rescue game on a play field for which movement between any two section of the play field is always possible. We also define and solve the game played on a tree for which movement is limited by the tree structure. Due to the complexity of this game, we restrict ourselves to one target.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","class=""MsoNormal"">The ambitious transition towards a renewable future is being made possible by power electronic systems that facilitate effective control and efficient conversion of energy. One such system is the solid-state transformer (SST) which aims to replace conventional transformers by offering larger energy densities and flexible power flow. However, these benefits come at the cost of severe mixed-frequency stresses experienced by the medium frequency transformer (MFT) of the SST. These stresses are characterised by fast-rising pulsed waveforms of several tens of kilovolts repeating at frequencies of up to a hundred kilohertz. In contrast to pure sinusoids, the behaviour of dielectrics undermixed-frequency stresses is to a large extent unknown. This research gap forms the core motivation behind this thesis project. To analyse these exciting yet extreme phenomenon, the first objective was to build a pulse modulator for testing cellulosic dielectrics under voltages up to 10 kV with rise-times ≈ 2 μs at frequencies between 10 to 50kHz. The topology consists of a rectified DC supply feeding a SiC H-bridge pulse generator connected to a 4:200 pulse transformer and other variable test elements. The work began with selecting the switch and gate driver, simulations in LTspice and TINA-TI, and the fabrication of the PCB pulse generator prototype using Altium Designer. Next, a novel third-order PQR equation was derived for a PT with capacitive load involving the parasitic leakage flux Ls and distributed capacitance Cd. The influence of bobbin geometry on parasitics was studied with 20 different 3D printed iterations designed in Fusion 360. A failure mode analysis was conducted to identify weak points in a transformer, and the solutions detailed in this report. The final objective was to apply the produced waveforms of T<sub>r</sub> ≈ 1.8 µs across single-layer OIP samples at 10 kHz and 50 kHz. The sample strength was determined through ramp tests with 1 kV/s slope. The lifetime curves were obtained by performing ageing tests at 10 field strengths each for 21-41 samples, and fitting the median failure time into an inverse power-law model. The results show a clear reduction in lifetime at higher frequencies hinting at the unsuitability of OIP in its current form as an insulation for MFTs. A transition point was observed indicating a shift in the ageing mechanism at lower fields. The report ends with a discussion on future scopes of research.","Pulse modulator; Oil-paper; Solid State Transformer; Mixed frequency stress; lifetime test; Solid dielectric; High voltage; High voltage test source; Pulse transformer; Medium voltage; Pulse shaping; Silicon carbide","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-12-31","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

Raw materials are continuously extracted from nature, and the rate at which they can refill is insufficient to meet demand. This system suffers significant losses across the value chain (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2013). On the contrary, the circular economy concept proposes a circular model of 'reuse-refurbish-recycle' that focuses on reducing waste and optimizing resource value retention. The strategy is ideal to adopt in a high-growth, high-waste sector like the built environment. The reason this research was taken up is because a significant gap is seen within valuation practices. The current valuation methods, although efficient, collect data and provide property valuations based on previous studies. For example, when using a comparative method of property valuation, we compare one asset with a neighboring one, that has similar features. This process incorporates the older values already provided to this old building, without accounting for innovations such as reusability or adaptability of the components How different would the sector be if we incorporated the value of circular interventions to the original value determined, rather than looking back at older valuation standards? Will there be a significant difference, and, more importantly, would it impact the way real estate investors viewed circularity? On conducting the research, The primary hypothesis of this study was that there is a link between circularity and valuation and that this link can be incorporated within present valuation procedures. The thesis research explains how the connections can be made, as well as specific actual instances for each.

These have demonstrated their higher gas transfer rates in comparison to the conventional aeration systems presently in use. Depending on the imposed flow conditions, different regimes of vortices are formed, among which the Twisted vortical structure is observed to have the highest gas dissolution rates. This has probed several questions on the physical mechanisms responsible on both micro-and macroscopic scales. The present research aims to numerically analyse the flow field organisation in these vortices to reason the observed high gas transfer rates using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).  Transient simulations were performed on a three-dimensional radially structured hexahedral mesh. Multi-phase modelling was done using the Euler-Euler approach-based Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method, while the turbulent flow was modelled using Shear Stress Transport (SST) based on k - ω equations with curvature correction. The choice of boundary conditions and their location is crucial for forming a stable vortex in the hyperbolic funnels. The position of the air-water interface from experimental results was used to validate the obtained numerical results. Two regimes of the vortex, namely the Twisted and Straight vortical structures, were evaluated for their gas transfer capabilities in terms of Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT), interfacial area and mixing in the bulk.  Instabilities arise in the secondary flow field of these vortical structures analogous to the Taylor-vortices that develop in the well known Taylor-Couette flow systems. In hyperbolic funnels, these instabilities aid in advecting the bulk of liquid to the air-water interfacial region and also enhance mixing within the bulk of water. The former enhances the gas transfer rates while the latter promotes uniform mixing. The strength of these instabilities is qualitatively analysed in terms of average vorticity per unit mass of water. This is found to be higher in the Twisted regime in comparison to other regimes. This is augmented by high air-water interfacial area making this regime possess superior gas transfer rates.  Although the gas transfer rates are high, water exiting the funnel is undersaturated at the given operating conditions. In order to further enhance the amount of gas dissolved few possibilities are qualitatively discussed at the end of this study.     ","Aeration systems; Hyperbolic funnels; Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD); Turbulence Modelling; Multiphase Flow; Swirling flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy and Process Technology","",""

All over the globe, plans are in motion to achieve this goal. This implies addition of new elements to the grid in the form of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs). These affect the working of distribution grids and to ensure reliable as well as safe operation, it is important to keep a track on the grid’s state regularly which is essential to a Distribution System Operator (DSO). For this very reason, Distribution System State Estimator (DSSE) has been introduced and has been a prominent topic of interest which has been discussed in literature over the past two decades. Because of lack in observability of the network owing to unavailability of measurements and the stochastic load profiles of the distribution network, DSSE poses its own challenges. For this very reason, it is necessary to validate the working of a suitable DSSE that is affected by the continuous changes in the grid. By selecting a suitable algorithm, this thesis attempts to solve the observability issue by introduction of pseudo-measurements. The work in this thesis comprises of sensitivity analysis of Weighted Least Squares(WLS) algorithm tested on two networks in the Netherlands; a synthetic model of an anonymized distribution network and a part of Stedin’s distribution network which has limited measuring devices data available. The percentage of pseudo-measurements is varied to determine the state estimator’s accuracy. Also the statistical validity of the algorithm against measures like bias and consistency is determined with the help of scenarios generated by using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS). The results obtained prove the effectiveness of the selected algorithm for DSSE and are important for the DSOs to make critical decisions when needed for grid operation.","State Estimation; Medium voltage networks; weighted least square; Load generation; Smart grid; distribution system operator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

If left to their own devices, they tend to cause undesired interactions. Our project proposes a design philosophy that can reduce the amount and severity of these interactions, improving the overall acceptance of sidewalk delivery robots. Our proposed design philosophy uses the power of expressive movement to create delivery robots with a streetwise attitude. Being streetwise means possessing behavioural qualities that allow you to deal with the potential difficulties of an urban environment. Using creative association, we narrowed these qualities down to confidence, pride, calmness, stability and smoothness. A design probe study confirmed that the streetwise qualities can be used to differentiate between desirable and undesirable events. Next, we propose a methodology to combine our streetwise qualities with movement theories. We verify the efficacy of the method in a 2D movement study. The results suggest that our interpretation of the movement theories is on the right track, but more iterations are necessary to improve the method's reliability. During our final evaluation, we combine all our findings in a 3D video prototype scenario to confirm if they hold up in a more realistic and relatable context. We showed participants two different versions of this scenario to compare a streetwise delivery robot with a non-streetwise delivery robot in terms of desirability. Both versions turned out to have positives and negatives, but overall, the streetwise robot appeared more favourable.","Delivery; Robot; Streetwise; Movement; Animation; Behaviour; Emotion; Interaction; Suspension; Industrial Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

The flame under consideration is a CH4/H2 (1:1) bluff-body stabilized flame known as HM1. The numerical calculations of the flow physics has been completed by using a commercial CFD code namely Ansys Fluent 19-R3, where the computational domain is assumed to be two dimensional and axis-symmetric in nature due to the cylindrical symmetry of the burner with an structured grid for meshing. The turbulence is modelled by using a two equation Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes model, namely the standard k – ϵ model with a modification in the Cϵ1 from 1.44 to 1.60. The chemical mechanism used in the project was the GRI 2.11 mechanism developed by the Gas Research Institute, USA. Next, postprocessing tools like the Reactor Network Model (RNM) and Ansys NOx post-processor were used as an alternative, possibly a better way to obtain the NO species<br/>concentrations. The acquired results from the simulation are thoroughly analysed and were compared to earlier results on the HM1 flame in the literature and validated by using the experimental data documented by the University of Sydney in collaboration with the TNF Workshop. The results showed that the steady diffusion flamelet performed better than the FGM model and was in acceptable agreement with the experimental data, although some under-prediction and overpredictions were reported for NO and OH species.

Also, the link between terms “fit-for-purpose” and ‘project management” has not been conceptualized. The main objective of this research is to investigate the link between fit-for-purpose and project management and applications of FFP-PM (Fit-for-purpose Project Management) approach. The main research question is formulated as: How can the term Fit-for-purpose and its development be defined in the field of project management? This research adopted a coupling of bibliometric analysis and content analysis to comprehensively answer this question. The bibliometric analysis was conducted on the literature from recent 20 years to investigate the link from a theoretical perspective. This stage follows a three-step method, with Step I looking into term ”fit-for-purpose” in all management areas, Step II exploring different forms of adaptations in the PM, and Step III building the links between the previous two steps. FFP-PM was defined as a set of wisely selected adaptive methodologies, tools and expertise to manage project activities. To investigate the links from the practical perspective, a content analysis was conducted on 117 student essays of the course WB3501 Fit-for-purpose Project Management from the past 8 years (2013-2021). Many PM practices that are fit-for-purpose in nature were identified and included in the key findings of this analysis. These practices cover many aspects in PM and it was further concluded that FFP-PM consists of a broad set of PM methodologies that can manifest their ways in many aspects throughout the life-cycle of the projects. To validate the results, the preliminary findings from the previous analyses were brought across to be tested with external practitioners via two in-depth interviews, to check weather and to what extent these findings reflect the PM in the real world. The results suggested that the majority of the findings are recognizable based on their experiences. A few adjustments were made after discussing comments through revisiting the literature. The main research question was then answered by establishing a theoretical framework of FFP-PM, the components of which cover the need factors, enabler factors, characteristics and required skills and competences of the project managers under the framework of FFP-PM. Projects under FFP-PM are defined and shaped by specific values and strategies, and managed with conscious decision-making in light of learnings from history experiences, risk management conducted close to the stakeholders’ values, and a welcoming attitude towards uncertainties and changes.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

This research includes both aspects to assess the different options, from the sustainable point of view as the business point of view.The goal of this researchwas to investigate the possibilities to apply renewable energy sources to a vessel that transports polymetallic nodules from the Clarion-Clipperton Zone to Mexico in order to reduce the carbon footprint. Besides this, also look into which of these possibilities has the lowest costs. For this purpose, multiple propulsion drive train systems were examined which were based on the Panamax Leda C. The behavior of these new propulsion systems was examined to answer the following research question: “Which currently existing energy source(s) can be used to transport the polymetallic nodules from the Clarion-Clipperton Fracture zone to the coast of Mexico, a 2200 km route, and whose operational use is technically feasible in five years, in the most sustainable way and with the lowest costs?"". To answer this research question, the following steps have been undertaken. First current technologies and their state, were analysed using technology readiness levels (TRLs). The known data was established which included the cargo, the requirements for the fleet, the total days at sea, total amount of nodules collected in one year and the buffer of the mining vessel. With this information an optimal base case was determined in terms of energy consumption and costs. The base case is a Panamax bulk carrier called the Leda C with a deadweight of 81526 dwt.Two different key performance indicators (KPIs) were set to analyse the different performance systems. These KPIs are the emission reduction per tonne collected nodules in %/tonne and the costs per tonne collected nodules in $/tonne.To examine the different propulsion systems, their performances had to be checked for this specific route. In this route analysis there is looked at the probability of the wind, which was necessary to calculate the performances of the wind assisted ship propulsion (WASP) systems. Drive trains of the different propulsion systems were schematically given and analyzed to understand which systems should be implemented for the different propulsion systems. After this, the components of each propulsion was checked, looking at their performance, sizes and costs.The costs of the total drive trains of the different propulsion systems were elaborated. Finally, three different scenarios were chosen to examine the KPIs of the different propulsions.It is concluded that the most cost-effective technology for the RE on board systems is the Flettner rotor and for the alternative fuels this is biofuel (HVO). The propulsion systems discussed in this research will only be attractive when the CO2 tax will increase. It is concluded that the higher the carbon tax, the more attractive the alternative fuels become in terms of cost effectiveness.The advice for Allseas will be, if nothing changes, to not install a sustainable energy propulsion system. Because all systems will be more expensive than the base case. If regulations make it necessary to reduce emissions, it is advised to install the Flettner rotor in hybrid with the current engine.","Wind assisted ship propulsion (WASP); solar system; Hydrogen; ammonia; Biofuels; Innovation; Sustainability; Transport; bulk carrier; Alternative propulsion system on board; Fuel Cell","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This research focussed on embedding iron electrocoagulation (Fe-EC) within a biologically active rapid sand filter (RSF) by submerging horizontally perforated (Fe(0)) electrodes. These electrodes were designed in such a way that they could easily be submerged in the filter bed during backwashing. Based on As(V)/As(III) adsorption characteristics and iron removal mechanisms in a RSF it was hypothesized that the arsenic removal could be enhanced by placing the electrodes in the biologically active filter bed instead of in the supernatant. Iron to arsenic ratios (Fe:As) were reduced from 18.3 to 15.0 when the electrodes were placed in the filter bed instead of in the supernatant (for a charge dosage of 6.4 C/L and 150 µg/L As(III) in the influent), showing an improved arsenic removal efficiency. The arsenic oxidizing bacteria (AsOB) on top of the electrodes oxidized As(III) to As(V) (over 85 to 97% oxidation), which was subsequently removed by the iron that got released (by the embedded Fe-EC) and formed precipitates in the filter bed. The major drawback of embedding electrodes in the filter bed is the increase in energy consumption due to the increase in operating voltage. As(V) flowthrough experiments showed that the arsenic removal can be improved by lowering the pH from 8.0 to 7.0 and by increasing the charge dosage from 6.4 to 9.4 C/L. It was shown that besides arsenic removal efficiency, parameters as iron dosage, energy consumption, sludge production, and clogging have a significant relevance. Iron-As(V) experiments showed the flaws of the integrated system related to a partly homogeneous iron release and improper mixing, resulting in a decrease in the arsenic removal efficiency. Further, ways to potentially improve the design of the system are discussed and evaluated, pointing the way forward for future research.","Arsenic removal; Electrocoagulation; Rapid sand filters","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-12","","","","Water Management","",""

This transformation of the ATM system relies on the improvement of predictive models that predict the 4D-trajectory of an aircraft. Previous studies primarily applied deterministic models that compute a single predicted trajectory. These models were assessed on their predictive accuracy. However, the accuracy of the predictions is highly impacted by uncertainties that affect the progression of a flight. These uncertainties are commonly related to the lack of detailed information concerning the flight intent, or the inaccuracy of positional and weather-related data. This study applied two probabilistic techniques: the model-based particle filtering model and the data-driven Gaussian Process Regression. Both approaches model the uncertainties and provide a predictive distribution of trajectories that allows for the evaluation of both the accuracy and the uncertainty of the predictions. These models were applied to predict the descent trajectories of aircraft arriving at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. The results showed that the uncertainty of the predictions could be reduced by incorporating flight-plan data and meteorological data in the predictive models. Also, the accuracy was improved which demonstrates the importance of these sources of data in the predictions of aircraft trajectories.

In the context of cancer treatment, while X-Ray radiotherapy and chemotherapy remain the current standard, Proton beam therapy is an alternative with a compelling biological and medical rationale. It has been shown to reduce the damage to healthy tissue with superior targeting abilities. In this report, a novel 3D engineered scaffold is designed and fabricated by two-photon polymerization (2PP). 2PP provides high-resolution and reproducible scaffolds that are used to compare the response of cultured U251 cell line to Proton Beam irradiation. The cells are cultured on two- and three-dimensional scaffolds simultaneously for response comparison. Gamma-H2A.X is the marker used to identify the damage induced in the cells by the proton beams. The results show a higher DNA double-strand breakage in 2D cells as compared to those cultured in 3D. Differences in morphologies and proliferation are also observed. The discrepancy in proton radiation response could indicate a difference in the radioresistance of the cells or a difference in the rate of repair kinetics between 2D and 3D cells. Thus, these biomimetic engineered 3D scaffolds can be used to routinely assess the effects of proton therapy on tridimensional GBM cell networks. These scaffolds have also been proved to be effective with evaluation methods such as immunofluorescence and scanning electron microscopy.","two-photon polymerization; Proton Beam Irradiation; 3D Cell Culture; Glioblastoma; Cancer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-31","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Micro and Nano Engineering","",""

An MRI-compatible concept is designed, but two of its working principles need to be researched before further development. <br/>A possible solution for increasing precision is rotating the needle along the insertion axis. Literature has studied the effect rotation has on insertion force, tissue indentation and target displacement in axial direction, which all show a decrease. However, the effect of rotation on the needle end-point position in lateral direction is not yet researched, and this is a good indication of targeting precision. Therefore, this work has studied the effect of rotation on the precision of the needle end-point position in lateral direction. <br/>The concept uses pneumatically actuated stepper motors for the needle insertion.

Therefore, the effect of an actuation frequency of 10 Hz on the precision of the needle end-point position in lateral direction is studied as well. <br/>Both effects are researched by inserting a needle in a gelatin phantom at different angular velocities and at continuous versus discrete actuation. It is found that rotation significantly decreases the standard deviation in 6 of the 12 cases. The actuation frequency of 10 Hz does not significantly increase the standard deviation in 7 of the 8 cases. These results can be used to further increase the precision of a biopsy robot, whether it is for breast biopsy or another application.","Needle insertion; Rotation; precision; Breast cancer; Biopsy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-08-27","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

It brings economic wealth to many countries but is also one of the largest contributors to environmental pollution. Textile companies nowadays often mention sustainability in their business models. However, it is noticed that consumers do not trust the word sustainability when textile companies use it. The uncertainty about the actual sustainability of clothing has led to a need for a high credibility label that indicates the environmental and social sustainability of the production process of an item. This research therefore focuses on the research question: How can a widely recognized sustainability label indicate both the environmental and social impact of the production process of a clothing item in a way that best informs consumers during their purchasing practices? This exploratory research is conducted commissioned by and in collaboration with the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management. The research presents the first base of information that will contribute to the discussion of implementing a (mandatory) sustainability label. In order to analyse the research question, three phases in this research are completed: the use of labels, the environmental impact of a clothing item, and the social impact of a clothing item. The research concludes in multiple recommendations for further research due to the exploratory character of this research, recommendations for implementing the new sustainability label, and recommendations for policy makers.","sustainability; ecolabels; labels; government; social impact; environmental impact","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

Several loads like wind and wave loading are acting on the structure and therefore its foundation. It is important to involve the impact of this cyclic loading into the design of the structure. A cyclic load influences the strength and deformation characteristics of the soil. Due to this the cyclic loading the cyclic shear strength will decrease. This cyclic shear strength depends on several factors which can be influenced by soil properties and shear mechanisms. The aim of this Master thesis is to provide correlations between index parameters and the cyclic simple shear strength to observe how and which parameters influence the shear strength behaviour due to cyclic loading. This research focuses on the results from cyclic simple shear tests and only for cohesionless soil from North Sea sand. The project material was obtained from several offshore windfarm projects by Fugro, namely The Hollandse Kust West ,The Hollandse Kust Noord and The Hollandse Kust Zuid. Available data from these project locations is analysed and translated to cyclic resistance curves. In these curves the number of cycles to reach a nominal strain failure is plotted against a normalised cyclic shear strength, also called a cyclic stress ratio. The strain failure criterion was chosen at 3.75\% and a commonly equivalent number of cycles of 10. The soil parameters that are elaborated for this research are based on characteristics compared to density of the soil, grain structure and in-situ characteristics. These parameters are the relative density, fines content, mean particle size and the normalised cone penetration resistance. The relative density is an unknown parameter in this research and is determined in two ways. First, by considering in-situ data where it was measured along depth and an assumption was made about the real value based on the known depth range of the borehole sample. The second method was based on the initial void ratio measured in the laboratory to obtain a relation between the in-situ measured relative density and the initial void ratio, which is called the theoretical value of the relative density. From this thesis, it was concluded that due to the small range of data it was not possible to provide clear correlations and to observe trends of soil index parameters with the cyclic shear strength. By looking at the total range of the cyclic response of the data in the cyclic resistance curves and the elaborated soil parameters, the relative density and the fines content influence the shape of the power failure lines. A relatively high value of the relative density results in a larger range of different cyclic stress ratio values, i.e. a failure line with a higher gradient. An increment in fines content results in a relatively lower values for cyclic stress ratio and do not differ much by an increment of load cycles. This observation is based on the available results from this research with a relatively low amount of data and a small range of fines content.","Geotechnical Engineering; Cyclic loading; Offshore engineering; Sand","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

One of them is wirelessly updating the firmware, especially for the ones that are hard or dangerous to reach. Is it feasible to do a firmware update over LoRa, and what is its additional power consumption of the wireless sensors? In this thesis a LoRa Class B Firmware Update Over The Air (FUOTA) is implemented and evaluated. Up to 100 end-devices are used to research the scalibilities and power consumption of the end-devices. The focus is mainly on the tranmission of the firmware itself rather than installing the firmware on the end-devices.<br/>This study introduces a power consumption model based on measurements of real hardware. After that, experiments are performed to evaluate the packet losses when scaling up the number of end-devices. These experiments show that the setup time increases with the number of end-devices due to the duty cycle restriction of the gateway. Antother experiment, focusing on end-devices that are part of the network but do not need to be updated, shows these end-devices suffer in terms of packets loss due to packet blockings during a firmware update.<br/>The extra setup time needed when scaling up the number of end-devices causes higher power consumption when more devices needs to be updates. To reduce the energy consumption during this setup phase, an improvement to the communciation protocol is presentated at the end of this thesis.

(mentor); Amoozandeh, A. (graduation committee); Radaelli, G. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","People in healthcare, warehousing, and the agriculture sector all have one thing in common. They require labour which can be demanding on the human body, this could lead to problems in the long term. A way to alleviate these problems is to use a passive exoskeleton. While passive exoskeletons can have a variety of different use cases and types of support, this thesis will focus on a wearable passive back support. A company specialising in these passive wearable back supports is Laevo. They have their own version of such a mechanism using torsional springs which are attached to the upper torso and legs. This ensures that when bending the mechanism provides support. However when walking, these springs are also activated and make walking more difficult and require more energy. A way to solve this problem is to use a differential mechanism. Such a mechanism can be quite complex and bulky and comprised of a lot of parts. A solution could be found in the world of compliant mechanisms. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to create and analyse a compliant differential mechanism for use in passive exoskeleton design. As a basis for a design, the proposed mechanism by Maurice Valentijn was used. The two main challenges were the location of the rotational axis and a relatively low stiffness ratio between the bending and walking scenario. While this mechanism showed potential as a compliant differential mechanism, it did have some problems which needed to be overcome before the use in a passive exoskeleton would be feasible.<br/><br/>The proposed design to solve these challenges consists of a thin-walled beam, with an H-shaped cross section, which has two curves forming a U-shape. By applying constraints on the sides the rotational axis of the mechanism could be changed to align with the rotational axis of the hip joint. This mechanism in combination with reintroduction of potential energy using springs to lower the stiffness of the mechanism when walking. This allowed for a design which could be used as a compliant differential mechanism in the use of exoskeleton design. To investigate the proposed design for a compliant differential mechanism, the mechanism first needs to be modelled and optimised to meet the requirements needed for the use in an exoskeleton. For the optimisation, a framework is proposed which integrates the use of a simulated Ansys model in combination with a Matlab optimisation problem. With this optimised model the behaviour of the mechanism can be analysed. The behaviour of the mechanism is investigated in the paper in Chapter 4. In this paper the simulated model is validated using an experimental setup. This paper is the main contribution of this thesis.<br/><br/>Findings of the paper show that the stiffness of the mechanism can be significantly reduced by reintroducing potential energy into the system to compensate the stored potential elastic energy in the material during walking. This caused the mechanism to have different types of behaviour: positive stiffness, zero stiffness, and negative stiffness. These stiffnesses depend on the initial preload of the springs, more initial preload means more energy is stored in the springs and releases more energy for the same displacement. This changes the overall potential energy to have these three aforementioned stiffness states. Zero stiffness is the most interesting for exoskeleton design, this minimises the amount of work required while walking without having bistable behaviour in the mechanism. <br/><br/>Finally, As a proof of concept for the mechanism a wearable exoskeleton prototype has been created to get a practical understanding of the mechanism and to find problems with the implementation of the mechanism for future works. The wearable exoskeleton prototype showed a lot of potential, the behaviour of the mechanism in the experimental setup was transferred to the prototype and low stiffness while walking was achieved without effecting the bending support.","Compliant Differential Mechanism; Exoskeleton; Neutral stability; Bistability; Zero stiffness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-27","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Clustering is an important unsupervised learning task, with many applications in machine learning, computer vision, formal program verification and finance. Heuristic approaches such as local search are an excellent strategy for estimating the optimal solution, but they run the danger of getting stuck in local optima. Furthermore, it is non­trivial to add user­specific constraints or other objectives to these approaches without compromising their functionality, which makes them inflexible. Generic optimisa­ tion techniques such as MaxSAT and Integer Programming are more versatile, but they scale poorly on bigger datasets. Additionally, the fact that the search space of correlation clustering is inherently symmetric only exacerbates the scalability issue, especially for exhaustive search strategies. In this work, a novel customised search algorithm for correlation clustering is proposed. It aims to unite the flexibility of exhaustive optimisation techniques with an improved scalability and the possibility to declaratively specify domain specific knowledge in the form of a propagator interface. The algorithm uses a specialised hybrid MaxSAT solver with a symmetry­free encoding. Traditionally, this encoding would restrict scalability due to the prohibitive space complexity. However, this problem is avoided by using lazy data structures to represent key components of the encoding, which reduces the space requirement by several orders of magnitude. In addition, a novel encoding is presented that drastically reduces the runtime for sparse graphs. The algorithm employs incremental bounding techniques that under certain conditions reduce the number of decisions required by the solver to prove optimality.","optimisation; MaxSAT solver; MaxSAT; Clustering; Correlation clustering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-12-31","","","","Computer Science | Data Science and Technology","",""

The root of these issues lies in the linear economic model established after the industrial revolution. This model relies on two fundamental principles, limitlessness and easily accessible resources and unlimited earth regenerative capacity. The economy thrives by consuming planetary resources to manufacture products and generating wastes by disposing of products in the landfills or incinerating them when they are no longer desirable. However, the growing planet’s population and the limited regenerative earth capacity make this model unsustainable. The circular economy (CE) represents an alternative to the current consumption pattern. It is an economic model aspiring to limit the use of virgin resources in the production systems and eliminate the waste streams by promoting a closed resource loop. The transition to CE is at the top of the agendas of both policymakers and companies (defined as CE auditing actors), which have initiated policy instruments to catalyze it. Such policy instruments could vary from regulations to additional taxes for eco-unfriendly goods. These policy instruments are prone to manipulations when there is a lot at stake. An indicative example is the case, in which plastic waste exported from the Netherlands to Turkey for recycling or reuse was illegally dumped. To prevent such adversities, the CE auditing actors need a monitoring system to control the implementation of their policy instruments and enforce compliance when necessary. Such a system should provide visibility in the flows of raw materials and products in the supply chain and detect frauds. The need for a monitoring system can be addressed by leveraging the research on the data pipeline concept. A data pipeline is an IT infrastructure capturing data at the source. It equips authorities with data shared by the businesses voluntarily and in real-time. This data pertains to the flows of goods from a seller in an exporting country to a buyer in an importing country. Traditionally, data pipelines have been used by customs to access information stored in the traders’ information systems willing to be transparent. The supply chain visibility currently captured by data pipelines is not sufficient to serve CE. They need to be extended to monitor the entire journey of materials and products in the CE context. Furthermore, to unleash the full potential of the shared data, the data recipients need to have trust in the data and its quality. This condition can be satisfied by using blockchain-enabled data pipelines. Blockchain is a technology that exceeds the capabilities of traditional information systems thanks to four characteristics, namely, decentralization, auditability, immutability, and smart contracts. The thesis dives into the research domain of blockchain-based data pipeline solutions by investigating their ability to support the CE transition. For that reason, it develops a framework that evaluates their ability to enforce compliance with CE policy instruments by acting as monitoring systems. The evaluation framework identifies the information requirements needed to be captured by such architectures to monitor the journey of materials and products in a closed-loop supply chain.","Circular Economy; Data Pipeline; Blockchain Technology; Digital Infrastructure; Supply Chain Visibility; Global Trade; Design Science Research; Governance; Closed-Loop Supply Chain","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

Validation is done based on a reconstructed simulation of gait using motion capture on the optimal design to check whether it could be used for real-life rehabilitation.

Using a scaled physical test setup, the air pressure inside a Hyperloop tube is lowered to 10 mbar, emulating Hyperloop conditions. By opening a breach hole inside the tube, air will flow into the tube due to the pressure difference with the outside ambient. A transparent PMMA tube is used to allow for background oriented schlieren(BOS) measurements. BOS is used to investigate shockwaves and pressure differences through the tube and to determine the feasibility of BOS for Hyperloop breach research. A ray tracing model based on Snell's law is created to relate physical test results to local pressure values inside the tube. Three tests are performed using two different sizes of breach holes. The first test is a low camera capture frequency test in which the entire pressure range from its initial 10 mbar to ambient 1000 mbar is captured. The second test is a shockwave detection test in which a high camera capture frequency is used in an attempt to capture shockwave effects on BOS images. The third test is a Hyperloop pod test, in which the effects of Hyperloop breach on a Hyperloop pod placed inside the test tube are measured. By comparing the results from BOS with measurements from pressure meters installed in the test setup, the feasibility of BOS is investigated. The results from the first test showed pixel displacement from BOS correlation images overestimate the pressure levels inside the tube while also showing pressure jumps compared to pressure values from the pressure meters. While data smoothing and correction operations could mitigate parts of the pressure overestimation and pressure jumps, error sources causing this remained. From the second test the presence of shockwaves could not be confirmed. While for the third test the pixel displacements around the pod could be visualized using a masking function over the Hyperloop pod, shockwave effects on the Hyperloop pod could not be visualized. From the experiment performed the use of background oriented schlieren for Hyperloop breach research is deemed feasible, however the results are sensitive to error sources.","Hyperloop; Background Oriented Schlieren; Hyperloop breach; Ray tracing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This lack of access to electricity limits the overall development. Having access to clean energy can provide education access, productivity and possibilities for economic growth. Frugal innovations are new or improved products, with a lower cost and fewer used resources in their production chain, while maintaining quality, achieving predefined criteria, fulfilling a specific purpose and are user-friendly. Frugal solar-photovoltaic systems, are one of the possible technologies that could be able to contribute to reducing the number of people without access to electricity. Despite the potential of frugal solar-PV systems for reducing energy poverty, market diffusion of these innovations is not a given. Political risks can pose a barrier to the market diffusion of these innovations, due to endangering a stable environment for development and investments.<br/>However, the span of this relationship, specifically in the combination with frugal solar-PV systems, is unknown. To analyse this, the following main research question has been posed in this research: ‘To what extent is there a relationship between political risks and the market diffusion of frugal solar-PV systems?’. The answer to this research question has been researched with a mixed-methods research approach. First, a quantitative analysis is performed with a correlation analysis. The second phase includes qualitative research. Based on the results of the quantitative results, the factors which could influence the diffusion of frugal solar-PV systems in Uganda and Namibia are analysed with means of case studies and interviews.<br/>The correlation analysis showed that there is no relationship between political risks and the diffusion of frugal solar-PV systems. There are too little significant results to convince that there is a relationship between the political risks and the diffusion of frugal solar-PV systems worldwide and per continent. Given the fact that this is a research area where little operationalising has been done so far, it is also important to find possible explanations for this result. Based on the case studies and interviews, it can be stated that that there are more factors playing a role in the diffusion of frugal solar-PV systems than the included political risks. For example, the need for frugal innovations, (renewable) energy technologies which are already invested in, the varying degree of involvement of foreign investors and non-governmental organisations, the history of relationships with other countries and current trading agreements.<br/>To conclude, this research has contributed to the knowledge gaps and scientific debates in the frugal innovation field by looking at the market diffusion of these systems and the possible role political risks can play in this process. Valuable knowledge has been gathered, which has contributed in filling in gaps in academic research: political risks have been operationalised, a contribution has been made in the field of diffusion theories, specifically for frugal innovations, and the scope of the extent of a relationship between political risks and the diffusion of frugal solar-PV systems has been determined. The results of this research can hopefully on the long term contribute to increasing the percentage of people having access to affordable and renewable generated electricity and reducing the energy poverty worldwide.","Frugal innovation; Market diffusion; Political risks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

With increasing product variety, shorter product lifecycles and market competition, it is necessary for firms to supply spare parts to customers for keeping the products functional. Forecasting for the spare parts aftermarket is difficult due to fluctuating demand rates. These issues make spare parts management challenging. Moreover, the covid-19 pandemic has complicated spare parts management and increased its importance. Therefore, the spare parts business presents opportunities to utilize Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology to solve issues related to spare parts management, which is the focus of this master thesis project. The thesis project has been carried out at Atos SE in the manufacturing consulting domain. Atos aims to identify the technical and economic criteria for selecting spare parts to be produced by AM technology and explore various business models to print and deliver spare parts to customers. The thesis objective has been achieved by conducting a market study on AM technologies &amp; spare parts, and developing a support process using the technical and economic criteria along with the business models. The data and information have been collected using literature study and semi-structured interviews. Through the market study, it was found that Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) is the most industry ready AM technology due to its high processing speed, material compatibility, high strength and mechanical properties and the non - requirement of support structures. The commonly used AM materials are Nylon PA 11 and PA 12, ABS, PLA, Aluminium, Titanium and Stainless Steel. The cost factors driving AM adoption in spare parts were found to be machine, materials, post – processing, labour and energy. The challenges to AM adoption were found to be technology awareness, intellectual property (IP) issues, costs and return on investment (ROI), strength and physical properties of AM produced parts. Following the market study, the criteria identified for selecting spare parts to be AM produced are increased responsiveness, minimized supply disruption, cost optimization, part complexity and sustainability. Furthermore, to select spare parts for AM, multi-criteria decision-making Tools (MCDM) such as AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process) and PROMETHEE (Preference Ranking Organisation Method for Enrichment Evaluation) have been used and validated. To print the spare parts, four business models have been described in the thesis, using the make-to-stock, make-to-order and engineer-to-order approaches. The study limitations, recommendations, discussions and implications have been enclosed in the master thesis.","Additive Manufacturing; 3D printing; Spare parts","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

However, research shows mixed findings on tDCS in stroke patients. The functional and structural brain reorganization may explain the mixed findings: (i) The individual motor function, i.e. the target for tDCS, may be relocated to a non-affected brain region, and (ii) the structural characteristics, i.e. conductivity, of the lesion influences the current propagation in the brain.<br/>This study evaluated the effect of individual optimized tDCS configurations for 21 chronic stroke patients and ten healthy controls using model simulations. We optimized tDCS configurations for two individual targets: (i) a functional target based on EEG during a functional hand task and (ii) an anatomical target based on MRI. The individual optimized configurations are compared with conventional configurations targeting the contralateral and ipsilateral primary motor cortex. The configurations are compared based on the normal component of the simulated electric field at both the functional and anatomical targets. Here we consider a negative field strength inhibitory, therefore undesirable.<br/>The functional target was found ipsilateral in eight of the twenty-one stroke subjects, which indicates the relevance of individual functional targets. The conventional configurations simulated for all healthy subjects a positive field strength in the anatomical target. However, our simulations showed that conventional tDCS can result in negative stimulation for seven stroke subjects in the functional target and two stroke subjects in the anatomical target. The simulations may explain the lack of consistent therapeutic effects of conventional tDCS in stroke patients, and highlight the need for individualized tDCS configurations.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-26","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Garcia, John (graduation committee); Limodio, G. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Photovoltaic (PV ) technology has seen exciting growth in the field of energy for the past few decades. With strong government programs in China, Japan, Germany, and Netherlands, PV systems have grown to become a dominant source of renewable energy. Thin film silicon based a-Si:H solar cells are 2ndgeneration solar cells. They have the ability to be applied on glass or polymer, free of toxic materials in the manufacturing process, and are extremely flexible. Even though they exhibit a lower efficiency with respect to other proven technologies, a lower temperature coefficient and the unique ability to self-anneal in warmer months make it an attractive option. HyET Solar Netherlands B.V. manufactures thin-film solar cells based on a-Si:H technology. These modules are extremely flexible and relatively cheaper to manufacture, hence are suited for Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV ) setups in the form of soundwalls, curved roofs, and solar blinds among many others. The primary aim of this research is to understand the performance variation of the solar modules when they are not under Standard Test Conditions (STC) but are aged outdoor. To understand this, data was collected from solar modules installed outdoor. The installed PV system consists of 16 arrays, each array comprising of two modules connected in series and each module consisting of 28 cells in series. However, during installation, some of the modules were damaged, and analysis was solely done on the best-performing array. To analyse the system, irradiance, temperature, and operating maximum powerpoints(mpp) were recorded every minute while the JV-curves were measured every fifteen minutes. The modules were analysed on two levels: on the system level and the cell level. Analysing the modules on system level was done by calculating the performance ratio and daily energy yield. It was found that the modules performed significantly better in warmer months than in cooler months. This could be explained by a combination of the annealing effect and relatively lower losses due to higher irradiance in warmer months. Upon analysing the daily energy yields of the modules, it was found that the system suffered degradation of 10.3% in the second year of operation. To analyse the modules on the cell level, JV-curve data were used. To extract the intrinsic parameters of the modules from a JV-curve, an in-house software ""DoktorDEP"" was utilised. In order to validate the output from the software, two experiments were performed, where JV-curve were measured at different temperature points and irradiance. While the experiments were successful in estimating the intrinsic parameters, certain requirements were not met at the outdoor data, hence the focus was now shifted to explicit JV-curve parameters such as short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), open-circuit resistance (Roc) and shot-circuit resistance (Rsc). Upon analysis, it was found that there was a Jsc loss of 0.63mA/cm2 and Voc loss of 0.02V/c in the second year of operation. Moreover, the ontained trends of FF and Roc exhibited a definite degradation while the Rsc did not exhibit a degrading trend. Even though data analysis was performed on damaged modules, the obtained trends in this study can be of vital importance in developing strategies for reliability of the modules. The same techniques can be applied to a set of undamaged modules to estimate the performance. Because the JV-parameter Roc was affected drastically as the modules aged, future experiments can be designed to observe and tweak Roc to improve both efficiency and reliability. Lastly, based on the insights about DoktorDEP, future versions can be rolled out with the ability to analyse outdoor JV-curve data to discern the intrinsic parameters and their variation when aged outdoor. This could help in targeting and prioritising the factors affecting module performance and hence resulting in a robust product.","Data analysis; Outdoor PV system; PV analysis; amorphous silicon analysis; PV System; Electrical equivalent scheme; Performance ratio","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-26","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Such deep learning methods learn a suitable MRI prior distribution from large sets of training data. For MRI images acquired with an uncommon scanning sequence, large datasets required for training are not available. Additionally, deep learning methods do not generalize well to unseen data. Therefore, in this research, a framework is proposed for accelerated MRI reconstruction trained with simulated data. The framework uses a Recurrent Inference Machine (RIM). The RIM is a deep learning framework that learns an iterative inference process. The RIM framework has been chosen as it is designed to learn the inversion process itself rather than the image statistics. Therefore, RIMs have a low tendency to overfit, and a high capacity to generalize to unseen data. The framework is evaluated by reconstructing undersampled data of in-vivo brain MRI images and comparing them with zero-filled reconstructions, reconstructions of an identical framework trained with in-vivo data and ESPIRiT reconstructions. The comparison shows that the framework does partly learn the inference process; however, the reconstructions still contain artefacts and the reconstruction of the framework trained with in-vivo data and the ESPIRiT method are of higher quality. For simulated data to replace in-vivo data for the training of the RIM, the simulated data has to be more similar to the in-vivo data.","RIM; Recurrent inference machine; MRI; undersampled; Image Reconstruction; deep learning; inference learning; k-space; simulated training data","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Bots, P.W.G. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","As the complexity of global supply chains increases, so does the turbulence and disruption they are suffering from. The medical equipment after-sales service supply chain is closely related to the healthcare industry. Therefore, the ability to provide high levels of customer satisfaction with after-sales services affects not only the performance of the medical equipment companies but also the lives and health of patients. This motivated us to study supply chain resilience in order to help managers in the medical equipment industry improve the resilience of after-sales service supply chains. Through literature research, we found that there is no research specifically on the resilience of the after-sales service supply chain of medical equipment. To fill this gap, we formulated the main research question for this thesis as: “How to assess the resilience of the after-sales service supply chain in the medical equipment industry?”. To answer this research question, we design a supply chain resilience framework by using a mixed-method approach to help managers assess the resilience of medical equipment after-sales service supply chains. And we opted for a mixed-method approach in two phases: (1) Framework development: We identified and synthesize the elements of existing supply chain resilience frameworks found through literature research into a single resilience framework applicable to the after-sales services supply chain for medical equipment. This framework identifies the enablers that need to be maximized and the vulnerabilities that need to be minimized to enhance supply chain resilience and operationalizes these elements as observable indicators. (2) Framework validation: Considering the strong growth of the medical equipment market in China, and the Chinese government ambition to provide safe, effective, convenient, and affordable healthcare services to both rural and urban residents by 2020, we have validated the proposed framework by interviewing professionals working in medical equipment companies located in China. We used questionnaires and semi-structured interviews to determine how participants perceived the importance of the identified elements and indicators. We expect that the resilience framework will help managers to better deal with turbulence and disruptions. The resulting framework identifies 11 enablers and 5 vulnerabilities, operationalized by 43 indicators. As the proposed supply chain resilience framework has not been tested empirically by applying it within a medical equipment company, a first recommendation is to perform such tests. By analysing and summarizing the results of the actual application, the framework can be improved further. Moreover, the expert validation was limited due to research time constraints. The reasons why participants considered some enablers and vulnerabilities to be unimportant could be investigated further, and the indicators can still be operationalized further. Finally, the relative importance of enablers and vulnerabilities could be investigated by using a multi-criteria decision-making method, so as to help managers select only the more important elements to improve the resilience of their supply chain.","Supply chain resilience; Medical equipment industry; After-sales service supply chain; Resilience framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

However, when they are placed on fuels they can, from a consumer point of view, be regarded as similar to carbon taxes. Carbon pricing, and carbon taxes in particular, are often championed by experts in relation to reducing carbon emissions. Based on these aforementioned notions, this research set out to investigate the role excise duties on fuel can play as an intervention employed by policy makers looking to reduce CO2 emissions. With this goal in mind, a Dutch case study is performed. This case study utilizes the synthetic control method to empirically investigate if the increase in Dutch excise duties on gasoline can be causally linked to CO2 emission reductions from road transport. Ultimately, the research found that an increase in the excise duty on gasoline can result in a significant decrease in per capita emissions. These findings resonate with the literature, and point towards how excise duties can play a part in strategically designed environmental policies. From a policy maker’s perspective, this means that in combination with complementary environmental policies such as technology mandates, raising the price of excise duties on fuel could prove to significantly contribute to emissions reduction goals.","CO2 emission reduction; road transport; fuel excise duty; carbon pricing; environmental policy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

This includes activities like R&amp;D, product design, testing, engineering, manufacturing, and assembly. But in addition to the developed technology, there needs to be enough opportunities for deploying it in a commercial market. Considering the need for capacity building, sustainable energy sources and possessing huge solar potential, massive manufacturing and human resources, India has an important role to play in the solar industry in the coming decade. In addition to this, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the trade relationship with China which is an important exporter of solar PV components. These factors provide a great opportunity for India to evolve as a global competitor for development and deployment of solar energy.<br/>For India to emerge as such a solar PV technology hub, it needs to engage in several activities ranging from technology development, market formation, policy development and others. Scientists and researchers have established that such technological developments or transitions cannot be studied as an isolated concept, but it is part of a larger ‘Innovation system’. The Technological Innovation System (TIS) approach provides a holistic framework focusing on technical, economic, policy, and socio-cultural aspects to nurture a new innovation. However, the current TIS framework is focused on the early stages of the technology life cycle and on how to make them successful in the niche and bridge markets. Whereas in the current case, solar PV is a well-matured technology and India being a hub or a market leader need accelerating large scale diffusion and needs to face competition from global players. For a country to emerge as a market leader in such a technology, it needs to engage in activities that are focused on building competence on par with global market leaders and take steps for large scale diffusion. The current thesis addresses this scientific knowledge gap by developing a new conceptual framework focused on the matured phase of TIS and on activities that will allow a region/country to emerge as a global competitor through formation of technology hubs. The author conceptualized the new framework called 'Factors of TIS acceleration' catering to the processes that a matured TIS needs to engage to compete with global players and diffuse in large scale. These processes include, 'Building competitive advantage', 'Integrating complementary innovations’, ‘Expanding market reach and ‘Overturning incumbents’ that are essential in advancing a particular TIS. This new framework is then applied to the case of solar PV in India to evaluate if the country can emerge as a solar PV technology hub in the next decade.","Solar photovoltaic; Technological Innovation Systems; Technology hub; Matured sustainable energy technologies; Sustainable Energy Technologies; India; Innovation; Technology transition; Sustainable transition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

As a result of the growing number of photovoltaic systems connected to low voltage (LV) distribution grids, a significant portion of power flow from photovoltaic arrays to the LV grid, As the PV penetration increases, this effect becomes more severe. This reversal of power flow (from the load side to the grid side) results in a voltage rise problem along the distribution feeder. Such an issue is more pronounced near the point of common coupling (PCC). Overvoltages are not desired as they can damage consumers’ electronic devices, burn the insulation and can trip protective equipment, causing sudden power outages. The principal objective of this study is to achieve 100% PV penetration in a low voltage distribution network while maintaining voltages within the grid constraints by employing numerous voltage control techniques. To conduct PV penetration studies, the European low-voltage distribution benchmark network developed by CIGRE is selected. PV systems of various configurations are designed and integrated into the CIGRE LV network. The results of the PV penetration analysis on the CIGRE network suggest that with the increase in the distance between the source and the load, the penetration level decreases drastically. The worst-case network model in which the penetration level is reduced to 65% is selected for employing voltage control strategies. Two main strategies have been used to improve PV penetration. In the first category of methods, the reactive power is controlled by the PV system so that voltages at the PCCs are within the grid voltage limits. Four different reactive power control methods are employed. The second category of methods are based on active power control, in which the voltages are controlled by batteries/electrolyzers by absorbing excess power generated by the PV system, avoiding reverse power flow into the grid. The results obtained reveal that all the techniques employed are successful at increasing PV penetration to 100% without violating grid voltage limits. However, it is concluded that, batteries/electrolyzer systems provide better value in terms of effectiveness in solving the voltage rise issue. They also offers lower losses, and multiple-use cases.","PV Penetration; Reactive power control; Battery; electrolyser","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

In recent years, a group of 3D-printed immobilization orthosis for the upper extremity has been proposed. However, they were mainly developed as substitutes for traditional casts for the upper extremity for short-term usage. There has been no definite attempt to design 3D-printed orthosis to immobilize the upper extremity used as an assistive device for long-term usage. Objective: Develop a patient-specific orthosis for wrist immobilization in long-term usage, which has suitable functionality, the comfort of wearing, and an efficient fabrication process by exploiting the benefits of Additive Manufacturing technology. Methods: Structure concepts were generated by modes of donning and doffing and evaluated with criteria. The prototype was assessed together with an orthopedic technician. For the next, the prototype was validated with actual patients who were suffering from degenerative wrist pathologies. The subjects wore their wrist immobilization orthosis for two months and were asked about their experiences. Results: In total, eleven wrist immobilization orthosis prototypes were validated with five subjects (two males and three females) suffering from degenerative wrist pathologies (Rheumatoid Arthritis: one subject, Osteoarthritis: three subjects, and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: one subject). 45 % of prototypes provided excessive pressure on bony prominences. Around 55 % of prototypes caused unacceptable pain at distal palmar creases. Specifically, the movement of putting it on and off brought complications for 91 % of all prototypes. For three subjects who could use their orthoses for two months, the orthoses functioned well, decreasing pains in the wrist while having daily activities. Conclusion: First, the structure of the wrist immobilization orthosis was well-designed, performing proper support during activities of daily living. Second, the comfort evaluation was conditionally positive; due to the rigid hardness of the material, two out of eleven orthoses were too painful to wear for the further test. Since the morphology of bony eminences and the amount of the cutaneous fats around those areas are dissimilar for all people, it was hard to design pain-zero orthosis for two subjects. Lastly, SLS printing with PA12 material offered apparent advantages over traditional fabrication methods. All works were conducted digitally from the scanning to fabrication, and there was no waste of materials. Despite six working days of delivery time from the outsourcing company, the orthosis did not require any labor-intensive procedures.","Wrist Immobilization Orthosis; 3D printing; patient-specific","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-26","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

In order to preserve earth’s climate, a lot has to be changed in current industry standards. In 2018, heavy-duty road transport was responsible for 680 million tonnes kg in transported commodities in the Netherlands (CBS, 2019). This resulted in 10.176 million tonnes of emitted CO2 in the same year (CBS, 2020). As these transportation activities are a big part of the current pollution, there is a lot to be gained in this area. Therefore, industries are investigating to make their transportation activities more sustainable.Large manufacturing plants often apply specific supply chain strategies in order to reduce waste. One of those wastes are warehousing costs. Just-in-Time (JIT) and Just-in-Sequence (JIS) are supply chain strategies that aim to reduce these costs (Bányai &amp; Bányai, 2017). A JIT supply chain strategy refers to a strategy where commonly used parts are delivered at the plant when needed, therefore reducing storage capacity. A JIS strategy goes even further. When products are customizable, a JISstrategy ensures that the required parts are delivered in the sequence of production.Upon till now, a lot has been researched with regard to alternative fuels in heavy-duty transport, especially in the hydrogen and battery electric area. However, these studies often stay on a general logistics level. Specific concepts such as JIT and JIS may influence choices for alternative fuels due to more important time constraints such as a predefined and strict pearl chain horizon. Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to research the feasiblity ranking of alternative fuels (hydrogen, battery electric, HVO and LNG) in a JIT/JIS supply chain.","Alternative fuels; Heavy duty vehicles; Sustainabilty","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

Through a literature study on the theory of social movements together with the principles of the Multiple Streams Model by Kingdon, a theoretical framework is developed to better hypothesize how policy adoption and implementation works and how movements can influence it. Indeed, the report revisits Kingdon’s concept with a particular focus on social movements and their various activities in the policy making process. The key components of the MSF are the problem stream, the politics stream, the policy stream, the window of opportunity and the policy entrepreneur. Using this model in conjunction with social movement theory, three hypotheses have been developed and tested for the three cases. The comparative case study approach is used to allow a deeper understanding of the impact of social movements on the development of positive cycling policies and the events behind the adoption of the cycling policies in three European capitals where there is evidence of social activism are extensively analyzed. These were the cities of Amsterdam, Stockholm and Dublin. The main data sources were articles, scientific papers, local newspapers, magazines and blogs along with transcripts of interviews. Besides, through semi-structured online interviews, the perspectives of relevant stakeholders in the three cities, such as members of social movements and experts in the field of policy-making and policy analysis were investigated. The next step after collecting all the necessary data was the content and narrative analysis, in order to connect the cases in a meaningful way but also to identify common patterns. Conclusively, the findings from the three cases were compared and contrasted based on their differences and similarities in the strategy followed by the social movements, the emergence and constitution of their groups and generally their effectiveness in achieving favorable changes for cyclists. Overall, the report argues that by determining the role of movements within the streams there is an added value to the explanatory power of the context. Influencing the problem stream and seeking public support is a prerequisite for strengthening social movements, while they tend to use methods such as indicators and focusing events to determine the perception of the problem in the society. Identifying the problems and highlighting them to the public may be secondary if the movements themselves, due to their composition, know how to negotiate with decision makers directly. This is because social movements and advocacy organizations also aim to influence government agencies, especially when there is no political will for change or when they have the right means to approach them in terms of power and knowledge. The need for active negotiation with the political stream increases when there are strong policy opponents influencing the board in the background. These rivals often come from the automotive industry as they have conflicting interests with cycling policies that tend to undermine car dominance. Lastly, regarding the policy stream and proposals for change that usually come from the community of policy experts, it is not impossible for movements to contribute even to this stream, if they have the necessary knowledge and expertise to do so. Otherwise, seeking for interaction with experts in the field can help activists to get realistic policy proposals that can be used in their discussions with the decision makers. Furthermore, when there is a clearly defined problem, politicians are willing to adopt a realistic political solution, and a policy entrepreneur couples these streams at a window of opportunity, the result may be in favor of activists. A noticeable finding was that social movements themselves can also play the role of the policy entrepreneur and articulate the three streams. As Kingdon suggested, social movements can invest their efforts to closely collaborate with the decision makers and push for their interests. At the same time, they can also work towards influencing the three streams in different ways and emphasizing on different aspects depending on the composition of their teams, the timing of their appearance and the legal framework of the country. There may also be some other important parameters such as scale of the city, the funding availability, the shape of old inner cities or the existence of historic centers that can facilitate the movements' success in influencing a pro-cycling policy adoption. Despite the importance of these contextual parameters, this study shows that success lies in the hierarchy of cycling, arguing that whenever there is a will, a realistic way can be found. After all, social movements, in order to achieve the best result and be mostly effective, they should be aware of their strengths that are directly related to their knowledge of the cycling policy-making process, their size and passion. In this way, they can choose the right strategy to follow and influence the political scene. Besides, for people who wish to promote cycling and sustainable way of travelling it is crucial to find others with a common view, because although every voice matters, when these voices become collective, they are more likely to be heard and taken seriously by the decision-makers. Finally, policymakers need to be more open to dialogue with such groups, as they represent a legitimate part of society and can bring issues that ordinary people cannot include on the political agenda. Ultimately, actively listening and constructively discussing activists’ demands in a friendly environment -always under a realistic point of view- can also be beneficial to their political future In conclusion, the knowledge gathered through this report on the ways in which movements can bring about policy change has to do with the political status and legal framework of each country. It is therefore worth noting that, as this study focused on democratic capitals, this may have an impact on the generalizability of results for countries with very different policy frameworks.","Cycling; Social movements; Policy-making; Multiple Streams Framework; Advocacy groups; Policy adoption; policy implementation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

The experience should achieve the design goal of triggering young people’s interest in Van Gogh and his art through experiencing the connections between his personal stories and his painting style and technique in a mixed-reality environment. Before defining this design goal, research was conducted through literature review, context and user research (Contextmapping), and existing XR products analysis. Through literature review, the factors of relevance and participation of enhancing engagement and their relation to emotional connection are found. It provides a clear objective for user research in the VGM context - figuring out the desired content of the museum for young people and how they would like to interact with the content. Specific qualities of interaction and desired content are figured out based on the needs of young people. Among all through mixed reality technology, mixed reality is selected due to its potential to enable diverse interaction and be more accessible by the target group. Based on insights gained from the research phase, the design goal and design criteria are formulated, validated, and prioritized based on the results of a questionnaire. In the ideation phase, ideas are generated and prototyped from both technological and context perspectives, which lead to three important results: Feasible design elements by MR, the understanding of the essential aspects of MR, and a structure of four phases of interaction that help build the design elements into a complete journey. A converging concept is created, tested, and discussed with participants and clients with all the insights above. The insights result in a content structure, providing a logical way of organizing content during the experience through layered information with a coherent storyline. It reduces the cognitive effort needed to process the information so that it engages young people more. Based on the structure of four phases of interaction and user test insights, the final concept is created. The interactive prototype is built with Java, a programming language. The prototype is used for the final concept evaluation. The concept is then evaluated and validated by both the field test and the control test, using observation, questionnaire, and interview combined to evaluate to what extend the design achieved the design goal and criteria. Limitations and recommendations for improvements are discussed at the end of the evaluation chapter. Overall, the design is an interactive art experience (installation) that brings the content of VGM to the public environment, approaches young people, and triggers their interest in the connection between Van Gogh’s stories and art with Mixed reality.","experience; museum; mixed reality; interaction; Van Gogh; young adults","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The research reveals three striking data: 1)While study abroad, students are five times riskier than those studying in their home country; 2) the highly educated women have more severe problems in the workplace than previous known; and 3) The women who fit three things are riskier and more afraid of sexual violence - in their young age, encountering financial issues and with an immigrant background. Therefore, the information implies an invisible danger to the target user. In the research domain &amp; context, sexual harassment is one of the most severe sexual violence problems on campus. Literature reviews and semi-constructed interviews with experts in the Delft area unveiled the absence of specific support to this problem at TU Delft. On the other hand, many universities have their particular organization to cope with relevant issues. Thus, their service and support were roughly divided into general knowledge education, support for victims and supporters, and some included the relevant problem such as anti-racism helpline. To better understand the weakness and desires in terms of tackling sexual harassment. Ten international students and one dutch student participated in generative research. The analysis unveiled these aspects are their weakness: 1) racism alongside sexual harassment makes them doubting their existence; 2) they are afraid of feeling incorrect without validation in advance; 3) self-blaming tendency such as considering they misunderstand or it is their fault; 4) unclear the intention of harasser; 5) sex is a taboo topic to talk; 6) the perpetrators share same cultural background, so they know the pitfall of victims; 7) the perpetrator reject the rejection; 8) men are silent victims. They also have expectations with regard to the design: 1) someone can talk through the unclear situation with them will help, 2) the awareness-raising builds a stronger mindset. Therefore, the researcher formed the design goal based on the above information: To enhance overseas students’ awareness of bodily autonomy and provide a strategy to cope with sexual harassment through a knowledgeable and amusing interactive workshop at the beginning of their study in the Netherlands. Through guiding by three characteristics of interaction vision (knowledgeable, amusing, and open-ended), appropriate timing, and design form. The design outcome is an interactive workshop design alongside conveying the strategy. The workshop was divided into two main sections: 1) raising the awareness of bodily autonomy and 2) learning the strategy of coping with sexual harassment. The design cycle included rapid-prototyping, user test, filming, and ACES strategy formation. The final design includes an interactive workshop, facilitators’ guidelines, and a strategic plan. It contains five main activities and designed objects. It includes 1) slides, 2) brochures with ACES strategy, 3) films presenting an ambiguous sexual harassment situation, and 4) teaching aids used in warm-up activities. The strategy was formed while considering the other university’s strategy and service. The evaluation took place twice at TU Delft. Ten international participants joined the user test. The results gained overall positive feedback and conformed to the three characteristics in the design goal. ","Sexual harassment; Interactive workshop; Strategy design; Interaction design; Sexual violence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Auping, W.L. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Over the last decades, the world population has grown vastly and the percentage of people living in cities has increased. This process of urbanization has had a lot of implications for both safety management and research on evacuations. Due to this growth in urbanization, more high density gatherings are taking place, potentially resulting in more casualties during emergencies. A common method used to conduct research on evacuations is simulation models. Simulation models have already improved our understanding of human behaviour during evacuations, but researchers argue that most current models are still not able to accurately describe human behaviour during evacuations since they do not take into account the effect of groups. Empirical research has shown that social groups in crowds influence the dynamics of evacuations. For instance, when an emergency happens and groups have to decide where to go, groups sometimes just follow other groups. However, accurately modelling such notions is often complex and contains uncertainty. One of the ways to deal with uncertainty systematically is by applying exploratory modelling. This, however, has yet to be applied to evacuations. This study aims to address the need for models which include the notion of groups by analysing the effect of two decision-making schemes on the evacuation time; leader-follower decision-making and consensus decision-making. Furthermore, this study aims to provide a stepping stone for exploratory modelling in the realm of evacuation modelling. In order to do so, this study uses three methods; a literature study, agent-based modelling, and exploratory modelling. The literature study was conducted to lay the foundation of the agent based model, while exploratory modelling was used to explore the uncertainty space of the agent-based model. After the development of the model, it was verified and validated using multiple tests, and data from a previous study. Through extensive validation and verification, it was concluded that this model is fit for purpose. It is both able to generate behaviour in the same magnitude as previous empirical research, and show valid behaviour on the lower abstraction levels of the model. Results show that groups have a significant impact on evacuation time. The more groups are present, and the bigger they are, the higher the evacuation time will be. Furthermore, results show that there is almost no difference in leader-follower decision-making and consensus decision-making. These two only differ when no one is familiar in a building. When there is 0% familiarity, leader-follower behaviour will lead to lower evacuations times compared to consensus decision-making. Lastly, results show that the combination of groups being present and all people being familiar with a building may actually have adverse effects on the evacuation time in crowd densities between 0.07 and 0.36. In case of crowd densities up to 0.36, a high percentage of familiarity may actually lead to higher evacuation times. All in all, this study provides a stepping stone for modelling group behaviour using an exploratory agent-based modelling approach. This study was the first to lay focus on the effect of group decision-making schemes by incorporating it in an agent-based model and exploring its behaviour by running it numerous times under different parameter settings. Furthermore, this research has important implications. First, evacuations inside buildings should not only be evaluated by crowd density or familiarity, but also by exit capacity. Secondly, different crowd compositions have different effects on the evacuations time. Policymakers should, therefore, take into account what types of groups will most likely be present. As regards future research, future research should mainly focus on the effect of modelling leader-follower behaviour in different ways, modelling consensus groups in general, analysing the effect of groups on different segments of evacuation time, and adding more (social) factors to the model which influence evacuation behaviour.","Agent-based modeling; Exploratory modelling; Group behaviour; Group decision-making; Evacuations; Evacuation time","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","","52.00667,4.35556"

The shortage is expected to increase in the coming years. Care-robots could provide a solution, by taking work out of the hands of the care workers. The potential utility of the care-robot is dependent on the functionality of the gripper. The goal of this study was to design and develop a new gripper for a care-robot, applicable in a care environment. Furthermore, the functional performance of the gripper was to be assessed and evaluated. The new gripper needed to outperform the previous gripper of the robot, named the RPG, in terms of functionality. A new gripper was designed in this study, named the 4FH. The 4FH has four fingers, resembling a human thumb, index, middle and ring finger. Sideways rotation of the thumb allows for two grasping modes, namely a pinch mode and a power grip mode. The 4FH has three DOFs in total. A glove is fitted around the gripper for hygiene. An improvement was made to the 4FH by modifying the shape of the thumb. The improved version is named the 4FH-i. A set of three assessments was drawn up for measuring functional performance of a gripper for a care-robot. The set consists of the the EIT, modified SHAP and modified AHAP. The SHAP and AHAP were modified in this study to make them representative for applications of a care-robot. Both the 4FH and 4FH-i outperformed the RPG on the modified SHAP and on the modified AHAP. All grippers passed the EIT. The results showed a significant increase in grasp stability, comparing the 4FH and 4FH-i to the RPG. The higher scores on the assessments indicated that the 4FH and 4FH-i have improved functional performance compared to the RPG.","Gripper; Functional performance; assessment; Care-robot; Versatile; Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-26","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Consumers have an impact on the sustainability status of our world in many different ways. In this project the focus lies on food consumption. Dietary changes are considered a great opportunity for fighting climate change, especially through the reduction of meat consumption (Poore &amp; Nemecek, 2018). This graduation project is performed for Goodcase. The startup aims to accelerate the shift towards a sustainable diet by offering sustainable foods directly to the customer. The goal of this project is to empower food box customers to switch their diet to a more sustainable one by offering a support system that promotes long-term behaviour change. Literature research indicated that selfefficacy and social norms play the main role when it comes to changing to more eco-friendly diets (Eker et al., 2019). Lead users reported that they had initially increased their self-efficacy to switch to a new diet by challenging themselves to perform the new behaviour for a certain time. Therefore, the design solution focused on self-experimentation through self-challenging, paired with the facilitation of social interaction with other users online. This combination is also applied in other behaviour change services, e.g. the Weight Watchers programme which helps consumers to eat healthier. Based on these key insights, the design brief defined the following design goal: To increase the self-efficacy of consumers trying to change to a more environmentally sustainable diet by facilitating self-experimentation with a food box. Following this brief, a productservice system was designed which consisted of a food box with products facilitating vegetarian cooking, a physical guide that challenged users to reduce meat consumption, and an online group for users to motivate each other. In a subsequent user test, qualitative research with eight consumers suggested that the food products triggered experimentation with vegetarian food which helped consumers to increase their selfefficacy to eat less meat. Vegetarian eating might have been positively influenced by the meat reduction challenge. However, many users found it too inconvenient to monitor themselves daily with the guidebook. Finally, a second iteration of the design concept is proposed that incorporates the key learnings from the user test. The concept, called EcoEat, combines a food box with a supportive app which allows users to monitor and improve their behaviour over the long term and in a more convenient way. This design proposal could be tested in the future. The main conclusion from this project is that providing real experiences with unfamiliar, eco-friendly food products can positively influence the consumer’s attitude towards sustainable diets. It can open them up towards trying out more food of this kind and thereby helps them to switch to a more sustainable diet. More of these opportunities for trial should be provided to consumers. Food boxes are a good medium to provide these experiences regularly. With a complementary behaviour change service the experimentation with a sustainable diet can be upheld if the users are guided in a way that is convenient for them.","behaviour change; food box; Sustainability; diet change; entrepreneurship; design; Design for behaviour change; Start-up","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Ahsmann, L.L. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The 3D Head-scanner is designed with the intent to scan a customer’s head such that the client can design personalized glasses using the generated mesh. The uniqueness of this process is due to the fact that the customers are uniquely disabled and therefore unable to clearly announce their comfort levels. The goal of this project is to design a new Head-scanner for Maat! since the process that they currently use involves interacting a lot of times with customers who move around a lot making scans invalid and operators having to put in extra effort. The client therefore wants a new and improved approach to scanning, one that is faster, accurate, portable and comfortable for their customers. The initial brief was to replace their existing workflow through this new design, however, after some research and discussion, the approach was changed to suit Maat’s future strategy of setting up stationary scanners all around the Netherlands in locations such as Down polis or Community centers where people could come for checkups and have themselves scanned as well resulting in a significant cut-down on the clients’ travelling time. The project starts with some contextual study where the clients are interviewed on their process, their observations and their expectations from the product. Further, clients are shadowed on a number of their customer visits for observation and gaining a first-hand understanding of a typical scanning process, customer behavior and interaction, involvement of parents, environment and noting down certain areas of interest that could motivate insights. The observations lead to a deeper understanding of a child-customer’s behaviour including points of distraction,<br/>various approach strategies employed by operators and how these aspects<br/>could be leveraged outside of a product’s workflow. Certain important points to note are that children have to be distracted at a common point for some amount of time since the scanning process takes some time. This could either be a parent<br/>standing in front of them or their favourite show on a phone. Due to the motion of the scanner, kids often get distracted towards the operator leading to parents often having to hold their head straight. Technological research is the next step<br/>and this involves looking at market competitors, their price ranges, techniques<br/>employed and feasibility with regards to the current context. Similarly, a number of scanning techniques are also considered before photogrammetry is eventually<br/>selected due to its speed, accuracy, ease of availability and pricing. Further tests are also carried out that involve comparing photogrammetry with structured light, scanning dummy heads for accuracy and working with the coding aspect and relevant software. These steps directly inform certain design decisions which serve as constraints based on which concept ideas for the embodiment and possible look and feel are ideated upon. Factors such as area of capture, landmarks and available space influence the design of the product as it<br/>undergoes a number of iterations before settling on the current version. The current Head-scanner makes use of 3 cameras to capture the subject’s face<br/>along with the requisite landmarks in less than a second, with only the click of<br/>a button. As it is connected to a laptop, all the post-processing happens on the<br/>system where the different camera views are aligned creating a complete head.

Feedback is then collected and implemented as best as possible<br/>before finally being validated with 3 families having children of various ages<br/>and a variety of responses.

Thereby, extending the FGM approach in order to include other conditions requires to add<br/>other independent variables which will inevitable lead to increase the size of the lookup table.

In this master thesis, the goal is to use Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Machine Learning (ML) techniques in order to reduce substantially the computational cost of storing lookup tables. In order to achieve this, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) technique is used. First, a 4D FGM lookup table for hydrogen flames is simplified using the aforementioned AI technique. Then, this technique is used to replace a 6D lookup table generated using the DA-FGM approach. The accuracy and stability of the models provided by ANNs is measured by statistical indicators, providing high accurate and stable AI models. Finally, in the middle of this project, unexpected issues regarding the 4D lookup table were encountered, which lead to recreate the 4D lookup table. After studying carefully how the 4D lookup table was created, a new 4D lookup table is generated, providing excellent results and improving the AI models obtained.","Turbulent combustion; Artificial Intelligence; Look up tables; Flamelet Generated Manifold","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Process and Energy Technology","",""

Using BIM tools provides various opportunities for cost management professionals to improve their cost management services' quality, speed, accuracy, value, and sophistication. Despite these benefits, BIM implementation for infrastructure projects can be quite challenging as these projects are highly complex. Very few organisations (who deal with infrastructure) have implemented BIM higher than BIM 4D in their projects. Therefore, this study investigates the challenges organisations face while implementing BIM 5D for infrastructure projects and identifies ways to minimise these challenges and enhance the BIM 5D process. The research methodology for this research is based on a literature study and interviews conducted with experts from Arcadis. This thesis first explores the challenges faced by organisations while implementing BIM 5D for infrastructure projects. In addition, this thesis also looks into the steps the building sector took to enhance the BIM 5D implementation and how these steps can be fine-tuned to suit the infrastructure projects. Based on these two points, recommendations are created for organisations dealing with infrastructure projects to BIM 5D, depending on their role in the project. The results show that the project managers should be targeted first to promote the use of BIM 5D. The expertise of BIM front runners should be utilised in projects, and a standard BIM Execution Plan should be prepared and followed by involving both designers and cost managers. The BIM 5D processes also need to be tailored to suit the needs of specific (larger) clients.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

It is believed that quantum computing can and will surpass conventional, classical computing. When quantum computing surpasses classical computing, it is called quantum supremacy. There are many different projects that use different quantum technologies aim to achieve quantum supremacy, such as projects from Google and Intel. In this thesis, the reader is introduced to a new project: the Fujitsu Project. The project is a collaboration between TU Delft and Fujitsu and has the goal of fabricating a new distributed quantum quantum computer based on color centers in diamond. The focus of the thesis is the definition of the microarchitecture. <br/><br/>The quantum computer stack is explained in detail. Precise and robust definitions for each of the seven layers of the quantum computer stack are given, where the definition of the microarchitecure is most important. A microarchitecture is defined as the list of instructions of the lowest level before entering control electronics. To define the diamond microarchitecture, a set of goals have to be completed. Other architectures such as QuTech's QuMA and QuTech's Central Controller were identified and analyzed. Combined with the requirements of the overall diamond system architecture as defined by the project, a list of requirements for the microarchitecture is created. Using these requirements, a Quantum Instruction Set Architecture (QISA) and a microarchitecture are defined.<br/><br/>Based on the defined QISA and microarchitecture, a compiler is designed. The compiler is made in OpenQL. OpenQL is a framework for high-level quantum programming that targets different quantum computing platforms. The main task of the compiler is to translate high-level quantum algorithms, expressed in a high-level quantum programming language (C++/Python APIs), to quantum microcode. The quantum microcode consists of instructions that are defined in the microarchitecture. <br/><br/>The QISA, microarchitecture and compiler are verified against the requirements that are set at the beginning of their respective definition phases. The microarchitecture supports for all gates that are part of cQASM 1.0. In addition, it supports all diamond color center specific protocols and rules. The compiler supports all instructions from cQASM as well. Moreover, the compiler supports all standard (gate) instructions and diamond specific instructions through OpenQL's Python API.<br/><br/>The work is intended to be a solid baseline, where the future of the project can rely and improve upon. Possible improvements could be the adaption of the microarchitecture to the growth of the number of controlled qubits per controller, the parallelization of the microarchitecture instructions to improve instruction throughput, and alignment with the quantum network group. The compiler can also be improved with for example enhanced scheduling, differentiation between qubit types and an entanglement library. The next step in the design of the microarchitecture will be the design of a microarchitecture simulator, which takes the microcode as input and simulates the hardware architecture.","quantum; microachitecture; diamond; color center; fujitsu; OpenQL","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-26","","","","","Fujitsu Project",""

An opportunity here is to explore the wishes and expectations of student housing in the future to build new innovative/ successful student buildings that also contribute to the student’s well-being. The research question of this project: How can DUWO contribute to the better well-being of all students, now and in the future? Literature research concludes that quality of life, life satisfaction and happiness are all different terms describing well-being. Findings on happiness research show that the human biopsychological pathway, which balances positive/negative feelings, predominantly determines our overall feeling of happiness. As human interaction heavily affects our positive feelings, one can see that valuable relationships make people happy. To stimulate the formation of these valuable relationships, one should start to facilitate social contact. Internal research shows the increasing interest of DUWO in the well-being topic, which results in practical ideas. Nonetheless, the main focus still lies with affordability and availability. This focus and the stimulus of the Dutch rent allowance/valuation system results in the corporation mostly building studios. This result affects the way students build these valuable relationships. From an abstract level, it also seems that there is a gap between the corporation’s intentions and the expectations of the students. DUWO focuses on the future and the collective, whereas students ask themselves what it implies for their individual situation in the present. The reframed challenge: Find out how DUWO can support social relations between students living in the same building and get a better understanding of students’ needs, to be able to design for those needs and support well-being. To stimulate the formation of valuable relationships, one should promote community building. People within the community dare to be interpersonally vulnerable, which creates emotional safety and intimacy. To be part of a community also provides a feeling of belonging. The best way to stimulate community building is to facilitate contact and to create a feeling of involvement. Design requirements: 1. DUWO has to get a better understanding of the students their needs. 2. Student housing should stimulate social contact and create a feeling of involvement. 3. Students need to know beforehand how they can give input and how DUWO will use their input. 4. Students should be able to respond to specific topics which they care about The final design outcomes:1.Internal policy change. Embrace well-being internally. Make it the basis to inform the policy. Ensure that affordability and availability no longer determine the future of student living. 2.Enrich the communication between DUWO and the student. Involve students via statements inside the DUWO app. See what students think and how many are concerned about which subject. Link these polls to offline discussion evenings where students can share their input elaborately. 3. Architecture recommendations. Ensure the building itself promotes social contact, plus create a feeling of belonging through designing for hierarchy.","Student Housing; Future Vision; Well-being","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Karbasizadeh, Nima (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In the present world, a new development in technology every other year is anticipated. Robots and motion stages in the high-tech sector are required to work at higher speeds being stable, more precise, and power-efficient. Linear controllers have served well but are falling short to continue with the trend. Reset elements can enhance the performance of linear filters like PID by overcoming the bounds of linear control. As the name implies, reset elements reset their state/ states, thus induce nonlinearity. This nonlinearity provides reduced phase lag with similar magnitude behaviour as linear elements. With such behaviour or by adding linear filters with reset elements, both the steady-state and transient response can be improved. The tracking precision is not needed to be compromised over stability and noise rejection. The reset control has its downsides. The resetting action (nonlinearity) produce higher-order harmonics in the output. The number and instant of resets occurring are vital in determining the closed-loop sensitivities. Ideally, only two resets should occur in one period of the reference frequency. But due to higher-order harmonics, multiple resets (zero crossings) can occur, which makes analytical closed-loop estimation difficult. This thesis provides an amplitude threshold criteria on higher-order harmonics to avoid the multiple zero crossings. Controllers following such a threshold can help benefit the system from nonlinearity rather than being adversely affected by it. An example of a control scheme with reset and linear elements for a motion stage is presented that satisfies the amplitude threshold. No multiple resets in the input signal to the reset element for any reference frequency were confirmed.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

During the hydrodynamic and meteorological accident were quite severe, with a significant wave height of 3.0m and wind speeds of 11 m/s, which is likely to have resulted in a boundary rip at the northern mole. On top of that extraordinary amounts of sea foam amassed at the northern harbour mole, disorienting anyone who got trapped in the area. It is likely that due to the wind and wave conditions and the resulting rip current it was near impossible for the surfers to exit the vicinity of the mole, especially with thick layer of foam. The Scheveningen harbour area was modelled in Delft3D and subjected to tide wind and waves. Assessment of the influence of wind, waves and tide on rip current intensity was performed by comparing the model results from a combined run with the rip velocities obtained by superimposing rip velocities per individual forcing condition. Lastly, the model was run with conditions resembling the aforementioned accident as to check whether the model was able hindcast this situation. The main wind and wave directions found to lead to offshore directed rip transport come from 30-70 degrees relative to shore normal. Retentive rips also occur, mainly when the wind-wave forcing comes from -70 to 0 degrees relative to shore normal, although rips occur less frequently in this range.","Rip currents; Delft3D; Modelling; Swimmer safety","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, formal synthesis of event-triggered controllers is an open topic. In this work, we propose different methods to synthesize event-triggered controllers. The event-triggered controller consists of a triggering function based on a certificate function and a stabilizing feedback law. Counterexample-Guided Inductive Synthesis (CEGIS) is used to synthesize formally correct controllers. The feedback law is synthesized along with the certificate function or using feedback linearization. This framework is also extended to the synthesis of periodic event-triggered controllers, which periodically evaluate the triggering condition. A method is provided for how the sampling time of the triggering condition should be chosen. The synthesis approach is tested on several systems, through which the effectiveness of the approaches are demonstrated. It is shown that the method can synthesize event-triggered controllers for general nonlinear systems.","event-triggered control; formal synthesis; smt-solvers","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Burnouts are a severe, negative consequence of lacking performance management within firms and a result of a disbalance between energy input (e.g: sleep, social activities, physical activity) and output (e.g: workload, anxiety on the job, caring for a kid) Burnouts lead to employment challenges for firms, resulting in a potential threat for the strategic competitive advantage for the firm. Moreover, on an individual level, high risks of burnout lead to severe consequences for the individual health of knowledge workers (e.g: cardiac diseases, impact on personal life, auto-immune-diseases) and major costs for both the society and firms itself. Dutch Journalists of the NRC concluded that an average burnout accounts for €60.000,- per burnout, while the total societal burden account for €1.8 billion each year as a result of direct and indirect effects of burnouts. Despite the competitive significance of vital employees for firms, we see an increasing number of burn-out related cases within the Netherlands. In 2019, 14,6 people per thousand inhabitants were officially diagnosed with neurasthenia/surmenage (=burnout) by their general practitioner. Moreover, in 2018, Approximately 16,4% of the male employees and 18,1% of the female employees experienced “multiple times or more” burn-out related symptoms during the month. Generally, this is 1 out of 6 employees of the Dutch workforce. This account for a 41% increase of burn-out related symptoms with men and an increase of 66% of burn-out related symptoms with women. The Quantified-Self (QS) philosophy prescribes the approach of the human being as a machine and, following the QS fanatics, has the potential to optimize performance. For example, the QS-approach is widely adopted within athletes sporters to optimize performance based on oxygen-levels and heartrate measurements. However, measuring different elements of the human body (such as nutrition, sleep or physical activity) has not yet been able to decrease the development of burn-out related symptoms. This research addresses the question on how the quantified-self and life-logging can contribute to the optimization of energy management within firms, and thus decrease the risk on burn-out related amongst knowledge workers and implicated side effects as stated above. First, an integrative, holistic framework is presented (the Vitality Map) which incorporates all relevant determinants (21 in total) influencing the knowledge worker battery, and thus, determine sustainable performance of knowledge workers. These determinants are categorized on four levels, which consist of two levels of non-adjustable determinants and two levels of adjustable determinants. An extensive literature is conducted, integrating five theoretical domains which lay around the solution, including health &amp; vitality, artificial intelligence, knowledge workers, performance management and human resource management systems. Based on the literature research, societal and competitive challenges are analyzed and translated into 9 Design Objectives. The Design Objectives are generic objectives which human resource management systems should incorporate in order to facilitate optimal performance management of individual knowledge workers within firms. The following Design Objectives are formulated:Thirdly, the Performance Management System (PFMS) Framework is developed, which builds forward on the Vitality Map and which presents how the data collection, aggregation, analysis and presentation should be implemented within firms. The PFMS is presented in Figure 2. This framework provides a fundamental description of the performance delivery process (energy charge to performance) and shows how the data can contribute to informed consent in performance management and policy developments, which leads to better strategic decision making in firms in relation to the human resources available within the organization and preventive interventions which decrease the costs which are associated by curation of burmouts. Moreover, the PFMS Framework suggests how the positing and collaboration of health, vitality and performance consultants and internal stakeholders within the firm can cooperate in order to optimize human resources within the company. At last, the research contributes to the scientific development of cross-disciplinary approaches in human resource practices. Five theoretical domains are integrated and incorporated in a single artefact which is supported by the interviewees. Further research is suggested to explore the practical implementation of the artefact prototype as developed in this This Thesis Research. However, human resource managers and IT managers within firms can adopt the practical tools as provided in this Research Paper.","Quantified-Self; Burn-out; Performance Management; Human Resource Management; Machine Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

A less strict derivative of origami are Hinging Rigid Panel Structures, which are not bound to be developable from a single flat sheet of planar material. These Hinging Rigid Panel Structures can be applied to many fields of mechanical design, and moreover are interesting for their kinematic behaviour. The benefits of using a structure that originates from pieces of flat material include but are not limited to being able to surface treat uninterrupted sections of material that can subsequently be folded into part of the structure’s configuration. In order to describe and programmatically manipulate Hinging Rigid Panel Structures and their kinematics adequately and systematically, this research takes a new and specific approach on modelling them. The Hinging Rigid Panel Structures are modelled as 1-DOF mechanisms, consisting of a base pyramid, to which 2 arms of a variable amount of pairs of triangles are attached. To sufficiently test the versatility of this method of describing Hinging Rigid Panel Structures, a classification has been set up to cover a range of kinematic input-output relations, which will be used to test algorithms against. This classification differentiates by dimension and displacement distribution over both the input and output curves, and captures all kinematic transmissions in 1545 cases. With a sample size of np = 10 randomly generated versions of each of these input-output relations and a motion path resolution of rc = 25, a data set was generated using this classification method. An evolutionary algorithm was created to navigate the solution space more efficiently than using conventional algorithms like (gradient based) hill climber algorithms. The main variables of the evolutionary algorithm like generation size (sg = 60), amount of generations (ng = 75), mutation rate amount (nm = 180) and parent splicing methods have empirically been determined. Running the optimisation for all the categories of the previously mentioned classification was done by adapting the code to be able to be run in crowd computational capacity across 17 contributors’ computers. The results show that Hinging Rigid Panel Structure mechanisms are to a certain extend able to be synthesised to generate requested transmissions, but some cases are harder to reach than others. Complex compound 3D paths are harder to optimise for than other categories, such as planar circular motions. This research lays out a valuable basis that contains all aspects to create a reasonable performing optimiser for 3-D Hinging Rigid Panel Structures that follow requested input-output relations. This research could for example be used as a starting point for developing a software package that allows designers to implement Hinging Rigid Panel Structures in their CAD designs for mechanical transmissions.","Kinematic transmissions; origami; hinging rigid panel structure; Evolutionary algorithm; Optimisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Precision and Microsystems Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","CO2 emission of vehicles and its influence on climate change is a widely discussed topic already for many years. New CO2 emission norms for vehicles have been defined based on the 2021 baseline: 15% reduction resulting in 0.09 kg/km for 2025, and 37.5% reduction resulting in 0.069 kg/km for 2030. Both norms are defined under the Worldwide harmonized Light-duty Test Procedure (WLTP) and apply to light-duty vehicles. In this study a new accurate measure is introduced to determine data related CO2 emissions of vehicle automation. The data related aspects in this study include: sensing components, the computing platform, disks inside the vehicle, wireless communication networks and data centers. These data related emissions are used to compare to the norms, which are based on the propulsion of the vehicle. A computational model is developed based on literature and a survey to obtain the instantaneous CO2 emission rates (kg CO2-e/h) of the data related aspects for varying scenarios. Scenario analysis is applied to define six different scenarios. The scenarios differ based on two varying sensing compositions and three varying energy grids. The two sensing compositions correspond to a Tesla Model S (SAE level 2) and Waymo's Chrysler Pacifica (SAE level 4). The different energy grids correspond to the 2019 Climate Act targets for 2030 and 2050 to reduce CO2 emission, and are referred to as fixed CO2 emission rates in kg CO2-e/Wh. Sensitivity analysis of the instantaneous CO2 emission rate is applied, to obtain the data related aspects that have the strongest influence on the resulting CO2 emission in each scenario. The instantaneous data related CO2 emission rates are translated to the driving cycle of the WLTP to obtain the spatial data related CO2 emission rates (kg CO2-e/km), which are used to compare to the defined propulsion-based CO2 norms of vehicles. From the sensitivity analysis, it is concluded that the energy intensity of wireless communication networks and the data transmission rate from vehicle to data center, are the two data related aspects that have the strongest influence on the instantaneous CO2 emission rate. From the spatial CO2 emission rate of each scenario, it is concluded that the energy grid also significantly affects whether the norms can be met. For high amounts of data transmission, the norms seem to be difficult to achieve in most scenarios and situations. Therefore, the energy consumption of wireless communication networks should be further optimized. Regarding the data transmission rate, further research should be obtained to gain more insights into the values of the data transmission rates dependent on the travel speed. Based on the assumptions made in this study, the CO2 emission from the data related aspects seem to exceed the propulsion-based CO2 norms of vehicles. Future work should investigate if data related aspects of vehicle automation need to be included in the CO2 norms of vehicles.","Autonomous vehicles; CO2 emissions; Data","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

In this report, we study how to collect external security indicators from a company's network, and how to process this information to build an intrusion prediction model. First, we build a scanning tool to retrieve relevant security indicators from the company's network (such as services misconfigurations or vulnerabilities) and public datasets. Then, we associate the collected indicators with incidents data from a Managed Security Service Provider in order to model using a Random Forest algorithm the probability of intrusions. Finally, we analyze the most significant indicators according to the model in an effort to find which indicators are the most relevant to evaluate the company's security posture. When we assess our model on real company's data, it achieves 92% accuracy on intrusions prediction.","cybersecurity; intrusion prediction; machine learning; scanning; network security","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Cyber Security","",""

The new lighting system at shunting yards of ProRail does not meet the intended environmental goals. here is a need for lighting systems to be installed that save energy and costs, but most studies suggest new techniques and technological components that can be applied. Little research has been done into the question of what an architectural design and process should meet on a socio-technical level. The lighting system should be seen as a large complex system consisting of interconnected and interdependent actors. A technical solution or improvement only is insufficient to achieve the environmental goal of saving energy. Therefore, the whole system must be brought together; the interaction with stakeholders and users, technology, laws and regulations must be determined in order to understand the complex system and formulate a solution. This research was carried out using a Design Science Research (DSR) approach, combined with Systems Engineering (SE) to deliver a process road map for the implementation lighting system that is well supported by both, the problem owner and the users of the yard. Requirements have been formulated using the Requirements Engineering, part of systems engineering, and resulted in various means that have been formulated for the six most important requirements in the form of a morphological chart. Choosing the right means from the morphological map to arrive at a definitive lighting system, creates dilemmas and challenges that require making trade-offs. The possible means for the main functions should be compared against each other by weighing out the advantages and disadvantages so that a mean can be chosen for each function to arrive at a result that maximizes the overall preference for a design. An exchange must be made because the quality or property of the chosen mean is reduced or lost in exchange for gains in other aspects of another mean. These advantages and disadvantages of the means have been researched and described resulting in different trade-offs. This new approach to system design in the train sector provides insights into the fact that it should not be approached from a purely technical point of view only: the soft side of involving human aspect is indispensable.

Most deaths due to atherosclerosis occur when the fibrous cap covering the necrotic core ruptures, leading to a blood clot. To determine whether an atherosclerotic plaque will rupture requires the development of accurate computational models. One of the key aspects for these models is the material model, in which collagen fibres play a major role. This study aims to contribute to the making of a numerical model which accurately represents atherosclerotic plaque by comparing the elastic and rupture behaviour of engineered collagenous micro tissues and their respective finite element models in ABAQUS. The Holzapfel-Gasser-Ogden material model of these computational models is based on a combination of global material parameters and local material parameters based on the local fibre organisation. A framework developed to measure the local fibre organisation using provided imagery of a nuclear stained tissue engineered sample shows the collagen fibres align along the loading direction and the edges of the geometry. The fibers are less dispersed along the edges of the geometry and on the left and right of a formed soft inclusion. A uniaxial tensile test was performed on four tissue engineered samples. The elastic and rupture behaviour of the samples during the uniaxial tensile tests is replicated in ABAQUS using both isotropic and homogeneous material parameters, and anisotropic heterogenous material parameters. The stresses measured in the simulations are highly dependent on both the material parameters and the geometry of the model. The strains are mostly dependent on the geometry, but are affected by the material model. Due to the higher stiffness at the edges of the geometry of the anisotropic samples, the stresses increased greatly, and the strains decreased slightly. The rupture behaviour of the cultured samples is replicated in the FEM simulations using extended finite element method (XFEM). The damage in the samples with isotropic material parameters initiates both from the soft inclusion as the left and right edges of the geometry. The damage in the samples with anisotropic material parameters initiates, similarly to the cultured samples, only from the sides of the soft inclusion. The damage in both the cultured and simulated samples propagate mostly horizontal and from the soft inclusion outward. In three out of four isotropic samples however, damage propagates to varying degrees from the edge of the geometry inward. Based on these findings it is concluded that implementing the local fibre organisation in the material model can improve the accuracy of finite element simulations of collagenous soft tissues, which includes atherosclerotic plaque, as the rupture behaviour of the simulations with anisotropic material parameters more accurately represents the rupture behaviour of the engineered fibrous tissues in comparison with simulations with isotropic material parameters.","atherosclerosis; FEM; XFEM; Biomechanics; plaque rupture; Finite Element Modeling; artery; collagen","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

(graduation committee); Trompenaars, Fons (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This thesis explored the company Trompenaars Hampden-Turner (THT), its offerings, activities and the context it works in. THT is a company originally founded in 1989 as the Centre for International Business Studies. Trompenaars Hampden-Turner is a relatively small niche consulting company which is renowned in the area of Culture for Business. It is specialised in cultural dilemmas in the business context. Its employees work to improve the integration between people (values, attitudes) and organisations (structures, systems and processes). THT is a founder-centric organisation, and this poses certain risks and limitations which influence the growth and resilience of an organisation. For THT this means that in order to continue spreading their theories and practise consulting, the founder-centric configuration of the company needs to change. Therefore, the main research question was established as: How can a small founder-centric consultancy become less founder-centric and sustain growth in the coming ten years? In the first part, information was gathered to create a deeper understanding of the client, domain and the market. First, the company history, business model, products and competitors were analysed. To gather the information needed, various interviews were held with people working at THT. Secondly, literature was reviewed, looking into managing growth in organisations, founder-led companies and how organisations and consultancies are structured. These research activities resulted in a collection of insights which were used for the strategy creation. The insights yielded from the research were used to create a story which was written to design a future vision and communicate the vision. Storytelling was chosen to explore the benefits of this method, instead of sketching which is more common in industrial design. The created future vision called for a strategy in which THT’s portfolio consists of digital products such as an e-learning course. Using this future vision, a roadmap was created to strategize this pivot in company activity from consulting to content development. The roadmap is divided into three horizons. The goal of the first horizon is to focus on scaling down the current portfolio and focus on creating a base of e-learning courses. The goal of the second horizon is to expand the portfolio whilst learning service partners are attracted to partially outsource marketing and personal parts of the hybrid learning solutions. The goal of the third horizon is to be the best expert in the field when it comes to developing content. The proposed strategy for THT was supplemented with a design of the new organisational blueprint and some advice on the corporate communication including the name of the company. For the organisational blueprint, a circular model was chosen to easily scale with the organisation’s size or the range of the product portfolio. It was advised for the company name to make it refer to culture rather than the name of specific individuals. The strategy based on this take on a future vision for THT, combined with trends which were relevant to THT’s industry and knowledge on organisational design, resulted in a plan to become less founder-centric and sustain growth in the coming ten years.","Strategic Design; Consultancy; Storytelling; Roadmapping; organisational design; Future Vision","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Due to their ecological significance and their role in providing grounds for a variety of human activities, understanding how tidal inlet systems evolve is of interest to scientists, engineers, and managers. The seabed profile in such systems evolves due to the erosion and deposition of sediment particles from and onto the seabed. Equivalently, this can be described by the tidally averaged convergences and divergences of sediment transport, which takes place due to diffusive and advective processes. The aim of this thesis is to systematically investigate the importance of the different sediment transport mechanisms in double-inlet systems, in which the back-barrier basin is connected to the open sea by two inlets. The geometry under consideration is that of a shallow tidal inlet with a prescribed length and arbitrary width. Starting from an idealised process-based model, in which all sediment transport mechanisms are included, the model is reduced to a formulation, in which only the dominant transport mechanisms are retained. The results obtained suggest that the transport mechanisms, which must be retained in order to obtain equilibrium bed profiles, comparable to those obtained with the original process-based model, are advection, erosion, and deposition. Modelling the transport of sediment using these terms results in reproducing the equilibrium bed profiles found with the original model in the case when the inlet system is modelled as a rectangular channel. When the width of the channel in non-constant, the equilibrium bed profiles obtained with the two approaches have similar shapes, with slight variations in their exact values.","morphodynamics; mathematical physics; Differential equations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

The long instrument shafts, two-dimensional view, and limited space for movement make simple actions, such as grasping and manipulating the needle and thread, difficult in the laparoscopic setting. To simplify the suturing process, the Hornet project was started by DEAM. The company was asked by two gynecologists to create a laparoscopic suturing device that simplifies the closure of the vaginal cuff during a total laparoscopic hysterectomy. The first prototypes that were created had promising design elements, but their suturing techniques proved difficult to execute. The modified sewing machine suturing technique was created to solve these issues, resulting in the aim of this thesis: to develop a laparoscopic suturing instrument that uses the modified sewing machine suturing technique to simplify the closure of the vaginal cuff. A new prototype of the Hornet was designed based on a list of Product Specifications. This instrument, Hornet prototype B3, was built and subsequently tested in a series of design verification tests to determine if the design meets the Product Specifications. Additionally, a series of user tests was executed to verify whether the design simplifies the closure of the vaginal cuff. In the tests, the participants placed sutures with both the Hornet and with the regular suturing method. Participants with different levels of suturing and laparoscopic experience were included to determine the effect of experience on the suturing results with the Hornet. The tests showed that the prototype simplifies the suturing process. All participants were able to place a closed suture with the Hornet, whereas only 43% of the participants placed a closed suture with the regular suturing method. The participants without laparoscopic experience had significantly shorter suturing times with the Hornet compared to regular suturing, indicating that the suturing method with the Hornet is simpler to learn. The participants with laparoscopic experience performed similarly with the Hornet and the regular suturing method, indicating that the first time the Hornet is used gives similar results to experience with regular laparoscopic suturing. From this research, it can be concluded that the Hornet prototype B3 simplifies the closure of the vaginal cuff when compared to regular suturing. To further confirm this claim, additional development and testing of the prototype is needed. Some alterations to the prototype design are required to improve its functioning and to ensure that all the product specifications are met. Additional tests are needed to investigate the extent in which the prototype simplifies the suturing process and to determine the learning curve of the Hornet.","Laparoscopic; suturing; device; Laparoscopic surgery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-26","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Multiple efforts are done to be able to sail with unmanned systems (systems thatdon’t need maintenance while sailing), but for large unmanned surface vehicles, the P&amp;P system isone of the systems that is not reliable enough. The goal of this thesis research was to study the pos­sibilities of adjusting an existing P&amp;P system to make it reliable enough for unmanned sailing. Theresearch resulted in creating a reliability model that gives insight in the direct impact maintenance hason reliability to study the possibilities of removing maintenance personnel from board. Therefore, themain research question of this thesis is:What adjustments to the power and propulsion system of a Navy vessel are necessary to be able tooperate for a given period of time, consisting of several missions, without any on­board maintenancepersonnel?To answer this research question, a study regarding the current system was done first with an functionaland physical decomposition. This gave insight in what functions the P&amp;P system needs to fulfill to pro­vide the ship with power and propulsion, what systems the P&amp;P system contains and what preventivemaintenance actions are currently done to prevent failure. With the data and knowledge acquired bystudying the system, performing a failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) showed that data currentlyavailable is not able to show the impact of maintenance and thus it is unclear how reliable an unmannedsystem would be.To be able to do so, a fault tree analysis (FTA) model was created to calculate the reliability and showthe direct impact of maintenance for the P&amp;P system on board a Holland class ocean going patrolvessel of the Royal Netherlands Navy. The model made use of an exponential distribution that was im­plemented with a time­dependent Weibull failure rate function while only using the mean time betweenfailure (MTBF) and the maintenance frequency for preventive maintenance actions.As a result, it has been found that either making the 20 weakest components of the P&amp;P system re­dundant, or changing the maintenance strategy from condition based to predictive and making the 5weakest components redundant, the reliability of a P&amp;P system that receives no maintenance during50­day missions can be as reliable as a manned P&amp;P system. Furthermore, several sensory equip­ment is added to replace inspections currently done by maintenance personnel on board.However, even though the reliability of a 50­day unmanned system can be as reliable as a mannedsystem mathematically, the model does not take into account corrective maintenance. An expansionto this model including corrective maintenance should be researched to show the opportunities of anunmanned hybrid propulsion system. Other recommendations for further research include identifyingfailure mechanisms to adjust the failure rate progression and implementing repair times and cost tostudy the feasibility of adjusting the current P&amp;P system and maintenance strategy for unmanned sail­ing.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

Due to the biodegradation of organic material, methane, a strong greenhouse gas, is released into the air and soluble pollutants, like ammonium or heavy metals, are flushed out of the landfill waste. In modern landfills, the waste body is isolated from the environment by an impermeable liner and both the gas and the leachate fluxes are collected and treated. However, sealing the landfill reduces the emissions on the short term but gives no sustainable solution as eternal active aftercare is needed and the emission potential is not reduced. The goal of the CURE project is to develop methods to enable the sustainable management of Dutch landfills. One of these methods is piloted at the Braambergen landfill, which is the in-situ aeration of the waste body with the goal of speeding up the biological degradation of organic matter to reduce the emission potential relatively quickly below the values in the Dutch regulations, such that the eternal active aftercare is not required anymore. The issue that the landfill operator, Afvalzorg, is facing is that in compartment 11Z of the landfill the aeration efficiency is poor due to ponding leachate. The objective of this thesis is to quantify the relation between the water level in the landfill and the efficiency of aeration, and to research the spatial and temporal variability of the water levels, leachate composition and hydraulic conductivity of the waste body to investigate the nature of the water and to find a suitable solution to mitigate the reduced aeration efficiency. To reach this goal, multiple types of field and lab measurements have been performed and the results of a water balance model have been used for a numerical evaluation. In the field, water tables have been measured as well the magnitude and composition of landfill gas extracted by the aeration wells. Pumping tests have been performed on the wells to assess the hydrological behaviour of the leachate surrounding the wells and to determine the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the waste. Leachate samples from all the wells have been collected and analysed in the lab on pH, redox potential, electrical conductivity, DOC and ammonium concentration. Also were CTD-divers installed in some of the wells to monitor the response to rainfall and the medium long term behaviour of the water level and the electrical conductivity. The general conclusion of this thesis is that the studied compartment 11Z is homogenous in its heterogeneity. With all the different measurement types performed it was in some way the objective to see whether the behaviour or the properties of the landfill and the leachate can be grouped spatially, but this was not the case. Therefore can be concluded that the only scale for which a measurement can be representative for the entire compartment is on the scale of the compartment itself. This is in line with the expectations of large heterogeneity in landfills and the unique situation of aeration system on the Braambergen made it possible to proof this. The efficiency of the aeration system is particularly low in compartment 11Z because the conditions are unfavourable for both water and gas flow. The conditions in compartments 12 and especially 11N are more favourable because the waste, especially at the bottom of the compartments, is more permeable. Even if the amount of water in 11Z is reduced and the gas flow increases, the total amount of extracted LFG will not reach the same level as for the other compartments.","Landfill; Hydrological processes; Spatial variability; Temporal variability; Leachate composition; Water balance model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

(mentor); Putra, N.E. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The increase in the average human lifespan and the higher prevalence of extreme sports communities in the current society has led to an unfortunate increase in bone defect and fracture cases. Consequently, there is a growing demand for bone fracture therapy and technology. In the case of orthopaedic implants, research has been gradually inclining towards designing biodegradable, biologically integrative porous scaffolds, capable of providing a healthy environment for optimal bone regeneration. Moreover, by mimicking the interconnected porous structures of the natural bone matrix, these implants allow the flow of blood, oxygen and nutrients that are essential in the healing and maintenance of healthy osseous tissue. The gradual dissolution of the structure deems it a non-permanent implant, ultimately completely replaced by natural bone tissue. Pure Fe can offer suitable mechanical properties to support the applied loads of habitual human activities, however, it exhibits too slow biodegradation rates and fails to display satisfactory bone integrative characteristics. Fe-based bioceramic composites are reported to offer biocompatibility, biodegradation and mechanical properties ideal for bone substitution applications. Currently, additively manufactured (AM) Fe-bioceramic composites are one of the most promising material classes for biodegradable scaffold implants. This thesis investigates the extrusion-based AM Fe-akermanite (5 to 15 vol%) composite scaffolds. The fabrication method involved 3D printing printable Fe-akermanite inks followed by heat treatment in an inert environment. Static in vitro immersion testing was conducted to evaluate the degradation characteristics of the scaffolds. Furthermore, the as-sintered and degraded scaffolds were subjected to uniaxial compression testing to determine how the mechanical properties vary as the scaffold degrades. Cytotoxicity evaluations of the scaffolds were also conducted in the form of indirect and direct preosteoblast seeding and culture procedures. The addition of akermanite hastened the degradation rate, with the Fe-15 (vol%) akermanite scaffolds displaying the fastest degradation and most rapid formation of corrosion products containing bone-forming elements, e.g., Ca and P. The yield strength of the scaffolds decreased with increased akermanite content however remained within a suitable range even after degradation. Furthermore, the akermanite addition did not induce a shift towards brittle-like material behaviour. The scaffolds containing 15 vol% akermanite displayed superior cytocompatibility with preosteoblast cells. Therefore, Fe- akermanite composites exhibit great potential for use in biodegradable orthopaedic scaffold applications, with Fe-15 (vol%) akermanite displaying the most promising results.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-12-01","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","A changing climate means that the combination of storm surge and river flood waves is becoming increasingly likely. The turbinepumping station of the Delta21 concept, is designed just for that. The energy storage lake and the pumps capable of up to 10,000 m3/s mean that even the highest river discharges can be sluiced to the North Sea in the event of closure of the storm surge barrier. When the pumps are not being operated to combat flood waves, the pumpturbines can be used for the purpose of storage of intermittent renewable energies. The required capacity of the pumping station means that the total width of the structure is in the order of kilometers. Past studies into the conceptual design have shown that if the pumping station and flood barrier are integral then this results in a massive structure. AnsorenaRuiz (2020) showed that such a massive structure performs very poorly in a life cycle analysis. For this reason, the goal of the thesis research is to develop an improved design for the turbinepumping station in which the structure can be separated into two parts resulting in a less monolithic form. The design is separated into two main parts: the hydraulic design and the structural design. The hydraulic design ensures that the turbinepumping station can operate at the required functionality. A pump characteristic as well as a turbine characteristic was received from equipment manufacturer Pentair and was adjusted to the requirements of the Delta21 turbinepumping station. A simulation showed that the total efficiency of the turbinepumping system is around 67%. Using timeseries of storm surges and predicted flood waves with various return periods, a simulation was also done of the response of the energy storage lake and pumping station. It showed that for flood waves of very low annual exceedance probability the required capacity of the turbinepumping station should be larger than 10,000 m3/s, but however the storage function of the energy storage lake does contribute to the sluicing of the superfluous discharge. Various alternatives for the hydraulic design were conceived, and it was concluded that the draft tube shape of the intake is the optimal solution. For the structural design the elements of the turbinepumping installation were integrated into a sea dike. The dike acts as a flood defense, keeping the North Sea out of the energy storage lake, while the elements of the pumping station ensure control of the water level inside the lake. This separation of functions allows for a less imposing structure to be achieved, without compromising on the performance. In this study, sea level rise and energy transition go hand in hand. On the one hand, pumping technology is used to protect delta areas from flooding, while on the other hand the technology of hydropumped storage is used to increase the productivity of renewable energies to offset further climate change. On top of this, the gridbalancing capabilities of the system make it financially attractive for potential investors. Hydropumped storage is already an upcoming technology in mountainous areas, but its potential in deltas and coastal regions is even bigger.","Pumped hydro storage; DELTA21; Pumped hydropower storage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

A large part of these grounds is used for livestock farming. However, the peat needs to be dried to prevent cows and other cattle from sinking with their hooves into the soft, wet peat. This drying starts a process called oxidation. This reaction with oxygen in the air and warm sunlight results in the forming of CO2 and some methane gas, which are added to the atmosphere. Since this contributes considerably to the CO2 emissions in the Netherlands, it requires solutions to stop the oxidation process and the subsequent subsidence. It seems impossible to find a solution for this problem with which every stakeholder can agree. Five main stakeholder groups are identified in this research: the research organisations, the agricultural stakeholders, the water management organisations, the nature preservation organisations, and the administrative bodies. These parties all have their own worldview and their own ideas about the situation. This forms a controversy, which contains many different elements and different actors, in which the different stakeholder groups disagree on different elements. This controversy slows down the process of stopping the oxidation of the peat meadow grounds. Therefore, the end goal of this research is on the one hand for the different stakeholder groups to gain insight in the motives of the viewpoints of the counteracting parties. On the other hand, a new base for these stakeholder groups should be formed in which a productive situation for (renewed) collaboration is created, which can lead to more effective conversations on the future solutions in peat meadow areas. This study is approached using the methodology concept of Design-based Research. <br/>To create a situation in which stakeholders can work together towards a solution instead of just focusing on their own priorities, the stakeholders should take a step back and build trust on other levels with the different stakeholder groups. This should help them to open up to insights that other stakeholders may have, which could lead to a situation in which they could work together. With this as a foundation, a participatory tool was chosen that could help to build a situation for a more effective collaboration: a serious game. The digital board game ‘Samen door het veen' (translation: Together through the peat) was designed, played with representative players, and analysed with the concepts of collaboration and double loop learning. The results showed that the players built more trust during the game and gained more insight into the perspective of other players, so the game seems to achieve its goals quite well. It can be concluded that the game is fun to play and that it has quite some potential for stimulating double loop learning and creating a situation in which more effective collaboration could take place.","Peat meadow; Controversy; Epistemic outlooks; Serious game; Design-based research; Collaboration; Double loop learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","Double degree in Industrial Ecology and Science Communication","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

In combination with the other stressors, it is projected that OA will have a wide range of impacts on marine life and its services to humanity. The representation of these implications is limited in environmental assessment tools such as Life Cycle Assessment. This research explores the relationship between the changing acidity of the oceans and marine biodiversity loss. This relation is quantified through utilising the ecotoxicology impact assessment approach for LCA. Following this approach, an endpoint characterization model is developed for ocean acidification. 3 different categorisations (climate zones, calcification, exposure duration) were made to assess their effects on species responses. The results revealed that there is no significant difference in responses based on different exposure durations or climate zones. Calcifying species on the other hand is found to have a higher sensitivity to ocean acidification as the change in carbonate chemistry directly influences the shell and skeleton formation of these organisms. Lastly, these models were integrated into an endpoint characterization model for ocean acidification. From the 3 GHG emissions included within the scope of this research (CO2, CO, CH4), CO2 has the highest (CFCO2 = 4.883 × 104 (&#x1d443;&#x1d437;&#x1d439;)&#x1d45a;3/&#x1d458;&#x1d454;&#x1d43a;&#x1d43b;&#x1d43a;) and CH4 has the lowest (CFCH4 = 4.072 × 104 &#x1d443;&#x1d437;&#x1d439;)&#x1d45a;3/&#x1d458;&#x1d454;&#x1d43a;&#x1d43b;&#x1d43a;) impact on marine biodiversity loss due to OA. These ecosystem damage indicators can be utilised in the impact assessment phase of the Life Cycle Assessment to translate the inventory results into impact on marine biodiversity. Through the quantification of the impacts of ocean acidification, the effects of this major stressor on marine life can be better understood and targeted strategies can be developed. However, more research is required to increase the robustness of these models through expanding the species scope and incorporating temporal and geographical aspects into the models. Furthermore, the cascading effects of the changing ocean pH are still unknown and its consequences on ecosystems and socio-economic structures are unprecedented. To establish science-based targets and strategies to conserve the species richness in marine life, the extent of our understanding of the damage caused by anthropogenic actions needs to be further explored and estimated.","Ocean Acidification; Life Cycle Assessment; Marine Biodiversity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

Therefore a control application which can run different protocols was created. We have shown that a significant reduction of communication time can be achieved by using event-triggered control (ETC), and by using self-triggering techniques we could reduce this even further. Wireless control networks (WCN) are networks of one or multiple controllers, sensors and actuators which share a digital communication network. Sensors send their measurements to the controller, and the controller sends a control signal to the actuators. Because the nodes are digital devices, periodic control is the standard approach. Communication therefore is not needed all the time, and nodes can sleep in between updates to save energy. Event-triggered control is a technique to further reduce communication of resource constrained nodes in the network by only updating control when an event, typically a significant change since the last control update, occurs. Water irrigation systems (WIS) are networks of channels transporting water from main rivers, to smaller rivers which need to be controlled to avoid losses. At TU Delft a model of a water irrigation system with three pools has been connected to a WCN to simulate this. To create an application for this testbed, supporting different control schemes, a low power embedded OS capable of doing multitasking with a replaceable network stack is needed. The Contiki Operation System is capable to do this and has been used by the D3S Research Group of the University of Trento to build wireless control bus (WCB), and has also been used for the WIS control application. WCB uses network floods from a protocol called Glossy and a schedule to synchronise communication with low power, and supports both periodic and event-triggered control. Experiments with WCB show periodic control is possible with only 7% communication time for this setup, and event-triggered control with only 2% without much loss of performance. Because the testbed unit has some technical problems, a hardware-in-the-loop simulation was created to connect to the WCN to do the experiments. A further reduction in communication has been achieved by combining a predictive control method called PSTC with ETC, which we call ETC+. Advantages over normal ETC are not large in our experiments, and there are still practical problems, but they show this is a promising research area.","event-triggered; Energy Reduction; Cyber pysical system; Wireless control; Wireless Networks; Water irrigation systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

Topology optimization, introduced in the late 80s, is a method capable of producing such structures and has been mainly studied for isotropic materials. On the other hand, the performance of composite structures, which are already widely employed in the aerospace industry, can be now improved due to the latest advances in manufacturing. Automated Fiber Placement has paved the way for further exploiting the capabilities of composites and led to the introduction of an optimization method, namely three-step variable stiffness design, that alters the fiber orientation within each ply, leading to a variable stiffness laminate. In this thesis, a staggered optimization method that simultaneously improves the material and the structural performance of balanced and symmetric laminated composite structures under planar loading is developed by coupling the two aforementioned methods. A finite element code is developed based on the equations for a static and linearly elastic problem. For the topology optimization problem, the nodal density values are used as design parameters and the Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization approach is chosen, along with a density filtering. The first step of the variable stiffness design method is implemented, using the nodal lamination parameters as design variables. The coupling of the two optimization techniques is performed through a staggered optimization, where both techniques are implemented successively, at each iteration. A gradient-based scheme is used for both topology optimization and variable stiffness design and the steepest descent method is implemented for the design update. The sensitivity analysis is performed based on the continuous adjoint method. Three different examples are demonstrated in this thesis; the case of a flat composite plate, a lug and an aircraft chair bracket. The whole optimization procedure, including pre- and post-processing, is carried out using an algorithm developed in MATLAB. The meshes are externally created and imported in the code. Convergence studies and a comparison with indicative examples from the literature are performed in order to verify the obtained results. A parametric analysis of the plate studies the effects of the different topology optimization parameters. Finally, comparative analyses are executed for the three aforementioned designs investigating both the structural and the computational efficiency of the results obtained with each of the three optimization methods, i.e. topology optimization, variable stiffness design and staggered optimization.","Topology optimization; Variable stiffness; Staggered optimization; Composite; Optimization algorithms; SIMP; Lamination parameters; Adjoint problem","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Machine learning survival models have been used in many cancer studies. However, machine learning models may not always be interpretable. The current lack of research for explainable survival analysis for urothelial cancer prompted this study. This study offers an insight into the generalizability and explainability of machine learning models for urothelial cancer. We also determine how we can make the models interpretable in the presence of collinearity. In this study, we compared the performance of the models; Rank Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM), Rank Kernel SVM, Coxnet, Random Survival Forest (RSF), and Gradient Boosting (Gboost). We used the Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets. We used gene expression variables and clinical variables to train our models. We evaluated these models based on the C-index. We used Permutation Feature Importance (PFI), a model-agnostic method, to explain our models and used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to deal with collinearity. We determined that the best linear model was Rank Linear SVM (C-index = 0.58) and the best non-linear model was RSF (C-index = 0.63). Using PFI showed that some of the top-most important genes were expressed in urothelial cancer, one of them even being a prognostic marker. With PCA, we were able to deal with collinearity, and the performance using PCA was comparable to models not using it. PFI with PCA showed that processes exhibited in the top genes were prevalent in cancer.","Survival analysis; Urothelial Cancer; Explainability; Generalizability; Model-agnostic; Coxnet; Rank SVM; RSF; GBoost; C-index; PFI; PCA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Bioinformatics","",""

This gives rise to a great availability of multi-modal biological data with no inter-data set sample/feature correspondence. This work proposes a novel approach to align multi-modal data sets in an unsupervised fashion using an Autoencoder to obtain latent embeddings of the modalities and a Generative Adversarial Network to align these latent representations. Minimising the topological error between the original and latent representations of a data set is central to this approach which enables not just the superposition but also alignment of different modalities. Two recently published methods, UnionCom and MMD-MA, have been used for comparison and benchmarking. The approach, termed TopoGAN, has been demonstrated to give consistently stable alignments, give better quantitative performance in realistic unsupervised settings, and scale much better in terms of memory requirements as compared to these state-of-the-art methods.","Bioinformatics; Topology; Generative Adversarial Networks; Autoencoder; Alignment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Data Science and Technology","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This thesis describes the design and development of an accurate and low cost 4D foot scanner in the context of podiatry. The intention is to make a first step towards the development of an affordable 4D foot scanner with commercial grade performance at a low cost, using commodity hardware. By doing so, 4D scanning can hopefully become more accessible to the general public, and accelerate the development and adoption of ultra personalized footwear and digital manufacturing in healthcare. Podiatrists focus on the treatment of physical conditions in the lower regions of the human body, which are often related to foot conditions. Personalized footwear solutions (e.g. orthotics) are widely used to relieve a patient of such conditions, which are primarily designed based on static 3D scanning data of the foot. With additional input of motion analyses and professional experience, a podiatrist can adjust the design of an orthotic to fit the patient. However, the change in foot measurements during different phases of the gait cycle are not accounted for in the design of these personalized solutions, which could vary up to 8 mm. With 4D foot scanning (dynamic 3D scanning), podiatrists will be able to observe and acquire data of the dynamic morphology of a foot during the gait cycle. This should allow the design and development of truly personalized orthotics that are able to support a patient during the entire gait cycle. To support this vision, a proof of concept of a 4D foot scanner has been developed. The presented proof of concept iterates over a previously built 4D foot scanner (Vidmar, 2020). The proof of concept includes: an optimized embodiment for improved scanning quality and scanning consistency, a trigger system to improve the human-computer interaction of the scanner, and a scalable camera configuration for up to 9 cameras. The hardware performance of the scanner in combination with the newly designed data acquisition pipeline has been evaluated in terms of acquisition consistency, speed, and memory usage. The outcome is that the scanner is able to manage dynamic data acquisition with a camera configuration of 9. Also, for a camera configuration of 7, the scanner shows a linear trend in memory consumption, acquired frames, and acquisition speeds, which suggests that performance of the scanner is predictable and constant for this configuration. More elaborate analyses should give better insights into the long time performance of the scanner for different camera configurations. The evaluation of the quality of both static and dynamic scanning data has been done with the implementation of nonrigid ICP. The accuracy of the scanner showed a minimal accuracy error of 2.274 mm. Compared with international 3D scanning standards (minimum accuracy error of 2 mm), the performance of the scanner is considered as a desirable outcome for this graduation project.","4d scanning; Podiatry; Product Design; foot; Depth reconstruction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The goal of the E-quarium is to optimize energy efficiency within the household in a fun and engaging way to benefit both the user, as well as the environment. To provide all household members with rich insight into energy consumption practices, the challenge was to decrease the cognitive load and required background knowledge associated with the interpretation of typical data-centric solutions, while still being able to provide multiple energy consumption parameters in a single display window. In this thesis the E-quarium concept, which was designed in 2013, was revisited to find if it still is relevant in today's (2021) context. The structure of the research was based on the idea that a truly successful HEMS interface needs to be able to inform the user, be able to hold the attention of the user and engage him to act on the information and feedback which he receives, as well as offer the user control over energy management. It was found that commercially available HEMS might have greatly improved in terms of UX when they are compared to older devices such as programmable thermostats, they fail to address the context of the user in important ways. The issues that E-quarium addresses namely, helping the user gain a better understand of his energy context and engaging him to increase his energy efficiency, remain relevant to this day.

The project focusses on the development and implementation of an ‘all-inclusive’ PET bottle recycling unit containing a large-scale 3D printer as made by 3D Robotprinting and the development of a preliminary set of guidelines for manufacturing products using the 3D printer. The aim is to enable the 3D printer to use PET flakes gained from bottles as feedstock. Therefore, the 3D printer was adapted and guidelines for manufacturing were developed. An iterative approach is followed, in which the exploration of the ‘novel’ source material and defining the design guidelines for manufacturing are at the heart of the project. After defining the context, the 3D printer was analysed and a literature study was performed, from which was concluded that the current polymer extrusion machine is likely too small to process the initial flake sample. With an initial sample of the material, experiments were performed in order to examine directions for a possible solution and to determine the most important properties, like flake material density, particle size distribution and funnel flow behaviour. By increasing the polymer extrusion screw channel depth at the feeding zone to 8 mm and compression ratio to 4:1 (resulting in a screw diameter of 30,4 mm), the 3D printer should be able to process PET flakes with a diameter up to 4 mm. To ensure the material does not contain particles larger than 4 mm in diameter, it should be shredded, granulated with a 3 mm mesh and sifted using a 4 mm sieve consecutively. Using literature of previous experiments, preliminary design guidelines for creating products with the 3D printer from 3D Robotprinting were set up. From a set of ideas gained from context analysis, a children’s slide was chosen to experiment on. Multiple prototyping rounds were done to perfect the slide’s printing performance and to refine the design guidelines. The project’s final results are: • Advised dimensions on the most important part of the system: the polymer extruder. • A list of preliminary design guidelines for optimizing a product for manufacturing on the 3D printer. • A children’s slide showing the application of the design guidelines.","Recycled PET; 3D Printing; flakes; Extrusion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

This is said so as there are multiple professionals from diverse backgrounds who come together to prepare a project's design. Consequently, communication between these professionals becomes a key component as it is the way they share project information apart from sharing their knowledge and thoughts at this stage. However, the relationship between communication and project success is not well defined, particularly the understanding of the barrier and drivers of communication in a design team seems obscure. Thus, this research builds on this theme and tries to understand project communication in detail. By examining the communication practices of a design team through the lens of literature, this study aims to describe how communication affects the project outcome and specify ways to improve it. To fulfill this objective, this research is divided into three parts. In part A, the literature is reviewed to gain insights and reflect on the attributes that describe the communication of a design team and explain the influence of these attributes on project success. In part B, a document review is done to analyze the documents produced by a design team that provide guidelines for the team's communication practices for project success. In part C, semi-structured interviews are conducted to obtain empirical data explaining the communication practices followed by the team while working on a project. Following this, the results obtained from the three parts are compared, which helps identify the gaps in literature and the guidelines contained in the documents on the communication practices to be used by the team.<br/>The results of this study suggest that communication is the central aspect that controls the functioning of the team. Communication practices impacts the team's collaboration, coordination, project performance, and quality of the work produced by the team. The impact of communication practices on these aspects of a project is categorized under two categories: drivers and barriers of communication. Based on these, recommendations for improving communication practices and mitigating barriers to project success are made and validated with experts. The study concludes with discussions on how adapting lean principles can bring many benefits to a team in the form of focus in meetings, minimizing transaction time of sharing information and developing a feedback culture. Also, these discussions describe that when working on a complex project, using a recommendation framed in this research; a team can mitigate various challenges associated with groupthink.","Communication; Design team; Collaboration; Feedback; project success; Group behaviour","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Anode baking process The anode baking process is one of the crucial steps in the production of anodes for the aluminium industry. It improves the strength, conductivity of the anode and reduces reactivity during electrolysis. Efficient baking involves uniform heat distribution on the surface of the Anode. Hotspots appear close to the burner due to high local temperature gradients. Hotspots lead to an increase in unwanted NOX emissions. NOX emissions can be reduced by having an efficient burner design to create a wide temperature distribution and subsequently avoid hotspots. The temperature distribution in the furnace is highly dependent on the flow distribution, combustion and the heat transfer. Accordingly, a model needs to be developed that can model the above-mentioned phenomena and predict the NOX emissions.<br/>State of the art review shows that there are many mathematical models available for the functioning and operation of ABF. But only a few of the models are tailored to estimate the emissions. Furthermore, these simulations are performed on the geometries with the simplest burner design, even though it is known that the burner configurations, significantly affect the emissions. Therefore, in the current study, a more sophisticated burner design is considered. Due to the complex nature of the burner design aspects of mesh generation are studied in detail and recommendations are made to improve the quality of the mesh.","Burner design; mesh optimisation; COMSOL Multiphysics","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Chemical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Chappin, E.J.L. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","By the year 2050, the Dutch government aims to have transitioned away from natural gas and provide heating to all residential dwellings using more sustainable technologies. Heat pumps (both all-electric and hybrid models) are expected to play a large role in fulfilling this heating demand. However, because heat pumps require electricity in order to provide heating, a rise in the number of installed heat pumps is expected to have a significant effect on the residential electricity demand. This poses an issue during times of peak demand and low renewable power availability, leaving no choice but to increase reserves and ramping needs from fossil-fueled conventional power assets. Luckily, when provided with the right control strategy, heat pumps are able to flexibly draw electricity from the power grid, lowering the electricity required during peak hours. As a result, it is both possible that an increase of installed heat pumps in the Netherlands can either aggravate the flexibility problem or provide a key role in solving it. <br/><br/>The extent to which heat pumps could contribute to providing this demand response is not only dependent on the technical demand-response characteristics of the heat pumps. Rather, it is determined by both the willingness of households to adopt the heat pump and the way users react to the proposed control strategy. Using econometric techniques, the master thesis research project quantifies these behavioral dimensions into a model estimating the electrical flexibility heat pumps will be able to either require or provide in the Netherlands in 2050. In the research, several consumer typologies are defined distinguishing between consumer user groups and consumer adoption groups. The research finds that an additional 1.6 GW of flexibility can be provided by heat pumps in 2050 should policy be developed that targets consumer adoption behavior. Consumer user behavior has less of an influence on the average demand response potential of heat pumps, however could be an area of focus should a frequent demand response be desired.","Heat pump; Demand response; Adoption Behavior; User Behavior","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","Energy Transition Lab",""

The best of these are shown to also work well on the real Talos robot. The learned Pareto front is then used in a Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm both as a search space and as a source of prior information in the initial mean estimate. This learning approach, which combines the two optimization methods, is capable of finding a suitable parameter set for a new trajectory within 20 trials and outperforms both BO in the continuous parameter search space and random search along the Pareto front.

These systems are heavily reliant and driven by data and algorithms to achieve optimal user experiences for myriad users. However, these data-driven products/services are multi-dimensional and multifaceted and do not necessarily have the same meaning and value to all its users. Different users may have different intentions of use for the system. Each user could also define different goals that they may want to achieve using the system. Additionally, what goals the organization has for the users might not align with what the end users what for themselves. These differences in intentions are called as multi-intentionality. In such scenarios, traditional design enforces the idea of simplifying interfaces that frame or dictate certain intentions of use for people. But this can be considered a sensitive issue because the end-users are unaware of these other potentially conflicting intentions. This creates an increase in tension between intelligent systems and the needs of end-users but also a sense of mistrust. Hence, there is a need to create a sense of legibility to the users on the behavior of these systems and the other intentions of use in order to enable trust. In this project, a way to help users sustainably consume energy is explored through the lens of multi-intentionality. The main aim of the research is to explore the meaning of intentions and multi-intentionality in the given context. Following this, the goal becomes to concretely represent the multi-intentionality into something more tangible for the users and applicable to the real-world context. The initial research resulted in identifying intention profiles for users, the intentionality gap, and the need to capture intentions that is required in order to bring more legibility and transparency to a system that the user might interact with. Through multiple iterations, a digital interface is created that through various communication data, data visualizations and recommendation designs tries to bridge the gap of intentionality between the two stakeholders (user and energy provider). By capturing intentions, portraying the tradeoffs of user choices, showcasing their energy use, presenting their energy profile with respect to their goals, designing transparent recommendations an effective proposal to bridge the gap between intentions is made. The designs were made with concrete thinking on how it could be applied to a real world problem and were validated through tests with users.","Energy system; Artificial intelligence; Digital design; multi-intentionality; Personalisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Limited research is done in the field of Internal Corporate Accelerator (ICA) where ideas from their own employees can enter the accelerator program. Additionally, accelerators are mostly implemented in highly competitive environments. However, accelerator programs are used more and more in less competitive environments like government-owned liability companies because external pressure requires them to change their ways of working more rapidly. This research addresses this gap by studying an accelerator program of the government-owned liability company TenneT TSO that operates in the energy utility sector. TenneT wants to innovate its core business and ways of working with the TenneT POWERLab, which is an ICA where employees can enter the acceleration program. The main goal of the program is to create an ecosystem that enables cultural and creative change within the organization. Hence, the tool ICA in this context is not used to get a competitive advantage by innovation as for most applications that are described in the literature. The research objective is to develop pre-seed selection criteria for Internal Corporate Accelerators (ICAs) of government-owned liability companies. A conceptual framework with pre-seed selection criteria is made from the accelerator literature and startup literature. Additionally, the research introduced three new pre-seed selection criteria that should be included in the research in the context of ICAs of government-owned liability companies, like the POWERLab. These are “Strategic Fit”, “Investment Cost”, and “Validation efforts”. This resulted in a list of 20 pre-seed selection criteria. Accordingly, the pre-seed selection criteria are studied on their relevance and compared to the literature. Findings are that 9 out of the 20 pre-seed selection criteria are not deemed relevant for TenneT TSO. Examples of not relevant criteria are “Sustainable Advantage”, “Timing of Entry” and “Lead Time”. This can be explained by the non-competitive nature of government-owned liability companies who follow market needs instead of being a frontrunner of innovation. Highly relevant criteria are “Incoming Team’s Willingness to Listen &amp; Adapt”, “Idea Solves a Real Problem” and “Investment Cost”. These pre-seed selection criteria indicate the importance of the team and the quality of the idea to solve real problems in the organization, leading to the innovation of the core business. Implications of this research are that ECAs in competitive environments have similarities with ICAs in government-owned liability companies. Both ECAs and ICAs have an accelerator with stage-gates and focus on mentorship. Minor differences are in the duration and intensity of the programs. The pre-seed selection criteria can be used as a starting point for other government-owned liability companies in the energy sector that want to proceed with an ICA that boosts employee development and organizational efficiency to cope with new challenges like renewables. However, future research should determine if ICAs are a good tool for government-owned liability companies to innovate their core business.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

The incubation times, defined as the period of time until damage is observed in the material, were measured in number of impacts and in global testing time (time that the test was kept running) until damage. The two effects that are aimed to investigate, the droplet impact frequency and the dry intervals, represent different relaxation times that the coating may undergo under real-life rainfall conditions: time intervals between individual raindrops (between raindrops) and between rain events (between rainfalls). Higher relaxation times are expected to have a beneficial effect on the rain erosion performance, as the viscoelastic coating would have time to recover itself to the original stress and strain state. The effects of test conditions that may influence the PJET, such as the water cushion effect, temperature and humidity were considered and evaluated. It was found that droplet impact frequency has an effect on the number of impacts until incubation: the lower the impact frequency, the lower the number of impacts until incubation. This effect has been linked to the longer and more energetic droplets produced by the PJET for these low frequencies and is not related to the viscoelastic behaviour of the coating. The existence of dry intervals when testing significantly increased the incubation times of PU coatings. This increase was larger when the dry intervals had a longer duration and when they were performed earlier during the tests. The effects of dry intervals in incubation times have been linked to the viscoelastic behaviour of the polyurethane coating. These results are expected to shed light on the effects of testing variables (impact frequency and dry intervals) that have historically been ignored in rain erosion tests and will help the design of new test parameters for erosion testing. The conclusions of the work will help to understand the importance of relaxation times and viscoelasticity in the incubation time of PU coatings and reveal that these effects will help to refine models that aim to predict the lifetime of polyurethane coatings in wind blade turbines based on real-life rainfall data. While investigating the influence of impact frequency, effects that may affect the PJET results were investigated. The effect of the water cushion was evaluated. This phenomenon consists of a water film that remains on the coating and that affects the posterior droplet impact. Water cushion effects were found to slightly increase incubation times for the highest impact frequencies. Their effects were counteracted with an air supplier aimed at the tested sample which removed the water cushion. Humidity and temperature were found to have an effect on the incubation times: in general, the higher the temperature and the relative humidity, the shorter the incubation times. The incubation times of saturated samples which went through humidity treatments were tested: their incubation times were lower than for those samples which did not undergo that treatment. DMA analysis was performed on PU samples, but the change in mechanical properties of the coating could not be directly linked to the drop in incubation times. It is suspected that plasticization is affecting the mechanical properties of the coating. The change in the environmental conditions may also be affecting the adhesion between the coating and substrate, resulting in lower incubation times.","leading edge erosion; wind turbine; polyurethane; Viscoelasticity; enviromental issues; impact frequency; dry interval; rain; erosion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","51.9899, 4.3753"

By conducting in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements combined with line-broadening analysis of the diffraction profiles, it was observed that the α (H-poor phase) to β (H-rich phase) transition induces stress that could (partially) relax by dislocation generation. After several absorption-desorption cycles (at 0.05 atm p(H2)), however, this stress increase prevents a full transformation to the β phase. When applying a higher partial pressure p(H2) = 0.1 atm for both of the selected open and compact-structured Pd/Ti thin films, a full phase transformation was observed. The corresponding phase transition kinetics, stress states and microstructural behaviors of the open and compact-structured Pd/Ti samples were found to be different. The microstructural changes and the kinetics of phase transformation during H2 (de)sorption are explained in terms of stress development and its relaxation through dislocation/defect generation.","Pd/Ti thin film; Hydrogen (de)sorption; Stress relaxation; Line-broadening analysis; Dislocation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-16","","","","","",""

As this area of individual ambidexterity is still comparatively new, limited study has been undertaken on the internal factors that determine individual ambidexterity. Further the study addresses the degree to which personality traits may influence ambidexterity in individuals. I investigate the influence of three personality traits on individual ambidexterity. The personality traits understudy are: Openness, conscientiousness and extraversion. For the purpose of this thesis, a mixed method approach was adopted, with semi-structured interviews and a survey. Results from the semi-structured interviews indicated internal factors that explain the link between personality traits and individual ambidexterity. For the quantitative study, a survey was conducted with a sample of 116 employees, working in the coffee sector in the Netherlands. This research examined the mediating roles of self efficacy, team player, and affective commitment, on the relationship between personality traits and individual ambidexterity. Results of this thesis showed that openness to new experiences, conscientiousness and extraversion positively relate to individual ambidexterity, and as a result, revealed that internal factors can be used to determine individual ambidexterity. Next to these findings, self efficacy mediates the relationship between conscientiousness and individual ambidexterity, and team player mediates the relationship between extraversion and individual ambidexterity. Contrary to our expectations, affective commitment did not mediate the relationship between openness to experience and individual ambidexterity. The findings of this thesis provide recommendations for future study and add to our definition of the construct of individual ambidexterity, which is useful in both theoretical and practical aspects.","Individual ambidexterity; Personality traits; Affective commitment; Self efficacy; Team player; Exploration; Exploitation; mixed methods","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

The invariant manifolds emanating from these quasi-periodic tori are used to design NEA high-thrust, low-energy retrieval trajectories. A thorough characterization of the two-dimensional space in which the invariant tori can exist is conducted. Three promising NEAs are selected, from which only two of them (2006 RH120 and 2020 CD3) permit transfers at extremely low ΔVs. For 2006 RH120, transfers that require between 20 and 2 times less ΔV than the existing results from literature were found. We prove that quasi-periodic orbits allow for better transfers than just considering manifolds from periodic families or not using manifolds at all. The use of quasi-periodic tori also permits extended transfer windows and more flexibility in the mission design.","Quasi-periodic orbits; Invariant manifold theory; astrodynamics; Near-Earth Objects; near-Earth asteroids; Asteroid Capture; Low-energy transfers; Mission design; CR3BP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

However, traffic models fail to fully acknowledge this uncertainty. Therefore, decisions made based on these models are not very robust. In this research, Robust Decision Making (RDM) method is applied on a macro-level traffic model made for the municipality of Groningen. This method, consisting of 5 steps, can make the decision making process more robust. First RDM frames the system in which the decision is taken. Then, within the boundaries of the system, the model in run on a large set of possible futures. These futures are picked based on Latin hypercube sampling. Finally, with the results obtained, scenario discovery and global sensitivity tools can be applied. These tools help to find regions of interest within the sample space and to analyse how different variables influence each other. Thereby, based on robustness metrics the most robust policy can be chosen. With the application of RDM in traffic models good policies and interesting scenarios are found. However, due to the fact that traffic models are often over fitted, the run time of the model is quite long and the level of interaction quite low. This makes the application of RDM both difficult and hard to fully exploit. The discussion of this research hands some possible tools to manage the run time. Multi resolution modelling and the use of providers like Amazon web services are two of the most prominent options. Thereby, more in-depth deep uncertainty, like Multi Objective RDM (MORDM) methods are possible when the run time can be better managed.","Robust decision making; Macro-level traffic models; PTV Visum; EMA Workbench; Groningen","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Zirconia (ZrO2) has emerged as a promising technical ceramic, electrolyte for solid fuel cells, and as a topcoat for thermal barrier coatings at high temperatures, etc. in the past decades. The traditional synthesis of ZrO2 usually necessitates a sintering temperature as high as 1200°C. General interest in lowering the sintering temperature to reduce energy consumption and thermal stresses has led to many research works. In this thesis, a novel route of sintering ceramics at lower sinter temperatures named ‘Cold sintering’ was adopted to sinter Zirconia bulks. Sintering is performed with the Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) technique through in-situ chemical conversion of Zirconium hydroxide [Zr(OH)4] precursors into Zirconium oxide. The sintering process is accelerated by the water vapor emission from the conversion reaction. For the commercial applications of Zirconia, its density, hardness, and the stabilization of favourable tetragonal phases Is necessary. Many methods were adopted to increase the densification of the powders. The applied mechanical pressure is increased, and sintering aids are used to densify the sintered bulks. Mechanical properties like hardness and thermal conductivity values are measured. The dependence of relative densities, hardness, and thermal conductivity on the sinter conditions such as sintering dwell pressure (range: 50 MPa – 300 MPa) and sintering dwell temperature (range 400 °C – 1200 °C) is mapped out as guidance for further material property design. In addition to the improved sintered density, the phase stabilization of tetragonal ZrO2 phases is also enhanced at sintering dwell temperature of 900°C and dwell pressure of 50 MPa using the aliovalent phase stabilizing compounds Yttrium oxide (Y2O3) and Bismuth oxide (Bi2O3).","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Sypesteyn, M. (graduation committee); Klooster, M.A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This thesis has the goal to improve the commercial wayfinding at Schiphol. Commercial wayfinding entails tertiary wayfinding activities, which are not related to the travel process (shopping, eating/drinking, relaxing), whereas functional wayfinding gives information about passenger activities related to the airport process. Individuals can find satisfaction and enjoyment from the (commercial) wayfinding activity itself, which is referred to as recreational wayfinding (Fewings, 2001). This thesis explores how recreational wayfinding can enhance the passenger’s experience during their waiting time at the airport: Passengers at Schiphol seek pastime to fill their waiting time before their flight departs. They are looking for activities to do in the lounges, but mostly visit the known locations such as shops and restaurants (current territory). Many passengers just visit the shops only to have something to do and to counteract the boredom, without the intention to buy anything. However, Schiphol has many other (free) services to offer, which most of the passengers are not aware of (hidden gems). The existence of the commercial services (e.g. Rijksmuseum, Airport Library, Nemo, spa) surprises the passengers and they would like to be notified about their existence and location, so that they can visit them (territory to discover). Currently, the commercial services are not intuitively found, as passengers do not know that they exist. But even when actually searching for the services, the current wayfinding does not suffice and does not easily guide the passenger to the services. The digital wayfinding solutions are user unfriendly, as not all facilities are included, routeplanning is not possible and filtering options are limited. To solve this two-pronged problem, an integrated concept for wayfinding and awareness has been developed. A locative audio tour which leads the passengers along hidden gems in lounge 2 has been developed. Passengers experienced the audio tour as calming, explorative and eye opening. To raise awareness among passengers about this audio tour, a concept for awareness was created and tested.","wayfinding; airport; commercial; passenger; waiting time; Schiphol; audio tour; awareness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","","52.308948, 4.756907"

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In a future energy system, chemical energy carriers that can easily be stored, like hydrogen, are of vital importance. One possible way of producing carbonneutral hydrogen is by direct solar to hydrogen conversion in a photoelectrochemical cell (PEC). Silicon based multijunction solar cells are a possible candidate for the photovoltaic stack of these PEC devices. To make high efficiency PEC devices, the photovoltaic stack has to be optimised, especially with respect to reaching high current densities in the middle (ncSi) cell. In this work it was attempted to increase the current density of a triple junction device based on cSi/ncSi/aSi absorber layers by varying the ncSi absorber thicknesses and implementing various intermediate reflecting layers (IRLs) between the middle and bottom cell. These layers were based on silicon oxide, transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) and thin silver films. For each method it was attempted to give a quantitative comparison of how much the electrical performance is affected per unit of current gained in the middle cell. Both increasing the ncSi absorber thickness and the silicon oxide reflector thickness were found to be feasible methods of increasing the middle cell current density. The ncSi absorber thickness leads to an initial rapid current gain, of about 2.6mA/cm2 between 2.5 and 3.75 μm, reducing to just 0.8mA/cm2 between 3.75 and 5 μm. The electrical performance cost between 2.5 and 3.75 μm was calculated as a 2% reduction in 푉 oc*퐹퐹 product per mA/cm2 current gain. This cost increased to about 5% per mA/cm2 between 3.75 and 5 μm. Increasing the absorber thickness beyond 5 μm is not considered feasible due to reducing current gains and mounting electrical performance losses. Increasing the silicon oxide thickness can result in a current gain of about 1mA/cm2. This comes at an electrical loss of 3% 푉 oc*퐹퐹 product per mA/cm2. TCO based IRLs were found to quickly result in shunting, and in the case of indium doped tin oxide (ITO) based IRLs also damage to the surrounding cell structure resulting in poorly performing cells. Aluminium doped zinc oxide (AZO) based reflectors with proper electrical isolation from the edges gave only slightly reduced electrical performance, but failed to lead to a current gain in the middle cell. Thin silver films were found to quickly rearrange into nanoparticles, effectively forming a plasmonic IRL. This IRL however suffered from high parasitic absorption, and as a result also did not lead to a current gain. A very thin silver film was however shown to slightly improve the electrical performance, at the cost of bottom cell current density. Finally, a device was fabricated with both a thick ncSi absorber as well as a silicon oxide IRL. The resulting device achieved a current density of 9.5mA/cm2, a 푉 oc of 1.947V and a FF of 0.789, giving an efficiency of 14.6%. To the knowledge of the author this is the highest efficiency reported for this device configuration to date. Furthermore, attempts were made to incorporate these stacks into PEC, by fabricating an microstructured anode, cathode and ionconducting pores, to form a porous membrane PEC (PMP). The cathode and anode were successfully demonstrated, but the pore etching is yet to be optimised.","Silicon Herero-junction; multijunction solar cells; silicon oxide; Photoelectrochemical cell; nanocrystalline silicon; amorphous silicon; current density","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","DISCO",""

From the collected data the internal moments and axial forces could be approximated, from which the GRF magnitude, direction and point of application were determined. The sensor system was calibrated in a 1-DOF load-cell compression bench and was conducted to a field test in which a participant performed load shifting, walking and running trails on the instrumented Gyromotics RSP. The compression tests showed that the measurement system complied to design requirements and that it was possible to estimate the point of application of the GRF. The field test indicated that loads applied in different directions than applied in the compression bench could lead to measurement errors.

(graduation committee); van Beers, Cees (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","SMEs are in the midst of a digital economy driven by the rapid growth of technologies, pushing them to change or be excluded from the system. Compounded by the COVID-19 outbreak, SMEs are required to catch up with the transition quickly. Governments and policymakers have previously conceived numerous policies to support SMEs' digital transformation in most countries. Nevertheless, in Indonesia, these efforts are dominated by digital literacy development programs while paying little attention to the holistic entrepreneurial capacity. Whereas only as a part of a comprehensive approach digital literacy can be developed. As SMEs are part of a system, the holistic entrepreneurial capacity should encompass internal and external capacity, from SMEs' capacity as an entity, the availability of enabling environment, and the synergy. This research attempted to solve the research question: ""How to raise the SMEs' capacity in Indonesia to perform digital transformation?"". The proposition was studied by carrying a multiple embedded case study of Indonesian SMEs to determine the existing capacity, barriers and ultimately answer the research question. The case study includes 18 SMEs with different business scales assorted into three categories according to the entrepreneurial capacity and digital literacy level. Data collection in this case study combined semi-structured interviews and observations. Additionally, three inclusive case descriptions are presented to illustrate the profile of targeted companies in the Government's digital transformation agenda. Furthermore, cases were cross-analyzed to reveal their capacities based on the value and institutional context of each company, and also the relation to its digital transformation phase. Meanwhile, data about the current landscape and the interaction with SMEs are collected from a literature review and interviews with four experts from Kemenkop, Bank Indonesia, and eCommerce. The empirical results reveal that Indonesia's current landscape is shifting within traditional and more modern practices. Numerous policies, regulations, development programs, and financial supports exist to boost SMEs' digital transformation. However, there are manifold barriers at this level. There is a solid patrimonial system and bureaucracy in a decentralized Government system, compounded by a sectoral ego that creates disintegration and hampers coordination. In addition, the lack of arrangement and regulations enforcement due to the Government's limited capacity generates suboptimal outputs. Next, lack of capacity is the central barrier to digital transformation at the SME level. However, the empirical evidence showed that this issue is beyond the lack of knowledge and skills in technology utilization. Hence, capacity building should not only concentrate on improving digital literacy but also the overall SMEs’ capacity. Another noteworthy finding is that some SMEs with high capacity prefer to stay out of the systems and refuse to take digital transformation due to weak regulations enforcement from authorities and lack of incentives. On the other hand, SMEs utilizing digital technology both in transition business model and digital business model obtain several benefits from their participation. First, they enjoy the broader market and network up to national also international markets. Such a network will also lead to cost savings and access to funding. Next, they can have better engagement with customers that contribute to their innovation capacity. Then, combining the broader market, network, and customer interaction enables SMEs to create demand-based innovation, leading to the better product value. Participating in the digital platform and the motivation for business escalation also affect the SMEs' compliance level. As they try to develop the business and increase the product value, they will register their business and strive to obtain relevant certifications. Ultimately, with intensive assistance and consecutive improvements, the company's overall performance would be enhanced, and in turn, this will promote business sustainability. This study confirms that SMEs' digital transformation requires comprehensive knowledge and skills, a supporting mindset, and enabling environment. Therefore, we propose a comprehensive SMEs development program for the Indonesian Government, namely SCALE-UP: SMEs Capacity Development and Upgrading Program. This program is a top-down approach for the Government and relevant authorities that focus on providing appropriate capacity building for SMEs according to their needs reflected on capacity assessment output. So, the capacity development between SMEs might vary. The traditional enterprises with a lack of capacity in most aspects will get different development plans than the SMEs with higher entrepreneurial capacity but lack digital literacy, as they need a more entrepreneurial mindset and attitude. This capacity development should be followed by intensive assistance and collaboration with civil society. Eventually, regular evaluation and more vigorous enforcement are essential to monitor progress and anticipate obstacles. Nevertheless, this development program requires more transparency, cooperation, and compliance within Government institutions. To deal with the sectoral ego, a dedicated working group for SMEs development consisting of the Government and relevant authorities is required.

(graduation committee); Qin, Z. (mentor); Bauer, P. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The global energy transition that is shifting the industry to renewable energy sources is at the center of many countries' strategic plans as demonstrated by the increasing number of offshore wind farms connected to the grid. However, modern-day wind turbine with full-scale back-to-back converter is considered as a main source of harmonics, which can be amplified through the network due to low frequency resonance points created by the combination of long capacitive HVAC submarine cables and the many inductive transformers. The amplification of harmonics could lead to a grid non-compliance, and hence the developers of Offshore Wind Power Plants (OWPPs) might be obligated to install inflexible and expensive filters. Prior to the construction of a wind farm and during the design stage, it is necessary to perform harmonic studies to estimate the harmonic emission from the wind farm and to predict whether there would be a harmonic non-compliance problem and the necessity or not to plan for remedial measures. The industry currently utilizes the IEC second summation rule to estimate harmonic distortion at the PCC of OWPPs. However, there is many proof in the literature that conclude the ineffectiveness of the summation rule as it leads to inaccurate estimation of harmonics compared to actual measurements. Therefore, there is a rising necessity to develop new accurate methods to estimate the harmonic distortion at the PCC of OWPPs. It has been shown in the literature that harmonics injected by wind turbine converters are statistically random, and both of their magnitudes and phase angles can be represented by probability distribution functions. In contrast, the IEC summation rule utilizes a deterministic 95th percentile magnitude and indirectly compensates for the phase angle by an exponent. These two assumptions could be the main sources of its inaccuracy. Therefore, the objective of this thesis is to develop a new method to estimate harmonic distortion at the PCC of an OWPP using probability theory considering the probability distribution functions of harmonics. First, a literature review is performed to acquire probability distribution functions of different harmonics based on actual measurements of a full-scale back-to-back converter, and on the modelling of the converter and other elements of the wind farm for harmonic studies. Then, an offshore wind power plant is modelled in DIgSilent PowerFactory software to perform both phase-correct (proposed method) and IEC harmonic load flows. The harmonic load flow for the proposed method is automated using Monte Carlo programmed in Python codes to calculate the harmonic distortions at the PCC, from which histograms can be computed to represent the statistical nature of the results. As the 95th percentile of the harmonic distortion at the PCC is the value used in harmonic studies to prove compliance, it is computed and used for comparison to the IEC summation rule results for four case studies. In case A, the IEC second summation rule underestimates low order harmonics such as the 5th and 7th harmonics and overestimates the 8th harmonic compared to the Monte Carlo method. It is demonstrated that the probability distribution functions of the magnitude and phase angle of the harmonics significantly impact the distribution of the harmonic distortion at the PCC. It is shown in the thesis that the probabilistic phase-correct (Monte Carlo) method provides closer results to the expected results, as seen from measurements, than IEC does, hence with the Monte Carlo method the uncertainty in grid-compliance studies is lower. In case B, it is studied whether the variation of the grid impedance could lead to grid code violation that could not have been predicted using a fixed grid impedance. The variation of the grid impedance reveals a big difference between the lowest and highest harmonic distortion that could be as high as 5 times, while the error between the probabilistic and IEC summation rule methods could be as twice high. This case concludes that the variation of the grid impedance is an important factor that should not be neglected in harmonic studies. In case C, the nonlinear behavior of the converter is included in the model and the impact of the frequency coupling phenomenon on the harmonic distortion at the PCC is studied. The phenomenon results in low errors when compared to the probabilistic method, however the error is quite high when compared to IEC summation rule. In case D, the frequency coupling phenomenon is analyzed while varying the grid impedance, which results in higher errors when compared to IEC summation rule. The results of the last two cases support the argument to include the frequency coupling phenomenon in harmonic studies. Therefore, it is concluded that the accuracy of harmonic studies could be improved by including the statistical nature of the wind turbine harmonics, the variation of the grid impedance and the frequency coupling phenomenon of the wind turbine converters.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Autonomous robots are increasingly used in more and more applications, such as warehouse robots, search-and-rescue robots and autonomous vacuum cleaners. These applications are often in environments where the GPS signals are denied or inaccurate, which makes it difficult to localize the robot in an unknown environment. To overcome this problem the framework of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is typically used. This solution constructs a map of the environment with the use of cameras or range sensors, while keeping track of the location of the robot in it. To extend the exploration time of these battery powered robots, the energy consumption of the SLAM algorithm could be reduced. It is assumed that if the computational load of an algorithm reduces, the energy consumption of the algorithm reduces as well. An existing paradigm to solve SLAM is the use of a particle filter, which tracks the trajectory of the robot and simultaneously maps the environment. The question answered in this thesis is how to make this algorithm more energy-efficient to be able to deploy this framework in more applications and make the existing robots more sustainable. In this thesis two methods are investigated. In the first method, the information about the landmarks is incorporated in the trajectory estimation as spatial constraints, to try to achieve a higher accuracy with less particles and thus subsequently a smaller computational load. The proposed method is validated by simulations on synthetic datasets. This method shows improvements in terms of the estimation accuracy. However, it is more computational complex than the existing algorithms, so it is considered less energy-efficient. The second method researched in this thesis, is the implementation of a parallelized particle filter. This method processes the observation measurements in parallel for the different particles and communicates the information between the particles efficiently. It should reduce the computational time, to enable partial computation of the algorithm to reduce the computational load. This method is validated on the same datasets as the first method using simulations. This method shows improvements on the run time and thus on the computational load, especially for a larger number of particles and is therefore more energy-efficient. The two separate methods have been analyzed and compared with state-of-the-art methods. Both methods deliver equally good or better results in terms of accuracy. However, the computation time of constrained FastSLAM does not outweigh the improvement in accuracy. On the other hand, the parallelized particle filter shows significant improvement over the existing solutions.","SLAM; FastSLAM; Energy Efficiency","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

Trust is a key concept affecting the adoption of crowdshipping yet to be explicitly investigated . Thereby, this research aims to explore the effect of trust and examine how users' adoption can be achieved. To analyse the stated gap, a stated choice experiment is conducted to test the effect of travel time, travel cost, track and trace, insurance, damage and reputation. A Mediation Choice Model is applied to explore how the relevant attributes would impact trust towards the service adoption. Based on the findings, the direct effects of all the selected attributes were found significant, except for tracking and tracing. Regarding the indirect effects, all the main attributes were statistically significant, meaning that trust has a mediating effect on the adoption of the service. Additionally, the heterogeneity in preferences is explored through a Latent Class Choice Model resulting in a two-class latent model, crowdshipping sceptics and crowdshipping enthusiasts, the latter being more likely to be composed of younger women. Although enthusiasts consider more features while opting for crowdshipping, the delivery company's reputation and delivery cost were the most important factors in crowdshipping service adoption.","Crowdshipping delivery; Trust; Stated preference experiment; Mediation choice model; Latent class choice model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

Interview findings showed that decision-making processes are evolving to incorporate climate adaptation efforts where possible. Implementation of climate adaptation measures was identified to occur when there was an opportunity to incorporate them into other necessary infrastructure projects, such as large-scale neighbourhood redevelopments, however taking advantage of these opportunities depended not only on their existence, but also on current institutional factors. Frequently identified hindering and enabling factors included the availability of financial resources, the current regulatory framework, fragmented roles and responsibilities within municipalities and the availability of sufficient and appropriately skilled personnel. Factors such as cultural/cognitive resistance and political incentive to action were also identified as hindering and enabling climate adaptation efforts. Interview findings also showed that in addition to the institutional factors, the actors involved in the decision-making process and the resources available to these actors played an important role in the decision-making processes. Four key actors were identified from the data: technical designers/ decision-makers, the local community, the municipal council and housing developers. The support or resistance of these actors strongly impacted the duration of the decision-making process and success implementing climate adaptive measures. Though the decision-making processes are evolving, the use of opportunity-based initiation tactics and ineffective bargaining tactics resulted in processes were often stalled or blocked prior to decision implementation. Improvements can be made to the decision-making tactics used by practitioners, however, the processes by themselves were not found to act as distinct hinderances. The institutional context within which these decisions are made has significant influence on the outcomes of the process and the institutional factors identified indicate that the current context is more hindering than enabling. Strategies to address some of these hindering factors can therefore also facilitate the decision-making processes and lead to an increase in implementation of climate adaptation in urban drainage systems.","Decision-making processes; Climate Adaptation; Urban Drainage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

Despite the promising results achieved by DeepJIT and CC2Vec, two deep learning-based JIT defect prediction models, industry-based JIT defect prediction studies have not opted yet to apply deep models. In this work, the goal is to build and evaluate several JIT defect prediction models that can help Adyen developers spot defective changes during code review. To construct a new dataset with a large enough set of labels, we identify four sources of potential bug-fixing commits by analysing Adyen's way of working. We make several practical adaptations to DeepJIT and CC2Vec and compare their performances with three traditional metric-based models when making predictions at both commit-level and file-level. Our results indicate that deep models are able to outperform the metric-based models across all three datasets. All models performed slightly worse when evaluated on Adyen data compared to an open-source setting, but both deep models still achieved respectable performances and significantly outperformed the metric-based models. When evaluated in a real-world setting on bugs manually collected by Adyen developers, DeepJIT performed consistent with earlier findings when evaluated on commit-level, but performances fall on file-level. Lastly, we find that although inclusion of each bug source generally does not lead to worse performance, whether it leads to better performance is dependent on both what type of model is used and at what granularity predictions are made.","deep learning; just-in-time; defect prediction; machine learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Software Technology","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","With the rise of various renewable energy sources, comes the possibility for combining the different type of sources together to balance their shortcomings. The goal is to find a renewable energy system that can be reliable year-round and be accessible for everyone. This research tries to model such a system. A model of a grid-tied PV-battery-electrolyser-fuel cell power system, which is based on a continuation of a series of master thesis projects, was expanded to include a neighbourhood with a fully electrical load or a combination of electrical and hydrogen loads. This model was developed to answer the following question. What is the techno-economic feasibility of a grid-tied PV-battery-electrolyser-fuel cell power system for a household area in the Netherlands which is either fully electrical or hydrogen integrated? This hybrid system is simulated by using the graphical interface program TRNSYS. The system size of the PV, batteries, electrolyser, fuel cell and hydrogen gas storage tank are optimised by the GenOpt, an add-on for TRNSYS. The optimisation algorithm will try to find the lowest levelised cost of energy(LCOE) while keeping the system self-sufficiency ratio(SSR) around 1 [%]. This will mean that only 1 [%] of the load is allowed to be extracted from the grid. The simulation is based on a neighbourhood that consists of 630 houses located in Pijnacker Netherlands. All houses will be equipped with a roof mounted solar PV system with centralised batteries, electrolyser, fuel cell and a hydrogen storage tank. If needed the model can be extended to include a small solar park next to the neighbourhood. The model will simulate two scenarios for a simulation time of one year, the first being that the neighbourhood is fully electrical and the second for a neighbourhood with integrated hydrogen gas in its consumption. The first one is the base, with only the electrical load demand of houses. Then the load profile will be extended by adding vehicle to the neighbourhood, including the heat demand of the house. These additional load profiles will either be electrical energy based for the fully electrical scenario or hydrogen gas based for the integrated hydrogen scenario. To estimate the economic development of this hybrid system, a price projection of PV, battery, electrolyser, fuel cell, hydrogen heating, heat pumps and inverters components were determined for the years 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050. a, the cases will all be simulated for these years. The economic analysis will be over the systems lifetime, which is 25 years. Before the cases were simulated the model undertook a sensitivity analysis. From this resulted that the simulation start time can be moved from the 1st of January to the 2nd of March to relief the storage tank of getting depleted at the start of the simulation. A battery discharge constraint was lifted and this led the batteries to provide more energy. A forecasting method was applied to the system that effectively reduced the electrolyser on/off cycles by 60 [%], which increased the lifetime of the electrolyser component. From a technical feasibility analysis of the cases, it resulted that the integrated hydrogen scenario was not technical feasible with the PV system (roof mounted with the PV park) of this model. All the integrated hydrogen scenario cases resulted in a depleted hydrogen storage tank, which forced the system to buy the hydrogen demand externally. The system will rely on an external source more than the allowed 1 [%] (hydrogen gas SSR >> 1 [%]) of the load demand. From the fully electrical scenario the 2020 C-E-(V+H) case resulted not be technical feasible with a SSR value of 2.1 [%]. All the other cases were technical feasible. From an economic and cost perspective, the cases resulted that the LCOE reduced with the years. The lowest LCOE value found was for the C-E-(Base) case, which reduced from 0.44 [€/KWh] in 2020 to 0.21[€/KWh] in 2050. The cost breakdown of the cases resulted in the PV system and the storage tank to be the most expensive components of this system. Due to the fact that the C-H2-(H) case had to buy a significant amount of hydrogen from an external source, this became a significant expensive cost of the system. Comparing the two scenarios resulted that the integrated hydrogen scenario system sizes were smaller, but this is an effect of the system being more eager to buy hydrogen gas then to expand the hydrogen production components. As both scenarios had different SSR values of their respected energy demands, a conclusion of which scenario is more beneficial will be inadequate.","PV System; Hydrogen storage; Hybrid System; Solar; batteries; Residential; Electrolyer; Fuel Cell","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","","52.017700, 4.440500"

In order to meet the Paris Agreement, the current role-out rate of wind energy in the North Sea, that is 2 GW/year, needs to be increased to an average value of 7 GW/year over the period 2023-2040. This rapid increase of the share of uncontrollable, renewable sources in the energy mix raises a certain number of challenges, among which sustaining energy balance and transient stability. To organise the large-scale deployment of offshore wind in a strategic manner, the concept of hub-and-spoke has been introduced. It envisages modular offshore renewable power generation clusters (a.k.a. offshore hubs) designed to be easily and safely operated and interconnected. <br/><br/>Dealing with large power fluctuations constitutes a major challenge for each offshore hub. The variability of power supply needs to be mitigated through the integration of storage solutions. Offshore power-to-gas conversion for storage purposes has been widely investigated in the literature, under techno-economic or power balance points of view. However, detailed analysis of the effective connection of large scale electrolysers in offshore hubs are missing. <br/><br/>This thesis proposes a real-time simulation model of a 2 GW offshore hub integrating electrolysers in order to investigate their impact on the dynamic active power management of the hub. Two locations for the connection of the large-size electrolysers are studied: i) connection of an electrolyser to the AC common bus of the hub and ii) connection of electrolysers to the DC link of the back-to-back converter of each Type-4 wind turbine of the hub. An Electromagnetic Transient (EMT) simulation based analysis, necessary to capture the fast dynamics of the zero-inertia hub, is performed under different severe disturbances, such as a three phase fault and sudden large wind speed fluctuations.<br/><br/>In a second part, the thesis investigates the connection of the hub to the shore via a bipolar High-Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) link. It has been shown in the literature that bipolar links are more reliable than monopolar ones, as they can still be operated to transfer half of their nominal capacity in case of failure of one cable or converter. The work of this thesis is focused on developing and implementing a power sharing strategy between the two Modular Multi-level Converters (MMCs) constituting the offshore terminal of the link. <br/><br/>It was found in this thesis that both investigated locations for the connection of the electrolysers can be beneficial in different ways. Connected at the AC common bus, the electrolyser can provide centralized ancillary services, while an electrolyser connected locally at the wind turbine can consume the power generated during an islanding event. Regarding the power sharing in the HVDC link, two different strategies were developed, both enabling to unload one of the poles of the link. Further studies should be carried out to provide in-depth understanding of the potentialities of the two methods.<br","Large scale offshore network; Energy storage; Electrolyser; Power-to-gas; EMT Model; HVDC; MMC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-25","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Conventional time-series models present limitations when dealing with non-linear changes in water demand. Thus, it is proposed to employ deep learning algorithms to offer a more reliable forecast. Three models are used, two 1-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNN), (a simple CNN, and a dilated causal CNN), and a recurrent neural network, particularly a long short-term memory (LSTM) based model. The performance of the models is tested on seven real-life water distribution systems in Italy with different uses and number of users. Also, a comparison with benchmark algorithms based on time-window techniques and pattern-based models is made. Additionally, the use of meteorological variables such as rainfall occurrence, temperature, and relative humidity is intended to test whether there is a positive effect on the forecast. Furthermore, a global model is built taking several years of data for training to test whether this bigger model increases generalization and improves accuracy in comparison to the individual cases. In addition, transfer learning is employed to predict individual cases and a WDS in the Netherlands. Lastly, a bigger global model is built and trained with 14 years of data to improve the performance of transfer learning on the Dutch WDS. To begin with, it was seen that 1D-CNNs outperformed the LSTM-based model, and the benchmark algorithms using data of the water demand, and a binary index indicating whether it is a weekday or a weekend day for six of the seven case studies. For the remaining case study, the results indicated that there is less than 1% in error between the best benchmark model and the proposed 1D-CNN algorithms. Moreover, the addition of meteorological variables showed to improve the calibration performance of the models but worsened the predictions on unseen data. It was observed that a simple 1D-CNN overfits when adding these extra variables due to its lack of regularization. Also, the global model showed to improve in accuracy compared to the individual models. The use of transfer learning (TL) did not indicate to improve the performance of one of the case studies, nonetheless, TL showed that by only using 75% of the data for training, the model offers a good generalization on the case with sudden changes in demands by the rapid increase of users due to seasonal touristic activities. For the Dutch WDS, TL performed similarly to the individual model, there errors ranged between 15% and 16% using different quantities of data for training. In addition, when having no data for training, the pre-trained model displayed showed lower than using 25% of data for training for the Italian cases. Lastly, the bigger global model performed in the same way as the smaller global model on the Dutch WDS. Also, when having no data for training, the model performed better.","Water; Demand; Forecasting; Deep learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

Quantitative models play an instrumental role to this end. As a direct consequence of their probabilistic nature, portfolio losses are usually simulated using Monte Carlo copula models, which in turn play a decisive role in their measurement of risk metrics such as the Value-at-Risk (VaR). Semi-analytical numerical methods are alternatives to the Monte Carlo simulations to compute the distribution of the portfolio credit losses, the VaR and the VaR sensitivities. We find that numerical approaches such as the COS method, based on a Fourier cosine series expansion are superior to the Monte Carlo based computations in terms of both, the computational speed and the accuracy. Several studies have demonstrated these results, using the examples of various copula models in a single threaded environment. In this study, we extend that scope and critically examine modelling approaches for improving the computing efficiency by investigating and validating, a multi-threaded GPU based algorithm for the COS method. In this process, we demonstrate the suitability of COS algorithm for parallelization on the GPU and highlight the performance improvements over existing methods.<br","Portfolio Credit Risk; COS method; GPU computing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Considering these inherent advantages, DAS-collected strain rate measurements can be beneficial as addition to traditional particle motion sensors, or potentially replace them under certain circumstances. A DAS system, consisting of an interrogator and attached optical fiber, is conventionally employed in a single (inline) direction providing 1D longitudinal strain rate measurements along the installed fiber. In this thesis, we explore unconventional fiber configurations to retrieve additional wavefield components. To investigate the potential of these unconventional fiber geometries, we perform numerical tests, discuss real data from a field campaign in Yverdon (Switzerland) and report on our analysis of synthetic and field data. Both synthetic and field results show that a loop- and cross fiber lay-out provide thepseudo-divergence, defined as the sum of the local spatial velocity gradients (∂xvx+∂yvy), which is proportional to the full wavefield divergence at the free surface. We confirm that the fiber loop &amp; cross shape predominantly capture Rayleigh surface waves, but are insensitive to Love wave energy. An important factor regarding the loop &amp; cross behaviour is the configuration size with respect to the wavelength (λ). Reduced amplitudes are recognizable for loop &amp; cross dimensions spanning more than 1/5λ, followed by additional phase distortions from 1/3λ and completely altered waveforms for even larger loop &amp; cross sizes.We show that a spherical configuration (composed of 3 independent orthogonal fiberloops) is theoretically attractive by enabling the retrieval of both the full divergence and the individual spatial gradients in the three orthogonal directions. The free surface-relation between the pseudo- and full divergence can be exploited to approximate the local ratio of the shear and pressure wave velocity (VS/VP ), which is demonstrated with synthetic data by means of spectral element modeling. However, the field results are less convincing due to, supposedly, poor cable-ground coupling as a result of required dense cable winding.Finally, we introduce a local approach to estimate the effective shear velocity (VS) without the need for larger arrays. We achieve this by combining local gradients and particle acceleration data, obtained from the fiber loop and one centred 3C-geophone respectively. Our novel approach is validated with synthetic data and we present promising field data results. The proposed 4C-configuration mitigates traditional finite-difference errors related to tilted or inaccurately spaced ground motion sensors. Furthermore, our novel arrangement offers the advantage of azimuthal independence, which can be of interest for VS-estimations from earthquake-, traffic- or potentially ambient noise recordings. The local character of the effective VS-computation is dependent on the incident P-wavelength and is therefore potentially exploitable with regard to 1D shear velocity subsurface models.The presented synthetic and field results in this thesis show the potential of employing unconventional fiber configurations with regard to multi-component gradient sensing. This work further contributes to the development of attractive DAS applications at various scales, especially related to wavefield separation (ground-roll suppression), shallow static corrections and near-surface characterization.","Distributed Acoustic Sensing; Wavefield gradients; Fiber configurations; Divergence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Geophysics | IDEA League","",""

(mentor); Kleinsmann, M.S. (graduation committee); Paap, Ino (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Inter IKEA Systems B.V. (also known as Core Business Franchise or CBF) is the franchisor and the owner of the IKEA Concept. By means of this franchising system, IKEA’s vision of creating a better everyday life for the many people is upheld through the collaboration, feedback, sharing and joint development between the franchisor (CBF) and the IKEA franchisees. IKEA Culture &amp; Learning is responsible for strengthening the IKEA culture and empowering IKEA co-workers through their own abilities. However, the current tools provided to enhance co-workers’ competences, gather their feedback and discover potential business improvements lack in cohesion, ease of use, relevance and active dialogue. Therefore, this project focused on designing new concepts for bi-directional information sharing between the franchisor and customer-facing IKEA co-workers. The final concept ensures the development of IKEA co-workers by presenting IKEA Concept Knowledge, Learning Solutions and IKEA Product Information given by CBF and Range &amp; Supply. I started the project with a literature review about the modern-day Employee Experience and based on three literature studies I established the theoretical parameters of my thesis’ design context to create a theoretical framework. The literature framework consisted of the following research findings that acted as the guiding principles for the design process: Daniel Pink’s Intrinsic Drivers of Motivation: Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose (Pink, 2009); Joseph Pine’s Drivers of Experience Value: Time well spent &amp; Time well invested (Pine, 2020); Bi-directional Information Sharing via a Digital Infrastructure (Koenders et al., 2018). In parallel to the literature review, I conducted interviews with CBF employees and IKEA Delft co-workers. This was to contextualize the theoretical findings with real-life, IKEA stories and experiences from both stakeholders. From these interviews came the following core insights: 1. CBF wants to be more accommodating and foreseeing in terms of IKEA co-worker learning needs and overall learning experience 2. CBF wants to create more points of involvement and interaction with IKEA co-workers to get their feedback on the IKEA Learning Offer 3. CBF wants to add more tangibility and guidance to the IKEA Learning Experience. 1. Co-workers want a relevant and personalized IKEA Learning Experience 2. Co-workers want to be more involved in CBF projects and be kept up to date on the status of their feedback 3. Co-workers’ autonomy in their learning experience is strong and that should not change. These insights guide the implementation of the concept idea because they’re based on more detailed and subjective findings and therefore, they contribute to a more specific level of what the concept should achieve as opposed to the literary findings. Additionally, L&amp;D managers from external companies were also interviewed and to bring more meaning to the findings of my research and design context. These findings are presented as ‘advice’ within this assignment because even though the findings were valuable, they represent a different company or industry than IKEA. Therefore, these findings were more suggestive than imperative to include. With these findings, I went through an iterative process to define the design statement of this assignment. First, I created user stories, which I then clustered into design opportunities, and conducted collaborative brainstorming sessions with IKEA people to gather content for my individual ideation cycle. It then became clear that the design process was sprawling and didn’t have a clear design goal. So, based on an initial design statement, I created three concept idea directions that each had a digital infrastructure as a facilitator of their goals. These directions proved to show a disconnect with the initial design statement as they contained design decisions about the manifestation of the concept idea that weren’t reflected in the initial design statement. So, by conducting user feedback sessions with IKEA Delft co-workers, I gathered their feedback on the relation of the design qualities in the initial design statement to the concept idea directions and finalized the design statement to eliminate the disconnect that had established itself during the design process. The final design statement is: The concept should enable Inter IKEA Systems B.V. to facilitate promptive learning of the IKEA Concept so that customer-facing co-workers feel autonomous, purposeful, and heard. This should be achieved through customizable layers, visualization of co-worker growth and omni-channel feedback. From these user feedback sessions, I gathered feedback on the three concept idea directions and evaluated them based on their fulfillment of the overall goal of facilitating promptive learning of the IKEA Concept, as well as the goals to make co-workers feel autonomous through customizable layers, feel purposeful through visualization of co-worker growth, and feel heard through omni-channel feedback tools. The same was done for an iterated version of the concept idea direction based on the feedback gathered during the user sessions. This potential fulfillment of the design statement was the deciding factor for the final chosen concept idea direction which was a combination of Direction 1 and Direction 3, and ultimately led to my final concept idea, Ändamål. For IKEA co-workers, Ändamål is a social performance support platform that presents a personalized experience of the IKEA Learning Offer with relevant learning content and personal development tools. By providing a digital space for IKEA co-workers to come together, share their experiences and feedback with all IKEA people, Ändamål gives IKEA co-workers the drive to continue their purposeful learning journey and improve the IKEA Concept. The platform is introduced at the beginning of someone’s IKEA career during their onboarding process. It has been designed with customer-facing co-workers in mind but can be used for IKEA co-workers from all departments since they all have their own experiential expertise. The platform is then used throughout the co-worker’s entire time at IKEA as it helps them to document their professional growth. Ändamål centers its features around the co-worker’s needs of autonomy, mastery and purpose. Co-workers are encouraged to choose their own development path at IKEA (autonomy) and by offering learning content that specifically aligns with their (team’s) goals, Ändamål makes every IKEA learning moment time well spent. The additional personal development tools that enable co-workers to document their learning goals and visualize their growth, prompt their need for intellectual challenge (mastery), thus creating time well invested. To create the feeling of purpose and togetherness, Ändamål’s digital communities connect IKEA co-workers to colleagues with shared interests, goals, or experiences, but also facilitates active omni-channel feedback loops between CBF and co-workers. Ändamål essentially removes the disconnect in communication and collaboration between CBF and IKEA co-workers in a way that puts the co-workers’ needs first and makes both stakeholders equal partners in their relationship.","Employee Experience; Bi-Directional Information Sharing; Strategic Design; Intrinsic Motivation; Digital Transformation; Employer-Employee Relationship","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

This study makes use of a case study-mixed methods approach combining a quantitative strand to identify public values and their conflicts from geo-located citizen contributions using natural language processing with a qualitative strand that leverages expert workshops. Integrating the findings from both strands embedded in the case study of Hamburg, Germany, there is evidence for a broader conceptualization of public values. In a new conceptual tool named ""public value spheres"", the main identified public values of social equity, livability, economic opportunity, ecologic quality, safety, health and conservatism are displayed. A total of nine archetypical spatial public value conflicts were found within Hamburg, among them the newly identified ""externality conflict"", ""dangers of nature conflict"" and the ""drawback of beauty conflict"". The findings provide urban planners and practitioners with a new tool to account for the value-laden nature of relational urban space in future participatory processes. The citizenry itself could profit from a better discourse due to aggregation of voices in participatory tools and a transparent mapping of public values that creates a sense of the pluralism of public values within a city.

(mentor); van der Voet, E (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Universiteit Leiden (degree granting institution)","2021","A large part of the Dutch plastic waste is currently incinerated, with a high amount of greenhouse gas emissions as a consequence. If recycling is done efficiently, it could provide environmental benefit over energy recovery through incineration, especially in a low carbon economy where renewable energy generation becomes the new status quo. This study focusses on one of the most used types of plastic for packaging: flexible film. The aim of the research is estimating the degree of circularity in the flexible film supply chain from a systems perspective. Moreover, the focus is on discovering how the current techno-institutional regime involving the flexible film supply chain can be protected from techno-institutional lock-in: a situation where innovation towards a circular supply chain is opposed through reinforcing socio-economic, institutional and technical structures. To explore this, a mixed method approach is applied, covering several qualitative and quantitative research methods. First, the current flexible film supply chain is examined by means of desk research. This analysis indicates that it is economically more advantageous to incinerate than to recycle flexible films under current conditions. A material flow analysis is performed to uncover the current flexible film material flows in the Netherlands. It shows that the ratio between recycled and reapplied flexible film and the amount incinerated is different than expected. A much higher proportion seems to currently be incinerated than suggested by national statistics. Furthermore, the material flow analysis shows that much of the recycled content supply remains unused, as the demand for recycled flexible films is currently higher than demand. The main supply chain actors are interviewed for their perspective on the influential factors for innovation for circularity in the supply chain. The interviews are analysed by means of comparative cognitive mapping. Results showed that the actors perceived high dependency on governmental institutions for accelerating innovation, more so than interdependency within the supply chain. Furthermore, the demand for recycled flexible films seems to be one of the most crucial factors, with recycled flexible film quality as a close second. Aggregated institutional factors appear to have the most influence on the demand for recycled flexible films, compared to socio-economic and technical factors. The construction of the current techno-institutional regime visualizes the crucial role of the institutional system in initiating and accelerating circular innovation through governmental (policy) triggers. Desk research is done to discover trends for and relationships between the relevant factors mentioned by the supply chain actors. Subsequently, the flexible film supply chain and the relevant influential factors are simulated for different scenarios towards 2025 by means of dynamic modelling. The results show that only in the high scenario, demand exceeds supply, resulting in a positive stimulus for achieving more circularity within the supply chain. Moreover, in the high scenario, the reapplied recycled content increases significantly, which shows a positive development on the ratio between incinerated and reapplied recycled content. The same trend is visible in the low scenario, but to a much lower degree. Moreover, only the high scenarios display an eventual decrease in the accumulating stockpile of unused flexible film supply. Based on the results of the different methods, it can be concluded that the current flexible film supply chain shows less circularity than Dutch national reports suggest with their values for recycled content. Nonetheless, some positive trends are visible, that push the supply chain towards circularity. In the short term, institutional factors seem to be most important here, due to their influence on recycled flexible film demand. The government aims to achieve a 30% recycled content, compared to overall annual production, for each type of plastic in 2025. This can only be achieved when the influential factors develop as estimated in the simulated high scenarios, especially in terms of institutional factors. Due to the crucial role of institutional triggers and policy implementation in this context, it is strongly recommended that governmental action is taken for providing a level playing field within the plastic industry. This can, subsequently, break reinforcing technological and socio-economic loops and initiate change within these structures hindering innovation. In this way, the development towards a circular flexible film supply chain can be stimulated and a techno-institutional lock-in is avoided.<br","Circular Supply Chain; Plastic Recycling; Flexible Film Recycling; Techno-Institutional Lock-In; Techno-Institutional Complex; Techno-Institutional System","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

Understanding the induced seismicity in the Zeerijp area is important for the population living in this relatively densely populated region, but also essential to the Dutch governement and the operator of the field; the Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij (NAM). One way of gaining the knowledge on the dynamics of the fault systems in the area is by, for example, a full waveform inversion f recorded seismic data that gives us the moment tensor describing the earthquake mechanism. A drawback of this method is that it is computationally expensive and time intensive. In this thesis two different machine learning techniques are investigated that can lead to a faster estimation of the moment tensor. We find that, when using time traces that are modelled from the 1D velocity model of the area, there is a difference in sensitivity of the network to the individual moment tensor components. Besides that, using a feed forward neural network generally yields a better performance, but does not give us the associated uncertainties of the network. This is in contrast with the mixture density network, which performs slightly worse than the feed forward network, but it does give us the involved uncertainties when the algorithm makes the predictions. Adding different levels of Gaussian noise to the data gave us a first insight as to how the precision of the moment tensor estimations would change. It was found that a mixture density network has a more stable prediction when estimating low signal-to-noise ratio data. No test with real data from the Zeerijp area is done, however, we can conclude from our results that the estimation of the moment tensors in this region should be possible with the use of machine learning techniques.","moment tensor inversion; Neural Network; mixture density network; Earthquakes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Geophysics | IDEA League","",""

Although methods exist that generate synthetic wMRI from qMRI, the inverse problem has not been thoroughly studied yet. A method to generate qMRI from wMRI would be beneficial as it does not change current clinical workflows and enables retrospective quantitative analysis. This thesis investigates to what extent fully convolutional networks are successful in generating qMRI from T1-weighted, T2-weighted, PD-weighted and T2-weighted-FLAIR scans. A set of synthetic wMRI scans from 97 healthy volunteers was split into training, validation and test sets for development of our models. We varied model architectures, loss functions and learning rates during training, in order to find the best performing models. These were able to predict qMRI with median errors of approximately 5% on the test set. Additionally, we determined the amount of information contained in the input scans by training models using different combinations of the input. These results showed that T1-weighted, T2-weighted and PD-weighted scans were the most important. Models trained on synthetic wMRI were tested on an additional dataset of real wMRI. This resulted in higher median errors of 27.4%, 12.0% and 8.7% for T1-, T2- and PD-maps respectively. Furthermore, the same models were tested on a third dataset of synthetic tumour scans and mainly showed errors around the tumour core. These results show that more research is necessary in order to improve the performances of models generating qMRI to a clinical standard.","MRI; Brain; Deep Learning; Quantitative MRI","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Medical Physics","",""

(graduation committee); Colenberg, S.E. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Social wellbeing at work by definition incorporates the feeling of belongingness, having satisfying social interactions and relationships with others (Fisher, 2014). During the COVID-19 pandemic, working from home has raised our awareness that positive social interaction with colleagues or peers is crucial to our wellbeing and the lack of it might lead to negative effects like exhaustion (Meyer et al., 2021). It has been researched that positive social wellbeing at the workplace can boost mood, increase productivity and performance (Dutton and Heaphy, 2003). Thus there is a need to measure and monitor the social wellbeing of employees at work for organisations like TU Delft. Supervised by Annemiek van Boeijen and initiated by Susanne Colenberg, this project aims to develop a tool that measures social wellbeing at the workplace. Recognizing the fact that the tool design could face challenges including different contextual influences and diverse needs and values of stakeholders, a design challenge was formulated to design a context-sensitive tool that can enable adaptation to different local contexts in order to meet different needs. The focus was put on the measurement form design instead of the content like what to measure. To tackle the challenge, this project followed a design process using the model of Double Diamond(Design Council, 2019) and Basic Design Circle (van Boeijen et al., 2020). To explore, methods of literature study and participatory research were combined to understand existing measurement tools and investigate stakeholders’ experiences. By synthesizing insights from the research, main problems were identified and a design vision was formulated. To inform the concept development, a list of design requirements were developed based on the theoretical architecture of the approach, Context Variation by Design (Kersten, 2020). Guided by the design vision and the design requirement, concept development was conducted starting by defining a basic framework of a continuous system. During the development, two rounds of ideation were executed both with reflections and idea convergence in the end. With the first ideation, possibilities were explored and a design direction was selected. The second ideation was used to design a more concrete concept that aimed to create a supportive network. With the clear concept, a final design was created and introduced, the app Forenet. With the app, employees could help improve social wellbeing at the workplace by sharing anonymous opinions. HR officers can use this app to customize how employees provide those opinion data and collect and track data about their social wellbeing over time. The final prototype was developed through Figma and stimulated into animation for design evaluation. With evaluations with employees and HR officers, what could be opportunities, challenges and drivers for its implementation were identified. Strategies to implement the design at TU delft context and a using manual for HR officers were proposed. In the end, recommendations for future development were also suggested.","social wellbeing; Measurement; Interaction design; Strategic design; Wellbeing at workplace","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

There are several indicators to measure the transition towards the CE in the built environment, but no consensus has been reached. Based on previous literature, the design decisions during the preliminary stage of the design should consider circularity performance and environmental impact as key indicators. Traditionally, these assessments are performed at the end of the design stage, limiting their use for making design decisions. Hence, there is a need to develop a framework or a tool to perform the assessment during the design stage. In recent years, Building Information Modelling (BIM) has shown its potential in the construction industry. However, there is limited research on its effectiveness to enhance sustainability driven by CE.<br/><br/>The objective of the research was divided into three parts: determine the necessary CE metrics related to product circularity performance and environmental impact during the design stage; develop a framework and a tool to conduct an assessment during the design stage and determine a method to support designers to make design decisions based on the assessment and project requirements. <br/><br/>A framework was proposed to conduct the assessment during the design stage. A prototype in Revit using Dynamo, a visual programming platform, was developed for conducting the assessment. A multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) using the TOPSIS method was performed on the obtained assessment results for the products to make a trade-off between circularity performance and environmental impact and obtain the best alternative product for the design. A case study and workshop validate the proposed framework. The criteria for evaluation include the applicability of the framework, accuracy of the developed tool for the assessment, usability of the tool and its implication to make a balanced design choice and its contribution towards sustainability and circularity consciousness. Based on the implementation of the developed tool and workshop, it was observed that the tool can be applied to real-time projects and had the ability to support designers to make sound decisions based on circularity and sustainability criteria. It had 95 - 100% accuracy when compared to other commercial tools. During the workshop, it was perceived that over the period of time the developed tool improves the designer's consciousness on circularity and sustainability.","Circular economy (CE); Sustainability; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Circularity assessment; BIM; Dynamo; Multi Criteria Decision-Making; TOPSIS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Due to the injection of high-pressure fluids, induced fractures can produce seismic events of low magnitude that can be recorded and subsequently analyzed to infer the stress field at the location of the event. The seismic moment tensor has been widely used to describe general seismic sources as it can provide information about the type of motion and the distribution of forces. Estimating such quantities from the recorded data can significantly improve the real-time microseismic monitoring operations and help to make assumptions about the structure of the reservoir. However, several challenges have to be faced when working with microseismic borehole measurements. They are characterized by a low signal-to-noise ratio and a limited angle coverage, which may ultimately affect the predictions about the location and the fracturing behavior inside the reservoir. In this thesis the inversion of microseismic measurements for retrieving the moment tensor has been tackled by using a deep feedforward neural network. The seismograms used to train the network were generated through the discrete-wavenumber method. The neural network was used to predict the six independent moment-tensor components and the fault angles from seismic sources at different positions than those used during the training. The predictive capabilities of the network were tested for realistic borehole acquisition geometries and wave propagation models. The moment-tensor components were retrieved with good accuracy when using noisy seismograms and, non-double-couple source mechanisms. As the generation of synthetic data can be expensive in terms of memory consumption, the training and prediction have been also implemented in the frequency domain using only a limited portion of the Fourier transform of the seismograms. The inversion results indicated that using narrow bands can still yield satisfactory results when predicting the moment-tensor components.","Artifical neural networks; Full-waveform inversion; Machine learning; Seismic moment tensor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Geophysics | IDEA League","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","With the current urge around the globe for switching to “green energy” and Renewable Energy Sources (RES) utilization, the electrification of the transportation sector has become a necessity. While the emerging Electric Vehicles (EVs) can provide several benefits to the power grid, such as voltage and frequency regulation and power quality improvement, the large and immense EV fleets penetration can have the exact opposite results, if no suitable charging method is utilized. Therefore, the uncontrollable EV charging, that is being utilized today, will not be capable of offering sustainable energy to the future EVs with respect to the power grid limits and hence, today’s research field has turned to optimized smart-charging techniques. However, most of these algorithms treat the problem of smart-charging deterministically, assuming 100% accurate prediction of the input data, while it has been shown that the optimality of results can be seriously deteriorated even under small prediction error.This thesis purpose is to address the impact and potential management of several uncertainties related with EV smart charging: PV Generation, Load Demand, arrival SOC, Arrival and Departure time of the EVs &amp; (Frequency Containment Regulation) FCR Reserves provision uncertainties. The main handling technique, utilized in this thesis, is the Robust Optimization (RO) approach, taking advantage of its very lower computational expense and protection against the worst-case scenario of the uncertainty, with the combination of the Receding Horizon Optimization (RHO), that is already implemented in the Benchmark algorithm. After improving the Benchmark algorithm by providing it with prediction feature, this thesis proves the capability of improved robustly EV charging with the combination of RO-RHO approach with prediction, which reduces the economical (in terms of charging costs/income) and “customer satisfaction” (in terms of unfinished charging gap impacts) of all the uncertainties considered. A more robust and “realistic” FCR reserves provision model has been developed, as well. Last but not least, the well-known RO drawback of potential over-conservativeness, in other words high deterioration of optimality at expense of robustness, is address for every uncertainty.The results of the investigation provide valuable results about which uncertainty has the greater impact, is more robustly manageable or inflicts the highest “Price of Robustness”, regarding overconservativeness. For example, it has been found that the FCR reserves uncertainty inflicts the highest economical and charging gap impacts, however it is the most robustly manageable uncertainty as well, if RO and prediction feature are utilized. Moreover, while arrival SOC and Parking Time uncertainties affect highly the unfinished charging gap, the PV Generation and Load Demand have practically only economic impact, which is also lower than the other uncertainties, hence they are defined as the “uncertainties with the least impact”. Finally, there are 3 types of nodes studied: the “Home” Node, the “Semi-Public” Node &amp; the “Public” Nodes. Observing their behavior during the different uncertainties’ study cases, interesting results have been found about their robust management and affection by the various uncertainties.","Smart-Charging; Electric Vehicles; Robust Optimization; Uncertainties managementn; Uncertainties Impact; Receding Horizon Approach; Algorithm; MILP; ancillary services","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-08-25","","","","Electrical Engineering | Electrical Power Engineering","",""

An increasing trend is observed among young parents travelling with their babies facilitated by low travel costs (Yeoman, 2012). However, babies below 2 years are not considered as regular passengers and airlines make babies fly on their parents/guardians lap with no or meagre fees (EASA, 2019). Most airlines provide baby bassinet to help parents manage their journey. The current Belgraver bassinet provides a temporary place at an economy class bulkhead wall for babies below 6 months to sleep and relax during the flight journey (KLM, 2021). However, this design is aged and needs to be updated to meet the user needs and desires. In addition, since this product is integrated into the aircraft, it needs to meet aviation safety regulations like 16G test, burn test and strength test (Belgraver, 2021). <br/>An abundance of research is carried out to understand adult passengers' physical, psychological, and social comfort, reflecting the evolution of passenger seats and amenities (Anjani, 2021). However, this is sparse in the case of infants (0-2 years) and their parents who experience internal and external stress throughout the journey (Harris, 2014). The main opportunity of this master thesis is to redesign the baby bassinet to meet the identified needs of parents, babies and flight attendants in the economy class cabin environment, which is implemented in the market in 3 years. In this project, the current bassinet interaction insights of babies and parents were obtained by interviewing 2 parents and conducting an online focus group with 14 parents. Further, 4 flight attendants and a flight manager from KLM were interviewed to understand their needs and requirements. The key challenges were developed by grouping the drawbacks of the Belgraver bassinet. They are comfortable, ease of handling and hygiene. The solution Kinder fly is a versatile product with two orientations, to accommodate all the babies under 2 years. Each sub-system, frame, basket and mattress, is developed through iterative cycles: synthesis – simulation – evaluation – decision (Roozenburg et al., 1995). The concept development results were evaluated with 3 parents in aircraft environment, in which the Inclusivity of bigger babies was highly appreciated. The challenges of comfort and ease of handling were given priority, and significant improvement in these areas are obtained. However, hygiene issues need to be tackled in the future. In conclusion, the concept, Kinder Fly entertains the baby and parent to have a stress free, relaxed and comfortable flight experience.","Aircraft Design; baby; bassinet","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-08-25","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Willemen, A.M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Although biocomposites have been around for some years now, their use is still far from mainstream. Yet, the material properties of biocomposites and their current applications show a lot of potential for more sustainable, lightweight and structural applications in many industries. Long fibre biocomposites show good specific properties and offer unique benefits like high vibration damping. Furthermore, they have a significantly lower environmental impact than aluminium and synthetic composites. This project was commissioned by NPSP, a company with over 20 years of experience in the biocomposite industry. They experience a rising interest in biocomposites in recent years, but large scale applications are still rare. This project aimed to explore the potential of long fibre biocomposite applications in the mobility and transport industry. These industries feel the need to become more sustainable and the characteristics of long fibre biocomposites show other potential benefits. After initial material research was performed, nine weeks of project acquisition followed. Six companies participated in a short track of a maximum of two meetings to explore biocomposite potential for their corporation. The results of this process are analysed to obtain insights into what boundaries and opportunities companies see in biocomposites. From the results can be concluded that interest in biocomposites is present in these industries. The potential benefits of saving weight and opting for a more sustainable material are acknowledged by most companies. The main boundaries currently preventing companies to apply biocomposites are the high perceived risk of applying the material, high costs, a challenging end of life scenario and lack of more ‘off the shelf’ semi-manufactured biocomposite products. The current position of biocomposites can be referred to as the so-called ‘chasm’ in the technology adoption lifecycle (figure 1). At this point, an innovation is accepted in a few small niche markets but needs the acceptance of more mature companies and industries to grow or even survive. Assumed at the start of this project was that larger scale applications would lead biocomposites across the chasm. So after ten weeks of project acquisition, one case was selected to continue with in the second phase of the project. The process of this project showed that material innovation is a slow process. Reaching a collaboration and develop a biocomposite application in a half year project proved to be optimistic. Since the selected case showed slow progress, more effort could be spent on improving the credibility of biocomposites at NPSP and evaluating new material development opportunities. These efforts led to the development of a website proposal, a new sample set and three development opportunities to enable widespread adoption of long fibre biocomposites.","Biocomposites; Material Innovation; Natural fibre composites; NPSP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","class=""MsoNormal"">This MSc. thesis presents the extensive research conducted on designing neural networks capable of generating reactionary dance motions. The research was conducted in collaboration with Stichting Another kind of Blue (AKOB) and CompactCopters UG (CC). It is set within the industry context of the ’AI-man’ project, developed by AKOB and CC; a novel dance show intended to create a truly interactive duet between man and machine. It is the follow-up to the successful ’Airman’ project; a dance show utilizing a swarm of 12 drones to perform with a human dancer on stage. Airman enabled the drone swarm to represent a human figure and copy the improvised dance motions of the human dancer, recorded via a motion capture (MoCap) system in real-time. The AI-man project aims to take this to the next level, by placing an AI motion controller in between the live MoCap recording and the desired humanoid pose passed to the drone swarm. By doing so, the system should be responsive to the human dancer’s motion and generate reactionary dance motions to created a shared improvised duet. Long-term motion generation is a very challenging problem and currently actively researched by various AI researchers. For reference, many researchers consider the prediction or generation of motion longer than one second, or even just 500 ms, ’long-term’ [Ghosh et al., 2018; Gui et al., 2018a; Tang et al., 2017]. In contrast to this, the interactive segment in the Airman show was about one minute long. During the initial literature study, no comparable research was found attempting to generate motion in reaction to full-body human input. To facilitate the research, a custom MoCap dataset was acquired containing over 9 hours of improvised dance motions between two dancers. In comparison to current publicly available datasets, the acquired dataset appears to be second longest MoCap dataset to date.To achieve the desired objective, two models were created:1) An initial regression model, successfully mimicking the human motion in the training dataset, but very unstable in a real-time environment.2) A generative model, intended to generate a variety of reactionary motions in real-time, in reaction to an arbitrary motion input. For the generative model, a novel neural network architecture, for the generation of long-term reactionary motions, is proposed: The ’Differential Recurrent Attention GAN’ (DRA-GAN). Utilizing the training methodology of ’Generative Adversarial Networks’ (GANs) [Goodfellow et al., 2014], in combination with design elements from ’Recurrent Neural Networks’ (RNNs) [Recurrent units: LSTM [Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997] &amp; GRU [Cho et al., 2014]], attention mechanisms [Bahdanau et al., 2015], differential equations and ’Principal Component Analysis’ (PCA) [Jolliffe, 2002].The proposed model showcases promising training progression, but has so far failed to generate true longterm output. This is because the training halts in a common failure mode for GANs; ’mode collapse’ [Liu and Tuzel, 2016]. While the model has so far not succeeded in generating the desired results, it cannot be concluded that the model is unable to generate the desired results. This is because, the full potential of the model has not yet been explored, e.g. by means of ’Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization’ (BHPO).The framework to achieve BHPO was developed, but the extremely long training times (≈ 2 weeks), on the limited hardware available, have prevented the evaluation of a sufficient number of model variations. To facilitate further research, an extensive list of methodologies was compiled that could potentially resolve the current problems of the model.","Generative Adversarial Network; Recurrent Neural Networks; Adversarial learning; Motion Generation; Motion Capture; Bayesian Optimization; Character Animation; Dance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","AI-Man",""

(mentor); van Goozen, Hans (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","class=""MsoNormal"">Both GKN Aerospace Fokker Aerostructures B.V. (Fokker) and Delft University of Technology (DUT) are partaking in a Clean Sky 2 program called MANTA. MANTA stands for: MovAbles in the Next generaTion Aircraft, and is a program created by the European Union in order to meet the ’ACARE Flightpath 2050 objectives’ by achieving cleaner air travel. The MANTA program aims to reduce the fuel consumption by 3% to 5% using the knock on effects of smart usage of movables.   The contribution of Fokker in the MANTA program is the Morphing Tab concept. This is a newly introduced tab which will be located in the wingtip and must allow load alleviation during manoeuvres. By deflecting the tab in a smart manner, it will be able to generate an internal moment in the wing structure opposite to the internal moment generated by the lift. These internal moments counteract one another, reducing the peak stresses which can result in a lighter wing structure. This will have multiple aerodynamic beneficial knock on effects such as the potential for a more slender wing.  The solution of Fokker. to keep the drag introduced by the tab to a minimum, is to use a morphing tab rather than a conventional tab. The morphing tab has a continuous inboard skin surface which morphs in the section between the Rigid winglet structure and the rigid tab. The continuous skin will add to the aerodynamic efficiency as airflow along the surface stays attached further along the wing chord and airflow leakage is largely avoided.  The morphing part of the winglet exists of multiple components. the component studied in this thesis is the flexible skin. More precisely, it is the attachment of the morphing skin to the non-morphing parts of the concept, the winglet and the tab. As the morphing skin is very thin, and the condition of use is an out-of-plain movement, a complex and rarely studied combination is formed. This has led to the following research question: What is the best method to connect a thin flexible skin element undergoing a peel-like motion to a rigid structure without disturbing the aerodynamic surface at the outside of the skin? Answering this question must lead to a solution for this specific situation as well as contribute to the body of knowledge to fill the current literature gap. Based on the findings of the literature study, the analysis started with selecting a joining method. This process was performed by a trade-off in which six groups of joining methods (Integral Structure, Bonding, Welding, Mechanical Fastening, a Piano Hinge and a Flexible Hinge Element) have been compared. This resulted in the selection of Mechanical Fastening as the best joining method. Within this category, Rivets have been selected as the best suited solution for the Morphing Tab Connection. Along with design guidelines, a comparison between the failure limits of the rivets and the loading conditions of the tab, led to the design of the riveted connection. A test had to be created in order to investigate whether the design is able to meet the requirements of the joint under the relevant loading conditions. No standardised test could be used as they did not create representative loading conditions. During the test, the stress and strain of the skin at the connection are measured via the machine output, Digital Image Correlation software and strain gauges. Additionally, video recordings are made of the test from the side in order to validate results. Three main test conclusions can be made: • The Aerodynamic Profile does not experience a significant effect of the Riveted connection. The required rotation angle and accuracy are achieved and the contour deformation is within the tolerance. • The Static Failure is caused by skin bending without interference of the fasteners. The Static Failure Level is higher than the required minimum stress. Therefore, the Static Load Requirements are met. • The rivets do not interfere on the skin behaviour during fatigue tests. The stiffness reduction due to the fatigue tests shows similar results with and without fasteners. Overall this means that the Riveted connection meets all Aerodynamic and Structural Requirements. Besides this, no indication was apparent during the tests that another joining method would lead to better performance. Also, the riveted connection outperformed the other joining methods in the other Trade-off categories. The combination of these two facts warrant the overall conclusion of this thesis: A riveted connection is the best method to connect a thin flexible skin element undergoing a peel-like motion to a rigid structure without disturbing the aerodynamic surface at the outside of the skin. The connection design created during in this thesis can be applied in further investigations in the Morphing Tab Concept.","Joint; Rivet; Morphing; Winglet; Mechanical fastener; Load Alleviation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-01","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Morphing Winglet Tab",""

Reciprocating engine, hydrogen fuel cell and battery models are incorporated into a multidisciplinary design optimisation framework, with the aim of minimising the maximum take-off weight at various levels of modelling fidelity. The results show that hydrogen fuel cells can provide around 40% reduction in the aircraft's maximum take-off weight, while batteries are not capable of enabling long-endurance flight. It is further shown that the effects of modelling fidelity of the aerodynamics and structural wing weight models are more significant when the aircraft design being optimised is substantially different from the baseline configuration.","MALE; medium altitude; long endurance; UAV; unmanned aerial vehicle; electric propulsion; hydrogen; fuel cell; battery; piston engine; reciprocating engine; modelling fidelity","en","master thesis","","","","","","Thesis in cooperation with the University of Sydney, Australia.","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

These global dietary shifts contribute greatly to increasing greenhouse gas emissions because of their higher carbon and water intensities. This development is problematic considering both the growth in our global economy as well as our population. It is therefore crucial to find ways to reduce the impact of food systems. The mesopelagic zone in the ocean has recently been found to host a vaster source of biomass than expected, however, designing harvesting policies poses a deep uncertain issue. The mesopelagic zone promises a new source for the human food supply chain, especially serving as fish meal for aquaculture. Aquaculture is currently the worlds’ fastest growing food sector. However, unlocking the potential of the mesopelagic zone has challenges. The working of the mesopelagic zone and its ecosystem are still vastly unknown, as is the magnitude and variety of impacts harvesting might have on this. Moreover, the zone is located at a location beyond national legislation and still lacks overarching regulation. To acknowledge this research gap, this study focuses on how robust decision making methods can support decision making on harvesting in the mesopelagic system. This is done by analysing the current governance arena, the working of the mespelagic zone, and finally applying these findings to a System Dynamics model and performing Many-Objective Robust Decision Making (MORDM). Ultimately, to understand possible mesopelagic futures and thus gain governance relevant insights on harvesting in the mesopelagic zone. Exploring the model behaviour over a variability of plausible futures demonstrated that several uncertainties have a crucial impact on the mesopelagic system's best and worst case behaviour. It seems that profitability of mesopelagic harvesting relative to regular fishing is the most prominent indicator for collapses of the mesopelagic biomass. Additionally, factors concerning low food availability seem to be strongly linked to biomass collapse and vice versa. Moreover, reproductive parameters (e.g., a high female fraction of the biomass) as well as a high ratio of myctophidea to Maurolicus muerelli positively influenced the magnitude of food provision. Furthermore, other noteworthy findings are that an optimal harvesting quota seemed to act as a balancing tool for profitability. Additionally, exploration of the uncertainty space clarified which uncertainties have the strongest influence when no harvesting limits are in place. The two most influential uncertainties are the profitability of mesopelagic fish versus regular fish and the type of risk reward mechanism. This finding reduces the uncertainty space for decision makers by clarifying which indicators to focus on and which uncertainties might not even be relevant to consider for decision making. Moreover, it can be concluded that by harvesting according to the selected policies, the atmospheric carbon levels in 2100 would rise significantly enough to cause added pressure on the climate. This strengthens the call for considering climate change as well as biomass conservation when thinking about mesopelagic governance In conclusion, this research found several governance relevant insights for harvesting in the mesopelagic zone. The set of policies and the insights they provided serve as a promising starting point for stakeholders to learn about harvesting in the mesopelagic zone. Considering the mesopelagic decision arena, this study shows that current marine governance is unprepared to manage the magnitude and variety of the impacts harvesting can have on the mesopelagic biomass and its carbon sequestration function. Also, this research strengthens the call for including the mesopelagic zone and its role in the climate in future governance. These findings facilitate a discussion between stakeholders, which was previously impossible due to the deep uncertain character of the mesopelagic zone. This study is a first demonstration of the added value of MORDM for decision making on an intricate system like the mesopelagic zone.","MORDM; System Dynamics; Modelling; EMA Workbench; Mesopelagic zone; Ecology; carbon sequestration; Uncertainty","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

One such technology that has come into the limelight in the past few years is the Digital Twin. The so-called ’digital twin’ is a real-time virtual replica (representation) of any given physical asset/object. The full-potential of a digital twin lies in its ability to not only communicate with the physical asset, but also control it remotely. Although the concept of digital twins is more than a decade old, digital twin initiatives are now been deployed in the manufacturing, automotive and healthcare industries among others. One such industry, experimenting with digital twins is the Energy sector. The objective of this research was to perform an exploratory investigation into the adoption of Digital Twins in the Dutch Energy sector predominately by Trans- mission System Operators (TSOs) and Distribution System Operators (DSOs). The investigation comprised of four elements: establishing the most fitting technology adoption model when it comes to digital twins, determining the relevant adoption variables, exploring the perception of digital twins in the industry and investigating the relationship between absorptive capacity and organizational characteristics. The research method deployed for the former two elements was desk research, whereas the latter elements were probed by conducting (semi-structured) interviews and targeted questionnaires respectively. There were a total of nine participants involved in this research which included technology adoption decision-makers having a wide range of work experience (1-5 years to 20+ years) from the five of the eight TSO/DSOs of the Netherlands.<br/>The research found that the most fitting technology adoption model when it comes to digital twins in the Dutch energy sector was the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) Framework with the following relevant (non-exhaustive) adoption variables: Complexity, Compatibility, Perception, Technological Characteristics, Availability, Organizational culture, Organizational size, Budget size, Incentives, Management support, Ab- sorptive capacity, (decision-maker’s) Demographics, Attitude towards technology, Regulations, Competitive pressure and Network effects. In addition, the overall perception of digital twins was found to be positive across the Dutch Energy sector, however, there was no consistent relationship established between organizational characteristics and the levels of digital twin perception. Similarly, the research suggested that organizational characteristics and absorptive capacity were not correlated. Nonetheless given the limitations of having a low number of study participants and the potential of bias amongst respondents towards their employer, the strength (significance) of these discovered relationships are indicative and should be further investigated in future research prior to making any additional claims that are conclusive.","Digital Twins; Technology Adoption; energy sector; Emerging technologies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(mentor); Auping, W.L. (graduation committee); Brazier, F.M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Evacuation strategies are critical in preventing casualties during emergency evacuations in buildings. As large-scale gatherings and high crowd densities in buildings occur more often, the need of relevant and effective evacuation strategies emerges. However, the domain of research that tries to identify possible ways to improve evacuation, i.e. prescriptive domain, is underlooked. Several studies successfully improve evacuation by optimizing existing evacuation scenarios in buildings. A shortcoming of these studies is that they often focus on one strategy and scenario in particular. Therefore, one should opt for a more generic approach to evaluate the effectiveness of evacuation strategies under different circumstances. A way to mitigate uncertainties in evacuation is by using data. Recent studies use a data-driven approach, in which data is used as an input to calibrate and enhance the evacuation strategy. A promising source of data is WiFi data. WiFi data captures movement patterns of building occupants and can be translated to population and building characteristics. Therefore, WiFi data offers the creation of evacuation scenarios in which evacuation strategies can be practically tested. This study aims to (1) evaluate the efficiency of evacuation strategies in buildings under different circumstances, and (2) determine effective evacuation strategies given WiFi data as an input. Therefore, this study presents a new exploratory agent-based approach to evaluate evacuation strategies, and moreover, presents an approach to incorporate input data to practically test evacuation strategies in a given building. To do so, this study used three methodological approaches, namely ExploratoryModeling and Analysis (EMA), Agent- Based Modeling (ABM) and Data Mining. EMA is used to experiment with the created agent-based evacuation model. EMA addresses the effect of uncertainties on the evacuation time, and if evacuation strategies are effective and robust in different circumstances. This study showed that in the created model of the TU Delft TPM faculty building, guiding evacuation strategies, such as dynamic signs and using evacuee staff members turned out to be an effective option if the familiarity in the building is low. However, as the familiarity increases the relative effectiveness of these strategies becomes negligible. In case of increasing familiarity, bottleneck improvement strategies, such as wider exits or stairs and obstacle placement, decrease the total evacuation time consequently. Moreover, this study concluded that an exploratory approach for evacuation models is promising, as the effectiveness of evacuation strategies is very dependent on the evacuation scenario. As a result, this study is able to evaluate these scenarios beforehand and to determine the effect on the total evacuation time. In this study the uncertainties crowd density, familiarity with the building, compliance with given instructions, and the exit capacity are leading in influencing the total evacuation time. The latter was found as a newly modelled uncertainty for evacuation scenarios.","evacuation; evacuation strategy; evacuation modeling; agent-based; wifi data; exploratory modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

This is wanted because the inherent stiffness of origami mechanisms introduces unwanted artifacts such as a higher actuation force, and the mechanism not following the theoretical kinematics. By making an origami mechanism neutrally stable the inherent stiffness of the pattern can be removed, and with that the unwanted artifacts as well. Two different strategies are explored, both a form of static balancing. With static balancing, two elements are balanced against each other. In the origami application, this means that two creases are balanced against each other. For the first strategy, a negative stiffness crease is combined with a positive stiffness crease. And for the second strategy two equal but opposite constant moment creases are balanced. To achieve this a negative stiffness, or constant moment crease needs to be designed. For the negative stiffness crease, a design was made where a flat sheet with a slot in the middle was prestressed into a saddle form. This showed bi-stable behavior, and with that negative stiffness. The range of negative stiffness was too short to be relevant for origami. And the prestressing proved hard to model. For the constant moment crease, a convex crease was designed, which did not need to be prestressed. This was easier to model, and three different geometries were found that showed a constant moment. By optimizing these geometries a constant moment over a range of 80 degrees was found. To check if the model is correct, a prototype experiment was performed. The optimized geometry was 3D printed and tested under the same boundary conditions that were present in the model. The results of the prototype experiment matched the results of the model, thereby validating it.","Constant moment; Origami; Neutral stability; Static balancing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

Recent reports indicate the number of registered drones in the United States have crossed 850,000 and is expected to increase multi-fold over the coming years. The widespread applications of drones include agriculture, transportation, mining, media, entertainment, etc. While drones are used for many benevolent purposes, there are also multiple real-life incidents, where drones have caused serious mishaps. Radars with high resolution are increasingly used for drone detection and classification, thanks to their long-range, all-weather monitoring capabilities. Several techniques for binary classification of drone vs no drone, drone vs birds, and different models of drones have been proposed based on the relevant features extracted from the micro-Doppler signatures or from tracks’ information. Recently, research focusing on the problem of classifying drone(s) carrying payloads has garnered considerable attention. <br/><br/>In this thesis, the ability of a fully polarimetric radar and a single polarimetric radar to discriminate between payloads carried by UAVs is demonstrated. A novel approach has been employed in the feature extraction algorithm, where features from individual and combined polarimetric channels are extracted for classification. Decision and ensemble fusions on the respective extracted features proved to enhance the classification performance. The robustness of the algorithm is validated on two experimental radar datasets acquired in the scenarios where the UAVs carrying payloads of different weights are hovering, flying back and forth, and flying along rectangular waypoints. Initial results for the fusion techniques provide approximately 95%-99% classification accuracy for the polarimetric and statistical features.","polarimetry; radar; UAVs; payloads; feature extraction; classification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

Before a flood people can evacuate preventively or vertical and during a flood people can flee, being rescued or permanently stay behind. This research focuses on fleeing and being rescued to a safe region. The research question is: ‘How much time does it take to flee to a safe region during a flood, and what are the core factors that determine the success of a rescue operation by a lifeboat in the Netherlands?’. To indicate how much time it takes for people to flee to a safe region, an experiment took place at test facility Flood Proof Holland in Delft. During this experiment 25 persons walked or bicycled over a parcourse divided into five rounds with different water depths, namely 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 meter. Additionally, there were other variations, such as walking with a floating object, bringing luggage, bringing a domestic animal, fleeing during darkness and the addition of debris in the water. Time measurements took place during the experiment. If people cannot flee, rescue is needed. To gain more insight into rescuing of people during floods, a questionnaire is spread among experts. Relations between time measurements are found with the use of the Pearson moment correlation coefficient, paired t-test and determining the line by using intersept free linear regression. The relations are combined into a flow chart. Further, the time needed during a rescue attempt is combined into a formula. The navigation speed deviates for different water depths and types of lifeboats. Further, it is estimated by the experts that it takes 7½, 30 and 1 minutes from the contact with a person located at respectively a higher floor or attic, collapsed building and out of the water until having this person into a lifeboat. There is no direct singular answer to the research question, because it depends on the area where the flood takes place and the extent of the flood. Larger water depths increase the fleeing time. If a person decides to flee, it is recommended to walk with a bicycle or bring an air mattress. A stick is useful to check where the road is located. Avoid areas with a lot of debris and do not flee during darkness, except if this is inevitable to survive. People can also wait for rescue at a higher (dry) floor. For the rescue crew, number one priority is safety. Try to avoid to navigate through areas with a lot of debris as this may damage the lifeboat. Search the area systematically and make notes of where people are located.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Hydraulic Structures","",""

It started with an open and experimental approach to the space, which helped to understand processes of participatory sense-making through tactile vibrations and the usage of haptic vibration interfaces for communication. This shaped the image and set foundations of what was possible to achieve as a final interaction. The result was an interface that allowed people to emotionally connect using their breath as an input to create haptic vibrations. To do so, a new concept called Vibrification was used, a technique inspired by Sonification that transforms data, in this case biosignals, into tactile vibrations. We successfully tested that Vibrified biosignals are an input that participants perceived as emotionally intense and that allowed them to react and feel the other’s presence. During the tests, the vibrations helped participants to concentrate on the breathing exercise and created an immersive and intense interaction with themselves and each other. The experience was highly rated and participants praised the interface in helping them to feel their breath when they were feeling themselves, and eliciting an emotional and empathetic response when feeling each other. Most of the technology and development was done in house, developing sensors, designing interfaces and programming software that allowed the experiments to happen. This is the main contribution of this project, in the search for emotional social interaction, we propose a new way to design for haptic interaction. Vibrification of biosignals is a new approach that enables us to capture and share human experience to design new ways in which to emotionally connect through technology, inspired by the wide range of possibilities that we, as humans, have to experience the world, ourselves and each other.","Haptics; Social Interaction; Cognition; Research Through Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Consistent fault tolerance has been one of the catalysts fueling the maturity of streaming systems and boosting their widespread adoption not only for analytics use cases, but also as a platform for running applications, such as microservices and stateful functions. The most common fault tolerance strategy that many modern streaming systems adopt is an adaptation of Chandy-Lamport's distributed snapshots protocol that is based on global coordinated checkpoints. Given the importance of fault tolerance and the impact of coordinated checkpoints in the stream processing space, it is surprising that no other fault tolerance algorithm has been considered as an alternative. In this paper we bring together and benchmark three seminal fault tolerance algorithms from the distributed systems literature: the coordinated, uncoordinated, and communication-induced checkpoint algorithms. We evaluate their behavior in terms of runtime performance and failure recovery on a variety of streaming workloads including pipeline, scatter-gather, and cyclical topologies. We benchmark the algorithms on a novel streaming system, FERDiS, built from scratch as an extensible benchmarking framework. The experiment results show that the coordinated approach that state of the art streaming systems adopt is in many cases optimal, but with some exceptions where it is outperformed in both runtime performance and failure recovery by the uncoordinated and communication-induced algorithms. The cause of the differences in performance, both at runtime and during recovery, was found to be strongly related to the characteristics of the input stream(s) and the query graph. On the tested cyclic topology, the coordinated checkpointing algorithm could not be applied as by its design it will deadlock on such query graphs. The natural cycle support of the uncoordinated and communication -induced proved advantageous here and we observed high susceptibility to the unbounded domino effect of the uncoordinated algorithm which the communication-induced was not affected by, indicating the unsuitability of uncoordinated checkpointing in cyclic stream processing.","Fault tolerance; Stream processing; Benchmarking; Checkpointing; Rollback recovery; Distributed systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

Nevertheless, most recent studies agree that hydrogen aircraft would underperform their kerosene counterparts in terms of operative empty mass and specific energy consumption. The main cause for the drop in performance lays in the fuel storage, as not only the liquid hydrogen has to be kept in cryogenic conditions and pressurised, but for the same energy content, it has four times the volume of kerosene. The inevitable consequences are an increase in fuselage size, which adds mass and drag to the aircraft, and the addition of an heavy fuel storage and distribution system. On the other side, hydrogen has 2.8 times higher specific energy, and the consequent reduction in fuel mass could balance the previously mentioned drawbacks. Literature on the topic shows that the optimal fuel storage solution depends on the aircraft mission, but most studies disagree on what solutions are optimal for each aircraft range category.The objective of this research was to identify and compare possible solutions to the integration of the hydrogen fuel containment system on short, medium and long-range airliners. The capabilities of an automated synthesis program for CS-25 aircraft have been expanded with validated structural and thermodynamic physics-based tank design models, to allow for the design and analysis of liquid hydrogen aircraft. Studies were performed on several design options. The effect of using an integral tank structure was found to be negligible for short-range aircraft, but increasingly more beneficial for medium and long-range aircraft. The effect of increasing the fuselage diameter was found to be favourable, especially when seats abreast could be added without the addition of one aisle. The effect of using a combination of an aft and a forward tank was found to be detrimental in terms of operational empty mass, beneficial in terms of specific energy consumption and negligible in terms of maximum take-off mass. The use of spherical tanks was found to be slightly beneficial, but only when compared to a non-spherical tank version using the same tank layout, non-integral tank structure, and same cabin layout. The study on the venting pressure revealed that with increasing aircraft size the optimal venting pressure in terms of main aircraft performance decreases whereas the sensitivity to those same parameters to the choice of venting pressure increases. The use of direct gas venting as a means to contain the pressure rise did not appear to provide significant performance improvements. The optimal designs, in terms of operational empty mass, maximum take-off mass and specific energy consumption, feature increased fuselage diameters, the use of the aft &amp; forward tank layout, non-spherical tanks and no direct venting. The short-range aircraft uses non-integral tanks and high venting pressure, while the medium and the long-range aircraft benefit from an integral tank structure and a lower venting pressure. Nevertheless, the sensitivity to these design choices is not significant, meaning that with a different set of assumptions and/or requirements different design choices may become optimal. The overall best performing LH2 aircraft for the short, medium and long-range categories were found to have respectively 8%, 24% and 22% higher operative empty mass, -2%, 1% and -5% higher maximum take-off mass and 5%, 13% and 5% higher specific energy consumption than their kerosene versions.","Liquid hydrogen; Aircraft Performance; Initiator; Aircraft Design; Hydrogen Tank","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

Therefore, as a road service provider under the Ministry of Public Work and Housing, they aim to achieve a high maturity level in public infrastructure asset management (PIAM) practices. It is done by improving the current Bridge Management Systems (BMS) 1992 guideline. However, managing such a vast network is challenging. The limited human resources in quality &amp; quantity hinder Bina Marga and Balai to strive for reliable data and adequate routine maintenance. Inspired by Indonesian collectivism, the study explores local community involvement to improve bridge data quality and adequate routine maintenance, i.e., BMS x Locals. Its objective is to recommend Bina Marga to improve the current BMS practices through a BMS x Locals guideline. The study sketches the current state of BMS, identifies drivers in outsourcing locals, identifies the type of works and groups, identifies locals’ willingness to be outsourced, and generates situational strategies. The research question is formulated as: How can the local community be involved as the external resources to assist Bina Marga’s in Indonesian Bridge Management Systems (BMS). This study uses interviews and desk study to collect data on six Bina Marga &amp; five Balai NTB officials, and five locals in West Nusa Tenggara province. In addition, various data analyses are performed, consisting of Causal Loop Diagram (CLD), Multi-criteria Decision-Making Analysis (MCDA), SWOT &amp; TOWS analysis. The study results and the BMS x Locals guideline have been validated by a high-level Balai official. For the result, CLD reveals that Bina Marga is struggling for a high PIAM maturity level because of the absence of specific quadrennial strategic planning (RENSTRA) and limited human resources in BMS, making them unable to obtain reliable data and perform adequate routine maintenance within a year. It also identifies Bina Marga’s drivers to outsource locals: up-to-date data monitoring, additional human resources, economy, and public engagement. The MCDA, amounting to 4 analyses, identifies nine criteria: cost, time, bridge literacy, technological literacy, labouring skill, quality, continuity, level of education, and age. Such criteria generate inventory and condition data – conducted by local university elements and cleaning works (garbage, rubble, grass, and drainage) – by locals in the municipality’s list. Locals’ willingness to be outsourced is also unveiled through CLD, consisting of economy, i.e., additional income and knowledge &amp; local pride. Moreover, SWOT &amp; TOWS analysis identifies 11 strengths, 12 weaknesses, 9 opportunities, and 10 threats for BMS x Locals; and generates situational strategies (maxi-maxi: 7, maxi-mini: 7, mini-maxi: 6, and mini-mini: 7).

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Cities are growing, leading to challenges to keep cities sustainable, liveable and accessible. In Europe, passenger mobility is focused on personal car usage, making parking availability an essential and challenging subject in development projects. The required parking capacity is determined based on parking standards, indicating the minimum number of spots developers need to construct. High parking standards result in an oversupply of parking places in urban areas. Literature advocates to implement context-specific parking standards that depend on the local conditions of the residential area. However, these studies neglect the visitor parking standards while in practice an oversupply is often observed. This research aims to identify factors that explain the visitor parking demand and what this means for the visitor parking standards. The developed conceptual framework showed that visitor parking demand depends on the demographic characteristics of the visitor, the geographic and policy factors at the residential area of the visitor and the demographic, geographic and policy characteristics at the residential area of the host. The usage of visitor parking permits in Eindhoven was used as a proxy for visitor parking demand to estimate a multiple regression model. The results showed that age, population density, distance to the city centre, housing characteristics, accessibility to public transport, and parking supply at the residential area of the host influence visitor parking demand significantly. Characteristics of the visitor and policy factors at the parking area could not be considered due to lacking data. The results show that visitor parking standards could be determined based on the local conditions of the parking area rather than as a fixed standard applied in all development projects.","Residential parking standards; Visitor parking demand; Visitor parking standards; Parking policy; Multiple regression","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

They appear in the observation of any illuminated surface. Specular reflections can be set apart from the diffuse reflection type, which has a random distribution of reflection directions. The radiance of the specular reflected light is governed by the Fresnel ratio and depends on both geometrical and spectral properties. A clear distinction can be made between the reflection properties of dielectric and the much more reflective non-dielectric material types. In certain cases the presence of specular reflections is useful, for example in object identification or computer graphics applications. However, often the presence of specular reflection causes bright spots on the image of an object, which results in loss of detail in these areas. Particularly in computer vision applications it is important to only observe the intrinsic diffuse reflection. Hence, a variety of specular reflection removal methods have been developed. Color-space analysis specular reflection removal methods are able to accurately recover the intrinsic diffuse color of the image of an object. Optimization based methods based on a non-negative matrix factorization of the data are considered. The reduced characteristic representation of the data allows the specular and diffuse reflection component to be separated more easily. A multi-image approach is considered because it provides more available information on the intrinsic diffuse reflection component, which is typically a relatively weak signal for non-dielectric surface reflections. A specular reflection removal method is developed, that combines a new reflection model for colored illumination with a sparse Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) optimization in a multi-image framework. The proposed method is evaluated on synthetic data and real data images of non-dielectric materials acquired conform the proposed reflection model.","specular reflection; surface reflection; optimization; image processing; computer vision","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(mentor); Blok, K. (mentor); Lammers, Martijn (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","While the expected rise of electric vehicles (EVs) in The Netherlands could attenuate climate change, new challenges arise.; one challenge is that large-scale penetration of EVs could increase system costs. Specifically addressed is the integration of the EV in the Dutch local grid system: (1) the charging infrastructure and (2) the distribution grid. This thesis introduces the highly efficient Solar Electric Vehicle (SEV), the Dutch Lightyear One, as an alternative for the conventional Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV). A SEV is less dependent on the system by its low energy consumption and its integrated solar roof. This thesis aimed at uncovering the differences between the SEV and the BEV to explore to what extent SEVs could reduce the system costs of BEVs in the future energy system. The system integration costs were derived from an approximated load curve of an existing Agent-Based Model that modelled the local electricity demand system in urban, suburban, and rural neighbourhoods. A scenario in 2050 is exploited comparing a 100% BEV fleet with a 100% SEV fleet. The results showed that in a winter week, the SEV reduces the maximum required charging infrastructure up to ~3 times; a belonging cost difference of ~€8 billion was estimated until 2050. The difference is caused by the prognosed Dutch charging behaviour that is influenced by the smart charging strategy; and the low electricity consumption and electricity solar yields of the SEV accounting for respectively ~66% and ~34% of the cost reduction. In contrast to the charging infrastructure, the difference between the SEV and the BEV in grid impact was slightly visible in the peak loads. However, the difference is not significant enough to require extra grid reinforcements for the BEV compared to the SEV; no difference in costs for the grid was presented. In conclusion, an estimated total system cost saving of ~€8 billion caused by the reduced charging infrastructure requirement, was presented in this thesis. In this research, many assumptions were made to approximate the future load curve and the system costs of electric mobility. Due to sensitive parameters, the system costs measured are solely applicable to the scenario that is presented in this thesis.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

(graduation committee); Keijser, Esther (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","We have come to a point in time where we can no longer just vision, but must act. We are talking about the transition from waste to material. The normal course of business around raw materials is a heavily environmentally polluting business, which contributes to global warming. In 2015, 196 countries signed the Paris Agreement, agreeing to a plan to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees. The Netherlands also contributed to this and translated this into its own Climate Agreement. In this agreement, attention is paid to the transition to a circular economy in order to limit the dependence on new raw materials. Circular craft centers are part of this circular economy. Points that replace the recycling centers and where material reuse is central. The clients of this graduation project are the BUCH municipalities: Bergen, Uitgeest, Castricum and Heiloo. These municipalities are faced with an extremely high level of bulky residual waste per household, which must be reduced to 5 kg by 2030. This thesis focuses on connecting local socio-economic entrepreneurs to the material flows in order to reduce bulky residual waste. The transition to a circular economy is not so much a technical challenge but a social one: how do we connect the necessary parties? Local entrepreneurs are key partners in this. Together with them, we are looking at the possibilities of setting up circular initiatives around the material flows. In addition to establishing a link between the entrepreneur and the material flow, this thesis examines the possibility of a circular network: a group of entrepreneurs who support each other in setting up circular businesses. To set up this network, a participatory approach has been designed in which circular capacities and collaborations are central. This approach consists of three layers, inspired by the Open4Citizens project, creating 1) Immediate value for the participants, 2) Tools for supporting the participants and 3) An network of actors. Setting up the network has been a research through design process, in which design questions were answered with a design that was immediately tested. Over a period of 3 months, local entrepreneurs participated in this project and met, talked, formed first collaborations and exchanged circular ideas. Worksheets were designed for the sessions in which this took place, which were improved or supplemented on the basis of the output. In this way a twofold design was made as a result of a participatory process with local entrepreneurs. Firstly, a vision for a circular network in the BUCH municipalities has been designed, with a name, website, shape and vision for the future. Second, a Circular Community Startkit was designed based on the formats used in the project. The aim of this starter kit is that the process can be repeated in the BUCH municipalities, but can also be applied in other regions. The start kit consists of an overview of the process and six worksheets in which circular activity is stimulated. By using this starter kit, municipalities can inspire local entrepreneurs to start circular business during a participatory project. The start kit ends with an exit phase in which the facilitator hands over the baton to the participants.","Participatory City Making; Delft Design Labs; Circulair Centrum De BUCH; Municipality; circular economy (CE); De BUCH gemeenten; Participation; Toolkit; Circular Collaboration; Network design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); de Jong, W. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Because of the expected growing implementation of large scale water electrolysis, an apparent opportunity arises to implement systems in which the by-product oxygen is harnessed by using it as a raw material in another process. This is also known as an oxygen synergy, an example of industrial symbiosis.<br/>A procedure to design and evaluate the performance of this kind of systems was devised by following guidelines of chemical process design and systems thinking. The method starts by defining the system’s spatial and temporal boundaries as well as a design goal. Then, it is further described by determining the systems’ elements, inputs and outputs, as well as its operation mode. All this information comprises the initial design space and, is organized in<br/>a graphical representation also known as a superstructure of options.<br/>Taking into account the socioeconomic environment of the energy transition in the Netherlands between 2020 and 2030, this methodology was used to design an industrial cluster with two oxygen producers and four oxygen users. This consist of an Air Separation unit (ASU), a Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) electrolyzer, an Auto-Thermal Reformer (ATR), an Oxy-fuel combustion power plant (OXFC), as well as two gasification processes: one for H2 production (referred to as B-to-H2), and the other for methanol synthesis (referred as<br/>B-to-MeOH). Additionally, the option of importing or exporting O2 to another location is added. Then, this initial set of options is translated into a Multi Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem with the help of Linny-R, a graphical specification language to solve optimization problems. The MILP includes both capital and operational costs (also referred to as CAPEX and OPEX), and aims to select a configuration that yields the highest benefits.<br/>Furthermore, three different scenarios were devised to evaluate different techno-economic conditions. The scenario PEM 2020 includes current CAPEX and OPEX for the electrolyzer, while PEM 2030 examines the effects of lower costs expected for this technology. Furthermore, the scenario Small ASU, analyses the effects of having a smaller O2 production capacity in<br/>the cluster. Because of the input and output prices selected, the selection the fist scenario just includes the ASU. However, for the PEM 2030, the electrolyzer is also selected, and the final configuration includes both O2 producers. For the final scenario, no process is selected.<br/>Then, when the output prices are varied, the topology selection changes. As when a product reaches a certain price, which is high enough to cover both the capital and operational expenses, the technology is present in the final configuration. These minimum selling prices are compared with reference values found in literature, to validate them. It was determined<br/>that model is able to roughly evaluate the operation and profitability of all the presented options, and thus can be used as a first evaluation method to discard options that are not economically attractive. However, the greatest limitation lies in the concept design phase, because the most optimal solution might not be included in the initial set of options.<br/>This process turned out to also be useful when comparing the effects of operating with and without synergies. For the cases evaluated, the benefits are higher when the main O2 provider is the PEM electrolyzer. In most of the business cases the obtained benefits are two times<br/>higher, than when the ASU is used. Furthermore, because of expected lower electricity prices and capital expenses for electrolysis’s, the business cases with O2 synergies are likely to be more beneficial in the future. As the only economically attractive option for current techno-economic data is a synergy to produce H2 via ATR. <br/>Finally, a relationship between the O2 price and the minimum H2 required price to invest in an electrolyzer was found for techno-economic specifications, one for the year 2020 and one for 2030. At low H2 market prices, the benefit from selling O2 improves the business case for the electrolyzer. This correlations can be useful for further oxygen synergies research, or industrial gas suppliers and electrolyzer suppliers, who want to render appeal to their business cases by finding synergy opportunities. If the devised methodology is further developed it can be used to model the oxygen demand and supply between various clusters, or find other opportunities in which an industrial symbiosis might be economically attractive. Furthermore, the effects of other external effects can be also modeled. For example, the variation in raw material prices or a policy to<br/>reduce CO2 emissions. Though it still needs to be further tested, it has been proven that the superstructure model can be used as a first evaluation method to discard options that are not economically attractive, and to evaluate different configurations with and without operating<br/>under industrial symbiosis.","Synergies; Techno-economic potential; Electrolysis; MILP optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Many countries lack awareness about psychological disorders and there is a scarcity of good mental healthcare facilities available globally. Medical practitioners recognise depression by analysing the patient’s behavioural patterns like speech levels, facial expression, body language and language patterns during therapy. Previous research has shown that behavioural studies are effective means for depression recognition. To explore this relationship, the automated depression recognition dataset called Distress Analysis Interview Corpus (DAIC) was evaluated. This dataset was chosen as it consists of paralinguistic (vocal), linguistic (verbal/text) and extralinguistic (visual) features from the dyadic interviews between participants and a virtual human. Prior research has evaluated the relationship between paralinguistics, linguistics and depression but many researchers failed to analyse the relationship between personality and depression for the DAIC database. The present study explores how different paralinguistic and linguistic features and personality types differentiate between high and low levels of depression. This study was exploratory in nature and used the LIWC software for linguistic and personality analysis, Pandas software for pre-processing the audio and text data files and lastly correlational analysis using JASP software to answer the research questions. The main findings concluded that linguistic features like emotion (sad and negative), feeling and health related words are used most often by depressed people. Additionally, paralinguistic features like high pitch and breathy voice as well as the personality trait neuroticism were characteristic identifiers of depressed people. These results showed that linguistics, paralinguistics, and personality traits help in depression recognition. These research findings have the scope for broader and cross-disciplinary applications in the future. Further research and development for automated detection technologies is required in the field of behavioural studies, to enable people globally to easily access and use artificial healthcare platforms for mental health diagnosis.","Depression; Personality; Linguistic; Paralinguistic; Correlation Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

Open innovation aims to build mutually beneficial relationships among corporate that can lead to competitive advantage. The market benefits by getting new and improved products faster, and the organization benefits financially and gains brand recognition. Although open innovation has its benefits, it comes with many challenges, the first being the organizations' readiness towards engaging in open innovation. Humans are the essential resource for open innovation in an organization. If organizations want to be successful in their open innovation objective, they need to manage human resources strategically. Open innovation has significant challenges; using strategic human resource management, organizations can navigate the challenges and benefit from open innovation. This paper has identified a relationship between collaborative human resource management practices and open innovation. HR focuses on strengthening the employees, teams and managers capability towards open innovation. HR promotes a change in leadership, culture, and engages in employee skill development. HRM has less to do with management making decisions to engage in partnerships but rather focuses on creating an open innovation mindset in the managers and promotes open innovation in the organisation. The paper has done a multi level analysis and found that HRM can promote a cultural change towards open innovation, affecting employees', teams and managers abilities and decision-making towards facilitating open innovation. To develop a culture of open innovation, open innovation must be addressed in the organization mission and vision. This will create a collective sense of purpose within employees and management. HR can further organize collaborative HRM (CHRM) practices that can develop unique skills and capabilities required for open innovation. Moreover, CHRM practices have been found to affect the management mindset towards open innovation and improving their leadership, knowledge sharing and risk-taking abilities - making them open to the idea of engaging in partnerships. CHRM practices affect the skills of the employees; together, they can affect the ways employees source and share knowledge from within and outside the organisation and help them create an open mindset. It can also help them learn how to build mutually beneficial and long-lasting relationships. There is a strong focus on teamwork based abilities and skills, which affect open innovation culture. Collaboration is a significant behavioural attribute for open innovation. These skills correspond to improved knowledge and skill sharing, sourcing and relationship building as well. The thesis has identified effective practices that can develop the skills and capabilities of employees and shift the organizations focus towards open innovation by moving towards a cultural change. Cultural change can be achieved by addressing the communication and relationships between employees and management. Open communication of the success and failures of partnerships need to be addressed. Sharing these stories will encourage employees to also engage in such activities. A framework to measure the open innovation performance of an organization has been proposed. A set of qualitative and quantitative indicators has been identified to help organizations measure their open innovation outcome. The study identifies that to CHRM practices can develop the capabilities of employees in an organisation and achieve a cultural change towards open innovation .

(mentor); Stikkelman, R.M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The Dutch economy is at present largely driven by fossil fuels, including the chemical industry. To achieve the goals set by the Paris Climate Agreement, the industry needs to decarbonise by switching to renewable sources. However, the industry faces many barriers in this climate transition. This research analyses the Dutch chemical site Chemelot, one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the Netherlands. Chemelot uses primarily natural gas and naphtha as energy and feedstock resources. Currently, a debate is ongoing on Chemelot whether electricity or hydrogen should be the main focus of replacing fossil fuels and raw materials, as these are the most potential eco­innovation alternatives. These eco­innovations pose a technology battle for dominance. The site users on Chemelot need to make decisions now, which will have consequences for both society and firms in the future. There are multiple types of factors that affect eco­innovation adoption. This study created a new framework that distinguishes Technological factors from Non­technological factors because it is desir­ able to gain early insight in both: Technological factors so that the decision can be based on what benefits best for the future industry and society; Non­technological factors to identify barriers and op­ portunities in time and how to deal with these. The Non­technological factors are distinguished between External and Internal factors, with External factors reflecting the environment in which a firm operates and Internal factors considering firm­specific characteristics. The objective of this study is therefore to identify relevant factors that affect the adoption of eco­innovations with the ultimate goal of decarbon­ ising the Chemelot site. Hence, this research aims at answering the following research question: What drives the technology battle for eco­innovation adoption on Chemelot? This exploratory and descriptive research investigated Chemelot as the main unit of analysis. It is a single and embedded case study design. This research started by reviewing the literature regarding the topics of technology battles, technology dominance, adoption, barriers in the chemical industry, and eco­innovations. Based on the literature review, a framework was made containing factors that affect eco­innovation adoption. Additionally, factors were added to the framework based on conversations with experts. The framework was then validated by interviewing experts and conducting a Best­Worst Method analysis. The Best­Worst Method is a suitable Multi­Criteria Decision­Making tool when eval­ uating multiple factors when objective metrics are lacking. Experts were asked to indicate the factors according to relevance with regard to eco­innovation adoption in the chemical industry. Additionally, the weights indicated by the participants were normalised using the Best­Worst Method to compare the factors. In total, 14 participants participated in the semi­structured interviews with questions to gain deeper knowledge about the technology battle between eco­innovations on Chemelot. The site users on Chemelot have to make decisions for eco­innovations now, which will have con­ sequences for future society and industry. Since the consequences of the eco­innovation choices are influenced by both Technological and Non­technological factors, this research created a new frame­ work of factors affecting eco­innovation adoption. This research found that the sub­factor Regulatory Pressure is the most relevant in the set of Non­technological External factors. In the Non­technological Internal factors, Firm’s Strategy is found to be the most relevant sub­factor, closely followed by Firm’s Management. In the set of Technological factors, the sub­factor Capex is found to be the most relevant factor. The normalised weights of all the factors show that the Non­technological External factors are the most relevant factors for eco­innovation adoption for the Chemelot site. Furthermore, the Techno­ logical factors appear to be equally relevant as Non­technological Internal factors because they hardly rank higher. The results from the conducted interviews show that experts define a successful energy &amp; raw ma­ terial transition when the environmental impact of greenhouse gasses is reduced while simultaneously maintaining employment, innovation, economic welfare, and adding value to society. The barriers the site users face on Chemelot to reduce environmental impact are: cross­sectoral collaboration among actors, sufficient availability of renewable energy and raw materials, lack of effective policy, high degree of integrated plants and processes, differently aligned strategies of the site users compared to Chemelot’s, increasing pressure by lobbies and society, a failing market always that proposes fossil technologies as the cheapest option rather than providing sustainable eco­innovation alternatives mak­ ing investment difficult, and the lacking or insufficient infrastructure. The opportunity Chemelot has are: the high degree of integrated plants because they offer synergies, advanced R&amp;D facilities, the innova­ tion and knowledge centre Brightlands Chemelot Campus, and highly experienced and knowledgeable experts. The technology battle between eco­innovations on Chemelot is twofold. For the heat­generating application, the technology battle is fought between hydrogen and electricity. The direct use of elec­ tricity is much more efficient for this application, because energy losses during the initial conversion of electricity to hydrogen are avoided and because no flue gases are released that contain energy when generating heat from electricity. Nevertheless, hydrogen technology for this application is being pushed by the actors, despite the fact that it is a less favourable alternative. This could have serious consequences for Chemelot since this is a much more expensive alternative. Furthermore, this research concluded that the technology battle for dominance is fought between the incumbent technologies and eco­innovations rather than between hydrogen and electrification. Both electrification and hydrogen are indispensable technologies required in this climate transition but will depend on the application. Moreover, site users continue to maintain their fossil assets while this is expensive and greenhouse gas emissions reduction is limited. They are reluctant to switch to disruptive eco­innovations because of the aforementioned barriers. Continuing the investments, in turn, raises the barrier for the site users to adopt eco­innovations due to the longer payback periods. Delaying the adoption of eco­innovation can be explained by the lack of a positive business case. The business case is reflected by the Technological factors Capex, Opex, and Efficiency, and is in­ dicated as a prerequisite. This affects the intrinsic motivation of the site users, which is reflected by the Non­technological Internal factors. However, site users are motivated by external pressures such as regulations, subsidies, market pressures, and rising emission taxes, which are reflected by Non­ technological External factors.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(mentor); Blok, K. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In the Netherlands, it is envisaged that hydrogen will play a crucial role in the energy transition. Especially in this heavy industry, hydrogen will become essential to make this sector sustainable. In general, three types of hydrogen are used: grey, blue, and green hydrogen. This study focuses on green hydrogen, as it is produced without CO2 emissions and therefore complies with the climate goals of the Netherlands. Using green hydrogen in these industries is useful because it can accomplish easy and cost-efficient significant reductions in this sector. However, some stabilizing pressures (stabilizing pressures), such as the suppliers' lack of a business case and there are more, hinder this transition and keep the incumbent regime based on fossil fuels in position. Fortunately, some destabilizing pressures (destabilizing pressures) stimulate the transition, such as the Paris Climate Agreement. Policy instruments can stimulate these destabilizing pressures and overcome stabilizing pressures. To get the transition started, the Dutch government will have to deploy policy instruments. For the Dutch government, it is currently unknown which policy instruments can accomplish this. The aim of this research is to conduct an analytical framework to assess policy instruments on the identified pressures and give an advice to the Dutch government which policy instruments should be deployed. Two streams of literature are combined into an analytical framework that can assess policy instruments to answer this research question: the transition literature and the economic literature. The outcome of the case study of the heavy industry in the Netherlands is the identification of six stabilizing pressures. The first is a lack of coordination as the necessary policies and regulations are not yet to facilitate the transition. Furthermore, there is no business case for green hydrogen yet. Next, the learning process has to be stimulated, as the development of the technology is moving slow. To foster the transition, it is crucial to have powerful actors involved. At last, a hydrogen market has to be established to accelerate the transition. Also, one destabilizing pressure is identified: the industry sector has a lot of hydrogen experience, which positively influences the transition. These are the pressures on which the policy instruments will be assessed in this research. The following policy instruments will be assessed on their contribution to transition: a higher national CO2 price for the industry sector, Carbon contracts for Difference, a subsidy of the supply, a subsidy for demand, and a financial contribution for the construction of the infrastructure. These are the policy instruments that will be assessed by the identified pressures. It is advisable for the Dutch government to deploy a policy mix of multiple policy instruments to impact all identified pressures positively.

Crowd-Shipping is one such concept which aims at taking advantage of regular travellers with unused space and additional time who can pick up packages, in order to deliver packages to customers who lie along or near the same route for a small compensation. Since the Netherlands has witnesses massive e-commerce growth and demand for efficient and fast deliveries, this study aimed at how Crowd-Shipping can potentially be implemented in the Netherlands through considering a set of drivers, barriers and a business model innovation perspective. The study first investigates the existing research on the concept, focusing on the drivers, barriers and business model aspects. In order to explore these findings and potentially more or findings, we conducted the methodology which consisted of interviews and surveys. Post the interviews and surveys, a thorough analysis of the findings was conducted through content analysis, descriptive statistics and correlations.

The form this infrastructure will take is uncertain due to the wide range of charging technologies available (and many more in the pipeline) and varying policy instruments. These influences make it difficult to find consensus for designing a public infrastructure. A literature study identified the following two research gaps: (1) insufficient studies investigated combinations of technical innovations and policy instruments to improve the success of public charging infrastructure, and (2) the perspective of the CPO is undervalued in current literature. To overcome these gaps, a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) was conducted to find possible combinations of technical innovations and policy instruments the CPO can implement to improve the success of public charging infrastructure. This way, the MCDA supports the CPO in making infrastructure design decisions.","charging point operator; electric transport; Multi-criteria decision making; public charging infrastructure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

(mentor); Schulte, F. (mentor); van Oort, N. (mentor); Saibene, Giorgio (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The COVID-19 pandemic poses an unprecedented challenge for the public transport system. The capacity of the transport system has been significantly reduced due to the imposition of social distancing measures to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. People remain skeptical about the use of public transport and prefer alternatives for their transportation as the likelihood of the virus spreading through public transport is high. Therefore, new avenues to increase the resilience of public urban mobility need to be explored. This research proposes the integration of the bike sharing system into the existing public transport system to compensate for public transport demand under the disruptive impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. To achieve this, a two-part methodology is developed. The first part concerns the development of a mathematical model for the demand integration of the two systems. The demand for the public transport system, which cannot be serviced by the system due to the distancing measures (distance of 1.5 meters between passengers), is considered as unsatisfied demand and is the new additional demand for the bike sharing system. The second part concerns the development of an optimization model for the design and operation of a bike sharing system with features that can cope with the mobility needs of the pandemic. These features of the bike sharing system are the mixed fleet, i.e., the system will provide the mode options of bike and e-bike, and the hybrid in its design, i.e., the bike system will be a free-floating system while the e-bike system will be docked. The developed methodology is applied in the case study of the Milan city in Italy. The two studied systems are the subway system and the public bike sharing system of Milan. For the implementation of the developed methodology, three demand scenarios and fifteen designs that reflect the needs of the bike sharing system are created. The parameters that differ in the designs are the number and location of the new (virtual) stations, the number of the maximum number of available bikes in the virtual stations of the bike system and the capacity specifications (number of docks) in the e-bikes stations. The selected locations of the new (virtual) stations in the designs are close to subway stations with unsatisfied demand. The obtained results show that 30% of the demand for the evening peak hour of the subway system in Milan cannot be satisfied due to distancing measures and that the current public bike sharing system can only compensate for 6% of the new demand (unsatisfied demand of public transport system and its own demand). However, the mobility capacity increases based on the system’s features. The separation of the bike sharing system into a free-floating bike system and a docked e-bike system increases the covered demand at least twice (2.1-2.4 times). Moreover, an increase of the capacity specifications of the e-stations and the available bikes in virtual stations by 60% brings an additional increase of the covered demand by 6.5-7.5%. Despite the increased mobility capacity of the system with the incorporation of the mentioned features, to fully cover the bike system demand it is needed 30959 bikes, while 20445 e-bikes are needed for 70% coverage of e-bikes demand. In addition, there is no limit to the available bikes per station and the maximum number of docks per e-station is 200. It is concluded that the bike sharing system cannot fully counterbalance for limited capacity in the public transport system. These findings contribute worthwhile insights into the mobility capacity of the integrated public transport system during the pandemic and where the operators of both systems should give emphasis.","Pandemic; COVID-19; Public transport; Bike sharing; Resilience; Linear Programming model; Milan","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-24","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

After the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, crowding has also been highlighted as a risk factor for catching Acute Respiratory Infections (ARIs) such as COVID-19 which has affected the demand of public transport. Several countries, including the Netherlands, have differential fare systems for peak and off-peak travel, however, the problem of overcrowding in trains is still prevalent and is expected to cause more disutility than before the pandemic. To reduce peak hour rush, change in departure time has proven to be an effective measure. In this research first a review of previous experiments related to valuation of crowding and departure time change is performed. And then an exploratory study based on a stated choice experiment is conducted to understand the extent to which people can be motivated to change departure time to avoid crowded trains during rush hours by offering them real time information on on-board crowding level and a discount on train fare. Unlike previous studies, the respondents are segregated into two groups before the start of choice experiment based on their indicated preference to schedule delay early or late. To study the change in travel behavior in the pandemic time, context of different vaccination stages is provided in the choice experiment. Background information collected in the experiment is broadly categorised as: socio-demographics, travel and work related factors, and attitude towards health and COVID-19. After the responses are analysed it is found that the coefficients obtained for main attributes are highly significant, and in line with previous research. When most of the people are vaccinated in the Netherlands, they may become less averse to on-board crowding. The research also indicates that certain groups of people can be motivated to change their departure time if real-time crowding information is provided to them. Few others can be motivated by offering incentives. However it should be noticed that to allow people to change departure time, policies such as flexible work hours and staggered commute are required in workplaces. <br","Public transport; Acute Respiratory Infections; Covid-19; Crowding in trains; Multinomial Logit; Latent class choice model; Departure time change; Schedule Delay; On/Off peak hours","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

Resonance modes caused by flexural elements in these machines are limiting the maximum bandwidth. Because of this, high-precision motion systems in industrial machines are limited in the maximum operating speed and precision. To improve the performance of these machines, an active vibration control (AVC) system is needed. In present scientific literature, all AVC systems consist of an under-actuated or perfect-actuated setup. However, the damping performance of these systems could be increased by implementing an over-actuated setup. In an over-actuated setup, multiple actuators are used to control one resonance mode. In this way, control inputs for suppressing modes are provided at more efficient locations, which increases the amount of damping. In this thesis, an over-actuation and over-sensing strategy for active damping is proposed. In this new method, a large number of piezoelectric sensors and actuators are used to control the first four vibration modes of a cantilever beam. The damping performance is evaluated in an experimental setup. Finally, the performance of the new topology of sensors and actuators is compared to the state-of-the-art active damping method that uses a perfect-actuation strategy. The improvement of the new method compared to the state-of-the-art method is shown both in time and frequency domain.","Active Vibration Control; Over-Actuation; Over-Sensing; Positive Position Feedback; PPF; Active Damping; Piezoelectric; Distributed Control; Decentralized Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

Even though radar data is a subject to multi-step processing, there are still several problems observed that can make the interpretation of the time-series difficult for users who are not experts in the radar remote sensing field.

A GUI is developed to collect expert knowledge in a form of assessing the time-series correctness, marking unwrapping errors, and dividing time-series into separate segments. This information is later used in the evaluation of several outlier detection and segmentation algorithms. We propose a supervised learning approach based on neural networks in order to use expert knowledge.

Traditional techniques to detect malware infections were not meant to be used by the end-user and current malware removal tools and security software cannot handle the heterogeneity of IoT devices. In this report, we design, develop and evaluate a tool, called NURSE, to fill this information gap, i.e., enabling end-users to detect IoT-malware infections in their home networks. NURSE follows a modular approach to analyze IoT traffic as captured by means of an ARP spoofing technique which does not require any network modification or specific hardware. Thus, NURSE provides zero-configuration IoT traffic analysis within everybody's reach. After testing NURSE in 83 different IoT network scenarios with a wide variety of IoT device types, results show that NURSE identifies malware-infected IoT devices with high-accuracy (86.7%) using device network behaviour and contacted destinations.","cybersecurity; network security; botnet; IoT; Internet of Things; Smart Homes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Cyber Security","",""

As such, its focus is on developing algorithms that can be used in the current communication systems to secure them against an adversary powered in the (near) future by a quantum computer. A code-based type cryptosystem is a public key cryptosystem that is resistant or slightly reduces its security level against attacks by the known quantum algorithms. The biggest drawback of this otherwise secure cryptosystem is its large public key. This thesis considers a specific type of linear codes, large minimum distance self-dual codes, and punctured codes derived from them that can provide the same security level as the original McEliece system with approximately a 30% smaller public key. Estimation of the bit security level of a cryptosystem using a small example of such a code for its private key confirms that increasing the minimum weight of the code significantly reduces the public key size of the system. Further, we determine the parameters of putative self-dual codes with a large minimum weight providing classical bit security of 80, 128 and 256 bits (quantum 67, 101, and 183 bits), respectively. For the parameters corresponding to the classical 80 bits security of the McEliece Cryptosystem, a particular example of a binary high minimum distance self-dual code is constructed. It is the first code of its type and length. A punctured code of this example is used for the private key of the McEliece cryptosystem. A new decoding algorithm is introduced, which is suitable for the specific construction of the new self-dual code. Moreover, we present a decryption strategy that decodes the complete code instead of the punctured private key. All this results in a McEliece type cryptosystem with 80 bits security classical (68 bits quantum) and reduced public key size of around 38.5% compared to the original system. Reducing the key size makes the quantum safe McEliece Cryptosystem more attractive for practical use.","Post-quantum cryptography; McEliece cryptosystem; Decoding; Self-dual codes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Cyber Security","",""

Green Hydrogen can be produced by the connection of a renewable energy source to an electrolyser which produces hydrogen, in this project the Photovoltaic (PV) System is indirectly connected to the electrolyser as this gives the ability to control the different systems and flexibility in sizing the different systems. Several different dc/dc converters are simulated in Matlab Simulink and compared to each other while also taking into account the project requirements. First, an overview of the project is presented after which the main idea of the thesis is presented in which the dc/dc converters are selected for optimal operation of the system. Two converters are selected based on simulations and mathematical calculations (Component sizes, Voltage ripple &amp; Current ripple), for the Maximum Power Tracking converter (Connected to the PV system) the buck-boost converter was selected. This was because of its ability to fully track the Current-Voltage curve of a PV system. And for the connection to the Electrolyser system a 3-level Interleaved Buck converter was selected, because of its increased reliability to be able to continue working after a power electronic switch failure. With the PV system maximum power point being between 580-582 V (depending on the irradiance) and a Electrolyser voltage range between 210 - 260 V, the voltage needed to be reduced. After selecting the different converters, a control system was modelled and simulated, this is to optimize and control the working points of the PV-Electrolyser system. This control system works on the idea of matching the electrolyser load working point to the available PV power from the input. This control algorithm selects the right reference voltage which then goes into a voltage controller to ensure the correct voltage is at the output for the electrolyser load. This control algorithm was modelled and simulated in Matlab simulink and tested against different changing inputs (Changing the irradiance &amp; electrolyser temperature). Furthermore, the controller was checked for several different stepsizes and time delays (accounting for external effects) and the optimal combination was found to be a stepsize of 0.1V and timedelay of 1ms which gave an Converter+algorithm efficiency of 98.42%.

This motivates the research on how neural network topologies encompassing spiking architectures can be configured on a neuromorphic hardware. In this thesis, a unique placement algorithm is devised to map diverse and complex neural network architectures on a connectivity-constrained array with thousands of processing elements(PEs) within seconds. Wide spectra of SNNs with varying complexity are investigated to evaluate the feasibility of mapping on the target neuromorphic architecture involving unique connectivity constraints. The performance of the proposed ALAPIN mapper is validated through time-to-solution for the surveyed SNN schemes with varying network sizes and diverse complexity measures. Experiments show that simple networks converge within 10 milliseconds. With limited resources and as the network architectural complexity increases, hardware constraints become overwhelming to achieve placement solution within a decent time frame. Further experiments are carried out to estimate the resource utilization of each candidate SNN for varying network sizes on target hardware. Liquid state machines use a greater number of synapses for a same number of neurons than the rest of the candidates, with approximately 100% neurons, 30% input resources, and 20% synapses on target hardware.","Mapping; Spiking Neural Networks; Neuromorphic hardware","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-01","","","","Electrical Engineering | Circuits and Systems","",""

Building Information Modelling or BIM is changing the way projects are developed and has introduced some changes to cost estimation. One of these changes is the possibility to generate semi-automatic quantity take-offs from BIM models, greatly speeding up the project quantification process. Furthermore, the concept of 5D BIM, or BIM with the addition of a cost “dimension”, aims to connect BIM and cost estimation. However, the participation of the cost engineer in BIM-based processes is still limited, and this actor frequently only appears at the end, to deliver single cost estimates. This study aims to observe and identify the possibilities of integrating cost engineers in BIM-based project development as a step towards reaching 5D BIM. The research is carried from a managerial and organizational perspective. The potential outcomes of the integration impact the process of cost estimation and other associated processes, namely project design and modelling, and project management and development. To conduct this study, a case study was carried out at a Dutch engineering company where interviews were carried out to respondents of different specialties. Activity theory was used as a theoretical framework for the analysis, discussion and development of a solution. Its use marks an interesting approach to the current problem as it provides the ground for simultaneous analysis of multiple activity systems to reach an integrative solution. The results support other studies that conclude cost engineers are detached from BIM-based project development. Furthermore, the results show that the integration of cost engineers in BIM-based project development has mainly positive potential outcomes for cost estimation and associated processes. It is, however, also concluded that at its current state BIM instruments alone are not fit to handle all information relevant to cost estimation, namely non-graphical elements. The research concludes that to achieve positive results from integration of cost engineers, it is required, a) 5D BIM specialized software, b) appropriate integration of actors in project development, and c) adoption of standards, mainly for development and use of three key tasks. The final deliverable of the research is a collaborative framework which is intended to provide the ground for the integration of cost engineers in BIM-based project development, aimed at reaching 5D BIM.","BIM; 5D BIM; Cost Estimation; Cost Engineer; Activity Theory; Information Management; Project Development; Integration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have emerged as an effective method for policy learning in partially observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). However, a major drawback of RNN-based policies is the difficulty to formally verify behavioural specifications, e.g. with regard to reachability and expected cost. In accordance with previous work, we insert a quantized bottleneck network (QBN) to the RNN that learns a mapping from the latent memory states to quantized vectors, which enables the extraction of a finite-state controller (FSC) representation of the RNN. This FSC, together with a POMDP model description, constitutes a policy-induced Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) that allows us to use efficient formal verification methods. For the scenarios in which the FSC fails to satisfy the behavioural specification, the verification method generates diagnostic information in the form of critical examples. These critical examples can be used to re-train the RNN and extract an updated FSC. In particular, we consider the synthesis of policies with formally verified satisfaction of behavioural specifications in uncertain POMDPs (uPOMDPs), where the uncertainty is expressed by polynomial parameterizations of the transition and/or observation probabilities. The uPOMDP describes a set of possible POMDPs that can be used to express imperfect knowledge of the environment, e.g. because the POMDP is an abstraction of real-world dynamics. Our goal is to learn and extract an FSC that has the best worst-case performance among all possible instantiations of the uPOMDP. To this end, our approach iteratively determines the POMDP among the uPOMDP set that is most critical for the extracted FSCs with respect to the specification under consideration. This POMDP reflects the model for which the FSC requires most improvement, and is thus used to retrain the RNN. Although applicable to any linear-temporal logic (LTL) specification, we test our implementation on benchmark problems with expected cost specifications. Our results suggest that our approach is able to extract well-performing FSCs for uPOMDPs where long-term memory is required.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To scale up the quantum dot arrays, one of the major challenges is the wiring bottleneck, as a high density of control lines might need to be integrated into a small chip. A proposal to solve this problem is using the shared control protocol, in which multiple qubits could be controlled by a shared line. For this, the most critical requirement is to realize uniformity across the quantum dot array, such that a single control signal could lead to an identical response in all dots involved. However, such uniformity is hard to achieve due to the variation of the device fabrication, and tackling this problem via materials and fabrication optimization only appears to be a daunting challenge. <br/><br/>In this thesis, we propose a potential solution to achieve uniformity of threshold voltage in such share-controlled systems. This solution is based on the hysteresis behavior of turn-on voltage in the heterostructure field-effect transistor (HFET) devices hosting the quantum dot array. In the Ge/SiGe HFET devices with hole as carrier, we found that the drift of turn-on voltage can be caused by population of 2DHG under negative gate voltage and reversed by applying positive gate voltage. We attribute this effect to trapping and detrapping processes on the dielectric surface of the device. Following this discovery, an automatic feedback control program was designed, in which gate voltage pulses are applied to control the trap filling level such that potential landscape in the device corresponds to the desired turn-on voltage. Using this program, we performed deeper investigations of the turn-on voltage shift including its relaxation and history-dependent stability. A hypothetical physical model for observations in these experiments is followed. For practical application of this effect, the feasibility to locally define and control the turn-on voltage is also demonstrated. Based on these results, we present a proposal for addressable manipulation of potential landscape in share-controlled quantum dot array, which might potentially realize the threshold voltage uniformity for scalable quantum dot array in the future.","Semiconductor Quantum dots; Heterostructure field-effect transistor; Quantum Computing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Under pressure of climatic change, urbanization and economic development, freshwater resources are becoming scarcer. These pressures combined with outdated infrastructure, pose a giant challenge to the Greater Maputo Region to meet their water demand in 2050. This report aims at identifying and analyzing pathways, using stakeholder preferences, that support SUWM and bear the potential to close the supply-demand gap in 2050. <br/><br/>This report utilizes population and demand forecasting to determine the gap between future supply and demand. Hereafter, alternative technical, social, and environmental methods to augment the Greater Maputo Region’s water supply are identified through a literature study. Furthermore, two distinct methods are used to develop scenario’s that augment the supply demand gap. The first being a technical analysis using multi-criteria decision analysis and the second a serious game that is to be played with stakeholders. At last, these scenarios are used to develop a framework that is technically feasible and approved by stakeholder opinions in the serious game.<br/><br/>It was found that the population of the Greater Maputo Region will grow from 2,8 million in 2017 to 6,9 people in 2050. Furthermore, under the pressure of economic development, population growth and urbanization, water demand increased from 9 million m3/day in 2017 to 22 million m3/day in 2050. This increase in demand, in the case of a business-as-usual scenario, amounts to a deficit of 1,2 million m3/day in 2050. The sector that consumes most water is agriculture, followed by industries and households. Furthermore, under climate change precipitation decreases over time whereas temperatures increase. Especially during the dry period, more evaporation and less rainwater is expected, highlighting the need for alternative water supply methods to ensure a steady availability of water. <br/><br/>Alternative methods that support SUWM such as dams, stormwater harvesting, rainwater harvesting, wastewater reuse and desalination were found to be most suitable approaches to augment the Greater Maputo Region’s water supply. However, it was also found that these approaches are not very efficient without the right urban context and socio-political and economic measures. Economic and social-political measures should incentivize water savings and fair distribution. <br/><br/>Two distinct methods were used to create scenarios to close the Greater Maputo Region’s supply demand gap. The first, multi-criteria decision analysis showed that that in the case of a high weight attributed to the cost of approaches, rainwater harvesting, stormwater harvesting, and dams are the most suitable options given the selected criteria and their respective rank. Whereas in the case of a low weight of the cost, wastewater reuse, stormwater harvesting, and rainwater harvesting are the most suitable. The second, a serious game that mimics the WASH situation in the Greater Maputo Region which showed that players focus on sustainable, circular, solutions, but that they are hard to implement because of financial limitations. <br/><br/>Ultimately, this report indicates that both decision analysis and serious gaming provide valuable insights for enhancing water supply in an urban context. In this report, both methods indicate that there is a preference for circular (sustainable) approaches. Such an ideal, circular, and sustainable, water system in the Greater Maputo Region, was found to be supported by decentralization of the water sector. In this case, decentralization of the water sector to a neighbourhood scale shapes niches for sustainable water supply approaches and within these niches, the local context of the neighbourhood determines the type of water supply infrastructure that is most suitable. Furthermore, the technical approaches are to be supported by socio-political and economic measures. Altogether, a combination of SUWM supporting approaches supported by political and socio-economic measures can close the supply-demand gap in 2050.<br","Sustainable urban area development; Serious Game; Stakeholder engagement; Water Management; WASH; Global South; Mozambique; Maputo","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","","-25.953724, 32.588711"

A number of representative undesirable scenarios was defined, and the behaviour of the GNC system, specifically guidance, was evaluated for these scenarios. This work formulated mitigation strategies, required on multiple occasions.

However, due to aggressive scaling, this pursuit has been challenged by the test escapes due to latent gate oxide shorts, despite of being subjected to voltage stress testing using Pseudo Stuck-At test patterns to screen out potential latent gate oxide shorts. This demonstrates an uncertainty that has been prevailing in the semiconductor testing industry, ‘are we stressing enough ?’. Also, the complexity of digital circuits combined with the test time requirements makes 100% fault coverage an unrealistic target. Therefore, to ensure a high screening effect, the most primitive need is to know how many transistors are really experiencing the stress and how to preclude stress test escapes. This thesis presents a novel solution to optimize the voltage stress methodology in digital ICs which can be subdivided into three methods. First method, ‘Critical Thickness Model’ answers the question ‘are we stressing enough?’ by finding out the minimum stress time for n and p type MOSFETs having their gate oxide thickness in sub-3nm range. Second method, ‘Stress Coverage Quantification Algorithm’ shows the real defect coverage by finding out the percentage of transistors being stressed by each pattern and by whole pattern set. And, third method, ‘Coverage Maximization Algorithm’ minimizes the chances of customer returns due to gate oxides shorts by minimizing the test escapes. The optimality of stress is considered to be based on criticality of the application and the considered case is of automotive grade ICs. Critical Thickness Model is elicited from Thinning Model and Direct Tunneling Model and deals with elimination of early product failures. It is shown how Critical Thickness Model calculates minimum stress time for latent gate oxide shorts and hence minimizes yield loss. Stress Coverage Quantification Algorithm (SCQA) has been applied to real dataset of a test chip for Pseudo Stuck-At test pattern set and the simulation results when compared with ATPG calculated coverage for the same test pattern set showed a coverage loss of 5% at transistor level. Coverage Maximization Algorithm (CMA) is based on Greedy algorithm and was also applied to the real dataset of the same test chip and the simulation results yielded an approximately 10% of reduction in the occurrence of stress test escapes. This thesis also discusses over how, effectiveness of screening can further be enhanced by having stress aware pattern generation and presents advantages and drawbacks of under-stressing and over-stressing.","voltage stress; stress coverage; defect activation; stress time; burn-in","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-08-23","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

Decarbonizing the heating sector that is globally responsible for half of total energy consumption is necessary to achieve climate-neutrality goals. The complex nature of the heating sector (characterized by variable market demands, and complicated stakeholder networks) has resisted the stakeholder alignment necessary to develop sustainable heating solutions. Co-creation provides a viable solution - a governance structure characterized by multiple, semi-autonomous centres for decision-making. There is little insight, however, into co-creation strategies in the field of sustainable heating. State-of-the-art literature indicates the need to explore the theoretical underpinnings for co-creation. Furthermore, if performed incorrectly, co-creation can result in the destruction of the public value and citizen rights it aims to uphold. The Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD)Framework provides a systematic method to analyze policy activities, over varying temporal, geographic and socioeconomic contexts. This body of research takes a novel approach in applying the IAD framework to understand the factors that aid and impede the development of effective co-creation. The framework demonstrates its efficacy in assessing both the process of co-creation and its outcomes. The IAD Framework was applied on qualitative data in the form of interviews and archival data from co-creation participants in four pilot cities that are part of the EU-Interreg 2 Seas Sustainable Heating Implementation of Fossil-Free Technologies project. Results show that supportive project management conditions such as stable funding, comprehensive planning support and the involvement of key stakeholders (actors) across the different stages of co-creation are vital for its success. The presence of community attributes such as shared values and goals motivate stakeholders to collaborate together. When actors who adopt the role of coordinators view co-creation favourably, they can use their administrative skills and social capital to bring together stakeholders in an effective manner to find solutions acceptable to all. Involvement of key actors in the initial planning stages is important to develop strategies that are tailored to specific communities. The presence of neutral actors such as research institutes is helpful across all stages and was shown to be vital in initiating co-creative strategies and facilitating supportive conditions for social learning. Furthermore, this study found that pre-existing governance structures between interacting stakeholders determines the pathway in which co-creation evolves. Pre-existing power dynamics, combined with the crucial role played by coordinators in the group, form patterns of interaction that tend to reinforce governance structures that do not allow for effective co-creation. Policymakers may benefit from the following recommendations - a) coordinators must commit to involving key stakeholders, including citizens, in all phases of co-creation; b) when co-creation is initiated by actors who are traditionally in authoritative positions in society, provisions must be made for capacity-building in other stakeholder groups. This study focuses on co-creation pathways when initiated by actors traditionally in powerful roles, in liberal democracies in Western Europe. Future research can focus on co-creation pathways when initiated in a bottom-up fashion. The development of co-creation in different political and societal settings merits further research.","IAD framework; institutional rules; co-creation; Sustainable heating; energy transition; Norwich; Fourmies; Mechelen; Bruges; SHIFFT; decarbonization; Implementation; Qualitative analysis; Interviews; citizen participation; stakeholder analysis; Social Innovation; Public sector innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-01","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","EU-Interreg 2 Seas Sustainable Heating Implementation of Fossil-Free Technologies (SHIFFT) Project",""

Users communicate and interact with others in the social VR environment through avatars, which are virtual anthropomorphic characters that aim to represent humans in virtual worlds. In addition, the development of the HMD and commercially available motion capture systems enable the avatars in the virtual environment to detect and reflect the real-time motions, even facial expressions of people. However, the avatars still lack an indication of biofeedback - e.g., body temperature, breathing, heart rate, muscle contraction -, which serves as social cues for communication in reality. While some features, for example, emojis, supports users to express their feeling or emotions for richer communication, the missing information often results in miscommunication in the virtual space. It remains a barrier to a fully immersed experience in the social VR space. This project proposes a concept of visualizing biosignals of the avatars in the social virtual reality space for a richer-level interaction in virtual reality. With the technologies available to capture and reflect accurate biofeedback in real-time, we would like to explore ways and possibilities to map the bio states of the users in reality to avatars in the virtual world. The project starts with conducting user researches to understand the current user behaviors in the social VR spaces and their perspectives on sharing biosignals. Based on the requirements gathered from the user study, the scope of the project is narrowed down to a ‘watching entertainment’ scenario, and the ways to visualize biosignals on avatars were explored through a co-design session with designers. After that, four biosignal visualization techniques in two biosignals - heart rate and breathing rate - are prototyped under the VR jazz bar setting. Finally, the user study is conducted with 16 pairs (32 participants in total) to test and compare the effects of each biosignal visualization technique in watching entertainment scenarios with a companion. As a result, the embodied visualizations are the most understandable and least distracting visualization method among the four methods. Furthermore, the limitations of the research, recommendations on biosignal visualizations, and recommendations on conducting design research are provided.","Social VR; Virtual Reality; Biosignals; Avatar; Contextmapping; Co-design; User Research","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Pesch, U. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Universiteit Leiden (degree granting institution)","2021","Climate change is and will have a severe impact on urban areas. Dutch cities are actively searching ways for successful climate adaptation. One way to do this is by experimenting with sustainable innovations in urban living labs (ULLs). This is a place where different urban actors, such as governments, businesses, knowledge institutes and citizens, collectively experiment with innovative ways to solve urban problems in a sustainable matter. This collective experimenting is also known as co-creation. From the beginning of the COVID-19 measures in 2020, ULLs are facing difficulties regarding co-creation as a result of the measures that are taken for social distancing. Furthermore, these social distancing measures affect the social cohesion in communities, and therefore most likely also in ULLs. The relationship between social cohesion and ULLs has not yet been studied extensively, and the COVID-19 measures give an opportunity to understand ULLs in a new way. Therefore, this thesis aims to answer the following research question: What is the relationship between social cohesion and urban living labs in times of COVID-19? The research methodology consists of expert interviews and a single case study research in ULL Reyeroord+ in the neighbourhood Reyeroord in Rotterdam. The expert interviews are conducted with five experts that are active in five different ULLs in the Netherlands. The case study research consists of document analysis to understand the aim and activities of ULL Reyeroord+, as well as interviews with citizens of Reyeroord. The research data is analysed using a social cohesion framework that subdivides social cohesion into the quality of social relations, identification with the social entity, and orientation towards the common good. Overall, the experts believe that regular physical contact, a long-term relationship, having an equal mindset, involving citizens in decision-making and experimenting, and taking a qualitative approach are perceived as being the most important for a successful ULL. From the citizen interviews became clear that problems of violence, waste and parking are experienced as priority problems in the neighbourhood and that they are, together with the experienced deterioration of the social situation, seen as ‘pauperisation’ or ‘degradation’. It appears that most citizens have other priorities than climate adaptation, for example in terms of income. This could impact the social cohesion, as it can affect people’s willingness to take part in civic engagement and social networking. The communication between actors in Reyeroord+ were impacted by the COVID-19 measures, as meetings were organised online. Furthermore, the COVID-19 measures have impacted citizens’ involvement in the neighbourhood, mainly by increasing the awareness of people’s surroundings. This has most likely affected the community attachment of citizens. It is possible that this increased awareness will have a positive impact in the future. Furthermore, social cohesion and ULL Reyeroord+ are connected through the development of a new way of communicating that deviates from the current top-down approach, and through the development of a sense of ownership among citizens. ULL experiments are therefore not only sustainability experiments, but also an opportunity for actors to learn how to approach citizen engagement and to develop a new way of communicating with citizens that could ultimately be beneficial for climate adaptation in urban areas. The results are debated on the basis of several discussion questions. The main limitations for this research lie with the research methods, which are not as ethnographic as was anticipated due to the COVID-19 restrictions, and the social cohesion framework, which is susceptible for subjectivity. The scientific contribution is the social science approach in the field of ULLs, which builds on existing literature. Implications and recommendations are given for the municipality and the citizens as actor groups. Finally, it is suggested that further research on citizens’ role in co-creation processes would be valuable for future research.","Urban living lab; Social cohesion; COVID-19","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

Due to the limitations in the state of the art flexible colonoscopes specialized maneuvers are required in order to allow the colonoscope to travel into the colon and reduce colon stretching. This thesis proposes a novel self-propelling mechanism designed to enhance the current flexible colonoscopes allowing for a better completion rate and fewer complications in colonoscopies. Methods: First an analysis was made of the fundamental types of propulsion and how well they could be used for locomotion inside the human colon. In order to determine the conditions the design has to meet a list of requirements was made. A wide variety of concepts were considered, which were then reduced to the three most promising concepts. These concepts were further developed and out of these, the most promising design was chosen. This design was adjusted in order to create a proof-of-principle prototype which was used to validate the design and give new insights into the type of self-propulsion used. Results: The prototype is able to perform locomotion in all tested tube/instrument diameter combinations, including tubes with a significant larger diameter than the instrument. Furthermore, the prototype is also able to perform well in tubes with an irregular shape and with a conical shape, both with and without lubrication. The effect of added weight to the tubes was also investigated and showed no significant effect. The efficiency of the prototype, as determined by the slip ratio, showed no significant variation during these tests. Discussion and Conclusion: The proof-of-principle experiments demonstrated that the design is capable of performing locomotion in the tested scenarios with better than expected efficiency. The lack of significant variation of slip ratio in tubes with a larger diameter than the prototype itself were unexpected and could significantly change the design of future iterations of the instrument. The issues which came up during the experiment gave new insights into the working of this type of locomotion which were used to make recommendations for future iterations of the design and recommendations for further tests, which could be performed to investigate unexplained results. The current design meets all the requirements set out for it and gave valuable new insights which will be useful for future iterations of the design making it a good first step towards developing a better colonoscope.","Bio-inspired; Mechanical; Friction; Soft Robotics; self-propelled","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

The overall objective is to verify the stage-stability requirements set for the Matrix-machine with regards to FIV by observing the induced cooling forces. This requires measuring in 6-DOF, over a wide frequency range (10-300 Hz) and at a very low noise level (e-11 N^2/Hz). Most challenging for this design is to be able to observe the FIV while in the presence of a variety of dominant environmental disturbances. The final design consists of a mass-optimized triple mass-spring-damper (MSD) system, weighting 828 kg. It uses six low-noise piezoelectric force transducers to observe the 6-DOF reaction-forces exerted by the modules. These modules under testing are supported by the piezos through custom designed stiff-flexible struts with a high axial/radial stiffness ratio. This improves measured signal and protects the piezos from damaging bending moments. This sensitive part of the measurement setup is isolated from floor vibrations by a double MSD Vibration Isolation (VI) platform (granite stones on airmounts). Acoustic shielding has been achieved by a custom designed enclosure that disconnects at the bottom granite stone. Flow vibrations in the supply tubing are discharged at various stages. Water flow is provided under constant pressure and flow rate by a hydrostatic pressure vessel. This prevents measuring distinct resonances from asynchronous motor characteristics inherent to a centrifugal pump. Verification measurements have been performed showing a noise floor characteristic at the level of the theoretically predicted effect of all disturbances combined (2.5 e-11 N^2/Hz). The main findings of this study are: - when aiming to measure very low-level dynamic reaction forces (0.35 microN-rms) in the presence of dominant disturbances that transmit through parasitic stiffnesses, quartz piezoelectric sensors proof to be a better solution when compared to (seismic) accelerometers. - flow vibrations induced in supply tubing can have a significant impact on the measured signal, if the stiffness train that connects the sensor with the measurement setup is relatively low. An effective method to minimize this disturbance is to discharge the bulk of the input to different stages of the vibration isolation platform, if present. - of all disturbances, environmental acoustics have shown to be most difficult to shield. The most effective means to reduce its effect is to fully enclose the sensitive part of the measurement setup and to rigidly connect this casing to a heavy mass with an attractive transfer path to the sensor e.g. the bottom stage of a two MSD VI platform. - when measuring direct forces using sensitive piezoelectric sensors that cannot withstand transverse loading / bending moments, stiff-flexible support struts with a high axial/radial stiffness ratio (roughly &gt; 500) are found to be a solution. Concluding, the design process detailed in this thesis describes a method on how to effectively design a low-level reaction force measurement system, while in the presence of a variety of disturbances. In the report, generic design guidelines are listed that can serve as a reference to others when aiming to measure low-level FIV.","flow induced vibrations (FIV); mechanical design; measurement system; acoustics; floor vibrations; Vibration Isolation; Piezoelectric transducers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-24","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

The recurring cost model for AM developed in the study has shown reduction in cost of the concept when compared to the existing components produced in a low-cost country.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The last 20 years has brought with it a surge in efforts toward the Red Planet as the next frontier is human space exploration draws closer. Many concepts have been proposed for a sustained human settlement on Mars, with NASA’s ISRU-to-the-wall campaign identifying the need for a shuttle vehicle between theMartian surface and a station in an orbit around the planet. Two such vehicle concepts have been designed: the Charon by Gaffarel et. al. and Hercules by Komar et. al.. However a Multidisciplinary Design Optimisation (MDO) has thus far not been applied. In this research an MDO is employed for the same mission scenario as the Charon vehicle’s. The vehicle must transport 1200 kg, including 6 crew, to a 607 km circular orbit at 44.96± inclination from the Martian base that is located at 42.5± North and 25.5± East. It must then return to the base, its entry beginning at 80 km altitude at a velocity of 3500 m/s. The MDO in this research is performed by dividing the design of the vehicle and its trajectories into various disciplines, which are optimised in parallel. In reality cost commonly is the dominant factor that drives the design, in this case, the vehicle’s Gross Take OffWeight (GTOW) is taken as the objective. Estimating the cost of the Martian shuttle vehicle within reasonable accuracy is exceedingly difficult, as not only is its realisation still decades away, costs such as the shuttle’s transportation to Mars, its operational costs, and its maintenance costs are very hard to estimate. However, a vehicle’s GTOW is directly influential on its cost, and its reduction is therefore the optimisation’s goal. The disciplines within the optimisation are the vehicle’s geometry, mass, aerodynamics, and ascent and descent trajectories. Constraints are set for both the vehicle and its trajectories, to which the design must adhere, and the performance of the design is determined by a fitness function that ensures the reduction of the vehicle’s GTOW. The optimiser itself is written using Tudat software, a set of C++ libraries developed by the TU Delft. As the same mission scenario is taken for the vehicle in this research as that of the Charon vehicle, the Charon design can be directly compared to that of the optimiser. TheMDO is able to significantly reduce the vehicle GTOW, obtaining an optimum solution of 146.2 tonnes, which is more than 20 tonnes lighter than Charon, at 168.1 tonnes. The greatest reduction in mass is found in the ascent propellant mass, which is the greatest contributor to the GTOW. This reduction is mostly due to the lower maximum Thrust to Weight (TW) ratio used in the MDO. Other scenarios are also investigated and their effects observed. Two other target orbits and rendezvous strategies are tested, namely the same as the Hercules vehicle (108 km pericentre altitude and an eccentricity of 0.0178), and a direct ascent to the orbital node at a circular 500 km altitude orbit. The Hercules vehicle scenario proved to be by far the most GTOW-preferable, with a GTOW of only 103.0 tonnes. The GTOW of the MDO solution found for the Hercules scenario is also less than that of the Hercules vehicle design, which is 162.8 tonnes, however the Hercules vehicle transports a payload mass of 5750 kg as opposed to the MDO’s 1200 kg, therefore the mass reductions cannot be solely attributed to the optimiser performance. It is clear from the results that the altitude of the initial target orbit is the greatest factor contributing to the GTOW, with a reduction in both payload mass andMartian base latitude also shown to reduce the GTOW. Neither an increase in the maximum acceleration constraint, nor a change in ascent thrust profile, were shown to have any benefit on the GTOW. The sensitivity of the optimum design with respect to uncertainties is assessed. The final pericentre and final eccentricity are both most sensitive to the final pitch node value, especially when taking interference with other variables into account. The inclination, however, was almost solely influenced by the first pitch angle value. The latitude and longitude are also almost solely influenced by a single variable, namely the flight path angle, and the final velocity and final pitch angle are both highly volatile to all variables when interference effects are taken into account. TheMDO model as a whole is found to be sensitive to changes in both aerodynamics coefficients and propulsive efficiency; an increase in aerodynamic coefficients adversely affects the GTOW, and an increase in propulsive efficiency benefits the GTOW, and vice versa.","mars colonization; Mars; Multidisciplinary Design Optimization; Single-stage-to-orbit; Reusable vehicle; Shuttle vehicle","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-08-24","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

It does so only using a single input channel to which a single harvester can be connected. The proposed system is able to differentiate between the two source types and adjust the power converter configuration accordingly.For the DC sources, a novel switched-capacitor power converter (SCPC) is proposed, that is able to convert the energy from a harvester that has a maximum power point (MPP) output voltage of 170mV to 5V and a maximum power point output power of 10uW to 50mW. This DC-DC converter offers 119 different positive voltage conversion ratios, with a maximum voltage conversion ratio of 16, using four in-package capacitors. As a result of this high number of conversion ratios, the MPP output voltage of the harvester and the input voltage of the power converter are matched accurately, causing the harvesting efficiency to be very high. A maximum harvesting efficiency of 96.2% is found in simulations. For the piezo element sources, the concept of a flipping-capacitor rectifier (FCR) has been adjusted to work in harmony with the designed SCPC. In a steady-state condition, the capacitors of the SCPC reach specific voltages, such that they can create evenly spaced voltage steps for the flipping operation. With this technique, a voltage flipping efficiency of 0.9375 and a theoretical maximum output power improvement rate (MOPIR) of 32 can be reached. Due to losses in the system, simulation results show a MOPIR of up to 20.0, which is still significantly higher than the state-of-art. The system is designed to work with harvesters with a piezo capacitance of up to 100nF, an excitation frequency of 1Hz to 200Hz and an equivalent FBR maximum power point output power of 1uW to 50mW.

The oversized hole clearances allow for the reuse of all the structural elements in composite structures. Due to larger hole clearance, the possibility of slip occurrence in the connection is higher and hence there is a need to study the behaviour of resin and steel-reinforced resin (SRR) under cyclic loading. A custom made setup with 3 and 6 mm oversize that replicates the nominal bearing stress experienced by the resin in a double lap shear joint was used to study the behaviour of the resin/SRR under cyclic loading. The slip obtained from cyclic loading is extrapolated for 5 million cycles to check if maximum slip exceeds the failure criterion of 0.3 mm and slip range exceeds the failure criterion of 0.1 mm over 5 million cycles. Numerical modelling was done to see if the results (initial stiffness) obtained from the experiments can be replicated by the material models for static and one cycle loading with the help of a reasonable friction coefficient between the steel and resin surfaces. Good sets of results were obtained for all the tested stress ranges. On extrapolating to 5 million cycles, resin specimens with 3 mm hole clearance failed at a stress range of 200 MPa and resin specimens with 6 mm hole clearance failed at a stress range of 150 MPa. SRR specimens with 6 mm hole clearance failed at a stress range of 200 MPa.

(mentor); van Wingerden, J.W. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Technical University of Denmark (degree granting institution)","2021","To meet current renewable energy demands, there is a major increase in global wind power capacity. Wind turbines are commonly clustered in wind farms. When operating, wind turbines extract energy from the wind, creating a region characterized by a low velocity, called the wake. The wake negatively impacts the power production of downstream wind turbines. This power loss can be alleviated with wind farm control, where an upstream wind turbine deviates from optimal individual operation to improve the power production of the total wind farm. A novel wind farm control concept is dynamic induction control. While the results of dynamic control look promising, the working principles behind the increase in energy are not yet well understood. This thesis provides a framework to evaluate the transport of kinetic energy into a cylindrical control volume in a wind turbine wake using the instantaneous Navier Stokes energy equation. This approach can provide insight into the time behaviour of kinetic energy transport and can be used in conjunction with the Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes energy equation. The wake is analyzed using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition to identify the dominant phenomena. The working principle of dynamic induction control is qualitatively described by dividing the wake into three regions: region I, dominated by pressure, region II, dominated by a vortex ring and region III, dominated by turbulence. The peak of transport of kinetic energy occurs in region II, as is confirmed by analysis through the instantaneous Navier Stokes energy equations. Finally, this thesis shows that for a simulation with uniform inflow and where the effect of the nacelle is not modelled, the transition from region II to region III is triggered by the interaction of the vortex ring with an inner vortex ring that forms around the nacelle wake. The nacelle wake is a result of not modelling the nacelle and deemed non-physical, so the ring vortex breakdown location that arises from this simulation does not have much physical meaning. While there remains a lot of work to be done, this thesis confirms the potential of dynamic induction control shown in previous research. A particularly interesting aspect of dynamic induction control shown in this thesis is that a high amount of wake recovery is compressed into a short distance in the order of $3D$. This property makes dynamic induction control a potential way to decrease turbine spacing in wind farms, allowing the placement of more wind turbines on the same area.","Wind Energy; Wind farm control; Dynamic induction control; Proper Orthogonal Decomposition; Entrainment; LES; Wake recovery; Actuator Line Method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","",""

High water usage, water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and textile waste are all negative impacts on the environment coming from the textile industry (European Parliament, 2021). These negative impacts are especially rising due to the impact of fast fashion, however workwear also plays a role in this. Workwear is often made out of durable fabrics which are discarded before their functional End-of-Life (EoL), therefore having greater negative impacts (ECAP, 2017). This report shows the research done on the sustainability of the Flamebuster2 Nordic Coverall from Trital Safety B.V.. This coverall is an all-round piece of work clothing used in several industries. Research was done into the context of this kind of clothing and in-depth information about fabrics and processes was collected. A fast-track Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was performed to assess the environmental impact of the Flamebuster2 Nordic Coverall. The LCA showed that the biggest environmental impact comes from the cultivation and production of cotton and the dyeing of the fabric. From this LCA, design fundamentals were setup to guide the redesign process. These fundamentals are: design for longevity, design for low maintenance, and design for recyclability. Together with a user survey, these design fundamentals shaped design challenges which had to be overcome for a redesign. These challenges were: fabric alternatives, dyeing of the fabric, towards a mono material, and sustainable treatments. Based on extensive research and testing, design solutions were found for the challenges. Together, these solutions create the redesign of the coverall: the Flambebuster2 Eco Coverall. The Flambebuster2 Eco Coverall is made out of hemp fabric, which is dyed in an eco-friendly way. This significantly lowers the environmental impact, but still makes sure the coverall is durable. All other parts are either biobased or made from recycled materials, and the labels are digitally printed. All together this almost eliminates half of the environmental impact of the coverall and reduces the CO2 footprint from 12 kg to 8 kg. Besides, it opens up new EoL options for the coverall. Next to that, the life cycle of the Flambebuster2 Eco Coverall has become more circular. On the one hand because the coverall is for 96% biobased, which almost closes the CO2 loop. On the other hand, an app was designed to give users more information about the coverall, and about the EoL options and implications. A prototype was created to test the Flambebuster2 Eco Coverall in practice. The prototype was used to assess the comfort of the coverall, and to see the impact of industrial laundry on hemp fabric. It was found that the coverall shrunk about 10% after laundry, because the fabric was not preshrunk at the right temperature. The industrial waterproofing treatment also did not work, therefore impregnation during production is needed. The comfort of the prototype is found to be higher that the comfort of the original Flamebuster2 Nordic Coverall. Since the Flambebuster2 Eco Coverall is not 100% circular yet, some recommendations were written. Future possibilities and other insights were presented to help the development of future coveralls.","Circularity; Textiles; Natural Materials","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

A drawback of these models is that they can be computationally expensive with run times in the order of hours or days depending on the time and spatial resolutions. In this study we explore the use of deep learning techniques in a surrogate model for 2D flood simulation. We propose and test a deep learning-based surrogate modelling framework that can be used to train a deep learning-based surrogate model. Once trained, the surrogate model can be used as a substitute for the hydrodynamic model with the advantage of being much more efficient in terms of run time and can be of great value in for example crisis situations. For training, a data set of expensive 2D hydrodynamic simulations was created using the SOBEK software program. Such simulations require a lot of input data, such as input parameter maps specifying the terrain over the computational grid and boundary conditions. To make training data-efficient, a sampling strategy was used for the input of the flood simulations. Three deep learning architectures were trained and tested. The first two architectures are feed-forward networks and the third architecture is of recurrent network type. These networks contain convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures with an encoder-decoder structure to make patch-level predictions of the flood characteristics in time. These patches contain a small section of the flood prone area and an encoder network is used to extracts coarse feature maps from this data that is then refined by a decoder network to create a prediction of the flood propagation. Using patches has the advantage of making a surrogate model able to create flood simulations over prone areas without restrictions on size or shape by tiling the output patches with flow predictions. Also it allows the surrogate to focus only on regions where the flood has reached and not on the regions where no water has arrived. It was found that with the recurrent architecture, the surrogate model was most capable of emulating the ground truth flood simulations in the test simulation. This trained network architecture was used in a case study where the surrogate was applied to create flood simulations in a small dike ring in the Netherlands. This shows that the surrogate modelling framework can be used to train a deep learning-based surrogate and, once trained, can be used to create flood simulations similar to hydrodynamic simulations. However, two main challenges were identified in using such data-driven deep learning-based surrogates. Firstly, keeping the predictions of the flood characteristics accurate enough to avoid large error propagation. Secondly, accurately generating large amounts of data from relatively little information present in the boundary condition and terrain.","Deep learning; Flood risks; Flood simulation; Hydrodynamics; Surrogate Modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Our work consists of two parts, an end-to-end 2D-3D lifting pipeline and a novel kinematic human model integrated approach. We start with Pose Estimation using TRansformer (PETR), an approach that does not require temporal information and has the attention mechanism to model the inter-joint relationship from RGB images. In the approach with human model, we emphasize pose similarity rather than focusing on joint detection. We propose a new metric, called Mean Per Bone Vector Error (MPBVE), that evaluates poses regardless of a human body’s gender, weight, or age. We introduce Pose Estimation on Bone Rotation using Transformer (PEBRT), a novel approach that regresses rotation matrices for 16 human bones, assuming labeled 2D poses as input. Our human model encapsulates joint angle and bone length constraints. Existing methods treat these constraints as an additional loss term, which does not guarantee realistic final out- puts. Our method does not require temporal information or receptive fields to generate kinematically realistic human poses. We demonstrate that PEBRT is capable of delivering comparable results on Human3.6M to existing methods.","Human Pose Estimation; rotation estimation; Transformer; CNN; kinematic modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Their aim is to make water transport more attractive for travelers by allowing the introduction of sustainable water modes to increase the use of the already existing water infrastructure instead of extending the road networks. In parallel with the common used large scheduled passenger ships, supporting on-demand water transport could be offered on a smaller scale in order to cope with fluctuating off-peak demand or to serve a specific target group, such as tourists. One way to set this up is by using on-demand water-taxis, such as Seabubbles. Seabubbles are small zero-emission (hydrogen) hydrofoil ships that can transport four to fourteen passengers depending on the type. The deployment of Seabubbles in water transport can be compared to Uber-taxis that are used in road transport. Since waterborne transport does not usually provide door-to-door transportation, the main challenges of introducing on-demand Seabubbles lie in their safe and practical integration into the surrounding urban area and transport network. The water hubs where the Seabubbles dock should seamlessly connect the waterfront with the landfront and therefore play an important role in connecting the water transportation system with the road transportation system.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Ideally, this numerical simulation can replace empirical methods based on overtopping simulations and provide more insight into the physical process of an overtopping flow on a levee. This could prove to be useful for the design andmaintenance of flood barriers. Different interpretations of the stress tensor of pore water have each lead to distinct systems of partial differential equations. For each interpretation, the resulting system has been solved, using a finite element analysis in combination with a time-stepping method, in order to assess the validity of the imposed definitions. However, only one definition lead to a mathematical framework that yielded trustworthy results. In this finalmathematical framework, both the hydrostatic water pressure and the gravitational force have been disregarded, resulting in a system only consisting of variables such as soil particles displacements, pore water velocities and a distribution function »(t ). The distribution function »(t ) represents the fraction of the exerted wave stress on the surface carried by the pore water. By definition, the fraction can vary over time, which stands in contrast to state of the art models. The applicability of the results is limited, since the problem is simplified to a one-dimensional setting in which only normal stresses are exerted. The mathematical framework could theoretically be extended to multiple dimensions. However, it remains contestable whether it sufficiently simulates the physics in a levee. Further research is needed to show whether the extension holds when shear stresses are present and whether the same distribution function »(t ) can be applied to non-axial directions. In conclusion, this research is a proof of concept and serves as a stepping stone for more research.

Data capture the characteristics of any entity around us, like living species, properties of scientific experimentation, etc. Moreover, data provides a basis for further analysis, reasoning, or decision-making. One of the most common applications of data analysis is to group data into a set of clusters to understand the underlying structures of a given data set. The classification system can be either supervised or unsupervised, depending on whether it assigns a data object to a discrete value from a finite value list or unsupervised or unlabeled categories. In unsupervised classification, also called, clustering no labeled data is available. State-of-the-art clustering algorithms are developed in a broader sense without targeting any specific applications. Further, they are used in a variety of application domains. However, because these algorithms lack domain-specific information and user-specific input, they do not always produce relevant results. Also, categorical features in the dataset make clustering harder because they lack semantics. Moreover, unlike classification tasks that are evaluated using well-defined target labels, clustering is an intrinsically subjective task as it depends on the interpretation, need, and interest of users. The little notion of ground truth makes cluster validation harder in an unsupervised setting. Also, there is no universally adopted approach to choose features or clustering schemes. To tackle such challenges there is an increasing need for methods that engage humans in the clustering process to tailor it to specific application domains and allow it to continuously adapt to their preferences. Such an approach where we try to achieve better computation results using human knowledge lies under the hybrid intelligence domain. This thesis explores the possibility of designing an end-to-end clustering analysis workflow using hybrid intelligence. The thesis aims to answer the following research question - How can we use hybrid intelligence in cluster analysis workflow to generate user-specific clusters and evaluate them? We try to answer the research question by introducing multiple novel methods that aim to solve the following challenges: evaluating clusters, creating semantics in categorical features, and performing user-specific cluster analysis. We apply the developed methodologies on real-time financial data to cluster small and medium (SMEs) sized Dutch enterprises. By our experimentation, we can observe that we manage to cluster Dutch SMEs as per the user-specific goals based on their financial behaviors. We believe that we achieve such results by creating semantics in the categorical features. The clustering results are further analyzed from a user requirement perspective. Our proposed cluster validation game enables us to validate cluster objects using human intelligence. The associated experimentation results give us confidence in our hypothesis that hybrid intelligence is one of the solutions to solve the clustering challenges.","Hybrid Intelligence; Clustering; Unsupervised learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current WWTPs are designed for the removal of parameters like solids, nutrients, organic matter, and pathogens. For achieving a high-quality effluent, that enables reuse, it is important to also address the removal of micropollutants, particularly antibiotics, from the wastewater. Due to these antibiotics, antibiotic resistance spreads among the microorganisms and increases through various mechanisms. Antibiotics of sulfamethoxazole (SMX), trimethoprim (TMP), ciprofloxacin (CIP), and ampicillin (AMP) are known to be found abundantly in natural waters all across the globe. The abilities of an anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) of maintaining high SRTs with low biomass losses help in treating wastewater containing antibiotics. A recently developed technique of adding limited aeration to AnMBR has the potential of removing recalcitrant antibiotics by improving the performance of the reactor. Hence, this research aims to study the removal mechanisms of the antibiotics (SMX, TMP) and the persistence of corresponding antibiotic resistance in AnMBR, followed by the effect of the antibiotics on the performance of the AnMBR. In addition, antibiotics CIP and AMP were tested via anaerobic batch tests to investigate the effect of the limited aeration on their removal.<br/>After adding the antibiotics SMX and TMP to the reactor, no significant difference in COD and nutrients removal was observed. The biogas production was reduced slightly after the addition of SMX 150 µg/L initially, however, it increased back to the original state after few days. Total removal of SMX and TMP was 86% and 97% respectively in the reactor. Results showed that 85% of SMX and 94% of TMP were removed through biodegradation/biotransformation and 14% of SMX and only 3% of TMP were discharged through the effluent. From the adsorption batch tests conducted, it was observed that the linear adsorption isotherm fits well for TMP. With the increase in temperature, the adsorption potential of TMP was reduced with a Kd value of 1.234 L/g at 10˚C and 0.513 L/g at 37˚C. The removal of SMX was low through adsorption and high due to degradation and follows the first-order rate kinetics with a half-life of 1.71 days. After two weeks of SMX addition to the reactor, almost all the bacteria present in the effluent gained resistance either to TMP or SMX or both. Of all the ARGs measured in this study, the genes responsible for the resistance development were sul1 and sul2. The addition of antibiotics increased the presence of ARGs in the system. The correlation between the presence of sul1 and TMP resistant bacteria, and sul1 and SMX resistant bacteria was 0.91-0.93, indicating that the gene sul1 might be involved in multidrug resistance. ARGs sul1, sul2, and dfrA1 were removed respectively by 3.2 log, 3.6 log, and 7.3 log units by the membrane. In addition, the class 1 integrons and 16s rRNA were removed by 3 log and 3.2 log units respectively. Removal of CIP and AMP was found to be high with values of 82% and 84% respectively in limited aeration assisted anaerobic batch tests. The removal efficiencies of all antibiotics were more than 80% and independent of their initial concentrations in the selected range. The increase in the removal of CIP and AMP in comparison to literature points to a relation with the added limited aeration. Nevertheless, more studies need to be performed to establish this.<br","Antibiotic resistant bacteria; Antibiotics; Antibiotic resistant genes; AnMBR","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-23","","","","Water Resources Engineering","",""

The proposal clearly mentions that AI systems should make use of Explainable AI tools to increase transparency and interpretability.Financial institutions in the Netherlands are required by law to detect and monitor fraud in their infrastructure. Fraud detection in Financial Services (FS) or the FinTech industry is increasingly performed by Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Neural Network models that provide high classificationperformance. ML/ANN-based fraud detection systems that are necessary for maintaining trust in the Dutch financial system are classified as high-risk applications by the proposal for the EU AI act. The EU AI act will directly impact high-risk AI applications used within the EU markets, Therefore,the Dutch financial institution sponsoring this research wants to future-proof their ML-based fraud detection to improve transparency and trust by solving the model interpretability problem. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a domain of AI research that seeks to solve model interpretabilityproblems of black-box ML models. In this thesis research, proofs of concepts are demonstrated for the investigation of two XAI approaches - TreeSHAP &amp; Diverse Counterfactuals to improve the model explainabilityor interpretability of ML/ANN-based fraud detection systems. This research pioneers the investigation of Diverse Counterfactuals to improve model interpretability in ML/ANN-based frauddetection systems. Based on the existing literature, this is the first instance of research investigating Diverse Counterfactuals for generating explanations to ML/ANN-based fraud detection models trained using synthetic transaction datasets. Before demonstrating the proofs-of-concept, an extensive literature survey has been conducted to map the XAI research landscape, formulate an XAI taxonomy, and conduct a comparative analysis of XAI approaches to select and describe in detail, the relevant approaches for the use-case at hand. Subsequently, several ML and ANN models have been trained and tested using the PaySim synthetic transaction datasets. To overcome model performance challenges due to data quality issues and high class imbalancein the datasets, several experimentation scenarios involving hyperparameter optimization, SMOTE Oversampling and class-weighting have been investigated. Subsequently, two high-performing models (XGBoost &amp; MLP) from these experiments have been used to demonstrate the proofs of conceptsby investigating TreeSHAP and Diverse Counterfactual algorithms. TreeSHAP algorithm greatly improved the interpretability of the global and local model behavior of the XGBoost-based fraud detection models. Diverse Counterfactuals algorithm-generated diverse but unfeasible counterfactuals. Counterfactual algorithms suffer from computational inefficiency and therefore, further research has to be conducted to generate feasible counterfactuals. Future work on model explainability should also conduct a human-grounded evaluation of the explanations to evaluate the quality or goodness of the explanations.

The fact that they can be used as a top cell in a tandem perovskiteSi design further adds to their potential. However, for perovskites to be effective in the solar industry, scalability and stability must also be considered. For a long time, the stability of PSCs has been a major source of concern. Thus, it is important to observe the performance of perovskite carefully in laboratory to understand the behavior under realworld, and thus operational, conditions.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Aviation has a growing impact on the earth’s climate, due to its emissions causing an increase in the global near-surface temperature. In order to better understand the dynamics by which different aircraft types contribute to this global warming and how this can be mitigated, the impact of different aircraft categories is analysed and compared. These categories are constructed by dividing aircraft into groups with a similar number of seats. Two approaches are employed to assess the climate impact of these categories. First of all, a global aviation emission inventory is used together with a climate response model, to evaluate the temperature change caused by each individual category. It is found that in absolute terms the middle category with 152-201 seats, and the largest aircraft with over 302 seats will cause cause the largest temperature change by the year 2100, compared to 1940. At the same time, per amount of generated capacity in the form of available seat kilometres, the middle category shows the smallest climate impact of all, with the largest aircraft being the second worst. From historical positional data of aircraft, flight trajectories are identified, to which an aircraft performance model is applied. This leads to the conclusion that the optimal distance in terms of fuel use is »2500 km, with an increase in fuel burn for both longer and shorter distance flights. The NOx emission increases for increasing flight distance, due to higher thrust settings and a higher rated thrust of the engines used. Next to being able to fly longer distances, the three largest aircraft categories cruise at a higher Mach number, increasing fuel use and NOx emission. Additionally, by flying in a less busy airspace, such as above the Atlantic, the impact of contrails is larger for these aircraft, as there is a smaller atmospheric capacity to form contrails in these areas. Another reason that the largest aircraft perform worse is the higher level of comfort provided to the passengers. It is shown that increasing the seating density to maximum capacity leads to a reduction in fuel use and NOx emission per available seat kilometre especially for the largest aircraft, narrowing the gap with the smaller aircraft categories which already make use of a high density seating. Based on the outcome it is suggested to adjust the policies dealing with aviation’s climate impact, to reflect the differences between the impact of the different aircraft types. Additionally, a direct reduction in aviation’s climate impact can be achieved by making use of the most climate efficient aircraft type for a givenmission.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This goal combined with a long desired lifetime, makes that a compressor is developed that operates based on gas bearing technology.<br/><br/>The design is focused on two main subjects. Firstly, the load capacity of the gas bearings is significantly lower than oil lubricated bearings due to the reduced viscosity. To avoid mechanical contact and wear of the components this has been thoroughly analysed using finite element methods. The oscillating nature of the loads in the system enhances the squeeze effect from the Reynolds equation. Secondly, the sealing function of gas bearings opposing internal leakage is evaluated carefully to obtain a desired efficiency.

These aspects involve moving the end-effector such that its surface makes and retains contact with the object while also coordinating the movement of the gripper to securely grasp the object. This work investigates how the intricate task of grasping may be learned from humans based on kinesthetic demonstrations. Due to the complexity of the task, these demonstrations are often slow and even slightly flawed, particularly at moments when multiple aspects (i.e. end-effector movement, orientation and gripper width) have to be demonstrated at once. Rather than training a person to provide faster demonstrations, non-expert users are provided with the ability to interactively modify the dynamics of their initial demonstration through teleoperated corrective feedback. This in turn allows them to teach motions outside of their own physical capabilities. In the end, the goal is to obtain a faster but reliable execution of the task.<br/>The presented framework learns the desired movement dynamics based on the current Cartesian position with Gaussian Processes, resulting in a reactive, time-invariant policy. Using Gaussian Processes also allows online interactive corrections and active disturbance rejection through epistemic uncertainty minimization. <br/>The experimental evaluation of the framework is carried out on a Franka-Emika Panda. Tests were performed to determine i) the framework's effectiveness in successfully learning how to grasp an object quickly, ii) ease of policy correction to environmental changes (i.e. different object shapes and mass), and iii) the framework’s usability for non-expert users.","Interactive Learning; Robot Control; Grasping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In India too, some of the corporate houses have gone beyond the prerequisites of corporate governance in terms of investments and social initiatives to benefit a large chunk of deprived, vulnerable, poor and backward population and areas either directly or indirectly. While corporate governance aims to promote corporate responsibility, justice, and openness; social investments by corporations have helped to strengthen their overall brand image and business performance. A significant number of major corporations have established Trusts and Development Foundations to launch CSR initiatives. With the government's concentration on the manufacturing sector, the footwear industry's future potential seems bright, especially for established and organized firms. CSR has now been extended to the Indian Footwear industry as well. This sector was never considered in discussions, and the traditional approach to CSR is generally presumed to be the responsibility of other sectors and big companies. As a result, not a lot of research is done about the current CSR initiatives in the footwear industry. Since, the Indian footwear industry mostly comprises of small and medium enterprises, it has been difficult to find company’s financial statements or records to come to any conclusion. The companies face survival challenges, they have time and resource limitations, there is a lack of systematic incentives which makes it even harder for these footwear companies to enroll in CSR activities. Many Indian footwear firms are in the process of establishing themselves and do not have the staff or resources to address CSR concerns, therefore they prefer to neglect them, according to literature study.

As the field of positive design aims to design for human well-being, how may we design for spiritual well-being? As we address this question in a secular society, an opportunity is presented by a rise in practices that were not explored by traditional western religion but are indeed known to create experiences that are regarded as spiritual. For this graduation project, I looked at breathwork following the research through design methodology for my design process. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected students in a significant manner leading to increasing accounts of stress and even burnout. To address this, the design was aimed at TU Delft students. Embodying the research through design method, the final design is Project Vital presents Spiritus. Project Vital is research platform design researchers can use to produce knowledge about breath enabled experiences of which the first research through design artifact is Spiritus. Spiritus is a data-supported breath practice aimed at guiding the students of TU Delft on their journey towards inner peace. This practice is uniquely different as participants who start the practice, start the same with an understanding of how their mind and body respond to the breath through their data. This data is comprised of electroencephalogram (EEG) data and thoracic data (Expansion/contraction of the chest). While addressing spiritual well-being directly in a secular society proved to be difficult, inner peace, a component of spiritual wellbeing, resonated with the target group. Spiritus, here while addressing the target group also produces data, which is used to further knowledge about how breath-enabled experiences can be used to promote human well-being.","Data driven design; Positive design; Design for well-being; Spirituality; Research through design","en","master thesis","","","","","","http://www.project-vital.org This link will lead you to the website of the research platform developed during the course of this project: Project Vital The showcase for this project is the website of the research platform (www.project-vital.org).

(graduation committee); Veeneman, Wijnand (graduation committee); van Wee, G.P. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Covid-19 has disrupted social norms and economic stability across the world. As the virus disseminated across nations, researchers rushed to delineate the causes and the consequences of the spread of the virus. Early findings highlighted a concerning disproportionate impact of Covid-19 among ethnic minorities, which have been disproportionally victimized by the novel respiratory virus, with studies reporting up to 3.6 times the likelihood of infection for ethnic minorities compared to their white counterpart (APM Research Lab, 2021; USA Facts, 2020; Gross et al., 2020). Early studies indicated healthcare and socio-economic inequities as fosters of the pandemic and its discriminatory behavior. However, weeks into the pandemic, researchers also identified transportation as another significant contributor to outbreaks and as a contributor to the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 among ethnic minorities (McLaren, 2020). Although much research has been conducted in assessing the effect of Covid-19 and imposed social distancing on people’s travel behavior and vice versa (with contrasting findings), considerably less attempted to discover the role that different travel behavior - with a special focus on public transport - played in the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 among ethnic minorities (McLaren, 2020). The absence of studies, even more Netherlands-based that investigate the role of disparity in travel behavior in the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 suffered by ethnic minorities, and the moral obligation at contributing to the scientific community at unveiling the fundamental sources of ethnic disparity to attempt to outline a remedy to it, have encouraged the development of this study. In order to fill the research gap, this study seeks to provide an answer to the following main research question: ""To what extend disparity in travel behavior is influencing the disproportionate incidence of Covid-19 infections and deaths among ethnic minorities? And how can policy-makers and public transport providers best adapt public transport to future discriminatory health crises?"".<br/>The answer to the main research questions and the related sub-questions (Chapter 1.5), will be formulated through the combination of a comprehensive literature review, a statistical analysis through the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) technique, and with the execution of a policy analysis study. Firstly, the literature review will be used to develop an in-depth understanding of the Covid-19 implications on the multidimensional ethnic disparity experienced by minorities in the Netherlands and on the actual nature of this disparity in the Netherlands. Results from the literature review will be used as inputs for the conceptual model that will later function as the theoretical guideline for the rest of the study. The conceptual model will represent the theory and the logic backbone of the SEM analysis. Structural Equation Modeling is a statistical tool used in a wide range of fields, with a concentrated number of applications in the travel behavior field. It allows to analyze a researcher’s theoretical model and capture the causal influences of the indicated exogenous variables on the endogenous ones and the casual influences among exogenous variables (Golob, 2011). Results from both models confirmed the notion that, in the Netherlands, ethnic minorities are more likely to suffer from Covid-19 infections and related hospital admissions but are not more at risk of death compared to their Dutch counterparts. At the same time, unlike the initial hypothesis, both models showed that public transport does not represent a key driver behind the development of Covid-19 infections, death, and hospital admissions; instead, other socio-economic variables and, most notably, spatial variables could be considered significant drivers of the Covid-19 pandemic. Moreover, both models diminished the intermediating role of public transport in the relationship between ethnic background and Covid-19 records by demonstrating that the registered positive relationship between ethnic minority groups and Covid-19 variables can be sourced to their direct relationships and thus to something that might not have been included in the study. Therefore, travel behavior and the other intermediating variables such as socio-economic variables do not appear to contribute to the disproportionate number of Covid-19 implications among ethnic minorities. What the second model offers that the first does not is a deeper insight into how Covid-19 disproportionally impacts ethnic minorities. This model demonstrates that the registered disparity in healthcare outcomes varies between ethnic minority groups, showing the presence of disparity even within the ethnic minority segment of the population. <br/><br/><br","Travel Behavior; Covid-19; Ethnic Disparity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Sales forecasting is a management function that is affected by various organizational factors. The aim of this research is to validate a Sales Forecasting Management (SFM) framework to improve the sales forecasting performance in a high-tech industry and study the impact of forecasting on the organization’s business performance. The organizational factors such as sales compensation structure, product life-cycle stage of the company, information logistics, and cross-functional communication of the SFM framework are validated in the context of the high-tech industry. Further, the framework is quantified by developing an appropriate sales forecasting model. Both quantitative and qualitative forecasting methods are studied and the most appropriate technique with high accuracy is chosen. Finally, the effect of sales forecasting performance on a specific business outcome – End of Service Benefits (EOSB) is quantitatively measured. The EOSB is the gratuity payment received by the employees of the company when they are terminated or resigning from the job. It is a crucial operational expenditure that is proportional to the salaries earned by the sales employees and the accuracy in EOSB forecasts has an impact on the company’s stock price and investment decisions. The results of the research show that the accuracy in sales forecasts has a significant impact on the End of Service Benefits forecast. The research also finds that the SFM framework has to be adjusted to include the sales pipeline stages as an important organizational factor that influences sales forecasting management. Thus, the thesis provides an interesting insight to include the sales pipeline stages in the framework to improve the sales forecasting credibility. Finally, the SFM framework is evaluated, the impact of sales forecasting performance on a business outcome (EOSB) is quantitatively measured using a sales forecasting simulation model and the conclusions are derived.","Sales Forecasting Management; Framework; Forecasting model; End of Service Benefits; High-Tech Industry; Organizational factors; Cross-functional communication; Information Logistics; Sales Compensation Structure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

The linear economy is accelerating the environment pollution and increasing the use of resources. If we want to be able to gradually move towards a circular system it is vital to include in this strategy the way products are being cared for, which is Product care. Product care is an approach to use a product as a means to catalyze consumers’ care behaviour change. It does so in a user-in-control way (you wash your coffee machine regularly without any reminder), but also in a product-in-control way (the coffee machine will stop working if you don’t wash it on time). The control degree of the product care means the degree of consumer autonomy over product care behavior and the degree of product intervention on the user.<br/><br/>This project is aiming to explore what is the optimal balance between these two ways when they design for product care. This goal is reached by using the research-through-design approach.<br/><br/>In this study, three strategies of product care with different control degrees were formulated through analyzing and combining existing strategies from circular design and behavioral change design fields. Based on three strategies, six concepts were generated to test which strategies and control degree are most effective.

Moving towards a hydrogen economy can reduce greenhouse emissions produced from burning fossil fuels which is one of the biggest contributors to global warming and climate change. Hydrogen fuel has a high gravimetric density and being a clean fuel it has the potential to become a sustainable energy source for the growing market. However, its low volumetric density makes it a difficult fuel to store, thus making storage technologies in the hydrogen supply chain an important part. The current storage technologies, however, are impeded by shortcomings such as low hydrogen densities, extreme pressure and temperature operating conditions and inefficiencies during the storage process. Combining existing hydrogen storage technologies such as compressed hydrogen gas and metal hydrides with 2D materials comes across as an excellent option as they can complement each other in their functioning. In this regard, borophene is considered a viable material for hydrogen storage due to its lightweight, good thermal, mechanical and electrical properties. Most of the studies performed so far on hydrogen storage in borophene were on hydrogen physisorption via weak van der Waals forces. In this thesis work, the chemisorption of hydrogen on borophene via strong covalent bonds is studied. This is because borophene with chemisorbed hydrogen is more energetically stable than with physisorbed hydrogen. Also, chemisorbed hydrogen on borophene performs better than physisorbed hydrogen in terms of safety and long-term storage. Hydrogen chemisorption on pristine, defective (i.e. with single and double vacancies) and metal decorated borophene are studied in this work, using density functional theory (DFT) and nudged elastic band (NEB) calculations to compute quantities such as enthalpy and activation energy barriers of chemisorption. Using Bader charge analysis and partial density of states analysis, it was observed that the addition of charge on the hydrogen bond weakens the bond, expediting the chemisorption reaction. The charge transfer from borophene to the chemisorbed H atoms was found to stabilize the final chemisorbed state. In the case of metal decorations, there is an additional steric factor that influences the activation barrier height for chemisorption. In general, metal decorations performed better than pristine and defective borophene systems in terms of the desorption barrier height, among which double decorated K atoms on borophene substrate had the best performance, improving the barrier height by 20% compared to the corresponding value for the pristine system.","Density Functional Theory; Hydrogen storage material; Borophene; Chemisorption","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-23","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Currently, most ships are designed on the basis of rules and reference ships for which often only the critical structural parts are calculated and designed in detail. This process can result in an over-dimensioned ship with the standard structural outcome of longitudinal stiffeners, transverse stiffeners, and bulkheads with a fixed distance due to ease of manufacturing. With the use of finite element analysis (FEA), the complete structure of a ship is analyzed against prescribed loads, which facilitates the determination of the detailed dimensions of all stiffeners and plates within a reasonable lead time and could result in better engineering in the form of a lighter ship. In addition, the most common structural forms could be optimized by replacing them with unique and optimal shapes. Topology optimization (TO) uses FEA, and it facilitates unique structural shapes. TO generates an optimized material distribution for a set of loads and constraints within a given design domain. The result can be used to inform the design of an improved part. Although the results provide helpful insight, they often cannot be used literally, as they are organic and cannot be manufactured with typical steel shipbuilding methods. The objective of this study is to research the possibility to design the structure of a steel midship with TO where the resulting structural form is manufacturable using steel-cut plates and cost-effective from a shipbuilding perspective. However, constraints that result in a manufacturable structure that can be made cost-effectively from steel-cut plates have not been developed and implemented in TO. To meet the objective, this project was initiated in cooperation with C-Job and the University TU Delft. The methodology was established based on a software comparison followed by an extensive trial and errortesting process. The study was executed in a case study for which the domain concerned the midsection of a 203m offshore vessel named Orion, as TO could result in substantial computational time such that analyzing a hull section is more efficient. The optimization was performed in multiple iterations with different design objectives using the method of Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP). After a baseline comparison, the manufacturing constraints were implemented and developed. Despite the availability of manufacturability constraints, it is currently not possible with the software used in this study to design the complete structure of a steel midship. However, it can be very useful to employ TO as a suggestion early in the design process, as this can result in manufacturable structures (see Figure 77). The TO software used in this study can help designers with structural suggestions in the basic design phase when there are fewer design limitations. This case study resulted in unusual 45-degree, X-shape components that are highly efficient for sustaining shear loads and which resulted in a weight reduction of the mid-section of 2.4%. In addition, the result shows that unique structural shapes under various angles can result in an optimal strength-weight design rather than in orthogonal structural parts with a fixed span.","Marine Technology; Topology optimization; Ship; Structure; Manufacturing constraints","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

Deze eiwitten kunnen zowel in actieve als inactieve vorm voorkomen [2], [6], [7]. De actieve vorm is gebonden aan het celmembraan en de inactieve vorm zit los in de cel [7]. De eiwitten kunnen zich verplaatsen in de cel. Doordat de actieve vorm gebonden is en de inactieve vorm niet, is de diffusiesnelheid van de inactieve vorm van het eiwit hoger dan van de actieve vorm [6], [7]. De kant met de hoogste concentratie actieve Rac is de voorkant van de cel. Actieve Rac zorgt voor een uitstulping aan de voorkant van de cel en Rho zorgt voor samentrekking van de cel aan de achterkant [2], [7]. Cellen zijn omgeven door een heel netwerk aan eiwitvezels waarmee de cel continu in aanraking is tijdens de migratie. Dit netwerk aan eiwitvezels wordt ook wel het extracellulaire matrix (ECM) genoemd. Doordat actieve Rac de cel stimuleert om met een speciale receptor (integrin) een binding aan te gaan met bijvoorbeeld het eiwit fibronectine en Rho deze uiteindelijk weer verbreekt, kan de cel ’lopen’. Eiwitten Rac en Rho werken elkaar tegen en remmen ook elkaar . Het ECM stimuleert juist het eiwit Rho en soms ook Rac [2]. In een specifiek lab experiment konden melanoomcellen (huidkankercellen) drie verschillende fenotypes hebben, namelijk random, oscillerend en polair [2], [5], [7]. Het fenotype random betekent dat de cel nagenoeg stilstaat, oscillerend betekent dat de cel wisselt tussen naar voren en naar achter gaan, en bij polair gaat de cel blijvend één kant op. In hetzelfde lab experiment is er sprake van een gradiënt in de afstand tussen pilaren bedekt met fibronectine, wat zorgt voor meer contact van een cel met fibronectine [5]. Dit bootst de invloed van het ECM na [2]. Als de cel het fenotype polair heeft en de kant op gaat van het ECM waarbij de afstand van deze pilaren bedekt met fibronectine steeds groter wordt, spreken we van topotaxis [7]. Als de cel de andere kant hierbij op gaat, spreken we weer van tegengestelde topotaxis. Of er sprake is van topotaxis of van tegengestelde topotaxis hangt af van in hoeverre het ECM het eiwit Rac en/of Rho stimuleert. In experimenten is gevonden dat topotaxis een rol speelt in het verspreiden van kankercellen zoals melanoomcellen [4]. De soort bindingen die een cel met zijn integrinnen maakt met het fibronectine in het ECM kunnen worden gezien als ’catch-slipbindingen’. Catch-bindingen zijn bindingen die sterker worden als de kracht erop toeneemt tot een bepaald moment. Dan is de kracht zo groot dat de binding breekt. ’Slip’-bindingen daarentegen worden zwakker als de kracht toeneemt. Deze combinatie weergeeft volgen experimenten een goed beeld van de werkelijke binding tussen een integrin en fibronectine [3]. We modelleren aan de hand van een aantal verschillende wiskundige modellen celmigratie met behulp van de eiwitten Rac en Rho en het ECM. We doen dit voor een 2-compartimenten model zonder diffusie en alleen afhankelijk van de tijd, dat de koppeling tussen de voor- en achterkant van een cel beschrijft, en een model in 1D met diffusie. Deze modellen bestaan uit reactie-diffusie differentiaalvergelijkingen en we hebben ze met behulp van python 3.9 gemodelleerd. We onderzoeken de onderliggende verbanden tussen de parameters uit de modellen en experimentele bevindingen. Op deze manier willen we bereiken dat we het fenotype kunnen voorspellen en zo kanker vroeger kunnen constateren bij mensen en beter therapieën ertegen kunnen ontwikkelen.","celpolarisatie; celmigratie; topotaxis; cell migration; cell polarization","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

In Ghana, it is estimated 25% of children under the age of five die because of diarrhea. A disease that often can be prevented by providing hygienic sanitation facilities. Tackling the problem across the whole of Ghana is challenging because of the large scale. Therefore the scope of this project is smaller, looking into the city of Techiman. Public sanitation in Techiman is far from ideal, sanitation facilities are usually dirty, smelly, and lack proper handwashing facilities. The waste streams are stored in pit latrines. When these are emptied, the sludge is dumbed without treatment in the environment, contaminating the groundwater. Semilla Sanitation Hubs has access to different proven technologies to recycle human waste streams. These technologies originate from the European Space Agency and are used in space, but Semilla is looking for concepts to bring these to earth. In this project, I designed a concept for a sanitary facility together with Semilla, based inside a standard 20 feet shipping container. It features seven toilets, six urinals, two handwashing facilities, and two showers. For a small entrance price, all visitors of the Techiman market have access to hygienic sanitation facilities. Three different waste streams are collected independently and recycled using the technologies of Semilla. Yellow water is processed into fertilizer and clean water, and blackwater is recycled into biogas, and drinking water. Grey water is collected on-site and used to flush the toilets. The facility functions stand-alone, meaning freshwater is won on-site, and all energy required to run the facility is generated using solar panels. This report elaborates on the final design, the considerations, and design decisions that led to this concept. Five stakeholders: the users, the company, the cleaners, the mechanics, and the container builders, and their influence on the final design are discussed extensively.","Sanitation; Ghana; Container; Circularity; Toilet; Urinal; Shower","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

It is attractive because of its low power consumption and feasible implementation. Typically, the neuron firing rates are lower than the modern digital systems. Thus, the endpoints of neuromorphic electronic systems are clusters of neurons instead of individual neurons. Address event representation (AER) was proposed in 1991 to multiplex communication for a cluster of neurons into an individual communication channel. AER circuits provide multiplexing/demultiplexing functionality for spikes that are asynchronously generated by/delivered to an array of individual neurons. Asynchronous techniques are not only used in neuromorphic electronic systems, but also widely used in globally asynchronous and locally synchronous (GALS) SoCs, or SoCs with full-asynchronous solutions. However, commercial tools on the market do not support designing asynchronous circuits, making the circuits cannot be adopted easily by most products. This thesis aims at addressing the challenge by providing an asynchronous library establishment strategy. The strategy uses SR-latches as standard asynchronous cells together with logic gates to build an AER communication circuit. With the strategy, the performance of using a modified traditional arbiter in the AER transmitter can be compared favourably with using state-of-the-art arbiters. A back-end flow and a verification flow are developed to evaluate the performance of the design as well as to check the feasibility of the strategy. The proposed 32-bit AER transmitter under TSMC 28nm CMOS technology sacrifices area and power to achieve better timing performance, where the modified arbiter inside has an 11.54% better response time than the arbiter who used to be the best in an old comparison.","asynchronous logic; library characterization; handshake; arbiter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-02","","","","Electrical Engineering | Circuits and Systems","",""

The thesis then dives deeper into DMA-based memory acquisition using PCIe and proposes several improvements to current DMA attacks in order to create a better memory acquisition technique. A novel memory acquisition technique is created by hot-plugging aPCIe device and skipping over the regular enumeration procedure. This techniqueal lows the memory acquisition to be executed without a reboot and provides a stealth approach to accessing the memory.  ","PCIe; DMA; Memory Acquisition; RAM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-23","","","","Computer Engineering","",""

Traditionally, the operating limits of these overhead lines are fixed and determined through static line rating. These limits are designed under conservative conditions such as high loads and extreme weather scenarios. However, the global energy demand is expected to increase substantially in a few decades. Furthermore, there will be higher levels of penetration of intermittent renewable generation in the power system due to energy transition in the future. In this thesis, a Dynamic Line Rating (DLR) method is developed to enable the determination of the varying operating limits of the overhead lines. It is realized by calculating the maximum allowable current for the line considering the real-time monitored electrical and weather quantities while meeting the requirements for the design and security criteria of the line. This is a more economical and feasible solution to improve the existing power system compared to constructing additional infrastructure. This thesis aims to develop a real-time dynamic line monitoring system by utilizing Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) data for a 50kV distribution grid. The Real-Time Digital Simulator(RTDS) is used with an interface to MATLAB to realize the DLR model at computational speeds equivalent to real-time operations. A parametric sensitivity analysis is conducted to understand the influence of each parameter in the DLR model and its working. Case studies are conducted by using the DLR model on the 50kVdistribution grid, which showed an increase of 20% on the line ampacity. Lastly, a comparative analysis of the DLR model and the P341 MiCOM DLR relay results are performed by applying RTDS Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing. The results of the DLR model are found to be in accordance with those obtained by the relay which also validates the model.

A baffle is required to surround the telescope to provide stable thermal environment, limit stray-light, and protect the optical components from debris. A deployable baffle consisting of pantographic arms has been designed that has only one degree of freedom, therefore the whole structure follows the configuration change if one angle is changed in it, and the diameter and height change happen synchronously, successfully reducing the required number of actuators.

This study addressed a research gap regarding the current and future material requirements of the global agricultural system, and it represents a first attempt to estimate the size and composition of the current global material stock embedded in agricultural field machinery. The study also explored the potential future developments of this material stock in five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) through a material scenario analysis, which utilized scenario data generated by an integrated assessment model IMAGE. Available country-level data on the number of machinery in use was linked to agricultural production data through the calculation of ‘mechanization factors’, which describe the relationship of the size of the in-use machinery stock and the annual production quantities of a country. Regionally aggregated mechanization factors were used in combination with regional production data for the estimation of the total numbers of different field machinery currently in use in 26 world regions. These numbers were combined with literature-based estimates of the average material compositions and masses of different types of agricultural field machinery to quantify their current in-use material stocks. Steel (121 Mt), ductile iron (86 Mt), and rubber (21 Mt) were identified as the largest global material stocks of agricultural field machinery, and the largest shares of the materials were found in tractors and combine harvesters. The results of the quantification of the current material stock were incorporated in a material scenario analysis in combination with IMAGE scenario data on agricultural production in the different SSPs. The scenario analysis involved two scenario models with distinct assumptions concerning the development of mechanization levels over time. Depending on the SSP scenario and the model assumptions, the results of the scenario analysis indicated a 50 to 200 percent growth in the global material stock of agricultural machinery by the year 2100. While the scenario analysis assumed the current agricultural practices and technologies to maintain their importance in the future, the study also explored some newer developments taking place in the global agricultural system and the ways they might influence the material stock of agricultural machinery in the future.","Material Flow Analysis; integrated assessment Modelling; Industrial Ecology; Material Stocks; Agriculture; Agricultural Machinery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","As of 2021, the world economic forum deems cyber-security failures as one of the most potent threats to the world. According to a McAfee report, the cost of cybercrimes in 2020 reached nearly 1 trillion US dollars, which was around 50 percent more than what it was in 2018. Exacerbating the already mammoth financial implication of such a failure is the ever-growing diversity in cyber attacks. Side-channel analysis is one such attack type wherein the information leaked via the implementation of a cryptographic algorithm is leveraged to obtain secret data, rather than any weaknesses in the cryptographic algorithm itself. This leaked information, amongst others, can be in terms of power, EM radiation, or the time taken to perform a cryptographic operation. Countermeasures against such side-channel attacks aim at reducing the amount of information leaked via the side channels or reducing the correlation between the secret operations and the information leaked. Manufacturing the chip is often a prerequisite for evaluating the efficacy of such countermeasures, which is a costly and time-consuming process. Thus, the security evaluation of a design has a substantial impact on the design cost and the time to market. In case the design does not meet minimum security requirements, it has to be redesigned and manufactured, increasing not only costs but also the design time considerably. Hence, there is a need for pre-silicon leakage assessment tools that can provide designers a sense of certainty about the security aspects of their design. However, the existing pre-silicon leakage assessment tools are either deemed unreliable or too slow to be used to perform power leakage assessment, which is the problem this thesis aims to ameliorate. This thesis explores the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for generating synthetic power traces. Generative deep learning has been used in various domains like computer vision, audio, and even for medical data like ECG. GANs have been introduced in the context of side-channel attacks to enlarge the size of the profiling dataset for carrying out profiled side-channel attacks. In this work, we propose a robust methodology to condition and train GANs to generate power traces that can be used to carry out leakage assessment. This methodology can even be extended to support the design space exploration of countermeasures by providing reliable leakage assessment at design time. The generated power traces are not only indistinguishable but also as attackable as the real traces. The conditioning technique helps the GAN to generalize to various scenarios and the proposed framework provides a speed-up of around 140 times over traditional CAD methods to simulate power traces while maintaining their structure and accuracy.","Side-channel analysis; Generative Adversarial Networks; Cryptography; Hardware Security; Design Exploration; Deep Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-02-28","","","","Computer Engineering","",""

The MRP uses an existing flight schedule, maintenance schedule and task detail document to determine the possible scheduling locations. Together with all the scheduling constraints associated with these documents, the algorithm differentiates preventive inspections from corrective maintenance tasks (safety- and Minimum Equipment List (MEL) related). The model is based on a Two-dimensional Variable Sized Bin Packing Problem (2DVSBPP) where each maintenance opportunity represents a bin with a shift size and opportunity length. The solution method is based on a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation with a multi-objective where a ratio between changes, delays, bin usage and the loss of workforce are considered. Besides the traditional bin packing constraints, auxiliary constraints are added to count the number of bins, delays and changes regarding the initial schedule. The performance cases show the expected behavior until an average bin load of 100% is reached. Since the objective function is ratio based, the sensitivity analysis did not show notifiable behavior. Additional simulation passed this limitation and showed the effect of each element within the multi-objective. It also showed the limitation of a ratio based objective function.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-08-01","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

One kind of such device is the NAS device made by the company QNAP. Unfortunately, these devices are prone to the QSnatch malware. Unlike previous malware such as Mirai has this nasty habit, it settles deeper into the machine. In this way, the malware gains reboot persistence. Therefore, we consider the malware as persistent IoT malware compared to the non-persistent IoT malware. This affects the clean-up of the virus, as changing the passwords and rebooting the device is not enough to remove the virus. As a result, other steps are needed to get rid of the virus. If we take a look at the NAS device market, we see that the manufacturers of these devices have little incentive to invest a lot in the security of the devices. It is then challenging for the customer to estimate which devices are secure and are mainly tempted by discounts and devices that can be configured quickly. Then, the ISP is the link in the process that, with the help of the non-profit organisation Shadow Server, can determine which of its customers may be infected with certain malware. Shadow Server uses servers to receive the malicious traffic and forwards the corresponding IP addresses to the ISP. The ISP then knows which customer is dealing with possible infection and can inform them. This also happens for the QSnatch malware. The ISP sends the infected customer a notification informing them about the infection and providing steps to clean their device. These steps are a simplified and Dutch-translated version of the steps provided by QNAP. From that moment on, it is up to the infected customer to take action. Previous research has made a tremendous effort in understanding the efforts of infected customers in remediating the issue and showed that various resources could be used by the ISP to improve the results of this process.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-08-24","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The Delta21-project is a proposed alternative solution to the increasingly higher risk of flooding in the southwestern delta of the Netherlands. Located at the mouth of the Haringvliet, it has three main ambitions: flood protection, storage of renewable energy and the recovery and preservation of nature. Flood protection is achieved by the installation of high capacity pumps, that pump out water from the rivers towards the sea in the case of a high river level, in combination with a closed storm surge barrier during a severe storm at the North Sea. Storage of renewable energy is accomplished by an artificial lake in which turbines generate renewable energy and the aforementioned pump capacity can empty the water back out to sea. The project does however pose various challenges regarding the local ecology, morphology and coastal maintenance. In this thesis, the impact on the latter is studied. The objective is to study the consequences of this Delta21-project on the alongshore sediment transport and resulting erosion volumes. Using a sediment transport proxy, the offshore wave climate nearMaasvlakte 2 is reduced to 100 representative wave conditions. This reduced wave climate is then transformed to the nearshore by the wave-model SWAN, after which the coastline modelling software UNIBEST-CL+ is used to calculate the alongshore sediment transports and erosion for the coastal profile above NAP -8.0m. In Model 0, the models are firstly validated to check whether the models are an accurate depiction of the present conditions in the area of Maasvlakte 2. This validation is done by comparing the measured erosion and performed coastal nourishments for Maasvlakte 2 to that of the modelled erosion. This confirms the model’s validity and applicability for modelling the effect of the Delta21-project in Model 1. In addition, the implementation of tidal data from an external Delft3D-model is modelled. However, due to the inability of UNIBEST to model the tidal effect above NAP -8.0m accurately based on the available data and model, no conclusive remarks can be given on the effect of this. In Model 1, the alongshore transports and erosion due to implementation of the Delta21 project are then modelled. The extent and characteristics are summarised as being similar to those found at Maasvlakte 2. This study furthermore shows that the grain size can have a significant impact, with alongshore sediment transports and erosion a factor of 2.5 higher for a grain size of 160 mm instead of 370 mm. A large temporal and spatial uncertainty and variability in wave energy and consequent sediment transport and erosion for Delta21 can be expected, as was also observed for Maasvlakte 2. This leads to a total bandwidth of the estimated erosion for the current design of the Delta21 coastline in between 0.4 and 1.2 millionm3/year, for a grain size of 370 mm. This study shows that the current layout for the Delta21-project will behave similarly toMaasvlakte 2 in regards to alongshore sediment transport and erosion above NAP -8.0m.","DELTA21; Unibest; SWAN","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Especially PV or wind sourced hydrogen production systems are becoming more prevalent as a solution to produce green hydrogen, owing to their regional abundance. In this master thesis project, a PV-grid powered electrolyser shall be taken into consideration. The electrolyser is an equipment that produces hydrogen through electrolysis. Here, an alkaline electrolyser is taken into consideration, which is a DC load and hence, it requires a rectifier to convert the AC power from the grid and from the PV plant (DC PV power will be converted to AC through an inverter) into DC power. The amount of hydrogen produced is proportional to the amount of current flowing into the electrolyser. As the electrolyser operates, the process of electrolysis will, more often than not, produce heat. The heat produced during electrolysis, along with the ambient conditions, will result in variation of the temperature of the electrolyser. Some systems make use of a thermostat to control the temperature of the electrolyser whereas some employ a cooling system to extract heat and utilise it to perform useful work. If there is no system to control or maintain its temperature, the electrolyser is bound to have varying temperature while it is operational. This research aims to develop a control strategy for a PV-grid powered electrolyser to ensure the optimal operation of the electrolyser despite its varying temperature. The need for such a control strategy for the electrolyser rises due to the dependence of the I-V characteristics of the electrolyser on the temperature. As the temperature of the electrolyser increases, the I-V curve shifts in such a way that a given current value will be produced at a lower value of voltage. Since the amount of hydrogen produced depends on the amount of current flowing into the electrolyser, the control strategy aims to maintain the input current to the electrolyser at the rated value irrespective of the change in the temperature of the electrolyser. The control strategy is tested on Simulink with the help of an electrolyser emulator into which data is fed through a look-up table. Real-time data for irradiance and ambient temperature has been used to perform day-long simulations. Based on the results obtained, the average efficiency of the converter was found to be 93.88%.","Electrolyser; Control Strategy; Photovoltaic Systems; Rectifier","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-02-23","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Maintaining 1.5 m distance and wearing protective face masks provide two respective examples. Proximity contact-tracing apps have furthermore been launched at a national scale to alleviate the pressure on the overburdened testing capabilities by means of automatic contact-tracing. Also the Dutch Ministry of Health launched its CoronaMelder on October 10, 2020. However, its efficacy is being questioned with the consideration of its instigated user behaviour. More specifically, it is being hypothesized that the CoronaMelder app instigates users to comply less with the issued non-pharmaceutical health interventions, thereby countering their expected beneficial effects in curbing the spread of the virus. An explorative sequential design provided the answer, where literature review findings were combined to conceptualize the effect of the app on attitude, perception and eventually behaviour. Structural equation modelling performed on data collected through an online survey (N=776) outlined the lack of causality from the CoronaMelder to behaviour and as such, compensatory behaviour was excluded. Moreover, it was found that older and higher educated people were more prone to install the app, similarly to people at risk and those who had previously contracted the virus. Eventually these results were placed in the context of behaviourally-informed politics to assess the management of nationally launched digital contact-tracing apps.","CoronaMelder; Risk Homeostatic Theory; contact-tracing apps; Covid-19; Structural Equation Modelling; compensatory behaviour","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

We evaluate LightDigit through extensive experiments in three different scenarios and in two different environments. The evaluation results show that both models are effective, with ConvRNN achieving 98% accuracy in the Within-Subjects scenario.

Through a combination of time series analysis, regression, geo-spatial analysis, and machine learning, and the use of a large Twitter data-set of geo-located social media posts, such relationships are quantified, modelled and visualized for the 2020 #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd social movement. First, time series analysis is used to measure the temporal relationship between hashtag activism, physical protest, and legislative action. Second, geo-spatial analysis is used to compare the nature of this relationship across different spatial resolutions. Finally, regression analysis and deep learning are used to model, generalize and forecast such spatio-temporal relationships.<br/><br/>The outcomes of this research are two-fold. First, in the case of #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd, it was found that at the national, state, and county scale, hashtag activism bears a very strong positive temporal relationship with physical protest activity. Through the statistical modelling of this relationship, it is possible to predict the intensity of national, state, and county level protest activity on a given day based on the intensity of state and county level hashtag activism the day before. At the county level, it was found that in some ""outlier"" counties the temporal relationship between hashtag activism and physical protest is characterized by a disproportional amount of physical protest compared to the intensity of hashtag activism, while in other counties this relationship is characterized by a disproportional amount of hashtag activism compared to the intensity of physical protests. In order to make sense of this tendency this research proposes the Mobilization Synergy Index (MSI), which makes it possible to statistically quantify this trade-off, and to visualize its spatial distribution in an intuitive way. Through this index, both local policy makers and activists could gain valuable insight into their communities and as a result adopt strategies that better reflect community needs and concerns.<br/><br/>Second, the analysis of instances of hashtag activism in relation to legislative responses revealed that states in which people engaged more in hashtag activism on average during #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd also experienced more legislative responses related to policing. Additionally, results from temporally disaggregated national level and state level data suggests that the number of legislative responses on a given day bears a very similar positive relationship with each of hashtag activism activity and physical protest activity taken at a specific time lag prior to the day in which the legislative responses occurred. At the state level, it was found that while both hashtag activism and physical protest activity result in future legislative responses, this temporal relationship is highly variable by state. Such tendency may serve as an indicator of state-level political responsiveness during times of crisis.<br/><br/>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first national level quantitative study aimed at measuring the temporal relationships between hashtag activism, physical protest activity, and legislative action, at various spatial resolutions. Therefore, the study provides several contributions to the field of social movements research and, more broadly, the computational social sciences.","social movements; big data; physical protest; social change; public policy; machine learning; policing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

Following the Paris agreement, emphasis has been made on decarbonization of the industrial sector. This thesis focuses on industrial decarbonization by employing Carbon Capture and Storage for Combined Heat and Power (CHP) gas turbine plants. The scope of this thesis includes conceptual modelling and thermodynamic analysis of potential decarbonization options for zero carbon CHP plants. The studied options include post-combustion capture, exhaust gas recirculation, pre-combustion capture and oxyfuel combustion. As conventional air Brayton cycles are not applicable for oxy-fuel combustion in gas turbines, different working fluids and cycle configurations are proposed and thermodynamic performance is evaluated. Selected cycles were then compared based on thermodynamics, economics and off-design performance at a typical constant power to heat ratio of 0.78. It was observed that oxyfuel CHP cycle with CO2 working fluid is a promising solution for zero carbon CHP with 100% CO2 reduction. However, this solution requires new turbomachinery design. In view of this, a retrofit analysis is also performed in this thesis which evaluates if an existing air designed gas turbine can be used for CO2 operation. It was concluded from this analysis that it is possible to operate an air gas turbine on CO2 by incorporating proposed modifications of higher compressor inlet temperature (473K) and a turbine inlet nozzle area 20% larger than design. These modifications, however also lead to serious performance deterioration.","CHP; Carbon capture and storage; Post-combustion capture; Pre-combustion capture; Oxyfuel combustion cycle; Axial compressor off-design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy, Flow and Process Technology","",""

One of the most important interventions is the decrease in carbon emissions from the energy sector. In the Cyclades islands there is still a very large margin for improvement, especially considering the great potential from renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar. While there have been relevant studies for some of these islands, there is not a complete plan for the transition towards sustainable energy. Therefore, a backcasting analysis is used in this thesis in order to answer the main research question: How can a sustainable energy system in the Cyclades islands be realised by 2030? While there is a lot of ground to be covered in the transition, the slightly short end-point of 2030 is chosen, also to align with the policies of the Greek state. It is envisioned that the energy system by then shall be sustainable, self-sufficient, efficient, and reliable. After developing the energy mix for each island, a “What-Who-How” backcasting analysis is conducted as part of the backcasting framework, in order to identify the full extent of the necessary interventions. The chief change towards the transition is of course the installation of renewable energy projects, and other, supporting systems, while the development of a strong policy framework is also a key requirement. Moreover, it is important that the public is also included in the transition, educated, and informed. Also, it is worth noting that further attention is being placed on the accommodation sector, owing to its considerable effect brought on by the touristic character of the islands. Based on the identified actions and interventions, an implementation timeline is developed until the end-point of 2030. The transition is split into three phases, each with a specific goal in mind. In the beginning, the first steps and the preparation for the future will be made, while afterwards the system will be ready to be functioning with the generation of energy by RES. Finally, in the third phase the storage of energy will also be available and the transition will thus be complete. Overall, transitioning to a sustainable energy system in the Cyclades is technically feasible. Nevertheless, there are quite a large number of both technical and non-technical changes necessary, and they need to be carried out in a rather short amount of time if the target of 2030 is to be attained. It is understandable therefore that a strong policy framework and a keen cooperation between the stakeholders are of utmost importance, in order for the Cyclades to have a sustainable energy system by 2030.","Sustainable Energy; Renewable Energy; Wind Energy; Solar Energy; Sustainable transition; Greece; Cyclades","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The numerical problem concerns a fraction of very small numbers, which we can solve using an asymptotic approximation of the Mills Ratio. The boundary problem appears in the form of a steep upward-sloping curve at the left boundary. We provide a pragmatic solution to this boundary effect, in which we use an extension of the data set, to obtain a better curve estimate at this boundary.","Bayesian statistics; Regression model; Bayesian Inference; Isotonic regression","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

(mentor); Kroesen, M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","After the U.S. financial crisis in 2008, shadow banking business in China has shown rapid development. Shadow banking refer to credit intermediary involving financial entities and financial activities outside the traditional banking regulatory system. The shadow banking system in western countries represented by the United States is mainly based on securitization and various types of financial derivatives. Different from the shadow banking system in Western countries, the shadow banking activities in China mainly revolve around commercial banks, so it can also be called commercial bank-centric shadow banking system. This master thesis first looks at the development history of Chinese shadowbanking system, identifying two different phases of Chinese shadow banking system development. Then an overall picture of how the Chinese shadow banking system is constituted is given, covering the main components within the shadow banking system. Further, this master thesis investigates the operation model of commercial bank-centric shadow banking system. As the two most important operation models, commercial bank wealth management business and interbank business are elaborated in this thesis. Besides, the main risks of the shadow banking business and the mechanisms of risk generation, transmission and amplification are also discussed. Based on the highly risky characteristics of shadow banking business, the current regulatory measures of Chinese financial regulators over the past 10 years are summarized and classified based on different regulation purposes. In addition to the above qualitative analysis, this thesis constructs a panel data set based on the annual report and financial report data of 146 listed commercial banks in China from 2010 to 2020, as well as the regulatory data in the past 10 years, and conducts an econometric empirical analysis to investigate the correlation between commercial banks’ shadow banking business scale, regulatory intensity and commercial banks’ default risk. The findings show that as the scale of commercial banks’ shadow banking business increases, the default risk of commercial banks increases; conversely, as the intensity of financial regulation increases, the default risk of commercial banks decreases accordingly. Finally, based on the qualitative and quantitative analysis results, this thesis provides feasible suggestions for future regulation of Chinese shadow banking system, while reflecting on the research methods applied in this paper and providing possible improvement points for further research.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

Most notably, actuator magnetizing coils dissipate heat to surrounding machine components as a result of Joule heating. With changing temperatures, system components expand and contract - causing unwanted structural deformations that can lead to a decline in positioning accuracy and repeatability. This phenomenon is especially pronounced in quasi-static processes that operate in vacuum environment – examples of which can be found in lithography mirror alignment systems, deformable space mirrors and magnetic gravity compensators. Prior TU Delft research introduced a method to accurately tune a low-coercivity AlNiCo 5 magnet to a set of user-predefined magnetization states – the novel Tunable Magnet (TM) actuator. This way, by precisely 'tuning' the magnet with a single current pulse, the magnetization state is sustained even after tuning, making this method especially efficient for quasi-static operation. In order to advance the development of functional TM actuators, this research provides four contributions. First, limitations within the original setup prohibit to the dynamic stage movement that makes a reluctance actuator functional. By introducing a modular compliant stage attachment to the existing setup, this discrepancy is overcome – making dynamic-gap experimentation possible. Second, magnetization state tuning robustness, accuracy and repeatability are significantly improved by introducing a series of four dynamic compensation methods. Third, a novel minor-loop tuning approach is proposed as a replacement of the original major loop tuning algorithm in order to improve energy efficiency, dynamic behavior and tuning times. Lastly, the Break-even Tuning Interval (BTI) metric as conceived by previous research has been experimentally validated – allowing for comparison between TM and conventional electromagnetic (EM) actuators.","Tunable; Magnet; Actuators","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

(mentor); Slagmolen, Mark (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The growth in the offshore wind industry sees an increased demand for offshore service vessels (OSVs). These vessels often operate in harsh conditions, and their performance is heavily dependent on their seakeeping characteristics. Conventional ship design processes fail to effectively consider seakeeping early in the design process, leading to sub-optimal vessel design. A design framework has been developed in the software 'NAPA' to efficiently design high-performing OSV concept designs.<br/><br/>The developed framework is able to optimize a hull shape -specifically the main particulars and length of different hull sections- to maximize performance in certain objectives. These objectives are seakeeping, ship resistance, lightship weight, and station keeping power requirements. Regarding seakeeping, the attainable percentage operability is calculated for each iteration, although the Operability Robustness Index (ORI) is optimized. The ORI is a more robust seakeeping key performance indicator (KPI) than percentage operability, which is advantageous when facing concept design uncertainty. The framework maximizes ORI, thereby seakeeping performance, for a particular loading condition, motion sensitive criteria, and operational area. The ORI is evaluated based on the area of operation's scatter diagram and wave spectrum, governing motion limits, and iteration-specific RAOs. Designs are required to satisfy an initial stability constraint, to ensure feasibility.<br/><br/>The framework's output is a Pareto-frontier showing the trade-offs between different KPIs, and the corresponding variable combinations. Thereby, the naval architect can evaluate what design offers the best overall performance. <br/><br/>A 'feeder' OSV, designed to transport wind turbine components to wind installation vessels has been optimized to validate the framework. This OSV is currently being developed as a concept by C-Job naval architects. The ship has been optimized for maximum operability of an Ampelmann motion compensated platform. A single optimization run took three and a half hours to complete 300 iterations, thereby finding the Pareto-frontier. Comparing the Pareto-optimal solutions with the base vessel, the ORI can be increased up to 3.6%, the lightship weight decreased by 21.1% and the ship resistance decreased by 13.0%. The framework showed that smaller vessels can still attain good seakeeping performance, leading to a substantial reduction in lightship weight. The increase in seakeeping performance allows for the use of less expensive motion compensated equipment while maintaining high operability. The framework showed that there is a trade-off to be made with regard to seakeeping, and lightship weight, and ship resistance. The framework presents what variables and ship attributes cause these trade-offs. This information allows naval architects to determine the optimal design direction during concept design. Clients and naval architects can decide what trade-off in performance provides the ideal combination to achieve the ship's mission. Consequently, besides producing high-performance designs, the framework substantially increases early design knowledge. Thereby, the overall design process becomes more efficient.<br/><br/>The framework showed to be a valuable tool for OSV concept design. By the extensive incorporation of seakeeping early in the design process, naval architects can design high-performance OSVs efficiently. The produced designs maximize performance in any of the KPIs, ensuring vessels have a high operability, but do not weigh more, or have higher fuel costs than is needed.","OSV; Framework; Optimisation framework; optimization; seakeeping; motion characterestics; concept design; offshore service vessel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Epema, D.H.J. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","With the advent of the cloud-native paradigm, the software development and deployment style has significantly reformed. An increasing number of enterprises are migrating their microservice applications onto Kubernetes, a production-grade container orchestration platform, to fully use the advantages of Kubernetes in self-healing, service discovery, auto-scaling, etc. Kubernetes introduces a host of novel software design ideas but also poses challenges to newcomers. In this thesis, we focus on the cold start problem in microservice auto-scaling on Kubernetes. A cold start refers to a situation where services receive overwhelming requests from the outside but has no sufﬁcient backend containers to serve. As the auto-scaling process is launching slow, the cold start problem may elongate response latency or even cause service unavailable in a more severe case. To study and mitigate the adverse effect of cold start, we pose three research questions.<br/><br/>The first research question is to identify what factors contribute to the cold start. We first learn lessons from research on cold start in Serverless and examine the current service auto-scaling process powered by Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), then suggest five hypothetical factors that may affect cold-start performance. Our findings indicate that reactive autoscalers like HPA are dilatory in determining scale events and lack a coordination mechanism to scale correlated workloads in sync. Besides, different programming languages differ in code loading and execution time. The major factors lie in slow scale decision making and application code loading. In contrast, other factors such as cluster size, the choice of container runtimes and CNI network solutions are negligible.<br/><br/>In the next two research questions, we investigate how to mitigate cold start and how effective the proposed solutions are. Based on our study from the first research question, we conclude that extra efforts must be made to speed up scaling decision-making and reduce application startup time. We compare a few technical solutions to the hypothetical factors. According to the results, we encourage microservice application developers, especially Java developers, to try and test different programming language stacks, preferably Go, for rapid auto-scaling. In addition, we propose a coordinated horizontal pod autoscaler, named CHPA, a supplement to HPA, allowing a group of identiﬁed, correlated scale targets to scale out in sync, rather than each making independent scaling decisions. As a result, no laggard pod in the auto-scaling process, thereby mitigating the cold start problem holistically.","Kubernetes; Auto-scaling; Microservices","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

Therefore, in this study, a sequential convex programming (SCP)-based optimisation algorithm was developed to solve the spacecraft reorientation problem in real time. Several features are implemented and proposed to improve the algorithm performance compared to existing studies, amongst others: an alternative transcription technique, a method to reduce inter-nodal constraint violations and an improved initialisation strategy. Furthermore, an extensive Monte Carlo campaign was conducted to thoroughly assess the performance of the SCP algorithm. While showing similar performance in terms of robustness and optimality, the median computational efficiency of the SCP algorithm was found to be up to a factor 6.1 higher than a state-of-the-art NLP benchmark algorithm.

With an exponential drop in prices of PV modules, more and more rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems are being installed worldwide. Since these small-scale PV systems do not use expensive sensors, it is difficult to detect malfunctions for these systems. This could lead to lower energy generation along with financial losses for the owners. Thus, a method for PV yield monitoring is developed for early and remote fault detection. This method does not use the conventional analytical approach as it depends on inaccurately extrapolated weather data. Instead, the proposed method uses data from similar or neighbouring or peer PV systems for estimating the expected energy generation. By comparing the expected energy generation with actual energy generation, a faulty system can be flagged. In this project, information from about 12000 PV systems is used, which includes system design information such as location, number of panels, panel orientation, etc. along with the historical daily energy generation for periods ranging from two months to up to seven years per system.<br/><br/>In this thesis, a machine learning model was developed for predicting energy yields, which uses a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for optimization. This model splits the available data into system design, system location and system yield data. Thus, the model uses these as criteria for finding PV systems similar to the monitored system. Once good peer systems are located, system yield data of those systems are used for estimating the expected energy yields of the monitored system. The three criteria used by the model do not have equal influence on finding good peers, thus, the model had to be trained or optimization was done using the training data. Post optimization, the relative influence of system design: system yield: system location was found to be 0.125:0.875:0 with on average 16 good peers needed for accurate predictions. The proposed model has a mean normalized RMSE of 0.057 and about 95% of the systems tested had an R2 score higher than 0.85. The existing commercial software at Solar Monkey has a mean normalized RMSE of 0.082 and about 83% of the systems tested had an R2 score higher than 0.85.<br/><br/>The predicted energy generation calculated by the proposed model is compared with the actual energy generation to detect any malfunctions that may have occurred in the monitored system. Thus, 120 randomly chosen PV systems were analysed for faults. Based on this, a semi-automatic categorization framework was created with the proposed model as one of the criteria to detect common faults in the system such as missing data, under-performance, over-performance and false positives. Using the categorization framework, certain PV systems were found as interesting examples for under-performance with broken panels or string, over-performance with system size change and false positives. The model is especially useful for separating system design mismatch from actual system malfunctions. With the framework, it was shown how the proposed peer-to-peer model can be used for fault detection along with certain other models.","photovoltaic; Monitoring system; Fault detection; residential photovoltaic; Machine Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-19","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Instead of focusing on the performance of a single organisation, the DORA report focuses on the comparison of organisations. It measures the Software Delivery and Operational (SDO) performance of organisations by four key and industry-standard metrics representing two aspects, stability and throughput, of a software product.

However, there rarely is evidence supporting the assumption that the proxy reflects the intended metric or represents the full thematic group.

It investigates the KPIs that are collected by the bank and analyses the relationships between those KPIs and the four metrics from the DORA report. It establishes a list of 27 KPIs that are in use by ING and shows that there are no correlations between the DORA metrics as collected within the bank and that these metrics show very little correlation with the metrics that ING collects additionally. Furthermore, it is established that nearly all metrics contain a bias at the organisational level and that these biases have a significant impact on the correlation between metrics.<br","KPI; proxy; DORA; metric; DevOps","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

Waste is a main topic within the circular economy, so the goal of the project is: ‘How to enable and show the residents of the CLT Bijlmer that they themselves can create value from waste and by doing so support the (local) circular economy?’. With the following criteria to evaluate the final design: Is it reducing waste locally? Does it create value or products out of the waste? Does it help the community financially or socially? The project started with reviewing the goals and challenges followed by an exploration of the context. This was sprint 0. Sprint 1 focused on exploration of opportunities and looking for directions for development. The exploration ended with multiple directions focused on: organic-, plastic-, textile- and bulk waste. Sprint 2 focused on developing these directions into initial concepts, researching about and with the community. This provided the insight that knowledge on circular opportunities was lacking. At the end of sprint 2, two concepts were selected for development. One concept focused on organic waste, with composting and a vegetable garden at its core. The second concept focused on textile waste and included a sewing atelier and recycling, upcycling and reusing textile waste locally. Sprint 3 focused on developing these concepts further and provide the community with clear steps to realise these. The current situation at the CLT community was analysed and the community was involved again. Researching the current situation provided information on operation and plans of the vegetable garden and sewing group used the CLT. These provided starting points for realizing the concepts. Also, some struggles were discovered. The vegetable garden lacked a good compost facility. Also, both initiatives had an individualistic approach. The second session with the CLT community found that both concepts were perceived valuable, but put more focus on details. Also, the lack of knowledge was highlighted again. They required more information on the process and wanted to know what specific products would result from it. Based on the feedback of sprint 3, sprint 4 was initiated. The goal was to develop specific interventions for the vegetable garden and sewing group focused on the value to the community and product. Also, a solution was developed for the lack of knowledge. So a toolbox with all the knowledge required was created. Consisting of methods to separate waste, ways to create value from waste with and providing the first steps to do so. Finally, the plans for the solutions for textile waste and organic waste were finalized. These were respectively a clothing swap closet and a compost facility with emphasis on the community.","Circular Economy; Community Land Trust; Toolbox; waste","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://www.notion.so/circularclt/From-waste-to-value-CLT-H-Buurt-be3ae712889840ee8788e961208b26cd Online toolbox from waste to value","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","CLT H-Buurt",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The gas production in the Groningen gas field of the Netherlands has caused a significant amount of shallowhuman induced earthquakes. Among various building typologies, Groningen is home to many Dutch historical churches constructed by unreinforced masonry which has shown to be highly vulnerable to these earthquakes. From the perspective of conservation and prevention of loss of our historical and cultural heritage, the structural assessment of these churches and their monitoring is of importance. The assessment of the seismic performance of historic churches is a challenging task because of their unique design, governed by macro element behaviour and nonlinear material behaviour. An accurate and reliable earthquake resistant assessment with appropriate numerical modelling of the structure and proper assumptions of all the uncertainties is crucial. The structural monitoring cannot be applied to all historical churches. By selecting representative case studies, indepth study regarding both numerical modelling and structural monitoring are possible. This information can then serve engineers and professionals to evaluate similar structures. The research gap lies in accurate modelling of historical churches to achieve reliable and faster results by linear dynamic modelling. The fundamental modes, eigenfrequencies and modal shapes, geometry and material properties, boundary conditions, connections between structural elements and loading variations are studied using 3D models with shell elements of the casestudy. Although, the models described cannot closely represent the real structure. Firstly, a regular thickness has been assigned to masonry walls and piers despite their irregularities. Secondly, the material properties have been estimated from similar structures in Groningen, and may not represent the actual material characteristics of this case study. Thirdly, the cavity ties has been disregarded because they have been assumed to be corroded (no actual information was available). Finally, the concrete slab at the entrance of the church is disconnected to the foundation, which was an approximation from the drawings but could not be verified. For the casestudy prior structural retrofitting (models 15); Numerical Model 3 with eliminated foundation and timber flooring and a rigid base at the ground level is expected to give the best approximation of dynamic response of the church. The fundamental frequency in X direction of the casestudy prior structural retrofitting can be approximated between 2.30Hz to 2.75Hz and the fundamental frequency in Y direction between 3.0Hz to 3.45Hz. The fundamental global modes in this model show maximum deformation in the timber roof of the mainstructure and tip of the belltower in globalnd Y directions. This indicates weakness of the casestudy prior structural retrofitting. The Old Church has undergone structural retrofitting in July 2018, to prevent further seismic damage on the structure. From the survey of the casestudy and the retrofitting measures, the recent findings (eg., cavity walls, installation of steel frame, steel and timber columns) are incorporated into the finite element model of the casestudy and various modelling variations are presented in models 6 to 10. From comparing the results of these models post structural modifications, Numerical Model8 (or Model9 which has almost similar results) with degraded material properties of masonry and timber diaphragms, a shallow masonry step foundation and a rigid base at the foundation level are predicted as the closest approximation of the dynamic properties of the church. The fundamental frequency of the casestudy post structural retrofitting can be predicted to lie between 1.5Hz2.6Hz in global X direction and between 1.1Hz1.65 Hz in global Y direction. It can be observed that the implemented measures make the church stiffer and the weakness of the structure post structural retrofitting is localised at masonry facade walls of the belltower, cavity wall between the belltower and mainstructure, tip of the belltower, lateral walls and timber roofing of the mainstructure. This research on simulating a numerical model that closely represents the dynamic properties of the Old Church in Garrelsweer for achieving reliable, computationally effective and faster results. This can be used as a basis to compare the results of ambient vibration testing and operational modal analysis, and a relevant guide to study how the numerical models can be defined for modelling similar structures.","Historical masonry churches; Dynamic response; Numerical modelling; Eigen-value analysis; Fundamental frequency; Curved shell finite elements; Groningen","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Structural Mechanics","",""

The model returns the response statistics of a MUFP due to environmental wind and wave loading using input variables of column separation, column diameter and draft. The model is developed with careful consideration to ensure compatibility with gradient-based optimizers. The low fidelity tool is capable of quickly traversing a design space to land on optimal substructure dimensions. The program uses the input variables to calculate the geometry, buoyancy, mass and stiffness matrices of the MUFP. The design of a mooring system is considered outside the scope of this report. As a result, the stiffnesses in surge, sway and yaw are filled with placeholder stiffnesses. The hydrodynamic coefficients of the three MUFP columns are calculated in HydroD. Smaller drag components such as bracing are assumed to be less influential and are therefore ignored. To maintain computational efficiency during the optimization, the hydrodynamic coefficients are interpolated using surrogate models. The rated power of the MUFP is 10 MW, this is generated using two 5 MW turbines. The aerodynamic loading is accounted for by taking the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of a thrust force time series generated for the NREL 5 MW reference turbine in SIMA. The thrust force time series is taken as the sum of two individual SIMA simulations run in a 280m x 200m wind field. The response statistics of the MUFP are calculated in the frequency domain. This is done by assuming the MUFP motion can be modelled by a Gaussian distribution. The Gaussian distribution is used to derive the zero-crossing periods and the expected number of cycles in a 3-hour timeseries. These values are used to calculate the probability of the maximum wave amplitude. The Most Probable Maxima (MPM) is then found by equating this probability to a Rayleigh distribution. The MUFP is tested against two load cases at rated wind speeds. The first load case includes uni-directional head-on wind and wave loading. The second load case is designed to test the MUFP weathervaning properties. This is done by simulating head-on wind loading, a 90 degree wave heading and a 3 degree yaw misalignment. The optimization is run using the SciPy SLSQP Minimize function. The objective function is the total steel mass and constraints are set on the static heave displacement in addition to the MPM pitch and roll rotations expected in a 3-hour timeseries. The optimization was run three times. Two solutions were found at the global minimum while the third was found at a less optimal local minimum. A comparison of the MUFP optimized dimensions is made against a 10 MW WindFloat design. The comparison revealed the optimization solution was considerably smaller than the WindFloat. Although the physical properties of the MUFP do provide benefits such as a reduction in the aerodynamic pitching moment arm, it is concluded that the reduction in size is a result of the calculation process underestimating the MUFP response statistics.","Multi-Unit Floating Platform; frequency analysis; Optimization; MUFP; MUFOW","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","",""

Amid rising concerns over its role in environmental degradation, agroforestry has emerged as a potential solution to satisfy growing global demand for cocoa in a climate-smart and sustainable way. As a shade tolerant crop, there has been much discussion over the potential ecosystem service benefits that cocoa agroforestry can provide if adopted in degraded production areas. However, not much is known in the academic literature regarding the amount of cocoa agroforestry that currently exists globally. It is also unclear to what extent cocoa agroforestry can be scaled up to and what the potential scale of impact of such an endeavor would be in terms of carbon sequestration. This study aims to address these questions by developing a spatial model that uses georeferenced data on global cocoa production and percentage of tree cover in agricultural areas to estimate the presence and distribution of cocoa agroforestry globally. Using data from the MapSPAM project on the physical area of cocoa production, this study found that approximately 10-21% of global cocoa production areas were covered by cocoa agroforestry systems in 2010. By applying global average findings on cocoa agroforestry benefits from Niether et al. 2020 to global cocoa monoculture areas in 2010, this study found that scaling agroforestry would contribute to sequestering approximately 175 to 199 million tons of carbon. This study also found that scaled agroforestry adoption is likely to reduce cocoa production by about 1.2 to 1.3 million tons per year. Further research examining the carbon benefits and ecosystem services of agroforestry adoption at different regional levels is needed to improve estimates provided in this global assessment. Moreover, challenges in adopting agroforestry are likely to differ across the multiple cocoa producing regions. Further research is thus needed to highlight the environmental constraints and socio-economic bottlenecks that may limit the benefits of agroforestry adoption in each of these regions.","agroforestry; spatial analysis; carbon sequestration; cocoa; agriculture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","MSc Thesis",""

To facilitate this effort, the SmartBlades2 research project has designed, built, and tested a set of prototype research blades. As part of the SmartBlades2 project, high sensor density modal testing has been conducted on the research blades. The analysis of the modal tests showed good agreement of the global vibration modes with the finite element model predictions. However, the test analysis also identified low frequency vibration modes, referred to as breathing modes, which were not predicted by the finite element models. These vibration modes were found on all of the blades and are characterised by out-of-plane trailing edge panel motion. The objective of this thesis is to identify and predict the aforementioned breathing modes using finite element analysis. To achieve this, three model characteristics are analysed to determine their influence on the breathing mode prediction, namely, model topology, shell element configuration, and material properties. To characterise the affect of model topology, a cut section from the SmartBlades2 prototype blade is modelled with shell elements and continuum element glue joints. To validate the blade section model, a modal test is conducted which identifies breathing modes analogous to the full blade. Various topology features are investigated with the focus on the shell glue joints and spar web joints of the blade section. The analysis shows that while these changes significantly effect the mode shapes and frequencies, none of them predict the experimentally identified breathing modes. To investigate the source of this discrepancy, the modal behaviour of a sample plate structure with the same materials is used to remove the variability of topology. The effects of shell element size and configuration are analysed with mutual comparisons. The analysis shows that higher fidelity element configurations offer no advantage over linear shell elements for prediction of modal behaviour, while the element size shows higher sensitivity. Furthermore, the effects of material properties are examined using the sample plate, subject to modal and flexural tests. It is found that the specified properties are stiffer than measured, and new predictions of the properties are made which better fit the plates experimental results. Finally, the topology, element, and material investigations are then applied to an improved finite element model of the complete blade and correlated with the experimental modal tests. It is found that the improved blade model has closer correlation with the experimental modal tests for global modes, however is unable to predict the identified breathing modes for the blade. It is hypothesised that cause of this may relate to the connection of the spar web with the glue flanges.","Wind Energy; Wind Turbine Blade; Breathing Modes; SmartBlades2; Panel Modes; Pumping Modes; Modal Testing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This ranges from levitating a living frog to stabilizing a force sensor, designing an acceleration sensor and determin­ing the power of a laser. Diamagnetic levitation is the only method in which a passive stable levitation of an object can be achieved. Such a stable levitation has the benefits that the levitated object is iso­lated from its environment, thus eliminating mechanical damping and friction. Furthermore, no energy or control mechanisms are needed to sustain the levitation and to keep the object in its place. With the decrease in the damping, due to the elimination of the mechanical damping component, potential non­linearities in the movement of the plate can present themselves. Such nonlinearities can be exploited in, for example, energy harvesters. In such energy harvesters, the nonlinearities can be used to increase the range of frequencies at which energy can be harvested. As both diamagnetism and nonlineari­ties have their benefits, this study aims at investigating the nonlinear behaviour of a diamagnetically levitating plate in the vertical direction. An analytical model has been constructed which aimed at pre­dicting the (non)linear behaviour of a pyrolytic graphite plate, levitating over a 2x2 array of permanent magnets, which is actuated electrostatically. The model is verified numerically using COMSOL and has been used to predict both the static -­ and dynamic behaviour of the plate. Experiments have been conducted to assess the validity of the analytical predictions. It is found that the static behaviour and the linear dynamic behaviour of the plate can be predicted analytically within certain margins. The ana­lytical model indicates that all combinations of the magnetic force and electrostatic forces investigated have a softening effect on the levitating plate. A softening response is also observed in experiments. However, the analytical model cannot perfectly predict the experimental frequency response functions. A possible reasons for this discrepancy might be mode coupling. Overall, the study of the nonlinear dynamics for a diamagnetically levitating plate will help to gain more understanding on its fundamental mechanism and thus pave a way for its wider applications.","Diamagnetic Levitation; Nonlinear Dynamics; Softening behaviour; Rigid body modes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-08-20","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Dynamics of Micro and Nano Systems","",""

Results of this research highlight that a sizeable European hydrogen network may emerge towards 2050 with Italy and Germany at its core. In 2030, multiple relatively small networks may arise around Italy, Germany and the Benelux. These components can be expected to grow in size by 2040 but nevertheless stay disconnected.

Together they form the dynamic policy triangle: a vibrant political system, constantly changing due to insights in the scholarly and public debate. This vibrancy leads to the fact that, despite an abundance of performed academic research, the relationship between the three entities remains a relevant field of investigation. A relatively unexplored aspect of the dynamic policy triangle is the working of a multilateral policy package within the relationship between national public and national government. An example of such a multilateral policy package is the United Nations’s collection of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The general assumption is that all the goals are of equal importance, and that no country should be left behind when attempting to achieve them. National governments seem to follow this rationale, and claim not to make any prioritisation of one SDG over another. However, literature has shown that prioritisations of certain SDGs are likely to be made by national governments. Additionally, it is conceivable that citizens also prioritise certain goals over others. Both seem previously unexplored in academic literature and government publications. This research partially fills these gaps in knowledge by performing a Discrete Choice Modelling experiment within the domain of the Netherlands. This is a method in which respondents of a survey are asked to review several hypothetical scenarios and to choose their preferred option out of a finite set of choices. In total, 36 Discrete Choice Models were estimated, either for the total sample of respondents, or for the samples of Dutch citizens and policy makers separately. The results provide indicative evidence that Dutch citizens and Dutch policy makers are to a great extent aligned in terms of their SDG preferences. For the main part, both groups do not prioritise certain goals over others. Also, when comparing individual SDGs between the two groups, no significant differences are to be found. The results, however, do suggest several differences between the two groups. Firstly, Dutch citizens relatively reject SDG 17 - to revitalise global partnership for sustainable development - to several others. In this finding, a preference for planet- and people related SDGs becomes apparent. Policy makers do not show this behaviour. Secondly, Dutch policy makers prefer SDG 15 over SDGs 7, 8, and 9 in the Netherlands. This shows that biodiversity in their own country is prioritised, and that certain economical and innovative SDGs are deemed of lesser importance. Citizens do not show this behaviour. The results suggest a preference for SDG action in the Global South; 13% more weight is attributed to SDG action in the Global South than in the Netherlands. This preference does not significantly differ between the two study groups. Also, the results indicate that both groups are loss-averse in the SDG context, meaning that SDG action is considered more important in a scenario when a certain SDG decreases than when it increases. It was found that citizens are more loss-averse than policy makers.","public consultation; public preferences; government preferences; sustianable development goals; discrete choice modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

Different studies on beach nourishment have been conducted over the years. Most of these studies regard the design, execution method, morpho- and hydrodynamic behaviour, and ecological impact. However, the relationship between the design aspects and the longevity of beach nourishment is not well understood. Here we show with the multiple linear regression (MLR) model that the design aspects volume per metre, height and length of beach nourishment are of interest to analyse the relationship with beach nourishment longevity in the central Holland coast. The storm variables were negligible according to the model since the regression coefficients are insignificant. After numerous reruns of the MLR model, it was noticed that the regression coefficient of design volume per metre is fluctuating. This could indicate a positive, negative, or even no distinct correlation between the design volume per metre and longevity. Therefore, no clear conclusions could be drawn on the design of nourishment volume per metre in order to extend a longer beach nourishment longevity. According to the MLR model, the design length has a positive regression coefficient and design height a negative regression coefficient. These signs suggest that a lower design height elevation and longer design length will result in a longer beach nourishment longevity. The computed beach nourishment longevities of the 7 locations (Julianadorp, Callants-oog, Bergen aan Zee, Egmond aan Zee, Bloemendaal aan Zee, Scheveningen, and Ter Heijde) along the central Holland coast showed that the average longevity of each location could not be interpreted with certainty. This outcome results from the given confidence level of the longevities and the number of beach nourishments used for the computation. Nevertheless, these computed longevities showed that a typical beach nourishment longevity along the central Holland coast is in the range of 3 and 3.5 years. Further, it was observed that computed beach nourishment longevities along the central Holland coast have increased between 1990 and 2020. The increase of beach nourishment longevity coincided with a policy shift in 1999 when shoreface nourishment became a common practice. Therefore, this data suggests that the presence of shoreface nourishment had a positive impact on the longevity of beach nourishments. Despite this result, no certain conclusion could be drawn as the positive contribution can also be caused by increasing nourishment volume through the years. Overall, data-driven research forms the basis of this study and provides a first qualitative insight into the relationship between design aspects and beach nourishment longevity of the central Holland coast.","Beach Nourishment; Shoreface Nourishment; Beach Nourishment Longevity; Multiple Linear Regression; JarKus; Data Driven; Central Holland Coast; Holland Coast; Noord-Holland; Rijnland; Delfland","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Supply chain activities have contributed to these global environmental problems. Namely, the production, transport, storage and consumption of goods have caused harm to the environment. Companies are therefore pushed to rethink their existing supply chain (SC) to contribute to the environmental challenges. Companies have to balance business performance measures with environmental performance measures. This issue is part of the green supply chain management (GSCM) field, which deals with supply chain management, where environmental considerations are taken into account [Sarkis et al., 2011]. One of the main environmental considerations within GSCM of companies is decreasing the supply chain’s emissions. From the literature review, a knowledge gap is identified where further research should focus on the impact of specifically supply chain design/coordination (SCD/C) decisions on emissions in global supply chains [Chelly et al., 2019]. These decisions include routing decisions, transport mode selection and facility location, to name a few. The consumer goods industry is an industry lacking such research [Ansari and Kant, 2017]. Next to emissions, the business performance criteria costs and transport times are included in the research question. Therefore, the main research question is: what impact do supply chain design and coordination (SCD/C) decisions in a global supply chain have on the supply chain’s emissions, costs and transport times? This question is answered by building a quantitative emission model of a part of the supply chain of L, a company that creates loyalty programmes for international retailers. In this way, a case-study methodology is applied in this research. The designed model is applied to the supply chain of L, but the model can also be applied to a different supply chain. Therefore the model can be seen as a tool that a company can use to understand the impact of SCD/C decisions on emissions, costs and time. After first defining a theoretical conceptual model and a case-specific conceptual model, the scope of the research was set up.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Interactions between tidal migration and the encounter of mean motion resonances (MMRs) have widely been used in attempts to explain unexpectedly young surfaces and high free eccentricities of moons. A driving variable in this process is the planetary quality factor (Q$), which has so far been assumed to be constant throughout the system. However, data showing faster migration rates for moons farther from the primary indicate otherwise. The proposed mechanism behind this phenomenon is resonance locking, which uses steep localised dips in Qp to explain why certain moons migrate faster than expected. These dips evolve along with the primary, and a secondary may reach the same migration rate, ""locking"" with a frequency mode. This thesis aims to provide a better understanding of the orbital evolution of pairs of moons in MMRs under the influence of the resonance locking mechanism, from the process of capture into a resonance lock, to the possibility of breaking the MMR. In this context, the differences between first- and second-order MMRs are examined. A higher order numerical model has been developed that combines the effects of tidal migration and MMRs with the newly proposed resonance locking mechanism. It is used to examine a variety of scenarios and test the behaviour of a pair of moons when the inner moon is in a resonance lock. Additionally, the stability of the 2:1 and 3:1 e-type resonances when encountering a mode are examined. It was found that the |Im(k2,p)| required to enter the resonance lock can reach values 50% higher than expected from theory, due to oscillations in mean motion caused by the interactions with the second moon. A substantial growth in eccentricity can be experienced, potentially growing indefinitely provided both the resonance lock and MMR are maintained. Finally, while it is unlikely that a resonance lock has caused an MMR to break in the past of our Solar System due to the lower masses, it may occur for heavier exoplanets. It can be concluded that resonance locking mechanism provides an alternative explanation for high free eccentricities and unexpected surface features. However, to better predict whether moons have been or are affected by a mode, for the Galilean moons data from the upcoming JUICE and Europa Clipper missions are needed. Finally, Juno has already helped constrain some of Jupiter's internal properties, and will continue to do so during the remainder of its mission, which may aid characterisation of the mode characteristics.","tidal dissipation; mean motion resonance; resonance locking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Misclassifications or mispredictions in areas like these can have serious consequences. Therefore, it is crucial to have high performing models that can make as minimal errors as possible. However, in some cases, it is not enough to know what the predictions and classifications are, it is also important to understand why a given model is making certain decisions. Explainability and interpretability tools help data scientists in understanding how an output is obtained by a machine learning model from a given input. Model explainability and interpretability tools like SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) and GAMs (Generalised additive models) are becoming widely used. However, user studies that evaluate the extent to which these tools help data scientists interpret and explain their models are still uncommon. Our study attempts to find out how data scientists use these tools – their general behaviour, factors affecting their trust in the tools, and their expectations from the tools. We conduct a qualitative study consisting of Pilot interviews and Contextual inquiries. By analyzing the results, the study shows that the tools sometimes are not used at their full potential. Moreover, some participants expressed the need to also align with other stakeholders to get the full picture on the explanations and trust them. The most important factors affecting their trust were the lack of clarity in understanding the visualisations that further lead to the participants reasoning intuitively and having suspicions about the explanations,","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

This leads to more energy efficient, healthy and comfortable homes due to the removal of mismatches between the resident and their home. It also results in an easier approval process thanks to the increased ownership and a more fair process. I propose a set of five interventions to accomplish this: 1. a survey session to understand current mismatches, hopes and worries 2. a printed renovation guide explaining the changes to the residents’ experiences 3. a tour of a demo apartment focussed on experiencing the new installations 4. a co-creation session together with residents and the renovating party 5. and the communication of the resulting changes. This should solve mismatches which might otherwise remain because the plans ignore existing issues. It also prevents extra mismatches where the new installations do not match the behaviour of the residents. These interventions are designed based on research in the context of a renovation in Reigersbos (Amsterdam) for the Energie Lab Zuidoost. I interviewed and observed residents in a demo apartment, on the street and in their homes, sometimes aided by prototypes or ethnographic probes. I combined those findings with theory from literature and insights from experts I interviewed. The resulting knowledge contributes to our understanding of apartment mismatches and communication surrounding sustainable renovations. The interventions fill a gap of concrete tools to involve residents. Together, it helps us in making these kinds of renovations more inclusive and, through that, making the energy transition more fair and sustainable.","Sustainable renovation; Inclusion; Resident participation; Sustainabilty; Energy transition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Although this aids the transition into a greener future with net-zero carbon emissions, the increase in EV penetration rates can have immense impacts on the grid and its operations. Coordinated charging strategies can help relieve grid stress by adhering to grid codes and requirements while carrying-out EV charging routines. Coordinated charging strategies can be of three types: centralized, decentralized, and price-oriented. The aim of this thesis is to investigate and mitigate the impacts of EV charging on Dutch residential grids, namely the impacts of voltage magnitude regulation and distribution transformer loading. This thesis proposes a decentralized coordinated charging strategy with local voltage control at its essence. The proposed charging strategy effectively allocates the charging power by prioritizing users based on their preferences, which are communicated to the charge controller through an IoT platform. Furthermore, in order to investigate whether users would be inclined to enroll into a coordinated charging routine, the impact on the user is also taken into account in this thesis by comparing to what extent can a user charge their EV battery with a coordinated charging strategy when compared with an uncoordinated one.

The automotive radar plays a massive role in improving the security of these vehicles. Radar needs to make fast and accurate detection in a noisy environment while being aware of its surroundings. The modern radar systems deployed on the SVs utilize multiple sensors to keep track of their surroundings and improve radar cognition. Even though adding more sensors will help make accurate decisions, the processing time to make those decisions may be affected. Hence, the research focuses on improving the accuracy of the decisions without adding extra sensors and extra processing time. The recent development of the Compressed Sensing (CS) theory has provided new techniques to reduce the number of measurements required for storing the signal and recovering the signal. This idea can be used for Direction-of-Arrival (DOA) Estimation, where we have very few measurements to estimate accurately. Sparse recovery algorithms based on the CS theory have shown promising results for single snapshot DOA estimation. Uniform Linear Array (ULA) provides redundant spatial frequency samples. This redundancy can be reduced by removing specific elements from the array. Removing the redundant elements can help improve the radar's aperture size and angular resolution; these arrays are known as sparse arrays. Combining sparse recovery algorithms with sparse arrays, the angular resolution and accuracy of the DOA estimates can be improved. Based on this idea, an optimal array search algorithm has been proposed in this thesis. The design technique optimizes the Multi-Input-Multi-Output (MIMO) array configuration for improving sparse recovery guarantee. Optimal MIMO topologies, as an example for 2Tx4Rx and 3Tx4Rx (Tx-Transmitters, Rx-Receivers), have been synthesized. The performance of these arrays has been tested with prominent sparse recovery algorithms. The performance of the algorithms is also ranked based on their probability of detection and angular resolution. Improvement in the angular resolution up to 8 degrees with respect to the ULA-MIMO for 2Tx4Rx configuration and up to 5 degrees for 3Tx4Rx configuration is obtained with the help of a sparse recovery algorithm.","MIMO radar; Automotive radar; Sparse antenna array; Sparse Recovery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-31","","","","Electrical Engineering | Signals and Systems","",""

Research in this area is, therefore, of high importance and provides valuable insight in how to prevent or counteract intrusions. Machine learning algorithms seem to be a promising answer for automated network intrusion detection, as their results often reach upwards of 99\%+ on datasets. Yet even with these results, the problem does not seem to be solved as the same models do not reach similar scores on real live network traffic. This indicates a problem with the datasets. In this work, we explored six recent network intrusion datasets and measured the quality of them from a design perspective and through a practical binary classification approach. Furthermore, we explored the need for complex classification models on these datasets, as research has shifted more towards using black-box models as opposed to white-box models. Through a literature study on the quality metrics of a dataset, we found there is a general lack of agreement amongst researchers regarding what makes a dataset good and realistic. We also found areas in which datasets are often lacking in and provide concrete advice on how to upgrade the quality of these datasets. For our practical classification approach, we built a general classification pipeline using a Random Forest. Three feature sets were tested, two of which form an ablation study to measure the effects of trigrams on the classification score. On all datasets the general classification model reaches good classification results (&gt;90\%+) and for three datasets even reached state-of-the-art results. The ablation study yielded a positive effect of using trigrams for classification on the datasets. Our white-box approach performed on par or better than most black-box techniques. We conclude that black-box models are unnecessary in this problem context and that the techniques should shift back to white-box approaches. Next, we attempted to link the quality of dataset methodologies to the difficulty of obtaining state-of-the-art classification results. Apart from the complexity of the attack vector and benign traffic variety, we found no further properties that define this relationship. Finally, this work started with the assumption that real live network traffic is more complex and therefore more difficult to classify well on than most available datasets. Newer datasets do show improvements over older datasets and our classification results corroborated the validity of the assumption.","machine learning; random forest; network intrusion detection; dataset quality","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Cyber Security","",""

Although Indonesia is endowed with many renewable energy resources such as hydro, solar, wind and biomass, renewable energy currently only accounts for 14.37% of the total power generation installed capacity (Directorate General of Electricity, 2021). Of these renewable energy sources, Indonesia has a large potential for small hydro power that can be developed, particularly for rural electrification. Around 19,385 MW of small hydro power potential lies across the Indonesian archipelago (ESDM, 2017). However, it has not been harnessed optimally where only 0.6% of the total potential contributes to the overall power plant installed capacity in Indonesia. <br/>Small hydro power has been slowly developed in Indonesia, although it has been reintroduced since the 1990s. Therefore, it is necessary to study the development of small hydro power in Indonesia to gain insights into factors that have influenced the development, barriers, opportunities for broader adoption. This research takes a qualitative approach to analyze niche development using the Strategic Niche Management (SNM) with complementary insights from the Multi-Level Perspective (MLP) and business models. The main research addressed in this thesis: ""How has the small hydro power market niche developed in Indonesia, and how did business models facilitate the transition?"". A case study research approach is used to gain insights on niche development while studying business models implemented in West Java. The data collection method includes interviews with 12 informants representing different groups of actors in the small hydro power sector and secondary data analysis. <br/>The results show that the small hydro power niche was initially developed through grants from international donors and development agencies. Landscape factors that influenced niche development include low electrification in rural areas, the Asian Financial Crisis 1998 and the climate change issue. Learning process in the niche resulted in several local turbine manufacturers, improve local people capability and network of actors. <br/>Niche actors have implemented business models to overcome adoption barriers of small hydro power in Indonesia. The cooperative business model has emerged to overcome social barriers and build the capacity of the local community. Niche actors created the PPP business model to support grant schemes through a partnership with the private firm. Furthermore, the IPP business model has emerged as incremental improvement in the regime sociotechnical dimension that facilitates niche development. A more significant contribution of the small hydro power plant in the electricity sector is expected in the future. This thesis shows that the Indonesian policymakers need to use shielding concepts from the SNM framework to formulate policies and regulations that support niche development.","Small Hydro Power; Strategic Niche Management; Multi-Level Perspective; Business Model; Indonesia","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

In this study, a deposition-only thermal model was developed in an area of interest (AOI) in this region. Using structural input obtained from seismic interpretation conducted in Petrel©, the model was constructed and simulated in PetroMod© to acquire initial estimates of the maturity of the Tithonian J100 source rock in the AOI in terms of the maturity parameters Vitrinite Reflectance (%Ro) and Transformation Ratio (TR). A one-at-a-time (OAT) sensitivity analysis approach was also undertaken to assess the impact of uncertainties in some inputs in isolation on the output maturity in order to identify key uncertain input parameters. Based on the modeling results, at the C-1 well location of interest within the AOI, the source rock was simulated to be within the wet gas generation window based on simulated %Ro values in the present, having emerged into oil window between 41 - 27 Ma (late Eocene-Oligocene) and into the wet gas window between 6 - 0.5Ma (late Miocene-Pleistocene). Across the wider AOI, present-day %Ro values indicate the predominant presence of late oil to wet gas generation windows, with most of the source rock across the AOI having emerged into the oil generation window between 23 Ma and 11.6 Ma (early to middle Miocene). The highest uncertainties in simulated %Ro values were associated with uncertainties in the Bajocian (J60) autochtonous salt sequence thickness distribution and with the maturity models used for model simulation. At the C-1 well location, TR values of 95% to near 100% in the present indicate that most of the kerogen (source rock organic matter) has already been converted into hydrocarbons, with kerogen conversion initiated between 55 - 48 Ma at the location. Across the wider AOI, average present-day TR values in the range of 81 - 97% were simulated. The highest uncertainties in simulated TR values were also associated with uncertainties in the Bajocian (J60) autochtonous salt sequence thickness distribution, and with the source rock maturation kinetics input used for model simulation. The timing of maturation of the J100 source rock at the C-1 well location - assumed to have been constrained by the OAT sensitivity analyses results for simplicity - in relation to the timing of other petroleum system elements and processes indicated by literature, suggests that hydrocarbon accumulations charged from the Tithonian source rock in the reservoir intervals in the well vicinity are possible i.e. presence of hydrocarbon accumulations cannot be ruled out based only on maturation timing considerations.","Thermal modelling; Sensitivity analysis; Seismic interpretation; Crustal modelling; Petroleum system analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-08-18","","","","Applied Geophysics | IDEA League","",""

(mentor); Kroesen, M. (mentor); Hoppe, T. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Resulting from the Dutch commitment to the 2015 Paris Agreement, the Dutch government has set the goal of making all 7.9 million Dutch houses natural gas-free. The present study has focussed on the challenge of removing the currently predominantly installed natural gas fired central heating boiler since such residential heating systems (RHS) are responsible for 78% of the natural gas demand in houses. Municipalities are responsible for this so-called heat transition and use public participation to gain insights into the needs and wishes of citizens, which will help to speed up the transition towards natural gas-free RHS. The present study focusses on homeowners in the municipality of Delft and argues that a variety of insights cannot be obtained by the current participation process in Delft. The main research question of this study is: How do different classes of Delft homeowners make trade-offs between attributes of substitute residential heating systems and how do these trade-offs change due to relocation? This question has been answered with a context dependent latent class discrete choice model for which a stated preference survey was conducted. In this survey, respondents were asked eight times to choose between three natural gas-free RHS which each varied on six characteristics. The varied characteristics are: the type of RHS (all-electric heat pump, district heating, and hybrid heat pump with green gas), investment costs, operational costs, popularity in the neighbourhood (as a percentage of people with a particular RHS), required inside space (compared to the space required for a conventional central heating boiler), and construction time (needed for the installation of the RHS and insulation work). The results of the present study show that the RHS choice of Delft homeowners is positively influenced by higher values for the popularity in the neighbourhood. The higher the value for investment costs, operational costs, required inside space, and construction time the lower the chance that a homeowner chooses that RHS. Although all homeowners show similar reactions with respect to these five characteristics, the severity of these reactions does differ between homeowners. The model results show that Delft homeowners can be separated into two groups which each make different trade-offs. The first and largest group is characterised by homeowners with a relatively high income living in poorly insulated houses. These homeowners base their natural gas-free RHS choice primarily on investment costs, operational costs, and required inside space. Moreover, this group prefers district heating. The second group is likely to be consisting of low income homeowners living in relatively well insulated houses. This group is, similar to the first group, heavily influenced by investment costs and operational cost, but also by the type of RHS (preference for all-electric heat pumps and hybrid heat pumps with green gas) and popularity in the neighbourhood. When homeowners are moving to a new house, they pay less attention to investment costs, while paying more attention to construction time. The effect of relocation is especially strong in the second group of homeowners. Given the results for investment costs and operational costs and that the national government is responsible for the affordability of the heat transition, the municipality of Delft should try to influence the national government. It should do this via four ways: the Association of Netherlands Municipalities, the G40 city network, the Metropolitan Region Rotterdam The Hague, and via the inter-government layer lobby connections between municipal aldermen and national ministers of the same political party. The inside space requirement concerns of the first group of homeowners should be mitigated by Energieloket Delft and 015 Duurzaam. The municipality should also have citizen organisations (Platform Energietransitie Delft and neighbourhood associations) to gather and spread information to the second group of homeowners about the popularity in the neighbourhood. The municipality of Delft should take advantage of the window of opportunity that relocation provides by starting partnerships with real estate offices. In this way, new homeowners can be made aware of the heat transition in an early stage and can account for the extra required construction time and investment costs for a natural gas-free RHS in their bid. The municipality and real estate agent should have an advisor from Energieloket Delft or 015 Duurzaam to formulate a plan in which is stated what the best natural gas-free RHS is for a to-be-sold house, including an overview of the required investment costs and construction time. The advisor should consider increasing the investment costs in order to decrease the required construction time.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The interconnection plays a crucial role in photovoltaics - ensuring proper flow of charged entities through the layers of the modules. In thin-film PV, these interconnections are commonly made by the process of laser scribing. Laser beams penetrate the various layers of the PV module, and create the pathways required for the flow of current within and between cells towards the busbars. At HyET solar, the Powerfoil’s interconnects are realised by the same method, with two laser beams creating two scribes namely the P1s and the P2s. A quality inspection algorithm stores data on these scribes by translating light signals reflected from their surface to estimate their depth. The interconnect has been proven to contribute to high parasitic resistances over the years, and in increased rates of degradation. This has been attributed to an existing interconnect resistance. Although the station employs a line-inspection camera for quality control purposes, the performance of the scribes based on this data has not been quantifiable. Additionally, an optimal laser parameter was to be provided to ensure good performance of the production-grade modules produced henceforth. In order to proceed with this testing, a recalibration of the laser module was done to find out an optimal for the laser power to be used based on visual inspection. As an extension to this recalibration, an initial quantification of laser power combinations was done based on a design of experiments approach within a useable range of laser parameters. A secondary quantification was established based on the signal data from the line inspection to understand the difference in depths of scribes between the best and worst laser parameters. For these laser parameters, the interconnect resistance was also measured and a basic correlation between high resistances and the worst performing laser parameters was realised using the inspected signal data. A qualification of the resistance measuring apparatus was also done to ensure proper accuracy of measurements. The analysis showed that an optimal laser power combination existed around approximate ratings for the P1s and P2s at 448mWand 135mWrespectively. For the fabricated lab-scale samples, these powers provided the best recorded efficiencies with the least spread in values. Additionally, the interconnect resistances were recorded to be below 1 ­-cm, ranging between 0.18 to 0.9 ­-cm which was closer to the desired goal of 0.1 ­-cm.

However, the lack of acceptance of these systems by society has stifled its successful deployment. Societal values play a key role in evaluating the social acceptance and the broader consequences of SES. However, there exists a complexity of change in the values of people. Alternatively known as value change, although SES may embody values permanently during its design, the values that people hold important may change during the lifetime of SES. Value change may often be driven by various exogenous factors as well as due to the complex, emergent, and dynamic characteristics of SES. Consequently, this has led to high uncertainty in the future acceptance of SES. Exploring the uncertain scenarios of value change is crucial for social acceptance of SES as it can facilitate better consideration of values in evaluating social acceptance of SES, ultimately contributing to the future acceptability of SES by society. However, current approaches to explore value change in ethics of technology literature are scarce. Few have proposed to explore value change, but lack in dealing with value change after it has occurred, or they consider values in a static manner. Alternatively, simulation models show better prospects in exploring complex societal dynamics of which a human mind cannot picture. Simulation models such as Agent-Based Models are seen as a suitable solution to capture the underlying mechanisms that drive the value change considering the complex and dynamic characteristics of SES. The objective of this research is to gain an understanding of the mechanisms that drive the value change in SES, by formulating a modelling approach that integrates agent heterogeneity, common pool resource &amp; dynamic behavior, transformative experience &amp; bounded rationality, and social interaction, to explore value change under various policy and uncertainty scenarios of SES. To this end, this study combined Agent-Based Modelling and Exploratory Modelling approaches to explore the change in importance of values in SES.","Values; value change; Social acceptance; Energy Transition; Energy Justice; Agent-Based Modelling; Exploratory Modelling and Analysis; Common Pool Resource; Transformative experience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","","52.10181466820254, 4.258791808540309"

Radiation can cause dysfunction of the cerebrovasculature which is hypothesised to induce cognitive decline in patients after radiotherapy (RT). A new method, the cerebrovascular stress test, is able to visualise cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) which is the ability of the vessels to dilate after a vasoactive stimulus. Research suggests a link between reduced CVR and cognitive impairment in patients, however, current studies have not yet shown if CVR is reduced in patients with metastatic brain tumours. This thesis aims to assess CVR in patients with metastatic brain tumour at baseline and after RT. <br/>Methods: In this thesis, 13 patients with metastatic brain metastases were included and underwent a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan with a vasoactive stimulus at baseline and three months after the same MRI-scan with stimulus. On the same day as the baseline MRI-scan, the patients received RT. CVR maps were calculated using the MRI-scan with the vasoactive stimulus. An additional computed tomography scan was obtained from each patient prior to their first MRI scan. All scanning data was brought into spatial correspondence with a developed image registration pipeline. After the scanning data was registered image analysis was performed using a VOI- and dose-based analysis.<br/>Results: The performance of the image registration pipeline was close to optimal for the MRI scans, and 69% for the baseline CT scan. The image analysis found a significant increase of CVR at an increasing distance from the tumour for white matter (WM) (p = 0.050). For grey matter (GM) and WM, a significant increase of CVR was found at 14 pixels away from the tumour in comparison to 2 pixels away from the tumour (WM: p = 0.039, and GM: p = 0.046). In the dose-based analysis, a nonsignificant decrease of mean CVR was found after RT. The decrease in CVR after RT did also not depend on the received dose.<br/>Conclusions: This thesis developed an image registration pipeline that can be used in further analysis with this specific patient group and scanning data. The image analysis showed an significant increase in CVR at a distance from the tumour for GM and WM. These results indicate that BM influences the CVR of these patients. However, no conclusions can be drawn based on the dose-based analysis. Additional research needs to be done to relate changes in CVR to cognitive decline in patients with metastatic brain tumours.<br","Cerebrovascular Reactivity; Image Registration Pipeline; Image Analysis; Radiotherapy; MRI; CT","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Medical Physics","The APRICOT study",""

BIM is a comprehensive digital representation of a built facility with great information depth. BIM fosters collaboration across the construction supply chain however the benefits of collaboration are realised only in a relatively small number of BIM-enabled projects. Poor collaboration continues to be one of the major risks affecting BIM-enabled projects with misunderstandings, misinterpretation of data and increased rework. This is especially high in the design phase of construction projects because of the high BIM usage. This research aims to explore the most critical barrier to collaboration in BIM teams in the design phase of infrastructure projects and provide strategies to avoid the barrier in future projects. The most critical barrier in this research is defined as “the main issue that causes the occurrence of problems resulting in undesired outcomes”. For this objective, the case-study method is preferred. Three large infrastructure projects are studied and interviews were conducted with BIM teams to identify the barriers to collaboration in BIM teams. The data collected are analysed by comparing among cases and with literature. Why questions were asked until the main issue that led to the occurrence of problems is found. From the analysis, it is found that lack of guidelines and standards is the most critical barrier to collaboration in BIM teams in the design phase of infrastructure projects. To avoid this problem in future projects, the existing BIM-based design process is improved to work with ISO19650 standards along with strategies to achieve better results. To enable better collaboration in BIM teams, the process is automated using Business Process Management (BPM) software. The proposed strategies are validated with BIM teams for applicability in practice. To conclude, the proposed strategies help in solving the lack of guidelines and standards. It improves the BIM-based design process in infrastructure projects and leads to achieving better collaboration in BIM teams. This research benefits researchers as well as BIM teams. Researchers can validate the proposed strategies in real-life projects and BIM teams can improve their work practices by implementing the proposed strategies.","Building Information Modelling,; Collaboration; Design Process; Infrastructure projects; Most critical barrier","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Currently, humanity has the challenge to stay between these boundaries. Food forests are an approach for improving ecosystems in soil quality, sequestering carbon and enhancing biodiversity while providing food. However, this concept is yet nearly unstudied in temperate regions. Accordingly, this study attempted to investigate aboveground and belowground storage, carbon fluxes, and the build-up rate in the transition from grassland to a food forest through an in-depth case study in a temperate region. In order to analyse all key carbon pools, a plotless method was applied for the coppice, hedgerows, fruit and nut-bearing trees, and a plot-based method for the grass, herbs, litter and soil organic carbon (SOC). <br/>Overall, the results showed exponential growth in aboveground carbon in the living biomass, though remarkably different patterns for SOC over the first 5.5 years. The ground layer (e.g. grass, herbs, and litter) is a significant source of aboveground carbon in young food forests (95% in year 3.5 to 36% in year 5.5). The trees compartments showed an exponential increase, and the total stored carbon biomass in the food forests at the age of 5.5 is 6.0 t C ha-1 yr-1. The SOC differed over the years, which is 115 t C ha-1 in the grassland and depicts 78 to 136 t C ha-1in year 5.5. Finally, the food forest has the potential to sequester around 4.4 t C ha-1 yr-1 in above and belowground biomass, functioning as active carbon sinks already within the first five years of the case study. Coppice and hedgerows have proven to be vital in sequestering carbon in living biomass. Further research should investigate older food forests in temperate regions while bearing in mind the potential of coppices and hedgerows. In addition, a better understanding of belowground carbon is essential for assessing the net carbon impact of carbon farming initiatives, as the soil stores most of the carbon. <br","Food forests; Agroforestry; Carbon emissions; Carbon Sequestration; Carbon stock","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

In this paper, a scheduling framework has been developed to schedule preventive maintenance tasks under application of prognostics, using a rolling-horizon scheduling approach to allocate tasks to appropriate maintenance blocks. The resulting maintenance schedule of a fleet of aircraft is subsequently used for the simulation of subsystem failures and the application of prognostics in order to anticipate them. Finally, the possibility of reducing maintenance cost, increasing fleet availability and improving operational reliability is investigated through a cost-benefit analysis. Results show significant improvements in terms of fleet availability and operational reliability, and minor reductions of maintenance cost.

Optical hydrogen sensors are a promising alternative to conventional hydrogen sensors as they are smaller, less expensive and safer. These sensors show a change in optical transmission upon exposure to hydrogen, allowing the partial hydrogen pressure to be probed. The optical response and the structural properties of Pd capped TaRu thin films are studied. A sensing range of 7 orders of magnitude in partial hydrogen pressure is observed, with a significant change in optical transmission upon hydrogenation. Exposure to hydrogen results in a phase transition of the Pd capping layer, leading to the hysteresis in the optical response of the sensor. This phase transition can be suppressed by alloying the capping layer. A sub-second response time is observed for large hydrogen pressures, which can be improved significantly using an additional PTFE layer. Phase transitions of the TaRu layer are suppressed by the<br/>nanoconfinement of the sensing layer, and a solid solution is formed. The sensing range of TaRu can tuned by alloying Ta with Ru, resulting in a shift of the sensing range to higher hydrogen pressures. Implementing the suggested improvements would result in a hydrogen sensor with a sub-second response time and a tuneable sensing range of 7 orders of magnitude free of any hysteresis, proving TaRu to be an effective material for hydrogen sensing.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

A way to tackle this challenge is by constructing unconventional (American) designs, which aim to reduce travel time and improve traffic safety by rerouting left-turns. This study focused on investigating whether unconventional designs, consisting of intersections and interchanges, have this potential to improve the traffic situation, under typical Dutch circumstances. Ten unconventional designs were analyzed and reduced to four, which were then extensively researched. These are: Median U-Turn, Quadrant Roadway, Diverging Diamond Interchange, and the Single-Point Urban Interchange. A desk investigation was constructed using Sustainable Safety principles, along with American and Dutch design guidelines, to determine necessary modifications to use these American designs in the Netherlands. Further, traffic models were built to determine the impact of the designs on traffic flow, traffic safety, and its surroundings. Lastly, the process to build these designs in the Netherlands were identified. All in all, the results show that the unconventional designs have a great potential to improve the traffic flow and traffic safety in the Netherlands. Additionally, customization is important due to the increasing urbanization, meaning that these unconventional designs might not have many use cases in the Netherlands, however, on locations where they can be built (i.e., locations with the right amount of traffic from certain driving directions), they can have a large positive effect on the traffic situation, while remaining a compact design.","unconventional; intersections; interchanges; American; traffic flow; traffic safety; traffic models","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

A potential solution for such situations is the use of reconfigurable PV modules. They are a type of modules which can reconfigure themselves under varying illumination conditions to ensure optimum yield at all times. The individual PV cells of the module are grouped into reconfigurable units/ cell blocks which can be interconnected in various ways to form a variety of unique configurations. The modules have an inbuilt algorithm which is responsible for controlling the reconfiguration process. There are various kinds of reconfiguration algorithms found in literature, each working with varying input parameters and operating principles. One such algorithm is the short circuit current sensing (SCCS) algorithm developed by the PVMD research group at TU Delft. The algorithm is meant for series-parallel<br/>connected reconfigurable modules and uses each cell block’s short circuit current as input. It is a synchronous reconfiguration algorithm, which means it runs at regular time intervals and not when there is actually a change in the module’s irradiance conditions. Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to develop a robust reconfiguration algorithm with a shade detection mechanism. Consequently, numerous versions of a reconfiguration algorithm with shade detection mechanism were defined and tested using a simulation framework for modelling reconfigurable PV modules. It was observed that the reconfiguration algorithm that performed the best in terms of yield, reconfiguration count and accuracy was the one referred to as the ”CC4AP+IR algorithm”. The algorithm uses the module’s and a single cell block’s operating current and voltage as inputs for shade detection. It was observed that the algorithm reconfigured a fraction of the time that the SCCS algorithm reconfigured and had a DC yield comparable to the SCCS algorithm. The new algorithm was also tested using real-life data to validate its performance. This experiment indicated that if the module were to be run using the new reconfiguration algorithm instead of the SCCS algorithm, it would have run only 6% of the time that the SCCS algorithm ran, but have a comparable DC yield. The significantly lower reconfiguration count is relevant because in practice, the PV modules are connected to power converters which will not be able to tolerate the high fluctuations in output owing to frequent reconfigurations.","Solar PV; Urban solar; PV Systems; Reconfigurable PV","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-12-31","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The chosen configuration is combined diesel-electric and diesel (CODLAD). However, there is a performance gap regarding the manoeuvrability between the previously implemented gas-turbine propulsion and the diesel-electric hybrid propulsion. In order to reduce this performance gap between a gas-turbine propulsion system and a diesel-eclectic propulsion system a new optimized control system needs to be developed. <br/>Adaptive pitch control avoids the angle of attack peak, reducing the torque peak that can potentially overload the diesel engine. Adaptive pitch control is the only control strategy that operates at a low angle of attack, and therefore is less perceptible for cavitation. However this peak in angle of attack is responsible for the peak in thrust. Adaptive pitch control therefore needs large shaft speed fluctuations to be able to create a large thrust. Adaptive pitch control is therefore either slow or forces the diesel engine to rapidly make large changes in its shaft speed. The rapid changes in shaft speed could increase the amount of wear inside the engine, reducing the time between maintenance.<br/>During the simulations torque control for the diesel engine performs extremely well during acceleration. Using torque control for the diesel engine the static power distribution of the propeller load was varied. During these variations it was concluded that a large acceleration can be achieved with a heavy loading on the diesel engine in steady state, supported by a large torque production during acceleration by the induction machine. A heavy matching of the diesel engine was possible because the diesel engine only produced the power needed for the steady state propeller power as matched via the combinator. The induction machine is made responsible for keeping the speed and coping with disturbances. The induction machine is inherently more suited than the diesel engine, due to its fast response as well as it being able to produce full torque or maximum power without any negative adverse effects. However torque control is not available from manufacturers.<br/>This research includes a novel implementation of a dynamic power split, which produced very promising results. The dynamic power split uses the diesel engine with speed control parallel with the electric drive in dynamic torque control. The dynamic torque control for the induction machine allow for optimal usage of the inherent characteristics of the electrical machine. Using dynamic torque control the induction machine is responsible for the high frequency load changes such as disturbances as well as the first part of the acceleration. The diesel engine governed by a slower integral dominated PI controller accounts for the low frequency load changes, including the higher load at a new steady sate. The diesel engine with speed control parallel with the electric drive in dynamic torque control produces excellent acceleration characteristics, making it a viable option to improve the acceleration characteristics of a diesel-electric hybrid system.<br","Acceleration; Dynamic power split; Parallel propulsion; Improved Ship Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-08-18","","","","Marine Technology","",""

Understanding the drivers of energy intensity is essential to produce a fitting policy. While structural changes have been acknowledged as drivers of economy-wide energy intensity, it has not been recognised as an influential factor on industry-level energy intensity because there is simply not enough data to do so. To generate a more reliable understanding of the mechanism that drives industries’ energy intensity, I explore the role of international trade on inter-country differences in the energy intensity of industries. The approach in this thesis shows with multiple panel data regressions how changes in trade specialisation in products explain inter-country differences in energy intensity of industries. The results estimate<br/>that an industry’s energy intensity increases when it develops a comparative advantage in products whose production requires lots of energy, ceteris paribus, and decreases when it develops a comparative advantage in products whose production requires little energy. Since the effect of trade specialisation in one product goes on behalf of the effect of trade-specialisation in other products, there is a strong suspicion that there are changing compositions of industries. For policy changes, these results can provide insights into how a centralised approach in trade agreements and a decentralised approach in industry policies can tackle the industry’s energy-intensity problems. In future research, it might<br/>be possible to accurately predict the composition effects by explaining the changes in the energy intensity of products with trade specialisation in products.","energy intensity of industries; structural changes; trade specialisation; international trade; disaggregate approach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the class of interval graphs is restricted and does not even contain a cycle of length 4. To overcome this drawback, we study some generalisations of interval graphs where instead of considering one interval on one real line for each vertex we consider d intervals on d different real lines and take the union of each lines (d-track graphs) or t intervals on the same real line (t-interval graphs). Nevertheless, most problems now become NP-hard as shown for Vertex Cover, Clique Cover, Biclique Cover or even APX-hard in the case of Feedback Vertex Set. This is even the case if we add some restrictions on the length of the intervals. We also give a bound on the unit track number of any interval graph (number of tracks needed so that all the intervals have the same length). Furthermore, we study the relationship between the classes of d-track graphs and t-interval graphs with the length of the intervals restricted or not. Finally, we also consider taking the intersection of d tracks (boxicity d graphs) and show that is it not more or less restrictive than taking the union of d tracks.","Graph theory; Algorithms; Interval graphs; d-track graphs; t-interval graphs; NP-hard problems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This master thesis provides an approach to develop Adaptation Pathways to prevent local flooding of the Dutch national highway network, using the A2 between the Vught and Sint-Michielsgestel junctions as a case study. Local flooding as result of extreme precipitation has the highest urgency on the Dutch national highway network, due to its increasing chance of occurrence as a result of climate change and increasing consequences on the traffic flow. Hydrological modelling through a bucket approach, complemented by the groundwater dynamics of time series analysis, was done to quantify a range of tipping points between 6 and 60 mm/hr for the Adaptation Pathways, i.e. the hourly precipitation intensity at which water exceeds the edge line of the road for a precipitation event with a maximum return period of 10 years. This was done for three scenarios that embed uncertainties in interception and infiltration parameters and variations in the boundary conditions of groundwater levels. The bucket approach revealed that processes of interception by porous asphalt and sewer discharge are most influential to delay the tipping point, whereas infiltration is the least influential to delay the tipping point. The modelling results showed that adaptation measures that result in (1) an increase in the storage capacity of the catchment of the road (either on the road itself or in the verge) or (2) an increase in the discharge capacity of the catchment of the road are possible to control flooding of the case highway. Possible adaptation measures to increase the storage capacity on the road that were identified are cleaning porous asphalt, increasing the thickness of the porous asphalt and installing a Plastic Road. Possible adaptation measures to increase the storage capacity of the verge that were gathered are removing the top layer of the verge, installing an infiltration trench, raising the road and creating a descending verge. An increase in the discharge capacity of the catchment of the road can be established through a new sewer layout, increasing the sewer capacity and installing manholes with holes. A focus group revealed the interests of stakeholders with respect to flooding. (1) Traffic flow, (2) water buffering capacity, (3) water quality, (4) ecological value and (5) costs and maintenance reflect the criteria relevant to the stakeholders of the focus group and therefore provide information on the societal robustness of an adaptation measure. A scorecard ranked the potential adaptation measures according to the defined criteria which indicate the societal robustness of adaptation measures. Overall, the design of Adaptation Pathways for measures to prevent local flooding on the Dutch national highway network revealed a wide range of possible futures for the defined measures, in which the fulfillment of the T=10 year design storm that is associated with 2050 requirement is either already met or possible through the implementation of adaptation measures. The combination of the Adaptation Pathways map together with the scorecard provided an assessment of the climate resilience of the A2 as an integral part of the surrounding environment. It was found that the designed Adaptation Pathways promote incremental changes, such as cleaning porous asphalt and enlarging the sewer capacity, which enhance path-dependency. Moreover, it was discovered that using a combination of Adaptation Pathways with a scorecard provides insight on transformational adaptation measures that focus on achieving hydrologic neutrality. Hydrologic neutrality can be either be achieved by storing precipitation in the catchment of the road or by discharging precipitation to a nearby location out-side the catchment of the road, where it is used. The findings of the research can be generalized to others places of the Dutch national highway network, to the design of Adaptation Pathways elsewhere and to a variety of climate effects. Finally, as the transformational change towards hydrologically neutral highways complies with the principles of systematic water management of the 21st century and low impact development, one could argue for generalization towards hydrologically neutral highways.","extreme precipitation; highway network; local flooding; time series analysis; bucket model; focus group; climate adaptation measures; Adaptation Pathways","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

At the COP21, cities were recognized as key actors in the fight against climate change because of their ability to combine national with local level approaches. In a multi-level system, the increased interconnectedness and competencies among these actors allow the subnational actors to increase their representativeness in central policy processes. The emergence of city climate networks, which are thought to be governing global and local climate action, reflects this multi-level nature and its dynamics.

The goal of this report is to recreate the security proof of the BB84 protocol, to generate the secret key rate for a practical application of the BB84 protocol, both with and without decoy states, and to review the MDI-QKD protocol and look at the advantages it has for practical QKD. The proof security of the BB84 protocol is done by designing an equivalent theoretical protocol and proving its security by bounding the information of the eavesdropper to an exponentially small number. The best distance over which secret key rate can be generated with the practical model of the BB84 protocol that is presented in this report, is 165 km. This is achieved by employing decoy states and is more than three times as far as the model can achieve without decoy states, which gave a distance of 52 km at best. The zero distance key rate of the model with decoy states is R = 1.21 · 10<sup>-2</sup> bits per pulse (bpp), at best. This is an order of magnitude larger than R =1.02 · 10<sup>-3</sup> bpp, which is what the model without decoy states could produce. The decoy state method is therefore an improvement for practical QKD. By reviewing the MDI-QKD protocol it can be concluded that because it eliminates the measurement device side channels, it is very useful for practical QKD, since it makes security analysis simpler and more precise. It also necessarily employs decoy states, which improves the secret key rate. MDI-QKD therefore is a promising protocol to use for future quantum communications.","Quantum information; quantum key distribution; Security Analysis","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","An investigation into AC superconducting coils is performed with a permanent magnet generator for a wind power turbine of 15 MW. Two reference models are sized: on the one hand, a DTU and NREL 15 MW wind turbine model is taken as a reference to set the mechanical speed according to the output power and the mechanical constraints of the blades; and on the other hand, a 10 MW AC superconducting PM design by Dong Liu is taken as a reference to set the geometry and slot-pole combination, and resized the machine to 15 MW. Both reference models are fractional slot concentrated windings. The aim is to study the effects of multi-phase symmetric windings on the AC HTS coils and the overall performance of a superconducting PM machine. Thus: 1) A comparison is made between 3-phase and 12-phase windings with the same machine geometry. 2) A design of a 24-phase winding is made to endorse the findings and comprehend the multi-phase symmetric windings and their advantages. 3) The AC superconducting losses are assessed for the different winding layouts with the same current and turns per coil, focusing on the behaviour of the magnetic fields into the HTS coils. The analysis found that multi-phase symmetric windings enhance the machine's magnetic behaviour by making it smoother and eliminating the space sub-harmonics. Furthermore, reducing the flux densities' rippling behaviour in the airgap and the iron causes a reduction in hysteresis and dynamic losses. Also, the better winding factor of multi-phase windings improves the output power, making the machine even more compact. Moreover, to achieve an excellent multi-phase symmetric winding layout, the phasors must be unique. However, it is observed that using symmetric multi-phase windings cannot improve the AC losses and power factor. On the first hand, the hysteretic superconducting losses for HTS tape coils depend on the magnetic flux line's incident angle. On the other hand, the power factor strongly depends on the magnetic energy stored in the magnets, related to the volume and remanent flux density. Furthermore, it is found that having AC superconducting armature coils, the magnetic field repulsion creates a fluctuating behaviour in the airgap, affecting the tangential and radial forces in the machine. Therefore, a parametric sweeping is done to vary the HTS coil's angular position, finding that perpendicular flux lines to the coil's side reduce further the AC losses. Nonetheless, this creates more repulsion of magnetic fields, making a stronger fluctuating magnetic flux density in the airgap, producing higher radial forces that can harm the machine's structure. A new design is proposed to improve the power factor and prove that having unique phasors into multi-phase symmetric winding layouts enhances the machine's performance. Finally, three main conclusions are made: 1) multi-phase symmetric windings enhance the machine's performance by using unique phasors, helping to reduce further the magnetic rippling behaviour. 2) AC hysteresis superconducting losses and the Meisner effect for HTS tapes firmly depend on the flux lines angle. Thus, a 3D coil must be designed and assess. Finally, 3) Superconducting machines with bulkier permanent magnets can achieve better power factors.","Superconducting coils; AC losses; Multiphase symmetric windings; Iron losses; Fractional Slot Concentrated Windings; Harmonics","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.36227/techrxiv.15123966 In this paper, an AC superconducting multi-phase symmetric-winding machine is designed for a wind power generator to improve its performance and reduce losses, where four handpicked topological designs were explored and compared. In particular, it is found that using high-phase order of unique phasors further improves the performance. The iron losses are reduced, and the rippling behaviour is reduced due to the smoother airgap magnetic flux density. Furthermore, a higher LCM is achieved due to a better slot-pole combination for fractional slot concentrated windings without having space sub-harmonics. Nonetheless, it is shown that creating a smooth air gap magnetic flux density does not improve the AC hysteretic superconducting losses; thus, further analysis with another approach must be done. Moreover, it is found that the Meisner effect is present in the machine and is inversely proportional to the AC hysteretic superconducting losses. Finally, it shows that a 13-phase AC-superconducting machine can achieve a theoretical limit approaching 101.7017 Nm/kg for the torque-to-weight (TTW) ratio, outperforming a classic winding layouts.","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","",""

(mentor); Scherer, L. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This thesis focuses on the challenges Istanbul faces due to extensive urbanisation and global warming. The metropole has become vulnerable to climate change, especially to the increasing threat of floods. As a result of urbanisation and poor city planning, the green spaces have decreased considerably in Istanbul, which reduced stormwater retention considerably. This is concerning, as green infrastructure provide ecosystem services that can serve as flood control. The thesis describes the context of Istanbul’s flood governance, including international, national and metropolitan flood policies and Istanbul’s flood resilience actor-network. In Istanbul’s flood risk management plans, the role that green infrastructure can play in flood control has been neglected. To meet this gap, this study aims to analyse how green infrastructure could enhance Istanbul’s flood resilience. Fatih is one of the oldest districts in Istanbul and is taken as a case study due to its high vulnerability to flash floods. The study presents a case study on Fatih with a spatial approach to monitor flood resilience and ecosystem services through green infrastructures that can foster resilience. A Geographic Information System in combination with a multi-criteria evaluation is used as a tool to identify priority areas for green infrastructure investments. Finally, the effect of three green infrastructure investments is analysed. The research finds that the indicators proposed by Li et al. (2016) are appropriate to use to analyse the priority areas for green infrastructure investment. These indicators reflect a system approach as they include technical, environmental as well as social variables. This is important for the city of Istanbul, as they provide a holistic framework with these indicators. Furthermore, using the flood map provided by ISKI, the flood sensitive areas in Fatih have been identified, and especially the infrastructures surrounding the main boulevard are subject to flooding. Molla Gürani resulted to be the neighbourhood being most flood vulnerable, and therefore the main priority is for green infrastructure development. For this neighbourhood, increased green infrastructure is modelled. The results show a significant reduction in flood vulnerability, which concludes the part green infrastructure have in flood control. The thesis concludes that there is no one-size-fits-all response to enhance flood resilience. Especially since flood resilience is not only based on flood mitigation but rather coping and transforming from floods. Green area investments prove useful to enhance resilience, as these investments provide benefits that can transform the resilience of urban flood management into a more adaptive state due to the nature of the ecosystem services. This research proposes a few recommendations for decision-makers in Istanbul to take into consideration.","Green infrastructure; flood resilience; Ecosystem Services; GIS; Multi-Criteria Analysis; Istanbul","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

According to the World Health Organization, stroke is the second leading cause of death in the world. One of the available treatments is the aspiration thrombectomy, where a negative pressure is applied to the thrombus in order to remove it from the vessel. In this work, the aspiration thrombectomy will be studied through the development of a computational model. By means of the development of this model, a baseline is created for exploratory research into both the technical and clinical aspects. The range of applied thrombus models in literature varies largely. In this work, the thrombus is modelled using a fluid material model. Through the application of this fluid model, an emphasis is put on the fluid properties of thrombi, which exhibit both solid and fluid behavior. Three fluid models are applied, of which two represent non-Newtonian fluid behavior and one Newtonian fluid behavior. The effects of these material models are assessed through the pressure and velocity distribution and the thrombus behavior. Furthermore, an evaluation of three clinical parameters, aspiration pressure, suction distance and thrombus length, is performed. Each parameter was assigned three variations, which are assessed based on the respective recanalization times. Each clinical parameter is evaluated to influence the recanalization time, albeit to different extents. In conclusion, this thesis functions as exploratory research in the development of computational aspiration thrombectomy models. Future research is advised, in the form of material model verification with patient-retrieved or analog clots or more extensive research into the relation between recanalization time and the presented clinical parameters.","BME; Numerical Analysis; cardiovascular modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

(graduation committee); Rajan, R.T. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In today's automotive applications, radar is widely used to estimate the target position and velocity with respect to the radar position. Estimating the position of the target in terms of range and velocity is fairly advanced and accurate. However, resolving two closely spaced targets in the azimuth domain which have the same range and relative radial velocity as seen from the radar is still a very challenging problem that needs to be addressed. The azimuth resolution that can be achieved by a radar sensor is directly proportional to the number of antenna elements in the radar, that is increasing the number of elements improves the resolution capability. But increasing the aperture of the single radar mounted on the automobile is not desirable as it is cost ineffective and not easy to fit in the design of the automobile. Thus a study is performed on combining the data from multiple radar sensors which are distributed over the fascia of the car along the horizontal axis. In this thesis, methods to achieve higher angular resolution in azimuth using multiple radar sensors is presented.<br/><br/>The system design and geometry for a distributed system consisting of FMCW radar sub-systems is studied along with the signal model for the same. The interpretation of near field and far field region around the radar sensors is presented. In this thesis, the Range-Doppler processing of the data is performed first and the snapshot related to the range and Doppler bin where the target is detected is extracted to perform the Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation. This is done as it is computationally efficient and the DOA estimation can be performed on every snapshot and hence the changes in the target position can be detected faster. The signal model for DOA estimation using single sensor and distributed sensors is provided for single snapshot case. Sparse signal processing technique is chosen to estimate the DOA in this thesis as it has better performance and certain advantages in DOA estimation of target using single snapshot compared to other methods like Beam forming or MUSIC. The theory behind compressive sensing technique is discussed along with the concept of block sparsity to fuse the data from multiple sensors. A new algorithm called Block Focal Under determined System Solver (FOCUSS) is proposed to incoherently combine the data from multiple sensors in order to achieve a better performance. This method benefits from the spatial diversity gain by combining the data from multiple sensors. However, the resolution improvement achieved by the incoherent combining of the data from multiple sensors is still limited by the largest aperture of the sub-system used and hence a way to coherently combine the data from multiple sensors is presented. Coherent FOCUSS algorithm is proposed which combines the data from multiple sensors coherently and the virtual aperture of such combining is given by the separation between the sensors and hence it can achieve very high resolution in azimuth. Such a method has some drawbacks when the target is non-isotropic or the distance between the sensors is too large, which is also discussed in this thesis. A method called Fusion FOCUSS is introduced to overcome some of the drawbacks of coherent processing, whose resolution capability is in between that of Block FOCUSS and Coherent FOCUSS.<br/><br/>Simulations are performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms and for comparison purpose the results obtained from Block Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (BOMP) algorithm is provided. Monte Carlo runs are performed for different scenarios consisting of varying SNR, target phase and baseline of the distributed system. The performance of the algorithms with varying SNR values is presented. The penalty incurred in performing coherent processing on a non-isotropic target is discussed. The problem of off-grid targets is studied and a possible solution for the same is implemented as discussed in literature. Results obtained by performing an experimental evaluation in the anechoic chamber to study the performance of Block FOCUSS is presented along with the explanation of results. We also propose some ideas for future work to further investigate the problem.","Automotive radar; DOA; sparse sensing; compressed sensing; Distributed systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-08-18","","","","","",""

Besides the potential of installing bodies on water, floating solar brings the benefit of an efficiency increase superior to 10 percent in relation to land based solar, depending on the solar panel technology and environmental conditions.

South Africa is in the process of transforming its electricity mix. The majority of electricity is currently sourced from coal-fired power plants. The transition maybe towards an electricity mix that includes more renewable sources of electricity generation, particularly from wind and solar technologies. The degree to which this transition will create and displace jobs is presently unclear. Furthermore, the extent to which these new jobs will be demanded locally or abroad and the implications that this transition will have on decent work is uncertain.The main research question posed at the outset of this dissertation was: What are the possible net employment effects of South Africa’s transition from coal to wind and solar forms of electricity generation? A quantitative method was employed to address this question: an Input-Output Analysis. The I-JEDI input-output model was used, updated with more recent data for South Africa that has more industrial detail. Additionally, a coal displacement vector was created to calculate the jobs displaced due to lack of demand for coal-fired power plants. Hence, the net employment effects were calculated. This quantitative method was supplemented with findings from a series of semi-structured interviews and a workshop with union members to ground the results in some of the realities of South Africa’s socio-political landscape. Two exploratory scenarios were createdthat were simulated in the model, each with their own narrative about South Africa’s future electricity prospects: Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) 2019 scenario and the Ambitious Solar and Wind (ASW) scenario. The IRP 2019 scenario was aligned with the recent government plans to transform the electricity mix. The ASW scenario included higher levels of local manufacturing of solar and wind technologies than currently employed. The results of this research are exploratory, aiming to provide insight into the boundary of what is possible. The main findings suggest that solar and wind may employ significantly more people than currently employed in the coal-fired power plant supply chain considering both operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) and construction activities. O&amp;M jobs numbers for coal-fired power plants are larger than wind and solar under the IRP2019 scenario but are comparable for the ASW scenario. While the results from the model showed promising prospects for employment, it was revealed through the stakeholder interactions and literature that there are several challenges to achieving a just energy transition. In particular, there is the challenge of garnering the support of labour unions and ensuring decent work. It was found that the overall skill levels in terms of education for the different sources of electricity were similar, but there are many other skill considerations required for people to change vocation from the old jobs in coal to new jobs in solar and wind.","Renewable Energy; Just Transition; Employment; input-output analysis; South Africa; Solar; Wind; Coal power plant; Macro-economic modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

With a prominent global presence, they are well known for their technological superiority (design, engines etc.). However recent trends in the automotive industry have put their monopoly in jeopardy. Firstly, Tesla’s success in the market with e-vehicles presents a threat of substitution. The German automotive industry prides in its build and petrol and diesel powered engines. However , with developed countries moving towards sustainability, e-vehicles have gradually started pushing the German cars out of the market. Secondly, given the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, luxury cars aren’t a preferred investment. However the new concept of ‘frugal innovations’ still provides optimistic hopes during these troubled times. This involves targeting the growing middle class population in developing countries by developing cars that are just good enough to meet basic customer needs. India is a country with a promising buying potential. Well known automakers like Ford, Suzuki, Hyundai and Tata, have successfully innovated to serve this market. However for the German automotive industry, which has always targeted affluent customers, frugal innovations would be challenging internally and externally as it calls for a different mindset. Despite the increasing importance of frugal innovations, academic sources do not provide a country and industry specific strategy for a high-tech firm to switch to frugal innovations. Given this controversy, this research attempts to explore the scope for frugal innovations for the German automotive industry in India by answering the research question: What are the opportunities and threats concerning frugal innovations for the German automotive industry in India? Given the knowledge gap resulting from the lack of available sources, the research starts with the construction of a theoretical framework that would enable a firm to assess its current position in terms of frugal innovations. This framework represents a detailed overview of the internal and external factors including organisation, value chain, competitors, social, political and legal factors to name a few. This framework also forms the backbone of further research work to be embedded in. Additionally, it could also be used by a product based firm that wishes to transition to frugal innovations. The generic nature of this framework has been obtained from both strategic management and frugal innovation literature. The research makes use of the complementarity approach to identify the internal and external opportunities and threats available. The first approach has been a thorough study of the literature from different disciplines that would have the necessary answers. Secondly, the Fiat Palio is an example of a controversial frugal innovation in India by the Italian automaker Fiat. The story of Fiat in India revolves around its very high receptivity during its inception and its eventual downfall in a few years. Having enjoyed the status of an elite automaker, a second case study of Fiat Palio in India has been performed to identify the factors that could be of influence. Thirdly, the research features insights from around 8 academic and industry experts specialized in this area. The combined insights from the three approaches were embedded in the context of the evaluated literature. To assess a firm’s current position in the market environment and make business decisions, the SWOT analysis is one of the most widely used tools. As a consequence, the combined findings were reported in the form of a SWOT analysis. However, the SWOT has certain disadvantages in taking business decisions, in a highly competitive environment. As a consequence, a new and a modified approach to SWOT known as the evolutionary and correlative SWOT has been considered as the tool for analysis to identify the opportunities and threats. Using the evolutionary and correlative SWOT analysis qualitatively, the opportunities and threats have been identified into four categories: Real opportunities, where the internal strengths and external opportunities are in perfect synergy; Space of lost opportunities, wherein the organization has a vast potential to review itself internally to tap external opportunities; space of possible defense, wherein, the firms could use its internal strengths to combat threats; and Real threats, wherein the internal weaknesses and external threats are in perfect synergy. The main sources of opportunities for the German automotive industry is its strong technical skill set, presence of well established suppliers, superior brand name that could give them an edge in comparison to competitors. However, with competitors like Suzuki, Tata and Hyundai skilled in local market adaptation, mass production, meeting low cost pressures including inexpensive after sales service, pose a major competitive threat. The success of the German automotive industry lies in reviewing the firms and making internal changes and exploiting opportunities to combat this. Expanding production and service networks by forming alliances and partnerships provide a ray of hope to push further in this market. A total of 15 opportunities and threats collectively were identified that if dealt with effectively could result in the success of frugal innovations for the German automotive industry. The main contribution of this research includes the identification of a new market opportunity for the German automotive industry, with the various factors that could lead to its success and failure. Additionally, this research contributes to the academic literature by highlighting a few key limitations of the frugal innovations literature like their lack of focus on sales and service as one of the most important parameters in determining a firm’s success with frugal innovations. Secondly, the research builds on the work of Vlados (2019), by using evolutionary and correlative analysis as a tool to make strategic decisions. Lastly, given the lack of technological expertise and living conditions in India, this move from the German automotive industry to frugal innovations would be a major contributor to the country’s development. The research makes use of both a managerial and societal approach to identifying the factors that make it a good fit for the MOT curriculum.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

To increase the energy yield, wind turbine rotors need to have an innovative tip design; such as winglets. Winglets are used widely in aircraft design; however, they remain mostly absent in state-of-the-art wind turbine design. The low-fidelity wind turbine design models used by industry, such as BEM, are insufficient to capture the full 3D flow physics in such an innovative design. Therefore, high-fidelity methods, such as vortex methods, are becoming more and more important in such a design phase in wind energy research. Single-objective optimisation has been applied in earlier works to maximise power production. Winglets have shown the potential of increasing power production while simultaneously increasing the design-driving loads (DDLs), for example, the thrust or flapwise bending moment. This work focuses on optimisation using machine learning of a winglet that increases power production without increasing DDLs. <br/><br/>A parameterised design for a winglet on a wind turbine is created. Different design constraints, such as DDLs or a diameter constraint, are explored to determine under which constraints and conditions a winglet can have an added value to the wind turbine blade design. Multi-objective Bayesian optimisation is used to maximise the rotor's power production and minimise DDLs. Surrogate models, created using machine learning techniques such as Gaussian Processes and Bayesian Neural Networks, are used in combination with an acquisition function, to determine what designs should be evaluated by the lifting line model AWSM. This has the goal to obtain designs that lie on the Pareto front of two or more objectives. The recent Bayesian Neural Networks were able to find the Pareto front most effectively in this work. Furthermore, the results show that different DDL constraints led to different winglet designs, with noticeable differences between upwind and downwind winglet designs obtained by the optimiser. Both a downwind and upwind winglet were found to be able to increase power without increasing the thrust, root flapwise bending moment and flapwise bending moment at 80% of the rotor radius.","Winglet; Machine Learning; AWSM; Vortex model; Bayesian Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","",""

In recent years, flexible elements have seen increased use as they enable the development of high-precision motion systems in a wide variety of applications ranging from semiconductor fabrication to precision surgery. Although these flexures provide ample benefits for systems that require lightweight elements and predictable behavior, structural vibrations can restrict their effectiveness in achieving precise positioning. This motivates the need for vibration suppression in motion systems, particularly those with flexible components. To that end, smart structures with embedded transducers and a suitable control algorithm can be used to actively damp the underlying structure’s resonance modes, although time-varying parameters and uncertainties from various sources can degrade the performance of the vibration controller. In this thesis, an adaptive control scheme is developed to maintain the desired damping performance regardless of system variations. The method employs adaptive notch filters in a cascade arrangement to track multiple modal frequencies of a smart flexible structure, then tunes a positive position feedback controller for multimodal damping with a straightforward adjustment rule. The adaptation is shown to be fast, accurate, and efficient, with clear advantages in suppressing the vibrations of time-varying and uncertain systems. The method also provides key features absent from other adaptive damping implementations, including the ability to effectively estimate modal frequencies using brief transient signals typical of damped structures, as well as signals buried in noise. Finally, the adaptive scheme is validated experimentally with a flexible beam, showcasing its strong potential for practical applications.","Active Damping; Vibration Control; Adaptive Damping; Adaptive Notch Filter; Multimodal Estimation; Flexible Structures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Ammonia fuel has been widely considered as an attractive solution for reducing the green house gas emissions over recent years. Adapting ammonia as fuel on ships would highly reduce the carbon footprint of international shipping and off-shore transportation. Among the different systems currently under development for carbon-free power production in the near future, the combined-cycle gas turbine system stands out for its relatively high system efficiency and a potential for running on pure ammonia fuel while maintaining a low level of NOx emission. This thesis project puts a sight on a special design of this type of COGAS power system and tries to adapt it for maritime usage onboard future ships. Previous researches have pointed out the key design features of the ammonia COGAS power system being running under a high fuel-air ratio with a cooling method based on EGR technology and cracking the additional ammonia fuel into hydrogen in the gas turbine system, then this created hydrogen concentration could be used for re-heating the exhaust before it is used by the combined steam cycle. However, current understanding of this type of COGAS system is still limited under static analysis and designed working points. This thesis project tries to provide a basic view on the off-design performance and dynamic behaviors of this COGAS system, and examines if this system is still able to maintain a low level NOx emission under such working conditions. This thesis project combines a dynamic model of an ammonia gas turbine and a chemical thermodynamic model for simulating the chemical behavior of the work fluid inside the gas turbine system. It is found that the fuel-air equivalence ratio of the gas turbine needs to be designed at a high value to ensure the flammability of the hydrogen consisting exhaust in the re-heating process. A very low NOx emission is observed in the gas turbine exhaust under an assumption of complete chemical reactions. The final NOx emission of the COGAS system is found to be within the EEDI Tier III limitation under both rated and part-load working conditions. The thermal efficiency of the gas turbine is relatively low due to the high equivalence ratio, while a system efficiency comparable with current oil-fueled COGAS power system is able to be expected for the full system of ammonia COGAS. On the phase of dynamic analysis, this project has concluded that traditional fuel control method for controlling gas turbine power generation is not adaptable to gas turbine systems working at fuel-rich conditions. A non-linear behavior is observed due to this high equivalence ratio. This thesis provides a new controlling method with controlling both the fuel injection ratio and the EGR ratio with an additional feedback controlling system attached to the original feed-forward system of the fuel control. Basic tests shows that such method is able to generate a dynamic output with the correct tendency. This thesis project also observes a high sensitivity of NOx emission with the presence of additional oxygen in the exhaust under a complete chemical reaction. In this thesis project it is found that the considered ammonia COGAS system maintains the advantage of traditional COGAS power systems and a is able to take an advantage in comparing with medium-speed diesel systems under an ammonia economy. Power output of the ammonia gas turbine is able to be controlled with a combination of fuel control and EGR control. A low NOx emission within the limit of EEDI Tier III is observed under both rated and part-loading conditions of the power system, but this is achieved with the assumption of a complete chemical reaction. Whether this assumption is adaptable to maritime scaled ammonia gas turbine system requires further kinetic analysis on the combustion process and further research efforts in the designing of the combustor system.","Thesis; Ammonia; Gas turbine; Simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

In the current healthcare system, providers are rewarded for increasing volume, but not for adding value, which only exacerbates the situation. Value-based healthcare (VBHC) is a candidate framework to reform the current healthcare system into an outcome-based system. Information systems are essential for the implementation of VBHC to execute outcome and cost measurements and collaborate across the care cycle. A literature review shows that there is a knowledge gap in the scientific literature to the architectures and components for such value-enabling information systems. This thesis aims to fill that gap by identifying and designing the essential components for a value-enabling IT architecture for the Dutch healthcare system.<br/>The Information Systems (IS) research framework of Hevner et al. (2004) is adopted to guide the research. The environmental analysis shows several deficiencies in the as-is architecture for VBHC including a lack of patient-centredness, inaccessible or unavailable data, and complex to extract and integrate data. Preliminary semi-structured interviews reveal that, besides IT barriers, there is a deeply rooted trust issue among stakeholders which hampers successful implementation of VBHC. It is found that trust is often related to transparency and can be managed. Increasing transparency in the healthcare architecture would allow for (i) continuous quality improvements, (ii) improved decision-making, (iii) positive financial stimulus and (iv) patient empowerment. The design activities aim to facilitate VBHC through integrating components that reduce or eliminate the IT barriers and increase transparency. Another round of semi-structured interviews is carried out to find the principles, requirements and components for the design. The overall design developed uses three types of environment: a Healthcare Information System (HIS) used by caregivers, a Personal Healthcare Environment (PHE) used by patients and a Quality Registration System, available to all stakeholders. The design and components are evaluated with an expert panel. The most essential components are: PHE, HIS, Quality Registry system, Clinical building blocks (Zibs), terminology standards, a data integration centre, logging and monitoring services, measurements and evaluations, auditing IT and care processes and an intermediary that stimulates improvement and collaboration. The expert panel reached a consensus that transparency in healthcare would contribute to solving some of the problems, but it will not solve the core problems that lie within the healthcare structure. There are several areas recommended for future research. First, the components should be evaluated with a broader expert panel to increase the validity. Second, the PHE is an essential component, but still in its infancy. It is recommended to further evaluate the utility for VBHC. Third, blockchain technology might enhance the design due to its inherent characteristics that offer transparency. Fourth, further research on the privacy-utility trade-off in the context of VBHC is recommended. Finally, interoperable systems rely on a shared and uniform language. It is recommended to research which standards have the highest potential to facilitate the architecture components. <br","Value-based healthcare; Information Systems; Healthcare Architecture; Enterprise Architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

They can contain so called reticulations, representing reticulate evolution, such as hybridization, lateral gene transfer and recombination. Methods are being developed to construct certain rooted phylogenetic networks from their subnetworks. A constructed network is encoded by their subnetworks if it is uniquely determined by that set. It has been shown that phylogenetic trees are encoded by their set of triplets, which are rooted trees on three species. However, triplets do not encode phylogenetic networks. Huber and Moulton introduced trinets, rooted networks on three species, which do encode level-1 phylogenetic networks, which are networks containing at most one reticulation in each biconnected component. Van Iersel and Moulton proved that level-2 phylogenetic networks are encoded by their set of trinets and Nipius proved that level-3 phylogenetic networks are encoded by their set of quarnets, which are rooted networks on four species. In this thesis we prove that for all k&gt;1, level-k networks without symmetry in their biconnected components are encoded by their set of (k+1)-nets, which are rooted networks on k+1 leaves. This result provides some evidence for the conjecture that all level-k phylogenetic networks are encoded by their set of (k+1)-nets. Thereafter, we generalise encoding results for level-2 and level-3 networks, where the underlying structure, called generator, and its sides play an important role. A generator is a directed acyclic biconnected multigraph, containing only vertices with indegree 2 and outdegree at most 1, indegree 1 and outdegree 2, and indegree 0 and outdegree 2. The sides of a generator are the arcs and outdegree-0 vertices of a generator. We have not been able to prove that level-k networks with symmetry in the generators of their biconnected components are in general encoded by k+1-nets. For the networks with symmetry, we prove encoding results for networks with leaves on at most p sides of the underlying generators of their biconnected components. We further prove that level-4 networks are encoded by 6-nets. Although Nipius gave a counterexample showing that not all (level-3) phylogenetic networks are encoded by their set of trinets, it is useful to know which networks are encoded by their set of trinets or k-nets. In this thesis, we provide an algorithm which can serve as tool for proving that certain level-k networks are encoded by their set of k-nets. Our presented algorithm is a first step to generalise encoding results to level-k networks with k&gt;3 by using trinets. Furthermore, we are a step closer to proving the conjecture that all level-k networks are encoded by (k+1)-nets, including networks with symmetry in the generators of their biconnected components.","Phylogenetic networks; Encoding; Optimization; Evolution; Graph theory; Phylogenetic trees","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Optimization","",""

Now, when TenneT decided to replace or increase the loadings on such cables, the question appears how would they behave to such temperature profiles and also the progress of their aging under such conditions. Only if a robust model is developed, can we understand which cable is closer to failure. Since all the cables cannot be replaced at once, prioritizing which ones are at the very near end and in the ""red zone"" of lifetime should be replaced first accordingly. But making a general model for all is not that simple, especially when there has to be a perfect balance between the academic research and also making it as realistic to the main scenario so that it can be applied on the field cables. Thus, the focus of the thesis is on observation of the physics-based processes taking place due to the effect of elevated temperatures on HPGC and the electro-thermal effect resulting in aging of insulation.<br/><br/>The whole research was divided into three sub questions leading to solving the big problem eventually:<br/><br/>1) How does the insulation degrade when the field aged HPGC are elevated to higher temperatures, but lower than the maximum designed temperature?<br/><br/>2) Can diagnostic tests be developed or modified focusing on the material physics inside the insulation that can be performed on the cable alongside Tan Delta at 50 Hz and Partial Discharge Measurements, that is viable in field with least online time?<br/><br/>3) What parameters can be extracted from measurements to develop a robust model that determines the degradation of HPGC insulation with thermal and electrical aging?<br/><br/>Initially, the cable loading profile was obtained from TenneT, cleaned using Machine Learning Algorithms and IEC Standard was applied to evaluate its operating temperature for last decade. Then, Fast, Short-Term Ramps as well as Long-Term Step AC Stress Tests were conducted on the samples to develop an aging model and evaluate the sensitivity of aging with elevated temperature. Once, an overall model has been developed, an electronic measurement box was designed to measure the Polarization and Depolarization currents (PDC) from unaged and aged samples. This was combined with a novel model developed using Frequency Dielectric Spectroscopy (FDS) for short duration online tests, and Partial Discharge (PD) Characterization. Using all the parameters obtained from the models fitted on the measurements of the experiments, trends were observed for these parameters which indicated the dielectric degradation with thermal aging. The conclusion clearly demonstrates how these indicators can be used during field tests to predict the progress of aging for these cables.<br","Aging; Statistics; Modelling; Experimentation; HV Cables","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-03-31","","","","Electrical Engineering | Electrical Power Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This master thesis' main objective is to develop a parametric design tool which improves the design process and explores the building typologies of a hybrid modular timber construction based on global and local structural requirements. The hybrid modular timber construction is core-less and combines load-bearing and corner-supported modules. The parametric design tool, which is named Habitat21, consists of an automatic placement function (Grasshopper), a manual placement function (Rhinoceros) and a structural analysis program (Karamba). The hybrid modular timber construction concept is tested by comparing the displacements in the x- and y-direction of a replicate of Hotel Jakarta, generated in Habitat21, with the original displacements in the x- and y-direction of Hotel Jakarta, generated by the case study of Gijzen. It appears that the replicated hybrid modular timber construction of Hotel Jakarta in Habitat 21 is able to approximately reproduce the original displacement in the y-direction of Hotel Jakarta calculated by Gijzen (difference of 0.642 mm). However, the displacement in the x-direction could not be reproduced in the same order of magnitude as the original displacement in the x-direction (difference of 13.081 mm). This could be caused by the fact the assumed inter-module connections, connection 1 and 4, of the hybrid modular timber construction concept were modelled as line elements with two hinges (”pendelstaven”), this could have influenced the displacement behaviour of the CLT shear wall mechanism. To examine the usability of the manual placement of the modules by Rhinoceros within Habitat21 a workshop with 5 participants (2 architects and 3 engineers) and two cases is performed. In the first case each participant created 3 buildings, each building was generated within 8 minutes, resulting in a total of fifteen different building typologies of the hybrid modular timber construction concept. Ten out of the fifteen building typologies satisfied the global structural requirements, five did not satisfy the global structural requirements. Two buildings were not stable in one or more directions, two buildings did not satisfy the unit check for the displacement in the x-, y- or z-direction and for one building an error occurred. To explore the diversity of the typologies from the fifteen buildings a typology score was given for each building. The highest score was 102 points and the lowest score was 10. This indicates a relatively large diversity in typologies. In the second case each participant worked on two buildings that both did not satisfy the global and local structural requirements but the second building had 2 extra design restrictions. The participants had 5 minutes per building to fix this. For the building with extra design restrictions three participants (all engineers) were not able to meet the local structural requirements. This suggests that the feedback from Habitat21 provided to the user in this case was not adequate. To examine the automatic placement of the modules by Grasshopper within Habitat21 the calculation time of the automatic placement of one extra CLT shear wall is analysed for 6 different buildings by using an iterative process. These buildings were all stable in the y- and z-direction but unstable in the x-direction. The calculation time for the placement of the extra CLT shear wall at a building with 4 modules and 8 possible positions was 6 seconds and the calculation time for the placement of the extra CLT shear wall at a building with 24 modules and 48 possible positions was 360 seconds. Combining the calculation times of the 6 different buildings it appeared that the calculation time increased exponentially when the amount of modules increased linearly. In conclusion, it was possible to discretize a hybrid modular timber construction in a parametric design tool. Furthermore, both engineers and architects were able to work with the tool and to independently create diverse typologies of a hybrid modular timber construction. The boundaries of the hybrid modular timber construction concept in Habitat 21 were determined by the inter-module connections, as found in the comparison study with Hotel Jakarta. The applicability of the parametric design tool and the hybrid modular timber construction concept could be increased by more research into inter-module connections and point supported cross-laminated timber slabs. Also, feedback about how the structural systems works could be implemented in the parametric design tool, where the user gets necessary feedback to fulfill the global or local structural requirements instead of using a trial and error design method.","Parametric Design; Parametric design tool; Modular construction; Timber; Karamba","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering - Structural Design","",""

Although, real world conditions largely differ from this standard. Energy yield of photovoltaic modules at a certain location gives a clear indication of the performance of the module exposed to varying weather conditions. Photovoltaic Materials and Devices (PVMD) Toolbox developed at Delft University of Technology and implemented in MATLAB®, aims to simulate energy yield of photovoltaic modules while providing the flexibility of modifying cell-level to module-level parameters of the device. Accurately determining the irradiance falling on the module at a certain location and simulating the electrical properties of a solar cell at realistic conditions is crucial in determining the yield generated by a module. Due to the promising results displayed by the technology, in this study, energy yield of perovskite/c-Si tandem modules are simulated using newly developed daylight and parameter extraction models in PVMD toolbox. Due to high computational efficiency and functionality offered, Preetham daylight model is implemented as an improvement to Perez model currently used in PVMD toolbox. The model considers the effect of Rayleigh and Mie scattering, and turbidity of atmosphere in determining the distribution of diffuse irradiance across the skydome. By implementing the model, three factors can now be determined: luminance distribution, RGB co-ordinates and relative spectral power distribution over the skydome for any location. Luminance is calculated for every point in sky using Perez parametric function that use coefficients derived from simulated data for different sun directions and turbidity values. For all locations considered, Preetham model calculates higher luminance over the year by ~2%. Calculated luminance values normalized against zenith luminance is used to derive CIE xyY values and consecutively, the RGB co-ordinates that are rendered real-time to create images of the skydome for every hour in chosen timeframe. By calculating the relative spectral power distribution, analysis of incident light falling on the module from all points of the skydome is possible which especially deems useful for modelling tandem modules. To accurately simulate electrical properties of solar cell under varying operating conditions, parameter extraction model for simulated ASA J-V curves is implemented using an analytical method. For the c-Si and perovskite cells considered in the study, the reconstructed curves using extracted parameters fits ASA curve with RMSE or 1.98% and 3.02% respectively at STC. Using these models introduced in this study, energy yield of mono-facial and bi-facial 2T/4T tandem modules are calculated and analyzed for Rome, Reykjavik and Alice Springs. Depending on air mass of a location, perovskite thickness of mono-facial 2T tandem devices are optimized to produce maximum specific yield. All considered modules generate highest yield at Alice Springs due to high insolation at the location.

With an increase in perovskite thickness, energy yield of 2T bi-facial modules increase significantly for high albedo while it drops beyond the optimum thickness due to current mismatch for low albedo.

However, the Netherlands is struggling to make progress in the energy transition, with only 8,6% of the final energy consumption being generated by renewables in 2019 (CBS, 2020b). To fix this renewable energy generation lag, it is crucial that a thorough understanding is created of how the energy system works, and what its drivers and barriers are. Among others, literature research shows that two of the biggest barriers for the generation of renewable energy are governmental policy as well as investments costs. The fact that governmental policy is one of the biggest barriers is extremely counterintuitive as it is also one of the biggest drivers. Furthermore, although renewable energy generation requires substantially high investment costs, other countries have been able to overcome this barrier, which raises the question as to why this has not yet been the case for the Netherlands. Due to their contradictory nature and their high level of influence, the decision was made to focus on the two barriers by researching the relationship between governmental policy and the investment climate surrounding renewable energy generation. This was done by analysing the effectiveness of policy instruments on the investment climate for two specific technologies, namely smallscale solar photovoltaics (PV) and thermal energy from surface water (TEO).","multi-level perspective; multi-criteria analysis; investment climate; renewable energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In order to understand the long term behavior of intertidal ridge-runnel systems high resolution spatial and temporal data covering extended periods of time is needed. Such datasets are still rare but are becoming more available through the usage of remote sensing technologies such as Argus and Terrestrial Laser Scanning. A three month period (Feb – April 2020) with data obtained by laser scanning at the beach of Noordwijk, the Netherlands, has been analysed to evaluate the longshore variability of rip channels. During this period varying weather conditions occurred. The timeseries consist out of snapshots taken around the occurrence of the lowest tidal water level each day, containing elevation data of an 1km alongshore section of the beach. Each scan in this timeseries is processed in order to remove noise, objects and correct for time dependent rotations. The spatial gaps in the scans present in the data as the result of flowing or standing water are interpolated using a 2D grid interpolation method. The analysis is done using two different methods: a 1D-method using longshore elevation transacts, and a more advanced 4D-Object-by-Change based upon elevation changes over time. The 1D-method detected 44 rip channels that existed for multiple days, with an average alongshore migration rate of 1.55 m/day. The average spacing between rip channels was found to be 131 meters. The 4D-OBC detected less rip channel when compared to the 1D-method but did capture other morphological features such a runnels. A comparison of the alongshore migration rates and the dominant wave and wind directions that during this period showed a correlation between wind and wave direction and the direction of the alongshore migration direction, however some exceptions are visible. Comparing this research to similar research and literature did show differences in the migration rates and rip spacing. These are explained by the different nature of both datasets (2D vs 3D) and methodology used in the detection of rip channels.","Intertidal zone; Rip channels; Alongshore variability; Channel migration; Channel spacing; Laser scanning; Ridge-runnel systems; Remote Sensing; 4D-objects-by-change","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But their commercialization is far from fruition, due to persistent issues. Stability under prolonged exposure to external stresses is a major concern. Furthermore, the adaption of upscaling technologies in research is presently slow. This research is done on a fully scalable architecture, fabricated with technologies adaptable to mass-production. Variations in active layer (dual cation and triple cation) and Electron Transport Layer are designed into different stack combinations to discriminate the more resilient stack. Long-term stability of these stacks is tested by accelerated thermal test and light-soaking test. Light-soaking test is done from different sides and with a filter to determine the difference in behaviour of samples. From thermal testing, the dual cation perovskite was found to be more resilient. In light-soaking tests done from side of glass, all stacks failed, while the stacks illuminated from side of ETL showed a far better performance. The dual cation perovskite was again found to be more resilient. Despite the performance loss, none of the stacks demonstrated significant degradation in perovskite layer under XRD or photoluminescence. Therefore, recombination mechanisms were studied under light-intensity measurements. The presence of carrier collection problems across stacks and degradation of HTL particularly in samples of glass-side exposure are determined to be the probable cause.","Perovskite solar cells; Long-term stability; Scalability; Upscaling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-15","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Currently, there is little knowledge about the process of a secured trace to a result used in court.<br/> Crime scene investigators are confronted with multiple decisions during the investigation and it is important to know with what goal in mind an investigator acts on the crime scene, as this influences the decision-making.

Therefore, users of information systems have to become more security aware. The reasonable solution to these human shortcomings was to provide users with policies that tell them what to do and have the technical systems behind them for support. However, within an organisational environment, information technology is increasingly needed for the completion of work activities. This creates problems for users to follow policies that require an excessive amount of effort and introduces human errors. Mainly caused by employees feeling like the amount of effort is unreasonable and not fitting into their daily work activities (Kirlappos, Parkin, &amp; Sasse, 2014). Subsequently, cyber attacks are mostly caused by liabilities created due to the human error and social engineering (Schneier, 2015). Therefore, it is of importance for organisations to find a way to manage security in an effective manner, by taking into account the interactions between the social and physical environment. Accordingly, there is a possibility that employees find complying to security rules and procedures to have higher costs than benefits to their company. Finally, it is fundamental to find aspects where the business and security processes clash, in order to improve the security and productivity of the organisation (Beautement, Becker, Parkin, Krol, &amp; Sasse, 2016).","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

The municipalit aims to cut down the use of natural gas for space heating in order to reduce its impact on the natural environment. For the Geerdinkhof neighborhood in Amsterdam South-East, the municipality is planning to implement a district heating system. These systems make use of a collective heat source and rely on underground isolated pipelines to deliver the heat to the end-user. These systems are a significant investment in infrastructure and require adjustments to households before they are suitable for this type of system. A heat transition like the one in Geerdinkhof is a significant challenge, as the heating alternatives that are considered are sometimes met with some resistance from households. Households might not always want to switch to a heating alternative for a variety of reasons. The heat transition therefore becomes a question of social acceptance: are households going to make use of this new system or will they resist the implementation? This master thesis is an exploratory study into reasons for social non-acceptance of a new residential heating system in Geerdinkhof, Amsterdam. Given the long life-time of energy systems and large investments necessary, the municipality of Amsterdam is interested in identifying reasons households might not accept a new heating technology. This thesis makes use of the theory on human values, value change and value conflicts to evaluate how households are affected by a heating alternative in their value fulfillment. In order to simulate the effects different configurations of heating alternatives can have on the human values of households, an agent-based model is constructed. This model is used to anticipate possible value conflicts households could experience in a transition to a new residential heating system. Three recommendations are made to the municipality of Amsterdam in support of social acceptance of a new heating alternative in Geerdinkhof: increase the affordability of the system through subsidies, prioritize household insulation for increased thermal comfort and answer to the Geerdinkhof neighborhood characteristics. The households in this neighborhood might require higher levels of participation, ownership and overall inclusion before they are to socially accept the heating alternative.","social acceptance; Value Conflicts; Agent-Based Modeling & Simulation; value change; District heating; Sustainable heating","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Amongst the different measures to lower the impact of road transportation on the environment is the use of biofuels, especially for heavy duty vehicles. For biofuels to be affordable and well integrated, improvements in the production process in terms of energy performance and economic feasibility need to be made.<br/><br/>Consequently, this thesis aims at the techno-economic assessment of the integration of pyrolysis oil gasification with electrolysis and syngas catalytic upgrading. Oxygen, being a co-product of electrolysis, is used as an oxidizer for entrained flow gasification of biomass derived pyrolysis oil. Hydrogen from the electrolyzer is used to enhance the production of biofuel. The process was designed to have a high-temperature solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) and the biofuel was chosen to be compressed natural gas (bio-CNG). The modeling of the process was performed on Aspen Plus software and calculations of parameters for the gasifier and electrolyzer were done using Fortran and Matlab respectively.<br/>As aimed by the integration of electrolysis, the hydrogen produced is added to the syngas to obtain a feed ratio of 3, required for an optimum methane production. The increase in the feed ratio at the level of the gasifier is mainly limited by the oxygen equivalence ratio (OER), considering the extent of combustion reactions and the operating temperature. The amount of steam inputted was found to increase the molar ratio of H2 to CO without significant change in the feed ratio due to the increase in the concentration of CO2. However, steam was still necessary for adjusting the temperature of the gasifier to values that are in accordance with experimental ones in literature. The obtained final product stream of bio-CNG at 250 bar and 15℃ has a purity of 98.63 mol% and 99.15 wt%. <br/><br/>Moreover, by applying heat integration to the process, the resulting surplus heat was 10.71 MW, which was assumed to be used to generate steam that is inputted to the SOEC for producing hydrogen as an additional product. The process was found to have an overall efficiency of 73.8% (LHV basis) and 78.2% (HHV basis). Heat integration increased the process efficiency by 15% (LHV basis) and 23% (HHV basis), by removing to a great extent the need for external heat and by having hydrogen as an energy output added to CNG. <br/>As a complement to the energy performance, the economic feasibility of the process was assessed. The total capital investment was found to be 889.5 Euros/kWinput, the net present value was 6.0342 million Euros and the rate of return on investment 30.02%.","Process Integration; Biofuels; methane; Gasification; Electrolysis; Aspen Plus","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

However, when families face the loss of their loved ones, the emergence of grief is unavoidable. Grieving itself is a normal phenomenon, but due to the untimely intervention, some people’s normal grief eventually turns into complicated grief, which negatively impacts their physical and mental health. Therefore, patients’ families also need to be supported during their grieving process. However, each person’s grief response is different, which can be influenced by various factors such as culture, age and gender. This project aims to support the psychological needs of Chinese teenagers facing the loss of their loved ones.<br/><br/>Adolescents are at a more sensitive stage. They are beginning to form their values and already can understand what death is, but at the same time are not as mature as adults. At the same time, due to the Chinese culture -- seldom emphasising personal feelings expression and even having a habit of hiding negative emotions -- grieved teenagers are often refuse to express their needs and therefore do not receive timely psychological support.<br/><br/>Therefore, with the guidance of the 13 fundamental needs proposed by Pieter Desmet and Steven Fokkinga, this project explores the psychological needs that emerged during the teenagers’ grieving. Also, through interviews, participatory observation, and generative sessions, multiple stakeholders were understood and analysed to identify better roles and scenarios for support.<br/><br/>Finally, based on the research results, a toolkit called ‘Book of Answers’ was developed. This toolkit aims to be used by classmates to support teenagers’ recognition and community psychological needs who have lost their parents. With the help of the toolkit, the classmates will learn knowledge about bereavement and kindness expressions and then work as a group to create a ‘book of answers’ formed by self-made comfort cards. This book will be delivered<br/><br/>to the bereaved teenager eventually, conveying classmates’ goodwill at the same time. It is worth noting that although the classmates were the main users of the toolkit, teachers and bereaved teenagers’ parents were also involved in the final concept, working as a system.<br/>Therefore, in the final evaluation, not only ordinary middle school students, but also teachers in school and a person who experienced parental loss evaluated the final design, all of whom commented on the concept positively. It could be said that this final solution supports the psychological needs of the bereaved teenagers, also provides education for the general students, and the proposed toolkit opens up new possibilities for psychological education in schools.","Teenagers; Psychological need; Grief; Bereavement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

This combined with an annual projected growth of 10% in online orders urges society to rethink ecommerce packaging (Topsector Logistiek, 2020). This graduation project is performed for Goodcase. The startup aims to accelerate the shift towards a sustainable diet by offering sustainable foods from Dutch startups directly to the customer. The goal of this project is to find the most sustainable way of transporting perishable goods for Goodcase. BOKS is the frontrunner in a new era of packaging in ecommerce. It is part of a system where material resources are circulating within a closed loop: the circular economy. This paradigm puts emphasis on designing out waste. Switching from single use to reusables fits in this philosophy. This switch is critical to sustainably deal with the resources our planet has to offer. Switching to BOKS prevents the creation of excessive waste and therefore decreases the environmental impact of insulative ecommerce packaging.BOKS is specifically designed to assist webshops transporting perishable goods directly to their customers. These foods need to stay under 5 °C during transport. The optimal configuration of BOKS is designed using a parametric thermodynamic model.The walls of BOKS are filled with a 25 mm organic hemp layer. The insulative principle of hemp is similar to wool; small air pockets in the material prevent heat from transferring through. Due to this insulation layer the products stay cooled consistently for up to 36 Hours. Within this timeframe two delivery moments can be achieved with a success rate of 99.9%. This is what makes BOKS the most reliable way of sending cooled perishable goods!BOKS is designed for contin-use, it should flow from stakeholder to stakeholder. A fast track life cycle analysis model is used to minimize its environmental impact. It could be reused up to 100 times and therefore saves up to 37.1 kg of single use packaging, insulation and buffer materials. The folding mechanism results in a 40% volume reduction which makes BOKS efficient in logistics and more manageable to handle for its users. The CO2 emissions per trip are 68.32% less compared to a single use cardboard box. This in combination with 40% recycled materials in the outer layer, BOKS is a sustainable contender for transporting perishable goods!BOKS flows from Goodcase Packaging to the webshop, where it is subsequently packed and delivered to the logistics party. They deliver it directly to the customer, who returns it at their local supermarket or drop-off point. From there on, the BOKSES are shipped back to Goodcase Packaging in bulk. At Goodcase Packaging they are cleaned and inspected before sending them out for their next loop!BOKS is designed with all aforementioned stakeholders in mind. It was found that a reward program is crucial to incentivise each stakeholder to keep passing BOKS on. This reward program aims to actively involve both the webshop and the customer.BOKS has been tested and proven to perform up to most of the requirements. However, further development is required to make the concept of BOKS ready to be used in the real environment.","Circular; Insulation; Ecommerce; Packaging","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

The panel method developed has been validated against the MIRAS software and CFD results. The results of the optimization are compared against the Glauert optimum blade. The blade is parameterized using NACA profiles and the twist and chord are used as design<br/>variables. Two optimizations have been performed: an unconstrained optimization, which has shown to take advantage of limitations of the panel method model; a second optimization is performed applying a thrust constraint and with tighter bounds on the design variables, which is capable of achieving realistic results. The main conclusion is that realistic blade designs can be achieved using a fixed wake panel method for aerodynamic optimization, although ultimately the performance of these designs should be assessed using<br/>higher fidelity models.","optimization; panel method; method of moving asymptotes; Wind turbine blade; Shape Optimisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM) | Rotor Design Track","",""

This poses a threat primarily to all manner of infrastructure built directly on and near the coastline. With climate change the coastal erosion is expected to increase. This effect is expected to be especially severe in the continuous permafrost region, as the coastal erosion is linked with the increase in thermoerosion of the permafrost. A remote sensing method with high coverage and sufficient temporal observation frequency at lower cost than from aerial photography would be practical to mitigate the problem. This would enable assessing and predicting (potential) damage to existing infrastructure and planning of its future locations. A thresholding method based on TerraSAR-X x-band synthetic aperture radar observations is applied to lower resolution Sentinel-1 c-band synthetic aperture radar observations monitor the coastal erosion rates. This study aims to determine the feasibility of using this method with Sentinel- 1 data. For this purpose, the method is applied to Senteinel-1 Backscatter scenes and the Coherence between scenes within each year from 2016 to 2020 at three sample sites on Herschel Island (Beaufort Sea, northern Canada). The method was successfully applied to the Sentinel-1 Backscatter data, yielding reliable and accurate results for one of the sample sites, with the highest estimated erosion rate of the three sites. The same technique was applied to the Coherence data. The obtained results were less reliable compared to the results from the Backscatter data, showing too high variance. The results indicate that the application is generally limited to the summer season and to coastlines oriented towards or parallel to the looking direction of the SAR sensor. The results are compared to previous studies of coastal erosion rates on Hershel Island or the nearby northern Yukon coastline region.","Remote Sensing; Synthetic Aperture Radar; Erosion; Environmental Impact Assessment; Climate change; Sentinel-1; coastal erosion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Geophysics | IDEA League","","69.5833, 139.0226"

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Replacing conventional kerosene has gained interest in an effort to make aviation more sustainable. In 2018 a total of 895 million tonnes of CO2 was emitted, equivalent to 2% of global CO2 emissions. For normal passenger and cargo planes synthetic kerosene is most feasible to replace conventional kerosene, hydrogen powered or electricity driven airplanes face problems and may only be feasible for small airplanes. Increased interest in electrolysis, direct air capture (DAC) and production pathways for synthetic kerosene has encouraged development and reduced the price gap with conventional kerosene. Although small pilot plants are realized last decade, little research has been done on large-scale studies. And most research is focused on one method, while an integrated system can be promising either. This thesis focused on both topics, taking Rotterdam-The Hague Airport as reference airport. Syngas will be obtained from biomass gasification and water electrolysis with a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer. CO2 to form CO is retrieved from a DAC plant. The syngas is converted into fuel by Fischer-Tropsch (FT) technology. Several gasification technologies were studied and the direct heated steam/oxygen fluidized bed gasifier was found to be the best option. This gasifier was built and validated according to the Institute of Gas Technology (IGT) gasifier located in Hawaii. In order to accurately estimate the behavior of the process, a steady state model is developed using Aspen Plus. Two scenarios are defined and represent the intermittent behavior of renewable electricity. The first scenario simulates high renewable electricity production, while the second scenario is driven by low supply of electricity. Biomass gasification is integrated to remain a constant syngas flow for the FT reactor and subsequent kerosene production. To reach the intended annual kerosene production of 50.000 ton, it was found that a gasifier with a maximum capacity of 100 ton/h is required. Thermal efficiencies of 35% and 33% are achieved for scenario 1 and 2 respectively, taking gasoline, diesel and waxes into account as useful side-products. Total land-area required to fulfill electricity demand equals 0.9km2 of solar panels together with a wind farm covering 3.6km2 assuming turbines of 10MW. A cost analysis has been conducted to investigate the economical feasibility of the project. The average fuel price obtained in this project reached 1.74-2.87 euro/kg, exceeding conventional fuel prices. But estimated price reductions and technical improvements for wind/solar power, PEM electrolysis and DAC decrease the fuel price to 1.49-2.78 euro/kg by 2050. In addition, carbon taxes are expected to increase hence reducing the gap between conventional and synthetic kerosene even more. Future research and development must focus on extending and improving the model to acquire more precise results. Furthermore, improvements have to be made for electrolysis and DAC plants before they are economically competitive and suitable for large scale. In conclusion, the models in this thesis have shown promising results in terms of future feasibility of large scale synthetic kerosene production in an integrated system. It has proved that when future developments are realised and DAC and PEM electrolysis have become more mature, the price gap between conventional and synthetic kerosene can be overcome and large scale projects become feasible.","Synthetic kerosene; Direct air capture; Electrolysis; Biomass gasification; Techno-economic analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-08-23","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Atmospheric conditions are modelled using the turbulent models recommended by the IEC: the Mann model and the IEC Kaimal and exponential coherence model. Model parameters are fitted to measurements at the FINO-1 platform to generate turbulent boxes that are as close as possible to measurements. The simulations are carried out using OpenFAST for three mean wind speeds: 7.5, 12 and 16 m/s and the power law wind profile is used with fitted shear exponent. The motions, wind, loads spectra are quantified using the WAFO toolbox and the loads are assessed with short-term damage-equivalent loads using MLife. Depending on the wind model, global motions differ by up to 52%. Generally, Kaimal resulted in higher surge and pitch motions, and the opposite was found for the yaw motions. The influence of atmospheric stability on global motions was found to be important as well, unstable conditions giving the largest motions and stable conditions the lowest. It was observed that the wind model influenced the fairlead tension and tower top loads. Mann resulted in up to 35% higher loads on the tower top yaw moment and Kaimal resulted in up to 30% higher fairlead tension loads. Tower base fore-aft bending moment and blade root out-of-plane moment were not very sensitive to the choice of wind model. Atmospheric stability had an influence on all loads by up to 30%. Unstable conditions led to the most damage while stable conditions generally led to the least. Whether the choice of the wind model or the change in atmospheric<br/>stability has more influence on the global motions of the platform and the loads depended on the wind speed, the degree of freedom or the load considered. It was found that wind models should always consider atmospheric conditions, not only neutral. Finally, impact of Mann turbulence model parameter variations on the wind, global motions and loads was investigated.

This thesis builds a Data-Driven Agent-based Model grounded in Theory of Planned Behavior, initialised with synthetic household population for a case-study of Albany County, (New York, USA). It uses network modelling to study how social network structures influence adoption rates of different communities. Results show that flat tax-credit schemes can result in poor adoption rates in segregated networks, with performance worsening if the network size is small. Seeding policies and information agents, do not necessarily result in better adoption rates, highlighting the importance of trusted information sources than mass communicators. The resulting understanding of social networks’ influence over adoption of energy-efficient technologies can assist policy-makers in designing energy policy interventions that improve access of clean energy technologies for all socioeconomic groups.","Agent based model; Just Transition; Solar PV adoption; social networks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

(graduation committee); Bhardwaj, Rajat (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The Dutch energy-intensive industry relies heavily on fossil-fuelled energy sources for production processes, being responsible for one third of CO2 emissions in the Netherlands. The road to CO2 neutrality by 2050 requires a massive transformation of the industrial sector: sustainable supply and (re-)use of industrial heat, CO2 capture and storage and improved efficiency and circularity are some of the routes that the transition of industry may follow. In the light of the European Green Deal, a rapid mobilization of investments is required in order to reap their benefits before 2050. In this context, new forms of cooperation within energy-intensive industrial clusters have the potential to accelerate the delivery of innovative solutions. Multi-actor and technical dependencies offer synergetic possibilities that make collaborative decision-making of great importance in a situation of profound transformation. The challenge is to understand how to systematically manage and govern such inter-firm collaborations to favour the transition of industrial clusters, while balancing actor profit and cluster welfare. Formal governance mechanisms such as bi- and multilateral contracts play a critical role in this respect, regulating the distribution of costs and benefits of investment projects, while consolidating the exchange of the resulting products to reduce the uncertainty of flows. As a result, the adoption of different forms of contracts needs to be carefully considered when evaluating investment options for decarbonization. Although the transition of the energy-intensive industry has been studied from different angles, current approaches fall short in analysing and understanding the relation between the technical (hardware) level and multi-actor (and institutional) context of an industrial complex. However, integrated methods and tools are needed to identify optimal transition paths, while enabling a dynamic evaluation of investments decisions under diverse multi-actor configurations. This thesis addresses the problem by means of the following main research question: “What are the implications of implementing contractual structures in optimization models to support optimal investment decisions in the decarbonization of industrial clusters?” Answering this question requires an exploratory research design combined with a modelling approach. The initial exploratory steps involve gaining insight in the field of contractual governance using elements of Transaction Costs Economics and Game Theory. A case study analysis of the industrial cluster located in the Port of Rotterdam is conducted alongside the literature study, analysing key investment projects for decarbonization and the underlying contractual network. As part of the hard-to-electrify (and therefore hard-to-abate) sectors, the Rotterdam cluster attempts to transition to a new energy system by switching from fossil fuels to electricity, low-carbon hydrogen and green hydrogen. Thus, a focus on hydrogen as fuel and for power generation is established with respect to investments’ evaluation. As a final step resulting from the exploratory approach, hypotheses on the impact of contracts on the transition of industrial clusters are formulated, together with the experimental setup required for hypotheses’ testing. The information gathered in the exploratory steps serves as input to develop a novel methodology to incorporate contractual structures in optimization models. The output of these research steps is translated into an integrated optimization model of the Rotterdam cluster using Linny-R, a software tool developed by Dr. P.W.G. Bots that applies Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) optimization. Besides the quantification of results of hypothesis testing, the model provides a proof of concept of the developed methodology to include contractual structures in the analysis of investment decisions for the energy transition. In addition, the model provides measurable insights in the effects of contractual structures on the transformation of industrial clusters, specifying the cash flow of the total cluster and its distribution among individual actors as the main metric for the evaluation of the economic performance. Optimal investment curves and resulting CO2 emissions are finally analysed as determinants of the cash flows obtained from the model experiments. As a result, implications of the implementation of contracts in optimization models are observed and discussed. As part of the research outcomes it is found that, without an explicit implementation of contractual agreements, results obtained from MILP may be characterized by a distorted allocation of cash flows, in which sacrifices of some actors in the form of negative cash flows are compensated by higher profits of other cluster’s members. These kind of results are clearly misleading in the identification of an optimal transition path. Thus, the proposed methodology adds value to MILP-based approaches. The model results show that contracts do have an effect on the transition of the industrial sector. In fact, adopting different contractual structures shifts investment decisions overtime, affecting the timescale of investments and the associated CO2 reduction. Bilateral contracts seem to yield the highest benefits for the modelled system, both from an economic and environmental perspective, as contract terms are tailored to the specific needs of the contractual parties. This makes off-takers less constrained than with multilateral contracts, whose advantages can be fully observed in thick markets. Although the findings suggest that there may not be a universal, one-size-fits-all approach in establishing a set of contracts that best supports investment projects under all possible conditions, the proposed methodology is effective in providing direction for the next steps to make decarbonization projects an investable prospect in the energy-intensive industry. More precisely, barriers identified via the implementation of contracts specify areas of need for targeted policy action, addressing the creation of greater economic incentives for the integration of investment options. With specific respect to hydrogen applications, regulated revenue support in combination with policies recognising the higher social value of low-carbon/green hydrogen products may be relevant options to take into consideration. From a managerial perspective, the methodology allows to identify and address dependencies among investment options which may strengthen or jeopardize each other. Relevant examples for hydrogen integration are the need for increased CO2 savings and/or the need to complement green hydrogen with additional measures to capture refinery fuel gases to improve the business case of such projects. Other implications consist in the need to carefully rethink the relationship between producers and off-takers to gradually adapt it to market developments. As a general conclusion, implementing contractual structures in MILP enables a more accurate representation of the behaviour of rational actors, allowing for a dynamic analysis of the system’s behaviour. Not only the incentives arising for each contracting party are taken into account in selecting optimal transition paths, but also synergies and externalities arising from the combination of technical options are optimized. This generates more valuable insights from a multi-actor and system perspective. This research suggests several research avenues that can be pursued. First and foremost, further research should be conducted to provide understanding of possible consequences of combining diverse policy interventions with contractual structures. It is possible that contracts will play a greater role in determining the revenue generation of investment options when more policies that provide specific economic incentives for decarbonization are introduced. Moreover, besides incorporating a higher level of detail and improving input data, adjustments to the proposed model could be performed to simulate a shift in contractual structures that follows the (hydrogen) market developments. Moreover, additional model expansions could allow to examine the consequences of blue and green hydrogen integration on the incumbent grey hydrogen suppliers. Finally, building upon the results of this research, the performed study could be replicated for clusters in different locations. A cross-case analysis would then reveal whether location significantly influences the identification of optimal contractual structures to support the energy transition.","Mixed Integer Linear Programming; Energy-intensive clusters; Contractual arrangements; Cooperative relationships; Energy transition; petrochemical industry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

The new design, the INUTEQ ICE, is made for warehouse and factory workers. They need cooling vests, because they work in large buildings with flat roofs. Large buildings cannot be cooled by air-conditioning anymore and the sun can heat them up to tropical temperatures. Additionally, the temperature may, in some cases, be increased by the production processes inside. Working in the heat can decrease productivity, performance, comfort and safety. The physical work these people perform also increases their chances of heat related illnesses such as: heat rash, heat cramps or heat exhaustion. In some cases, overheating can even lead to a heat stroke.<br/>One of the solutions to cool people down is with cooling garments. The INUTEQ ICE is an improvement on traditional liquid circulation garments, which cool by running the water through silicone tubes. The new design makes use of open cell foam pads to increase the heat exchange between the cold water and the body. The developed cooling pad technology was found to have a nearly three times as high cooling capacity per unit area compared to liquid circulating cooling technology currently on the market. In the same experiment, the cooling capacity per unit area of the new pad technology was found to be similar to existing 6.5°C PCM packs and higher than 15°C and 21°C. The design has the potential to cool for longer than the 6.5°C PCM packs. Contrary to evaporation and air based cooling vest, the INUTEQ ICE is able to be used underneath enclosed clothing and in other high humid environments.<br/>The project contained three phases, an analysis phase, a development phase and an evaluation phase. In the analysis phase, relevant information about cooling garments and the target group is gathered. This information is brought together in a list of requirements. In the development phase, the cooling pad technology is developed and the cooling method is defined. The development phase ends with the first concept of the INUTEQ ICE. In the evaluation phase, a working prototype was made and user tested in the appropriate context, which provided useful insights towards the final concept. The evaluation phase also contains the previously mentioned cooling capacity test and recommendations to continue the project. <br/>The end result of the project is a promising final concept, with working prototype. The INUTEQ ICE has the potential to become a product that, in humid environments, performs better than alternative cooling garments. With further development it can be used by different target groups, not only factory and warehouse workers. It seems likely that a finished version of the INUTEQ ICE can add value to INUTEQ’s product range.<br","Personal cooling; Cooling vest; Liquid circulation; Liquid perfused cooling; Passive PCM; PCM; Foam; Pad; Factory; Warehouse","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","","51.941940, 4.229813"

One of the foremost symptoms of exacerbation of the heart is fluidcongestion in the lungs. One of the method to measure a change in biological tissue, such as thebuild­up of fluids in the lungs and chest, is bioimpedance measurements. By injecting an alternatingcurrent into the tissue, a voltage develops across the tissue that is proportional to the impedance ofthe biological tissue, the bioimpedance. Conventional bioimpedance measurement techniques are notsuitable for continuous monitoring of the patients as they are power consuming and hinder patient intheir daily living.This thesis proposes an alternative approach that is based on a pulse width modulation (PWM) inorder to convert the measured analog signals to time signals. To determine the measured bioimped­ance, the magnitude and phase should be derived. The proposed design employs one channel toconvert the measured voltage across the bioimpedance to a PWM signal. As this PWM signal con­tains the amplitude information of the measured voltage, the magnitude of the bioimpedance can bederived. Furthermore, a second reference channel is employed where a known resistive reference isconverted to another PWM signal. By comparing the two PWM signals, the phase of the bioimpedancecan be determined. The proposed system requires only a comparator and triangular wave in order toconvert the measured analog signals, compared to the complex implementation of the conventionallyused analog­to­digital converter.In order to validate the design, the circuit is simulated and implemented on a printed circuit board (PCB). The PCB operates correctly on 3.3V and, additionally, an voltage­controlled current sourceis implemented and connected externally to the PCB to provide an excitation current of 100μA and10kHz to the circuit. The circuit should be capable of measuring the voltage across a device under test(퐷푈푇) that consist of resistive and capacitive components. This is because the bioimpedance can bemodelled by the Fricke­Morse model, which consist of a resistor in parallel with a capacitor and resistorin series. The implemented PCB can measure 퐷푈푇 magnitudes up to 1kΩ and is determine the phaseshift between the two PWM signals.This work shows an important contribution towards a wearable continuous bioimpedance measure­ments system to monitor patient that suffer from heart failure.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The duration of protection that COVID-19 vaccines provide is still uncertain (Murray &amp; Piot, 2021). Therefore, a possible future scenario is that the entire population will need an extra dose of a vaccine. Yearly recurring flu vaccinations take place at general practices (GP), so this might also be the case for COVID-19 vaccinations. General practitioners indicate that this would not be efficient. In fact, many general practitioners don’t want to execute any vaccinations, because their main job is to provide primary healthcare (Buckley, 2021). On the one hand, when considering the insights of general practitioners, the question arises whether it is desirable for GPs to take care of the vaccinations. On the other hand, immunization of an entire country is a huge operation, so it is important to know which contribution GPs can make to accomplish this task. To answer this question, the required performance of the system must be investigated. Therefore, the main research question is: What is the required performance of the vaccination system to keep the vaccination rate above a sufficient level and minimize virus spread, given uncertainties in vaccine supply and negative social influence regarding vaccinations? This research explores the interactions the concepts of social influence, service level (i.e. the ease of getting vaccinated) and willingness to vaccinate. Several experiments were run wherein negative social influence influences willingness to vaccinate in varying degrees. The same applies to the service level of the vaccination system, which is expressed in waiting times, vaccination speed and canceled appointments. Uncertain deliveries impacts the vaccination speed and the number of canceled appointments in a negative way. A lower average willingness to vaccinate leads to lower vaccination rate and stimulates virus spread. The minimum vaccination rate to achieve herd immunity is assumed to be 70% (Lippi &amp; Henry, 2021). Since an epidemic and willingness to vaccinate of a population are driven by social interactions, an Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) approach was chosen to conduct this research. Based on the findings of this research the following lessons learned have been formulated. First, it is recommended to focus on higher vaccination capacities in order to reduce the vaccination times and limit infections. Despite the fact that vaccinations can be executed more efficiently by GGDs and that many GPs are not willing to take care of vaccinations, the additional force of the GPs can be useful. Provided that they accept to spend 1 hour per day for 37 days, GPs can take care of 11% of the vaccinations. Therefore, the options should be discussed with them in order to convince them to take part in the vaccination campaign. Besides the 11% of the population that GPs can possibly vaccinate, another 89% percent of the population should be vaccinated. Therefore, re-establishment of (some of) the current mass vaccination sites would be a useful option to enable GGDs to work efficiently. Second, this research shows that the minimal required performance of the vaccination system to keep the vaccination rate above a sufficient level is low. That indicates that the willingness to vaccinate in the Netherlands is robust. Enormous increases in negative social influence, delays and low service levels didn’t cause significant disruptions of the willingness to vaccinate. Even in situations with 40% chance of delayed vaccine supplies and high values of negative social influence, the vaccination rate remains above 70%. However, it is still important take the effects of social influence and low service levels into account, because they might be stronger when the willingness to vaccinate is lower. That will possibly be the case when we are not in a crisis situation anymore. Suggestions for further research are making improvements in the model and investigating the actual importance of social influence on vaccination decision making. The last suggestion is to conduct experiments with the model proposed in this research, with the amount of patients that currently receive an influenza vaccination, instead of the entire population. With those experiments, it can be evaluated to what extent GPs can take care of the vaccinations when the number of patients is equal to the number of people that already visit the GP for a vaccination every year.","Vaccinations; Covid-19; Agent-Based Modeling; ABM; General practitioner; social influence; willingness to vaccinate; uncertain vaccine supply; service level; vaccination rate","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Not only does it allow us to track the movements of many individuals throughout time, it uncovers patterns in a persons decision making process that potentially tell us a lot about the effects of different interventions. The opportunity of finding new information on human behaviour has been noticed in several research fields, but every researcher eventually finds the same blockade: privacy. The data represents a detailed track of individuals and therefore these individuals must give approval (almost certainly lowering the amount of data that can be collected), or the data must be aggregated to the point that user anonymity is guaranteed. As a consequence of aggregated data, potentially important information could be lost. Especially in the case that both the dimension of location and time are aggregated, as these two could be considered as the essence of the CDR data. There are however techniques that increase the aggregation level, by de-aggregating the data. Naive Bayes classification has shown to be a functioning method within Machine Learning to de-aggregate a dataset that has incorporated information on at least one of the two essential dimensions; location in this case. By using the same variables to describe the administrative areas within the country that were used to describe the rows within the data, Naive Bayes classification can find the area that is most likely to fit the row. Matching the variables of the areas to the variables within the displacement dataset represents the backbone of the process, as the de-aggregation is driven by the closeness of datapoints between the two datasets.","Supervised classification; Humanitarian aid; Population movement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

(mentor); de Roode, S.R. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Due to the insufficient worldwide efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and related global warming, marine cloud brightening (MCB) is gaining interest as an instrument to artificially lower Earth's temperature. MCB is based on exploiting the aerosol-cloud effects to enhance the albedo of stratocumulus clouds and prolong their lifetime by injecting clouds with sea salt aerosols. As there are still many uncertainties in the expected output of MCB due to the unresolved questions related to cloud processes and feedback mechanisms, this thesis aims to assess the efficacy of MCB to enhance solar radiation reflection of stratocumulus clouds using the turbulence-resolving Dutch Atmospheric Large-Eddy Simulation model. This assessment is made by investigating which cloud properties and processes that determine the cloud's radiative forcing are affected by the aerosol injection for different meteorological conditions and injection strategies in 30-hour simulations. The simulation domain has a horizontal size of 25.2 $\times$ 25.2 km$^2$ and 2 km in the vertical, with a mesh size of 100 m horizontally and 20 m vertically. The two studied cloud cases are based on the measurements of the first and second research flights of the DYCOMS-II field experiment and are characteristic for a shallow stratocumulus-topped boundary layer (STBL). The investigated surface aerosol injection strategies are a horizontally uniform source and a point source that is restricted to a single grid cell. In addition, an assessment is made of the effects of differences in aerosol number concentrations between the STBL and the free troposphere on the cloud's aerosol number concentration and radiative properties. This is done in 6-hour simulations with and without a uniform aerosol source, based on the second research flight of DYCOMS-II. The simulated horizontal domain is 3.2 $\times$ 3.2 km$^2$ and 2 km in the vertical, with a mesh size of 25 m horizontally and 20 m vertically. Our simulations showed that boundary layers with relatively low background aerosol concentrations were most effective in generating a negative radiative forcing, compensating slightly less than half of the forcing related to the CO$_2$ doubling in the atmosphere. For boundary layers with an average background aerosol concentration, the radiative forcing approaches a quarter of this value, which diminishes to negligible effects for boundary layers with relatively high background aerosol concentrations. For precipitating boundary layers, the enhanced radiative forcing is mainly caused by its suppressing effect on precipitation. For non-precipitating boundary layers, the reduction in cloud droplet size showed to be the primary source of the enhancement. No pronounced differences in efficacy were found when using a homogeneously distributed aerosol source or a point source. For the two studied cloud cases, investigation of the contributions to changes in the liquid water path showed that to exploit the effect of aerosol injection on the liquid water path, it is most effective to suppress precipitation and enhance cloud cover. The differences in aerosol number concentration between the STBL and the free troposphere significantly and consistently altered the aerosol number concentration in the cloud layer due to the entrainment of air from just above the cloud-top into the cloud layer. This indicates that these differences in aerosol number concentration need to be considered when modelling MCB, as they change the intended aerosol number concentration enhancement and thereby affect their cloud-modifying effects.","Marine cloud brightening; cloud dynamics; albedo enhancement; aerosol effect","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Space Flight","",""

This thesis contributes to solving this problem by exploring the use of bleed air spoilers during the return phase in terms of their potential to improve the average cycle performance. To this end, a mathematical model is first introduced to evaluate the individual phases of the characteristic power pumping cycles in a general sense. This model is further used to demonstrate that a given kite configuration with the capacity to selectively lower its glide slope and/or resultant aerodynamic loading could improve the net power output of the system by around 30%. A CFD-based simulation environment for investigations of the effects induced by bleed air spoilers is developed using Simcenter STAR-CCM+. To establish the reliability of the setup, a first study revolves around its validation with experimental data from independent wind tunnel tests on bleed air spoilers effects on ram-air parachutes. The second CFD study is based on a standard kite geometry employed by SkySails Power GmbH. Two parameter studies testing the influence of spoiler size and chordwise position are carried out to investigate how bleed air spoilers are best used to reach the desired aerodynamic effects. The results show that bleed-air spoilers should ideally be applied in the vicinity of the suction peak and that relatively small spoiler geometries can already entail a major effect on the resultant flow field. It is predicted that the evaluated configurations would improve the system's overall performance by 9 to 18.3%, mostly due to substantial reductions in the glide ratio.","bleed air spoilers; Airborne Wind Energy; Power Cycle; Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-01","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","",""

The increased uncertainty and complexity of coordination, result in the companies’ necessity to innovate and obtain capabilities for responsiveness and decision¬ making. Hereby, creating supply chain visibility is crucial to oppose the problems supply chain managers are dealing with. However, in many cases limited insight exists into how the right information can be collected and how to receive the right information across the supply chain that is accurate, complete, in ¬time, and of high quality. A first step towards strengthening the supply chain visibility of FMCG enterprises, is by assessing the performance of the companies’ supply chain visibility. Therefore, this study aims to design of a comprehensive support tool to assess the maturity of supply chain visibility. An extensive literature study and empirical research is executed to gain insights into the trends, complexity drivers, and critical information in the FMCG industry. Additionally, the main barriers impeding supply chain visibility were investigated. Design science as methodology is used to transform the theoretical knowledge into a digital tool as operational assessment method. This tool was developed during an iterative process existing of two separate analyses: the Visibility Maturity Scan and a Detailed Supply/Demand Visibility Analysis. Validation sessions with FMCG managers were carried out to test the practicality, overall impression, and added value of the digital tools. The managers confirmed that the tool creates awareness for critical areas, identifies critical suppliers/customers, and provides support for setting action priorities. Also, it can be used as a regular health check and benchmark of the organization over multiple years. The Visibility Maturity Scan provides grip for FMCG companies and is valuable during the project definition phase, where critical areas within the supply chain can be identified more easily. It can be placed at the website, sent by email, or used during sessions as starting point for further project proposals. The Detailed Demand/Supply Analysis provides detailed insights into the maturity of customers and suppliers in the business-to-business perspective and can be used as part of a project or detailed analysis. The tool can be used for benchmarking to a limited extent, but is more appropriate to monitor improvement processes within the same organization over time. All in all, the tool offers priorities, constraints, and implications that enterprises face in the transition towards a visible supply chain.","Supply Chain Visibility; FMCG Industry; Supply Chain Management; Coordination; Support Tool; Information sharing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

In recent years, neural networks like multi-layer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks have proven to be the most powerful instruments for performing side-channel analysis. Recent work on this topic has focused on different aspects of these techniques, either to improve the performance of the resulting models, reduce the complexity or find new well-performing architectures. A part of these neural networks that has received relatively little attention is the loss function. Loss functions play a key role in how these networks learn since each of the weights in the network is updated to minimise the loss calculated by the loss function. Work on loss functions in other fields where deep learning is used shows that the choice of loss function impacts the performance of the resulting models. While there are two novel functions proposed specifically for side-channel analysis, no broad analysis of the performance of different functions has been done in this context.<br/>In this work, we provide such a broad comparison between different loss functions in the context of side-channel analysis and how they impact the performance of the resulting models. We show that novel, application-specific loss functions almost always outperform the current standard categorical cross-entropy. Besides that, we also show that state-of-the-art (multi-)loss functions from other domains can be successfully applied to side-channel analysis. Finally, we provide an overview of the strengths and weaknesses of the different loss functions in various side-channel analysis scenarios and use those to introduce our own novel loss function, the focal loss ratio. We show that this new loss function based on characteristics of other, well-performing loss functions, outperforms the previous best function in most SCA scenarios.","Side-channel analysis; Cyber Security; Loss Functions; Deep Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

(mentor); Draganov, D.S. (graduation committee); Weemstra, C. (graduation committee); Aurik, Mike (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The Dutch infrastructure counts many bridges, the majority of which are built in concrete. These bridges have been designed and constructed according to safety codes. A lot of these bridges date from the previous century and have been designed conform outdated safety codes. Therefore, the main problem<br/>of these bridges is the uncertainty with regard to their structural health as well as their performance under the current loading conditions.<br/>The application of ‘smart aggregates’ could potentially solve these issues. Smart aggregates refer to a network of sensors that emit and receive wave signals inside the concrete structure. These sensor are embedded within the concrete and can be implemented in both new and existing structures. The<br/>changes in the medium with regard to the stresses are reflected by the phase changes of the wave signal measured by the smart aggregates. This information allows for the monitoring of the conditions of the bridge during its lifespan. The magnitude of the stress in certain parts of the structure could then indicate the need for maintenance at an early stage, thus preventing unnecessary maintenance while preserving the safety of the bridge. This method, however, requires a thorough understanding of the wave propagation inside a concrete medium subjected to a stress state. This thesis investigates how the relative wave-velocity change of a concrete-like medium is influenced by the stresses to which it is subjected. Throughout the report this relation is referred to as the acoustoelastic effect. The first part of the thesis is centered around the theoretical formulation of the acoustoelastic effect. During this study, the models of Murnaghan and Biot have been studied. Subsequently, their differences with respect to the fundamental assumptions have been indicated. Here, it has been found that the main difference between the two models is demonstrated by the way they regard the second-order deformation terms. Murnaghan assumed that these terms are significant and has included them in the constitutive relation. From the latter, Hughes and Kelly have derived expression for wave velocities of a stressed medium, which have been verified with experimental results. On the other hand, Biot adopted the theory of infinitesimal deformations which omits the second-order deformation terms. In addition he based his theory around the wave propagation of a bending rod and extended this model to a three-dimensional medium subjected to initial stresses. This generalisation of an approximated model has led to analytical expressions for the wave velocity of a stressed solid which are contradicted by experiments. From this comparison, it has been concluded that Murnaghan’s model results in the most accurate representation of the acoustoelastic effect.<br/>The second part of the thesis focuses on the verification of the theoretical acoustoelastic effect through experimental research. For the purpose of verifying the acoustoelastic effect as well as determining the third-order elastic coefficients of a concrete-like medium, four specimens have been tested.<br/>In order to investigate the influence of the inhomogeneity of the material on the changes in the wave velocity, two different material compositions have been investigated. The first type consists of a homogeneous cement paste, whereas the second type represents heterogeneous concrete including<br/>aggregates. During the experiment, the different waveforms have been repeatedly emitted through a specimen subjected to an uniaxial compression. The relative wave-velocity change has then been obtained by post-processing the acquired data, which has been compared with Murnaghan’s model.<br/>The conclusion of this research is that Murnaghan’s theory can be used to accurately predict the relative wave-velocity changes of the cement-paste specimens, and in particular the relative P-wave velocity changes. The results have shown that the radial recordings yield inconsistencies which can be attributed to the small dimensions of the specimens. Furthermore, the influence of the inhomogeneity of the material on the relative wave-velocity changes manifests itself through a discrepancy in the acoustoelasticity.<br/>Here, it is found that the ratio between the aggregate size, the specimen dimensions and the wavelength of the signal determines the sensitivity to the acoustoelastic effect. Therefore, before the data from the smart aggregates embedded in a real structure can be interpreted, the experiments need to be improved and expanded. It is important to investigate the acoustoelasticity of waves with non-orthogonal propagation and particle-oscillation direction, while applying various stress states to the medium. This is because the smart aggregates are arranged in a network, where the signals are emitted signals are propagating through the structure via arbitrary paths between various transducers.","Concrete; Smart Aggregates; Coda Wave Interferometry; Structural Health Monitoring (SHM); Dynamics; Wave Propagation; Wave velocity; Stress wave propagation; Acoustoelastic effect","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Concrete Structures","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In recent years, Networked Control Systems (NCS) have become more popular, partly because of the increasing accessibility. In NCS, multiple plants and controllers are connected over a wired or wireless shared network, possibly having significant spatial separation. A major issue that arises is network congestion: If too many control loops are connected to the network, the shared communication channels become oversaturated, causing the packages to be lost, and subsequently the individual control loops might become unstable. One solution to this problem is to make use of Periodic Event Triggered Control (PETC), where a triggering condition is checked periodically, and if this condition is satisfied, the control loop is closed. Control using PETC becomes inherently aperiodic, as opposed to the periodic nature of standard control implementations. This aperiodicity introduces another issue: Avoiding collision of communication events caused by the triggering of control loops. To resolve this issue, schedulers have to be designed for the control loops. There are approaches already available that can automatically synthesize schedulers for a collection of PETC systems. However, these share a common issue in that these scale poorly with the number of subsystems. This thesis explores new algorithms for synthesization of schedulers for PETC systems, with the goal of better scalability. This is done by first abstracting the triggering behaviour of the individual control loops and representing these by Transition Systems (TSs). Then schedulers are synthesized by solving a safety game. To increase efficiency of the safety game, several states are combined by partitioning. Additionally, a major boost in performance is gained by representing the TSs by Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs). Finally, a method to increase schedulability is also investigated by allowing the control loops to occasionally trigger late.","periodic event-triggered control; networked control systems; Scheduling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

Through lowering financing costs, green QE leads to higher shares of green investment and green capital, apparent immediately after implementation. More green capital leads to higher shares of renewable energy which leads to lower levels of carbon emissions. In the most extensive policy alternative, this results in a mitigation of atmospheric temperature rise of approximately 12% compared to a baseline scenario, to approximately 6% in a limited policy alternative. Macroeconomic performance or the stability of the financial system are not affected by these policies in the short to medium term, and positively in the long term.

An experiment is conducted on a 45° swept wing in the anechoic wind tunnel at the Delft University of Technology. Stereoscopic PIV is employed to study the influence of the AC-DBD plasma actuator on the boundary layer velocity profiles. It is found that the AC-DBD plasma actuator is capable of directly decreasing the cross-flow component for various operating conditions. Moreover, as the Reynolds number is decreased, the authority of the actuator increases accordingly. In a second wind tunnel experiment in the same facility, the influence of the actuator on the cross-flow instability is monitored by performing 2D2C-PIV measurements at consecutive chord locations. As a result of the body force induced by the actuator, the cross-flow vortices shift position and feature a reduction in amplitude for the high frequency case of 5 kHz. Lower carrier frequencies are found to induce turbulent wedges due to the presence of strong localised plasma discharges. As a consequence, successful cross-flow instability control highly depends on the chosen carrier frequency and voltage, as well as the actuator lifetime and configuration. Although the changes in the transition front can not be observed here due to the consulted wing model, it is believed that the presented results provide an adequate overview of the influence of the AC-DBD plasma actuator on the cross-flow instability and add to the body of knowledge concerning AC-DBD plasma actuators and their application as flow control devices.<br","Cross-flow Instability; AC-DBD Plasma actuators; Stereoscopic Particle Image Velocimetry (SPIV); Boundary Layer Transition; Swept Wing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Aerodynamics","",""

They can be used to test unconventional stresses experienced by high voltage equipment. Before the realization of a full-scale prototype setup, it is necessary to validate the controller as it involves the complexity of communication and control of a large number of switches in the circuit while demanding accuracy in the generation of gate pulses. OPAL-RT was identified as a good solution for implementing the MMC control. This thesis intends to investigate two main objectives. Firstly, to evaluate the various capabilities of the OPAL-RT to implement control of MMC by performing simulations and testing it with real MMC with 12- submodules. Secondly, to design a PR controller for the MMC circuit and further validate it in real-time. The topology of MMC, as well as two modulation approaches – Phase-Shifted Carrier (PSC) and Nearest Level Control (NLC) were explored initially. This was followed by the filter design for 50 Hz and 1 kHz fundamental frequencies. Thereafter, the trade-offs for both control strategies based on the filter design requirement were examined. Furthermore, the various software tools included in OPAL-RT were investigated for potential use in the development of the control algorithm. To test the accuracy of gate pulses and the ability to generate precise waveforms for higher fundamental frequencies, Model-in-Loop testing with eFPGAsim is used. By realizing, the control algorithm in the CPU and the MMC in the FPGA, results obtained are compared with the offline simulations. It is observed that the minimum CPU time step is incapable of generating accurate waveforms for higher fundamental frequencies, resulting in missing or delayed gate pulses. Next, the control was implemented in the FPGA using internal PWM generators of the OPAL-RT and the MMC plant was tested both in the FPGA and as actual hardware. In PSC modulation, the phase shift between the upper and lower arm decides the switching pattern of the submodules, contributing to the building of the voltage level at any instant. In this case, the gate pulses’ phase difference between the lower and upper arms are noticed to be larger than what is observed from the offline simulations. These phase delays are resulting in the addition of delayed gate pulses at any instant causing strange switching voltage levels at the output, contributing to unexpected carrier harmonics. Furthermore, because the CPU samples the modulating signal before passing it to the FPGA for processing, it compensates for communication latency while also contributing to inaccuracy. Finally, a PR controller was designed and discretized for performing stability analysis, later implemented on the real-time setup. The PR controller resulted in suppressing the lower order harmonics by reducing them within the expected tolerance limits and the THD obtained was consistent with the results of the offline simulation.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

Alternative ways to promote mental well-being appear necessary. These could be provided by implementing design to mediate and promote positive activities through human-product interactions.

The most prominent impedance discontinuity is commonly represented by the crust-mantle boundary (Moho), which yet needs to be confirmed on Mars. A lot of care is taken to attenuate the spurious signals and the wind induced lander resonance, that contaminate the data, before the autocorrelation analysis. We further apply attribute filtering and reject data windows that exceed wind speed thresholds or reveal too large amplitudes at later lags, which are often related to residuals of artefacts or lander resonance.

We observe a good agreement in the autocorrelograms of the ambient noise and the marsquakes and determine several stable arrivals on the vertical component, in particular at 10.8 and 12.7 s, that we interpret as trapped P-waves, which are reflected between the surface and the potential Moho or other layer interfaces.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","class=""MsoNormal"">Quantum Markov Semigroups (QMS) describe the evolution of a quantum system by evolving a projection or density operator in time. QMS are generated by a generator obeying the well-known Lindblad equation. However, this is a difficult equation. Therefore, the result that the Lindblad form greatly simplifies in the case of the generator commuting with the modular automorphisms group, is useful. Unfortunately, the proof only works for finite dimensional Hilbert spaces, which is why the aim of this thesis is to generalise this result to countably infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces. To this end, the Lindblad equation is derived from both a mathematical and physical perspective. Where the former relies on rigorous proof and the latter relies on approximations.   In the rigorous case the theory of unital completely positive maps is used. Furthermore, multiple topologies are considered which put less stringent conditions on the operators of interest than the norm topology. Additionally, the Haar measure is used on the unitaries of the bounded linear operators to construct the explicit Lindblad form. To derive the result by employing physical assumptions the interaction picture is used. The physical derivation starts from the Von Neumann equation and uses multiple assumptions to obtain the final Lindblad form. The most important physical assumptions are: the Born approximation, the Markov approximation and the rotating wave approximation.   Furthermore, the main result is the generalisation of the simplified Lindblad form. This simplified form holds for generators commuting with the modular automorphisms group in case the Hilbert spaces are countably infinite dimensional. However, this requires the domain of the generator to be restricted to trace class operators with the identity operator artificially added. Additionally, the generator needs to map strongly convergent sequences to weakly convergent sequences. It also needs to be self-adjoint with respect to the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product. Lastly, the generator is assumed to be self-adjoint with respect to the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal (GNS) inner product &lt;X, Y&gt;=Tr(σ X*Y) for σ a density operator. This last assumption implies that the generator commutes with the modular automorphisms group, which is the symmetry we are considering. Hence, the two previous assumptions are the additional requirements needed to generalise the result, besides the restriction of the domain. Therefore, it is recommended for further research to generalise the result for the domain extended to the bounded operators B(H). It should be noted that the proof heavily relies on the Hilbert space structure induced by the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product. Consequently, the generalisation for the bounded operators would probably require a different approach. Another recommendation is to try and lift the sequence and self-adjoint requirements on the generator. In addition, it is interesting to investigate which physical systems actually have the symmetry of generators commuting with the modular automorphisms group.","Quantum Markov semigroup; Lindblad equation; bounded operators","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

These pipelines can cover up to several tens to hundreds of kilometres. Hydrocarbons are not the only fluids present within the pipelines, often they are filled with a mixture of oil, gas, water and even sand particles. The flow phenomena associated with this multiphase mixture complicate the transport operations of the industry. The operations covered in the present study are: flushing, batch transport and hydrate inhibition.% in which is focussed on the physical challenges on. <br/><br/>Simulation techniques exist to reproduce the multiphase flow phenomena. However, three-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models require very much computational power and the one-dimensional two-fluid models, such as OLGA and COMPAS, are not capable of capturing all involved flow phenomena. The goal of the present study is to develop a one-dimensional model of high accuracy to reproduce miscible fluid-fluid displacements in long pipelines, in which the focus is on the displacement within the aqueous phase of a multiphase mixture. The model must be able to reproduce slip velocities and gravity currents within this aqueous phase without solving the momentum equations. Furthermore, the model must account for turbulent dispersion, mass transfer, pipeline inclination and differences in thermodynamic properties of the fluids.<br/><br/>Two virtual regions are created in the model in which both fluids can be present. The upper region is associated with the less dense fluid and the lower region is related to the denser fluid. The mass of the regions is tracked by a mass conservation equation. To account for the changes in the concentrations of the fluids in the regions two advection-diffusion equations are solved. These three equations are coupled by exchange terms. The velocity variables are solved by a slip relation between the regions and by a velocity equation derived from the incompressibility condition. All equations are cross-sectionally averaged to ensure the one-dimensionality of the model. To reproduce the appropriate slip interface between the regions several slip relation functions are derived. An empirical relation for the turbulent axial dispersion is implemented in the advection-diffusion equations of the two regions. <br/><br/>The one-dimensional miscible fluid-fluid displacement model is discretised by employing a finite volume method on a staggered grid, by using the Crank-Nicolson time integration and different schemes for the advective terms. The diffusion terms are discretised by the central approximation method. The flow variables are solved by a coupled approach using Picard's method to linearise the nonlinear terms. Moreover, the possibilities of applying Newton's method for linearisation have also been studied. The model is validated by comparing the flow solution of a single-phase advection-diffusion equation to the analytical solution of a turbulent diffusion equation. Even the flow solutions obtained on relatively coarse grids turn out to be of high accuracy.<br/><br/>By simulating miscible fluid-fluid displacement cases it is shown that the model is able to reproduce slip velocities and gravity currents under different circumstances. A linear empirical relation for the volumetric transfer terms is derived by matching the numerical simulation results to experimental results and to CFD results of a specific miscible fluid-fluid displacement case. The CFD results were also obtained as a part of this study; thereto the Fluent CFD package was applied.

Governmental pressure to tackle this problem has forced the industry to adapt with regard to material development. One such adaption is the development and application of advanced high-strength steels (AHSS), offering high specific strength combined with improved ductility. This enables lightweighting of consumer cars, as well as improving the overall occupant safety and crashworthiness. Despite these apparent advantages of AHSS, sheet metal forming operations can cause unexpected edge-cracking. In this research the occurrence of edge-cracking is investigated and rationalized with fracture toughness testing. The Essential Work of Fracture (EWF) methodology is applied on double-edge notched (DENT) specimens, an increasingly applied method to characterize the crack propagation resistance of thin sheet metal. A novel sample preparation method is evaluated here, based on sheared notches instead of fatigue pre-cracked specimens. The obtained fracture toughness parameters are validated against laboratory-scale deep-drawing experiments to estimate its predictive capabilities. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to examine the fractured surfaces and to identify the relevant micro-mechanisms of fracture. It was found that the obtained EWF results are in good agreement with the observed cracking behaviour during deep-drawing. Both the established method (fatigue pre-cracking) as well as the novel method of sheared notches were able to reveal the intrinsically low fracture toughness, otherwise undetected with conventional tensile testing. From the fractured surfaces of the EWF samples the relevant micro-mechanisms of failure were identified that govern the fracture toughness properties. Transgranular cleavage fracture was responsible for brittle behaviour while failure ductile failure occurred via microvoid coalescence.<br/>Although the fatigue pre-cracking method for EWF testing seems to show a higher accuracy in predicting the cracking susceptibility, the shearing method can be employed as a rapid routine test to identify deterioration of fracture toughness properties early on.","Fracture toughness; Advanced High Strength Steels; essential work of fracture; Automotive Applications","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-06","","","","","",""

First, the kinematics, definitions and particulars of the system of interest – the vessel including crane and suspended jacket - are provided. Then, literature research is done on the main two problems with any transport at sea: the inconvenient draft problem, and the forward speed problem. To remove the inaccuracies introduced by both problems, the novel TF A2B Method is introduced. The method can be used to find the required force transmissibility functions at location of the cranes that are most prone to fatigue: the welds at the crane boom pivots. It is mathematically proven that the TF A2B Method can be used and with validation tests set up for unrestrained suspended transport it is shown that the required RAO’s can be obtained from in-house modeling software Liftdyn. Overall, its concluded that the TF A2B Method works in principle, removing the need to consider inconvenient draft and forward speed.<br/><br/>The hypotheses proposed in this research are further validated by the proposed validation tests in combination with a synthetic data model created in software tool Liftdyn. The Synthetic Data Model (SDM) uses a Jonswap Spectrum to obtain the motions at the Motion Reference Unit (MRU, ‘A’) and the Control Point (‘B’) at the modelled SSCV Sleipnir, which is assumed as a rigid body. After successful validation, the SDM model is then used to calculate the motions at the Jacket Sensor (‘B’). Further validation of the found responses is done and it is confirmed that the location ‘B’ can in fact be located on another rigid body as the MRU, which in this research was the location of the jacket sensor. It is also shown<br/>that the transmissibility functions (TFs) between A and B are almost equal for different draft, resulting in that the TFs between A and B are not significantly dependent on the hydrodynamic properties of the modelled system. Therefore, it is concluded that the TF A2B Method can correctly find motions at location B by using the motions of location A in combination with the corresponding TFs between A and B.<br/><br/>The TF A2B Method is then applied to calculate the jacket motions using measured vessel motions. Data obtained from the X suspended transport were processed and applied using the Measured Data Model. The calculated jacket motions are compared to the measured jacket motions during the X suspended transport to the accuracy of the TF A2B Method with real data. An approximate 70% accuracy match with the measured suspended jacket motions, Roll and Pitch during the X Suspended Jacket transport was found. It is noted that not all data was found to be suitable for use. Suggestions for improving this have been made and are expected to further improve accuracy of the match. The validated Liftdyn model of the X transport is then used to model the suspended transport of X. From the Liftdyn model Force RAO’s can be obtained at the selected fatigue location of the cranes. A Fatigue Data Model using the TF A2B Method is proposed to find the stress cycles and thereby the fatigue damage during suspended transport.<br/><br/>Concluding, the TF A2B Method developed in this research shows positive results overall. The method can in principle be used to translate vessel measurements during suspended transport into fatigue life consumption of the crane. Further research is needed to improve the Measured Data Model, for which the use of a Surge and Sway motion sensor at the MRU is recommended. Furthermore, smaller vessel motions and more data samples should be used to further validate the accuracy of the method which is required to validate the Liftdyn model of the transport. Finally, to verify the results of the Fatigue Data Model, it is suggested to install strain gauges at the welds of the crane boom pivots for validation.","offshore; fatigue cranes; suspended transport; RAO's","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

This resulted in remarkable advancements in photovoltaic technology and design. The performance of the majority of PV modules is determined in laboratories under controlled conditions. Perhaps the climatic conditions on-site are not always stable when the PV module is installed. As a result, modules are subjected to changing environmental stressors such as temperature, relative humidity, UV radiation, and cyclic temperatures. Each of these environmental factors results in a distinct mode and mechanism of degradation, resulting in a loss of performance over time. As a result, determining the rate of degradation of a photovoltaic module is crucial for performance prediction and financial analysis. Primarily, this research identifies a degradation model that is adaptable to various of photovoltaic technologies and designs while maintaining long-term accuracy such model is implemented into PVMD toolbox. We use this model to explore the degradation of photovoltaic modules in a variety of locations around the world, as each site has its own distinct environment. We explore a few well-known climates, namely tropical, steppe, temperate, desert, and cold. According to the study's findings, the lifetime of Cold &gt; Steppe &gt; Desert &gt; Temperate &gt; Tropical and inverse for degradation rates. Financial analysis is critical for determining the value and social impact of a project. Thus, the levelized cost of electricity metric is utilized to determine the economic value of photovoltaic modules under the various climatic conditions indicated previously. To perform this study an LCOE model is incorporated in PVMD toolbox consisting of economic and system variables along with growth rate per year parameter to determine future costs of PV modules. Tropical, steppe, and cold regions are evaluated financially using a variety of economic scenarios and discount rates in order to compare the effect of degradation on LCOE. Tropical zones have the highest LCOE values and the greatest influence on LCOE when the scenario is changed. Cold zones exhibit the greatest range of LCOE values in sensitivity analysis.

Despite this, new research indicates that perovskite/silicon tandem modules are susceptible to degradation. As a result, a model is designed with the objective of assessing the total degradation of tandem modules. We focused on the ability of the perovskite layer degradation to affect the overall degradation of the tandem module by employing normalized power in tandem degradation research. To investigate correlations, the energy production loss owing to degradation in tandem modules is compared to that of an independent crystalline silicon module. Following that, the LCOE of tandem modules is assessed and compared to that of crystalline silicon modules in order to determine the economic impact. According to the study, the perovskite layer in 4T tandem modules degrades at a greater rate than the perovskite layer in 2T tandem modules in order to maintain the same lifetime as independent crystalline silicon modules at the location. When perovskite layers in 2T and 4T degrade at optimal rate, they reach economic equilibrium at 5% and 10% additional module cost over crystalline silicon module.","PV Modules; Degradation; LCOE; Perovskite solar cells; Tandem modules; Energy Yield Simulations; Lifetime","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-31","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

These medical devices mimic and replace the function of the damaged structures of the cochlea. To this date, more than 700,000 individuals worldwide have benefited from CIs. However, state-of-the-art CIs do not provide a natural and high-quality sound perception to their recipients, who poorly appreciate music and hardly understand speech in crowded or noisy atmospheres. Furthermore, CIs are expensive and unaffordable for poorer portions of society. The CI electrode array is the component that presents the most margin of improvement as it is still composed of classic materials and is fabricated via a tailored manual manufacturing process that does not maximize the potential of the system. Concretely, commercial CI electrode arrays contain from 12 to 24 individual stimulating channels that cannot optimally substitute the role of the 3000 neural stimulation sites of a normal-functioning cochlea. Moreover, most of the commercial CI electrode arrays cannot fit in the narrow deep areas of the cochlea to completely cover the low-frequency audible spectrum. Hence, to overcome these limitations, novel strategies and materials to optimize CI electrode arrays ought to be investigated. Chapter 1 of this work starts with an introduction to the auditory system and the different types of hearing loss. Chapter 2 goes through the history and research that led to the development of cochlear implants and presents their main components and current limitations. Chapter 3 discusses in detail the state-of-the-art of CI electrode arrays and Chapter 4 reviews novel materials to enhance them. In Chapter 5, PEDOT:PSS is suggested for the development of all-polymeric cochlear implant micro-electrode arrays. Initial experiments provide a proof-of-concept that demonstrates that by patterning PEDOT:PSS layers with conductive and non-conductive areas, it is possible to create electric circuits with superior electrodes and leads that give rise to all-polymeric CI micro-electrode arrays. Future work will be directed towards developing an actual prototype using this strategy. Furthermore, a study of the long-term stability of the material will be necessary.","Cochlear Implants; Micro-Electrodes; BioMedical Engineering; PEDOT:PSS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(mentor); van Zeumeren, I.M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Automated transportation technology has been rapidly evolving across all modes of transportation, with enormous potential to improve road safety and travel comfort. New challenges arose during the transition to full automation, such as increased instances of disagreements between the driver and the automation system over who should take control. Negotiation plays a crucial role in resolving such conflicts. The Mediator project, a research and innovation programme of the European Union’s Horizon 2020, is developing an intelligent system to meditate between human drivers and highly automated vehicles. This graduation project aims to design a human-machine interaction that can resolve conflicts with appropriate negotiations, thereby creating a pleasant user experience in highly automated vehicles. The challenge lies in striking the right balance between the driver's safety and autonomy in order to ensure that the Mediator system is accepted by a wide range of users. To tackle the challenge, conflicts between human drivers and highly automated vehicles were analyzed to identify the most severe conflict as a main focus. To resolve it, research referred to human-to-human negotiation styles to inspire possible ways of human-to-machine negotiation styles in a context of high automation. To determine the most appropriate negotiation styles, desirable human-to-machine interaction was investigated through interviews.It was found that most participants preferred to have a certain extent of autonomy only when safety is secured. It resulted in an approach of resolving conflicts with negotiation styles based on the reasons for the automation’s takeover requests. More specifically, persuasive negotiation should be employed with a competing style when the reason is about safety. When it comes to comfort, seductive negotiation should be employed with a collaborating style. These insights were translated to interaction qualities for negotiation in the design concept. A design goal was formulated after establishing a future worldview by using the Vision In Product Design (ViP) method. The goal was to create a pleasant experience through negotiation during control conflict. Furthermore, the driver's motivation to follow the automation’s recommendations was investigated through two design interaction cycles. It was found that increasing intrinsic and extrinsic incentives by audio interaction and rewards could effectively motivate drivers to follow recommendations. The final concept is a negotiation ritual consisting of voice messages and rewarding features. When there is a disagreement over who should take over, the negotiation ritual of either persuasive or seductive negotiation will be activated. In the persuasive negotiation ritual, the system will give takeover requests twice, emphasizing the urgency and consequences with a commanding tone and wording. In the seductive negotiation ritual, the system will only ask the driver once, emphasizing the benefit of control transfer with a friendly tone and wording. Furthermore, drivers will get rewards such as parking discounts when following recommendations.","Negotiation; HMI design; Interaction; Highly automated vehicles; conflict; Artificial intelligence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Scholten, D.J. (mentor); Janssen, Merijn (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The world needs to decarbonize, and that includes the transport sector, which accounts for almost a quarter of the GHG emissions. Electrification and hydrogen-powered transport are increasing significantly. But, a new category of hydrogen-based fuels (synthetic fuels) could be part of the solution as well. Synthetic fuels are fuels that are made from CO2 and low-carbon hydrogen. Their use would reduce GHG emissions and mitigate the negative effects we have on climate change. Also, they are compatible with existing infrastructure, which increases the possibility of becoming part of the energy mix in the short term. Despite the increasing attention, there is a lack of literature that combines qualitative research with quantitative insights and a lack of research on the macro-environment of the synthetic fuel system.<br/><br/>This study aims to provide an extensive overview of the critical internal and external uncertainties that influence the synthetic fuel supply chain. Additionally, the study wants to look at the impact of the identified factors by using scenarios to model future developments. Scholars are highlighting the potential of synthetic fuels, and the International Energy Agency expects them to play a role in the future energy mix. However, high costs and regulatory uncertainty might prove to be significant barriers to their development. The synthetic fuel system is complex, and their are a lot of factors with that impact each other and a lot of uncertainty in terms of how key factors will develop in the future. The research question focuses on the potential of synthetic fuels in the future. This research uses an integrated approach to look at the system, as the important factors are highly dependent of each other. <br/><br/>A PESTEL-analysis was done to highlight the different categories of factors influencing the synthetic fuel supply chain. The Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental and Legal factors together form the driving forces and uncertainties surrounding synthetic fuels. After an extensive literature study to create thorough understanding of the synthetic fuel system, relevant literature was reviewed and discussed to identify the most important factors and uncertainties. These factors are elaborately discussed and then summarized and categorized. The factors with high impact were done reviewed and discussed further with quantitative experiments. The critical uncertainties were quantified by analyzing scenarios in a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model using the program Linny-R. The mix of qualitative and quantitative research makes it possible to understand the synthetic fuel system better. Using Linny-R, the system was modelled in a simplified way by linking the relevant feedstocks, processes and products. The advantage of Linny-R is that it is very suited for looking at integrated systems. The identified factors have a lot of interdependencies and that makes it interesting to look at the impact of uncertainties on multiple factors at the same time. <br/><br/>The results showed the major impact the energy price and the electrolyzer Capex have on the hydrogen and subsequent synthetic fuel prices, as they are at least twice as expensive as fossil fuels on the short term. The high current prices for renewable energy weigh heavily on the hydrogen costs, which in turn has a major impact on the costs for synthetic fuels. The results also show the importance of renewable energy availability, as the average price increases significantly due to the intermittency of renewable energy sources. This intermittency leads to lower capacity factors for the electrolyzer, which increases the electrolysis costs per tonne hydrogen. These two factors are the main cost drivers of hydrogen and finding the right balance between the capacity factor and cheap energy is key for reaching an optimal synthetic fuel price. Technological developments and efficiency gains will decrease the price significantly in the future. However, it will definitely remain challenging to become competitive in the short term. In the longer term, there is potential if adequate regulatory support is provided and hydrogen prices continue to decrease due to innovation and scalability. Hydrogen production, and even more so, synthetic fuel production in countries with favourable conditions for renewable energy could lead to lower prices than local production. A potential disadvantage is more competition and geopolitical tensions making the supply chain riskier, requiring a higher rate of return. Because the model also incorporated the fossil fuel production and the carbon emissions, the impact of policy could also be taken into account. While the results show that the impact of policy measures like carbon pricing is definitely lower than the impact of significant hydrogen cost reductions, it is clear that this policy does make synthetic fuel production more attractive. The integrated approach of the system shows that multiple developments are needed for the ambition of cost-parity for synthetic and fossil fuels. While this cost-parity may never be reached, under the right circumstances the synthetic fuel price can become very close. Additional policy measures like blend-in quota and higher subsidies could further increase the demand. <br/><br/>The results highlight the challenges but also the potential of synthetic fuels. In order to make them part of the inevitable transition to sustainable alternatives for the transport sector, governments, policymakers, international organisations and customers need to align their efforts to collectively (partly) shift towards synthetic fuels. This is a big opportunity to reduce GHG emissions and reach the climate targets from the Paris Agreement.","Synthetic Fuels; Hydrogen; MILP; PESTEL","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Some of these problems can be formulated in a ‘two-stage’ formulation, such as the location transportation problem. To solve such a problem, a column-and-constraint-generation algorithm has been introduced in which constraints are iteratively added to mixed-integer pro- gram based on different uncertain scenarios. However, if these scenarios are randomly chosen, this problem can grow too large to efficiently solve for. For most problems, there is some mini- mal set of scenarios needed to find the optimal solution, and it is important to find the ‘right’ scenarios early. In this study, we attempt to predict these scenarios for a location transportation using machine learning. Using customer demand data for different instances of the problem, we train a logistic regression classifier, a neural network and a random forest classifier to predict important scenarios for newly generated problems. We find that when applying these machine learning tools, we reach an average reduction of scenarios added to the problem ranging from 8% to 24%. Even though we do not spend much effort on training perfect models, we see that there is a strong indication that machine learning can be used to increase the efficiency of the algorithm.","Robust Optimization; Two-Stage Optimization; Machine Learning","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

The project was initiated and supervised by SWOV, the Dutch Institute for Road Safety Research, as part of the MEDIATOR Project, which tackles the challenge of developing a mediating system between human drivers and intelligent driving systems. The design of a well-thought-out HMI is imperative to such a system. Multiple experiments, designed to evaluate the users’ interaction with the HMI and to validate its effectiveness in guaranteeing a safe and comfortable driving experience, will be conducted. Due to its unique qualities, which allow us to simulate highly detailed and interactive environments, Virtual Reality is considered useful as a tool to support product evaluation and aid in the design process. This is particularly true in the earlier design phases when the development of high fidelity prototypes is out of reach. In the first half of the graduation project, a number of research activities were conducted to gain insight into the best practices for the development of VR applications and into the requirement for a tool dedicated to facilitating the Mediator HMI design and evaluation process. The outcomes of the research result in a list of design requirements that were used as the blueprint for the conceptualisation of the final design. An iterative prototyping and evaluation process of three Minimum Viable Products (MVP) served to test initial design concepts and further inform the development of the tool. The second half of the report presents the design concept and implementation of the Mediator VR Evaluation Tool as well as the User Manual, which was created to facilitate the use of the VR tool by the Mediator design and research teams. Finally, the evaluation of the two products is described and the results of the two studies are discussed. The outcomes of this graduation project suggest that VR is effective in supporting the evaluation of the Mediator HMI.","VR; Human-Machine-Interface; Evaluation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","MEDIATOR Project",""

The main contribution of this thesis is to include the influence of a constant vertical wind speed on the classical Ekman spiral. After stuyding the classical Ekman spiral, the inclusion of a constant vertical wind speed is done step­wise. First, the vertical wind speed is discussed without having any vertical Coriolis forces. The classical Ekman spiral and the Ekman spiral with vertical wind, but no vertical Coriolis force, were solved exactly. Then, the vertical wind speed is included fully, giving rise to a non­linear coupled system of differential equations. For the non­linear system, an algorithm for solving it analytically using a general perturbation method is proposed. Next, the hodograph of the non­linear equations of motion including a constant vertical wind speed, is made using Euler’s Explicit numerical method and a shooting problem is solved.","Ekman Spiral; Perturbation Analysis; nonlinear; coupled system of differential equations; Differential Equations","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The thesis studied the employer branding process as a way to increase start-ups attractiveness for potential employees. Start-ups, unlike larger and more established corporations, face challenges when it comes to recruiting talented personnel. Employer branding concerns the different strategies that a company can employ to increase the employer’s attractiveness. Thus, to investigate how this would be possible in a start-up environment, few steps needed to be taken. First, the job attributes, later defined as employer brand attributes, which make the company attractive for the candidates, needed to be studied. Secondly, the behavioral characteristics of young and talented applicants, also called in the thesis entrepreneurial behaviors, were analyzed to identify their potential effects on employer brand attributes and employer’s attractiveness. The study involved a mixed method. First, a qualitative study was performed where 5 semi- structured interviews with start-ups managers or founders helped to understand the start-up employers’ perspective on the subject. From the content analysis of the interviews, five different employer brand attributes were found: financial package offered, responsibility functions, growth and learning opportunities, work environment, and serious games. As a next step, a quantitative study was employed where the (potential) employees’ perceptions were studied through an electronic questionnaire which collected 94 respondents among students and young professionals. Using conjoint analysis and regression analysis, the results revealed that the preference order for the attributes was: financial package offered (26,86%), growth and learning opportunities (24,12%), responsibility functions (19,20%), work environment (15,16%), and serious games (14,66%). At the same time, a positive relationship was found between responsibility functions (0.845, p&lt;0.05) with innovative behavior. A negative correlation was instead verified between proactive behavior and responsibility functions (-0,506, p&lt;0.05), and between risk-taking behavior and responsibility functions (-0.399, p&lt;0.05) and growth opportunities (-0.362, p&lt;0.05). Thus, the propositions advanced by this thesis for the academics was to continue the research on employer brand attributes and entrepreneurial behaviors enlarging the sample of the study to guarantee more generalizable results. For practitioners, especially for start-up employers, the qualitative and quantitative study revealed their weakness, mainly the financial package, which should be reinforced to improve the employer’s attractiveness. Moreover, a different strategy should be thought of for each of the employer brand attributes, such as growth opportunities, work environment, responsibility functions, and serious games, because all of them presented a positive relationship towards employers’ attractiveness.","employer branding; start-up; entrepreneurial behavior","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

This report contains a research in different def- initions for the graph Laplacian applied on directed graphs, since it is rarely used in applications neither occurs often in literature. Two definitions are discussed into more detail. The first definition considers a directed graph as a bipartite graph between the node set containing all nodes with outgoing edges and the node set containing all nodes with incoming edges. A Laplacian is defined on both sets distinctly and later on the two Laplacians are convexly combined to define a Laplacian on the whole directed graph. The second definition considers a random walk on a directed graph. We will see why a random walk on a directed graph is equivalent to a finite Markov Chain with a corresponding transition probability matrix. This definition will be used for clustering. The method for clustering as well as the definition for the directed graph Lapla- cian require a unique stationary distribution associated with the transition proba- bilities on the node set of the graph. The existence and uniqueness of the stationary distribution became an important part of this report, because the given data set has to meet up with these properties to be able to use this method. Furthermore, the introduced definitions are used in a MATLAB based model, to get more insights about the spectrum of the directed graph Laplacian. The biggest conclusions to be drawn are that for strongly connected directed graphs, it seems that there is a correlation between the multiplicity of eigenvalues that are close to 1 and the numbers of subsets such that all nodes in the subset are adjacent.","Directed graph; Laplacian; Clustering algorithms","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

The meat industry alone accounts for 15% of the greenhouse gas emissions. So, the solution would be eating less meat and dairy. But although the Dutch eat most meat replacers in Europe, the annual meat consumption hasn’t declined between 2005 and 2019. The growing number of vegans and vegetarians in The Netherlands show that it isn’t always willingness to eat less meat, but often it is habitual behaviour that is hard to disrupt. Teaching and preaching sustainability is proven to be ineffective, since consumers often filter out information that doesn’t result in short-term benefits and personal gain. Filtering out information is to reduce the mental load that consists of several struggles that consumers experience in the cooking process: finding inspiration, sticking to their budget and eating healthy and varied food. And even if consumers consider sustainability, it almost never has top priority. Therefore, a product or service that wants to help consumers choose to consume more sustainably should, primarily, focus on offering personal value and short-term benefits. In addition, sustainability has to be subtly incorporated, but never be the main attribute of the product. Consumers are already looking for help with their struggles in the cooking process, like finding inspiration Consumers are already looking for help with their struggles in the cooking process, like finding inspiration and help online and buying products that make cooking simpler and more convenient, like food boxes. But, research shows that consumers quit their food box subscription, because it is too expensive and they have no control over the size, quality and price of the vegetables. Furthermore, the recipe and herbs/sauce of the food box are considered more valuable than the vegetables. Therefore, the product that is developed in this project is a food box without vegetables. Instead, consumers receive a recipe, for inspiration and including a shopping list, and a ready-to-use sauce made of natural herbs and ingredients, which helps them with the most expensive and complicated part of a meal. All recipes are vegetarian, which nudges sustainable consumption, without compromising on price and convenience. Vegetables can be purchased in the local supermarket or local market. This increases the physical barrier compared to regular food boxes, but gives the consumer a lot of flexibility in return. The focus of the solution is to reduce the mental load for the consumer by making eating less meat easier, not more complicated. The target group are generation Y and Z, because these generations are already most sustainable, like cooking and they live online, which make it easier to target them.","food; sustainability; Product design","en","master thesis","","","","","","http://www.meetgoodcase.nl/foodbox","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Other studies have shown that surface curvature can also serve as a mechanical cue to modulate cell behavior. Therefore, the fabrication of pillars on curved surfaces would allow researchers to investigate the synergistic effect of pillars and curvature on cell behavior. In this project, a process was developed based on thermal nanoimprint lithography (TNL) and dry etching techniques for the fabrication of pillars into curved substrates made of hard materials. To this aim, a fused silica specimen containing sub-micron pillars was used as the master mold in a molding process to replicate the pillars as pits into a hybrid polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mold. The dimensions and morphology of the replicated patterns were assessed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Thereafter, TNL was employed to imprint the pits of the hybrid PDMS mold on the surface of the desired planar/ curved substrates. Finally, etching processes were employed to transfer the patterns into the bulk of the substrates. The process was first developed on planar fused silica substrates and then, on curved substrates. The interspace of the resultant pillars on the planar substrates was no more than 3% different than the interspace of the original pillars on the master mold. The diameter was also close to the values of the diameter of the original pillars (the maximum difference was 23%). The height of the pillars differed slightly (mo more than 16%) for the specific process conditions that were used. On the curved substrates, the interspace increased by 5% and 10%, and the diameter by 57% and 11%.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are countless leisure activities, yet this paper focuses on how food connects people and can generate feelings of enhanced intimacy. The scope of the research centers adults living in The Netherlands, which are currently in a romantic relationship or have had previous experience with such a relationship. This paper contains research into the current dating culture, the food design scene in largely The Netherlands, intimacy in romantic relationships and how food connects people. In the secondary research section, a wide and explorative approach is taken by attending food design fairs, tantra classes, and fetish events to fully explore the extremes of ‘intimate connection’. Furthermore, Tinder dates were set up for an immersive experience and to discover how food sharing contributed to feelings of connectedness. Lastly, numerous food experiments were performed to ultimately lead to the final design. The final design is called Intime and is a food ritual where two people go on a date together at home. A cosy and warm blanket is placed on the ground somewhere in the house where the couple feels most at ease and they position themselves according to the design requirements. Each person receives their own dish with bite size chocolate balls, which they share with each other through handfeeding.

(graduation committee); Hoving, J.S. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","A rapid increase in global energy demand and the international objective of increasing the contribution of renewable energy to satisfy this demand have spiked the interest in offshore wind energy. Depletion of suitable locations for bottom founded turbines has led to a new chapter in offshore wind development: floating wind farms. This relatively new business brings many uncertainties and no large-scale projects have been deployed yet. The performance impact of an increase in structural motions, in comparison with bottom founded offshore wind turbines, is not yet fully investigated with respect to power production of the system. This thesis seeks to quantify this impact on performance by performing an integrated system analysis of a 15-MW semi-submersible based offshore wind turbine for operational conditions at a site north of Scotland. <br/>All considered elements in the fully integrated simulation model are broken down individually and assembled in a finite element analysis framework via OrcaWave and OrcaFlex. OrcaWave develops system RAOs and QTFs using linearised potential-flow hydrodynamic radiation and diffraction theory in the frequency domain, whereas OrcaFlex is a finite element analysis software tool with full non-linear capability in the time domain. The non-linear flow separation induced quadratic drag in a real system, which is not included in potential flow theory, is introduced via a damping matrix by addition of Morison elements to the structure. The overall system including tower, RNA, controller and mooring is analysed by OrcaFlex in time domain. This overall integrated model was first validated and verified against a well-documented open-source reference model, provided by NREL and the University of Maine, and then adapted to the semi-submersible substructure selected for this study. A case matrix is developed representing the site environmental loading scenarios under operating conditions to simulate the dynamic interactions between substructure, RNA and controller. The impact of wind-induced yaw misalignment mean offset angles on the mean power production is examined. For wind speeds below rated, an increase in yaw misalignment angle corresponds to a decrease in mean power production. For a functioning active yaw control system, misalignment angles of the rotor will be small and consequently the mean power reductions will be as well. For above-rated wind speeds, sufficient lift can be generated to compensate for the reduced rotor swept area caused by the yaw misalignment and therefore no reduction in mean power production occurs. Load case results show that with increasing sea state severity, the motions of the system increase. The impact of this increase in motions can be observed in the generator power and rotor thrust response through their fluctuations. Performing an FFT on these parameters shows that most energy in the fluctuations is situated at the incident-wave frequencies and correspondingly, the wind and wave unidirectional load cases present the largest spectral density values for generator power and rotor thrust fluctuations. Furthermore, the results present a connection between the severity of power output fluctuations and the mean power production for above-rated wind speeds. For increasing power production fluctuations, the mean power production experiences a reduction up to 0.39\%. A hypothesis is formed that links the mean power production reduction due to its fluctuations to the response time of the controller. In further research this hypothesis is to be tested and it should be further investigated whether a more detailed integrated analysis model produces similar results. The fluctuations in power production impose challenges on the ability to connect to the grid. Connection of a single floating wind turbine to the power grid is not recommended, but when considering a group of multiple turbines it is assumed that the peaks in power production are flattened out over the total power production of the group. Capacitor banks can then be implemented to create a stable power output to the grid. Quantification of this farm effect is recommended for further research. Finally, an indication of the rotor thrust impact on bending stresses at the tower-substructure interface is presented. A more detailed analysis is to be performed to find local stress concentrations and to address potential structural adjustments to fatigue-prone members.","Floating Wind Energy; Power Production; Floating Wind Turbines; Semi-submersible; Offshore Wind; Renewable Energy; Modelling; OrcaFlex; 15MW","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-08-05","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

The NdFeB permanent magnet in EOL hard disk drivers (HDDs) is an actual source of REEs. However, REEs recycling routes are still under development. Hydrometallurgical routes are attractive because they are versatile, but concerns arise regarding their chemical consumption and the implication to the environment. An ex-ante environmental analysis supports the launch and consolidation of the route in an environmentally sound manner. This work aims to identify the environmental hotspots of a theoretical hydrometallurgical recycling route for REEs, which uses acetic acid for leaching and oxalic acid for precipitation. The route also allows chemical recycling through a loop within it. The ultimate goal is to draw recommendations toward improving the environmental profile of the technology before it gets implemented. The evaluation is carried using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology according to a dedicated framework for ex-ante analysis, including upscaling. The analysis highlights as hotspots the oxalic acid in the precipitation stage and the direct dust emissions and its treatment in the fragmentation of HDDs. Moreover, results indicate that acetic acid regeneration within the system is more burdensome than use the chemical produced from raw materials. The premature assessment also indicates that the environmental profile of the emerging technology is potentially inferior to the established primary production. A limitation of the model arises from the economic allocation for multifunctional processes due to the approach developed to stipulate the price of some co-products. Overall, the uncertainties carried with the ex-ante LCA prevent any assertive declaration regarding the recycling route’s environmental performance. However, the exercise contributes to the problem-solution space. It gives directions to the next steps: better data collection for the RE recovery phase, less dust production in the fragmentation phase, other means for precipitation of REEs, and variation in the leaching solid-liquid ratio.","NdFeB permanent magnet; REEs; recycling; hydrometallurgy; weak acid; ex-ante LCA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","VALOMAG",""

Hence, there needs to be a higher emphasis on reusing old building components in new construction without down-cycling them and retaining their original functions. Barriers involved in reusing recoverable building elements have multiple dimensions. Based on the current development of the industry, the solutions exist as isolated digital tools and focus only on one issue. This calls for a holistic approach to develop a solution which not only focuses on developing a technical tool but also focuses on embedding the solution in the process of reusing building elements. The main objective of this research is thus, to investigate the application of 'Systems thinking' as a holistic approach that focuses on developing a digital platform ecosystem based on the interventions amongst the actors and processes within the system. A serious gaming approach was used to simulate the system such that it can effectively derive its needs. Through the application of systems thinking and modelling approach to the problem, a set of six intervention strategies were derived. These strategies indicated that the digital platform ecosystem for enhancing reuse will fundamentally rely on these intervention strategies and thrive on reinforcing power from one side of the market to the other. By building on these intervention strategies, four propositions of change were given by comparing the existing scenario of the industry to the desired structure of a digital platform ecosystem. The research is concluded with the acknowledgement that implementation of the intervention strategies will require certain adaptations in the system. A conclusive, but not an exhaustive list of recommended adaptations in the design process and actor-network is provided to accompany the interventions strategies.","Reuse in Circular Economy; Systems Thinking and Modelling; causal loop diagram; System Interventions; Serious Gaming; Digital Platform Ecosystem","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Kamphuis, Thijs (mentor); Kurstjens, Michel (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Since the introduction of the first offshore wind farm in 1991, the demand for offshore renewable wind energy has experienced exponential growth all around the world. To supply this demand, the power rating and corresponding dimensions of offshore wind turbines have grown significantly. Due to the ever-shrinking availability of easily accessible shallow water sites and the abundance of high quality wind resources in deeper water, the industry is stimulated to come up with innovative, yet cost effective, solutions to tap into these deep water sites. Historically, the use of monopile foundations has been an important facilitator of cost reduction due to its relative ease of manufacturability, transportability and installability. Monopile foundations have, however, thus far only been used in relatively shallow water depths. With jacket-type and floating support structures remaining relatively costly, the question arises if the monopile could yet be scaled up further to be used in water depths beyond the current 40-60mfor future, 10+ MW wind turbines. The goal of this research is to investigate the technical feasibility of monopile foundations in the water depth ’gap’ of 60 to 120 meters, which is currently claimed by jackets, for large wind turbines and determine critical design parameters for up-scaling monopiles to these depths. With an eye on future developments a 15 MW reference turbine is adopted and to make the research widely applicable the Hywind Scotland site in the Northern North Sea is selected, a well-documented reference site with a very severe wind and wave climate. To define monopile designs, a parametric (static) monopile geometry optimization tool is developed in Excel, which transfers the environmental data to forcing components. The monopile geometry is optimized for first natural frequency and ULS resistance (yield and global buckling) by varying the outer diameter and wall thickness along the structure. It was found that the ULS check is governed by the inertial wave forcing during survival case (50 year return period storm conditions). As the acting wave frequency is way lower than the system natural frequency, the monopile can be adequately assessed using a static approach. To assess the effect of critical variables, the tool is used to define monopile geometries for water depths ranging between 60 and 120 m, target first natural frequencies of 0.15, 0.17 and 0.20 Hz and a range of soil types, while complying with known manufacturing limits. The results show that all designs are within manufacturing limits and resistance against ULS decreases for lower target frequencies, making 0.15 Hz monopiles unfeasible. In contrast to the ultimate limit failures, the fatigue damage is largely incurred from normal rather than ultimate wave states, which embrace the first natural frequency of the system, thus warranting a full dynamic analysis. In order to assess the fatigue resistance of 0.17 and 0.20 Hz monopiles, which pass the ULS check, an analytical full dynamic model is developed in Maple based on the fundamental equations of motion, including (added) mass, aerodynamic damping and soil/structural stiffness. The model is verified and validated against numerical modelling using ANSYS Finite Element Analysis software and found to be in very good agreement. The Maple model is then used to test the fatigue performance. It is found that the fatigue damage accumulated over the 25-year design lifetime is governed by the bending stress cycles induced by inertial wave forces. The model is used to generate a transfer function between this wave forcing and the resulting bending stress over the entire range of present wave frequencies. The transfer functions are used to transfer the wave scatter diagram to accumulated fatigue damage against a B2, C1 and D graded S-N curve. The analysis results show increasing fatigue damage for decreasing first natural frequency due to the increasing slenderness and more prominent interference with present wave frequencies, which causes the 0.15 and 0.17 Hz monopiles to fail on fatigue damage. Given the very demanding site conditions assumed in this research, more slender monopiles may be feasible in deep waters with a milder wave climate. Over all, the results show no fundamental technical limitations for a monopile supported 15 MW wind turbine in water depths of up to 120 meters, provided that the stiffness of the structure is sufficiently high. Since steel usage increases for increasing stiffness, technically feasible monopiles will need to be relatively heavy, thus costly. Therefore, a range of strategies to reduce steel weight have been quantitatively assessed. It is found that the amount of steel can be reduced up to 35% by adopting higher-grade steel types and improved weld quality. Based on the fundamental limiting factors for monopiles found, also a novel hybrid floating-fixed bottom concept is proposed aiming at steel weight reduction. Although the concept can be considered promising, it does add complexity to the system and unfortunately does not (yet) result in steel reduction.","Monopile; Offshore; Renewable Energy; Wind; Bottom Fixed; Deep Water; XL Turbine; Engineering; Sif; DOT","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

This is done as for some samples it is convenient or even necessary to put the sample into a fluid. The sample can then travel through the channel and its mass can be determined. The channel also simplifies placement of the samples compared to regular nanomechanical resonators. By having this channel embedded within the resonator, it is then possible to place the resonator as a whole in a vacuum and so eliminate medium losses. The main purpose of these suspended microchannel resonators is mass spectrometry which has already been performed on viruses and biological cells and so could potentially be very useful for the medical field as well. Especially if suspended microchannel resonators can be used to measure individual proteins which has not been done before with these resonators. It would also be interesting to use these kinds of resonators in quantum mechanical experiments. This means that the performance of these suspended microchannel resonators needs to be improved.<br/><br/>In order to accomplish this, a new kind of suspended microchannel resonator is introduced. The determination of these designs is strictly FEM based. The new resonator design, which is a doubly clamped beam, is made from pre-stressed silicon nitride which enables high Q-factors caused by an effect known as dissipation dilution. Dissipation dilution means diluting the energy losses of the system by increasing the stored energy which is increased by the initial stress in the silicon nitride. To increase this effect, the resonator is tapered towards the center. This is called strain engineering. Silicon nitride has been used in suspended microchannel resonators before but it did not result in higher Q-factors. Possibly due to clamping losses. The designs presented here offer a solution to that in the form of soft-clamping. This reduces the curvature near the boundaries to a minimum which means that the clamping losses are also reduced or eliminated. The combined effect of these features results in very high Q-factors as has already been reported for nanomechanical resonators. Through machine learning optimization it is possible to achieve 6E12 Hz in Qf product required for quantum mechanical experiments at room temperature and more than one order of magnitude improvement in mass sensitivity.<br","Suspended microchannel resonators; SMR; Soft-clamping; Strain engineering; Bayesian optimization; phononic crystals; Qf product; dissipation dilution","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

Structural pavement evaluation is often carried out by road authorities or consulting companies that use non-destructive testing (NDT) methods to assess the remaining life and structural capacity of a road structure at project or network level. In Western Europe and in most parts of the world, the most common equipment used as part of the NDT method is the use of the Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD). The FWD is able to capture deflection values that can be used for the backcalculation of moduli and to determine remaining life of a structure by mechanistic-empirical equations.<br/>In the Netherlands, like in many other countries, motorways have an increased number traffic flow based on high population densities accumulating in major cities. Due to this, pavement evaluation with stationary equipment such as the FWD can become relatively expensive due to the disruption of traffic. To solve this problem, research institutions and consulting companies have developed different versions of continuous evaluation equipment that are able to perform the structural analysis in a similar way to the FWD. In 2018, Dynatest® launched the Rapid Pavement Tester (RPT or RAPTOR) which aims to perform functional and structural evaluation of road networks at traffic speed. Continuous evaluation devices such as the RAPTOR are in constant development in order to achieve the quality and guaranty of use that equipment such as the FWD have in the pavement engineering industry. Currently this type of device uses technology that is less accurate than the sensors (Geophones) used in FWD equipment. This becomes a significant impediment in the evaluation of high stiffness pavement structures as the calculated deflections are in the lower end of the spectrum. This research aims to find a methodology that can be used in order to find limitation stiffness parameter values for which it is viable to use continuous evaluation equipment. Additionally, this research aims to find a method that can be used in the pavement engineering industry and research that is able to aid the data collection process of pavement layer information by means of machine learning tools. This was a problem faced during the elaboration of this research as the data collected to perform the analysis was incomplete in terms of layer thicknesses information. This process is carried by means of an artificial neural network (ANN) that is able to predict layer thicknesses and moduli based on deflection values and deflection parameters that obtained with the FWD.<br/>The analysis of this research is carried by comparing deflection values in different road networks collected with the FWD and the RAPTOR under similar weather conditions, where the predicted layer information is used to assess the cut-off values and limitations that the current version of the RAPTOR has when compared to the FWD. From the presented results it was found that the asphalt layer modulus showed the highest correlation to the limitation values where the RAPTOR is able to present reliable results when compared to the FWD. Additionally, promising results were found in the use of ANN method to predict missing layer information which are assumed to improve with a specific build in the ANN architecture.","Pavement Engineering; Data Analysis; Backcalculation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

Sending audio messages requires a user to invest lesser effort compared to texting while enhancing the meaning of the message by adding an emotional context (e.g., irony). Unfortunately, we suspect that voice messages might provide much more information than intended. In fact, speech audio waves are both directly recorded by the microphone, as well as propagated into the environment and possibly reﬂected back to the microphone. Reﬂected waves along with ambient noise are also recorded by the microphone and sent as part of the voice message.

Current strengthening measurements are mostly very visible. However, this can change by using the window frame as part of the structure, particularly interesting for Dutch houses characterized by large window openings. In this thesis, the focus is on the validation of the numerical model based on experimental testing. From this, the main research question was formulated as “How can the structural window frame be modelled to agree with the experimental results, in order to assess the seismic performance for unreinforced masonry structures?”. The structural window frame is made of a timber frame, an adhesive and a double-glazing unit. The timber frame is made of hardwood on the outside and plywood on the inside. The potential of the structural window frame is researched into several numerical, experimental and design studies using DIANA 10.4. It is concluded that a specific non-linear elastic interface model for the adhesive is the best suitable model. This numerical model is used as a loading protocol for the experiments. The structural window frames have been built and tested at the TU Delft. The experimental results showed that the structural window frame behaves plastically. Concluding, the glass panels and the hardwood are not damaged however, the plywood is pinched due to the glass panel. The numerical model is adjusted to include the pinching behaviour of the inner bar to suit the experiments. The next step is the masonry model. The masonry model including the structural window frame showed an increase of 15% for the in-plane shear force capacity and a decrease of 23% for the crack width for a displacement of 4 mm, compared to the unstrengthened masonry wall. The pushover calculation showed that both the unstrengthened and strengthened masonry wall can withstand the seismic loads in Appingedam. According to assumptions, the structural window frame results in an increase of the shear force capacity of 47% for larger displacements. The ductility of the structure can be increased by increasing the effective mass to 15000 kg. However, the calculation is only valid for the assumed values, these results should not be taken too strictly. The design of the window frame can be improved by using: a stiffer timber frame, a thinner adhesive and a more sustainable design. Using a frame that is twice as stiff and strong has resulted in: similar initial behaviour, higher maximum shear force and later stabilisation of the in-plane shear force. Using a thinner adhesive than 5 mm does not result in more beneficial results. Furthermore, making only screwed connections and maintaining the structural window frame frequently could increase the lifespan of the structural window frame. The structural window frame has potential however, more numerical and experimental research should be done.","Groningen earthquakes; Unreinforce masonry structures; in-plane strengthening; timber-glass composite wall; structural window design; structural adhesive; Structural glass; Numerical modelling; Pushover analysis; monotonic load; Cyclic loading; Earthquake; Earthquake Engineering; Induced Seismicity; structural window frame; Experimental study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering - Structural Design","STRUCTURAL GLASS WINDOW DESIGN FOR IN-PLANE SEISMIC STRENGTHENING - EXPERIMENTAL STUDY",""

In March 2020 stock prices dropped immensely and markets became extremely volatile. In this report we model three European stock markets before and during the COVID-19 crisis to determine whether the dynamics of financial markets changed structurally compared to previous periods. Stock markets play a big role in our economy and can cause economic disruption when they crash. Therefore, it can be very useful to understand the dynamics of the stock market. Econometricians are nowadays often asked to model the non-constant volatility (conditional heteroscedasticity) of financial time series. This report uses Generalised AutoRegressive Conditionally Heteroscedastic (GARCH) models that are known for their precise modeling of conditional heteroscedasticity. They are also known for their ability to capture the key stylised facts, the common empirical properties applicable to all types of stock markets. This report includes general definitions and characteristics of the GARCH(p, q) process and covers topics such as autocorrelation of returns, kurtosis, leptokurticity and volatility clustering. For estimating the GARCH models this report uses the statistical program R which estimates the parameters by the Quasi-Maximum Likelihood Estimation (QMLE) method. We modeled different periods before and during COVID-19 and compared the estimated parameters with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals. To test the accuracy of the estimations we performed parametric bootstrapping.

The wing should be flexible so it can morph, stiff so it can withstand aerodynamic pressures and light weight to reduce fuel consumption. The aim of this work is to provide a method for the density-based topology optimization of compliant morphing structures. The method includes a novel formulation for the objective function which compares the deformed shape of the structure with a desired deformed shape by using a dot product. This method is applied to obtain an optimized design of a compliant variable-camber morphing wing. The obtained design was converted to a prototype by 3D printing and an experiment was performed to assess if the deformed shapes of the prototype were similar to the ones predicted by the analysis in the topology optimization. The experiment showed that for small deformations the output shape matched the predicted output shape. For larger deflections, there was a slight difference. However, the obtained shapes were still quadratic-like and so it is expected that for larger deformations the designed trailing edge will still have superior aerodynamic performance than conventional flap systems.","Variable-camber; Morphing Wing; Topology optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | High-Tech Engineering","",""

Mobility hubs, a place where several (shared) modalities are combined, are seen as an enabler of shared mobility. Shared mobility and mobility hubs could therefore provide attractive alternatives for private vehicles and contribute to municipal policy goals. Like to create more accessible and liveable cities. This study explores the influencing factors for the usage and effects of neighbourhood mobility hubs through an ex-post evaluation of some already existing neighbourhood mobility hubs in the Netherlands. This is examined in a qualitative manner by employing a literature review, applying qualitative system dynamics methodology and conducting semi-structured interviews. A causal loop diagram is constructed that visualises the complexity of mobility hubs and shows the various factors and relations that influence the usage and effects of mobility hubs. The diagram shows that while there is potential, there is also still uncertainty about the precise effects (such as private car usage and ownership), as they may be either positive or negative. The research has contributed to filling the scientific gap on (neighbourhood) mobility hubs, and by mapping influencing factors and effects, provided a framework for further future evaluation of mobility hubs.","Mobility hub; shared mobility; causal loop diagram; ex-post evaluation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

(graduation committee); Huysmans, T. (graduation committee); de Zeeuw, I. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The goal of this thesis was to propose a new design for a kitefoiling harness for the Dutch Olympic team, which does not cause major discomfort, stays in the same location on the body and properly supports the body of the athlete. In the discovery phase, three main problems with existing harnesses were found. First, as the harness is pulled up the body while kitefoiling, the legstraps put an uncomfortably large amount of pressure on the groin. Second, ideally the attachment point between the harness and the kite sits around the crotch, but as the harness is pulled up the attachment point moves as well. Furthermore, the attachment point moves around too much in general. Last, the shape of the harness does not always fit the athlete well, causing weird pressure points, which are perceived as uncomfortable. Two extreme postures were identified that harnesses need to perform well in: going upwind and doing a manoeuvre. Through force analysis it was found the highest forces that the harness has to endure are in the upwind posture. Major shear forces should be avoided. The athletes prefer to be supported most at the Gluteus Maximus and the lower back. The design approach for this project was prototype focussed, with every design stage being tested and validated. First, general concept directions were designed and evaluated. This evaluation led to two major pain points in the design: too much pressure on the hips and too much pressure at the groin. Two subsequent design sprints were then completed to solve these two pain points. The outcomes were tested with members of the Dutch Olympic team. The final proposed design is radically different than existing kitefoiling harnesses on the market. The new design removes the spreaderbar and makes the attachment point much smaller. Additionally, it contains much bigger legstraps that keep the entire harness in place and are connected to a hard belt that is custom moulded to the shape of the back of the athlete. Apart from the hard belt, everything can be adjusted to ensure the best possible fit. During final testing it was found that, overall, the new design does not perform better than the current best harness on the market. The freedom of movement is greatly reduced and the leg straps were perceived as very uncomfortable, partly due to a much higher pressure from the kite in manoeuvres than anticipated. The newly designed leg straps did stay in place perfectly and kept the attachment point in the same place. Ultimately, the design should be tested with more participants. Even though the design is currently not better than the compared harness, some suggested adjustments could have a positive impact on the discomfort that the athlete perceived.","Kitefoiling; kitesurfing; Olympic Games; 2024","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","With the development of Artificial intelligence and Machine learning capabilities, the connected objects are extended with predictive capabilities, and the character of things is changed to “things that predict” (Smit, 2021). If a connected device is able to embrace a predictive system that not only profiles for scripted behavior but could also use the knowledge co-created by all the other similar devices and their users that encounter similar situations, the predictions can be generated based on that. In this case, a new type of interplay between humans and things called ""predictive relation"" is created. However, challenges such as the transparency and users' acceptance of predictive behavior of the everyday connected product still require us to figure out before the future takes place. It is urged to understand the now and the future, and this leads to the question: ‘how to design transparent and acceptable predictive relations for the things that predict?’ Therefore, to investigate the question, the project will explore the predictive relations and identify the design qualities for predictive relations between humans and things by taking the XiaoMi’s Vacuum robot as the starting point of the case study. The purpose of this project is to explore the predictive relations and study the transparency and the acceptance of the predictive behavior. In answering the initial research question, this project proposed 2 propositions for transparency and acceptance respectively by combining the insights generated from the case study of XiaoMi’s vacuum robot and the creative session of envisioning the working of predicting vacuum robots. The 2 propositions are evaluated through the method of ‘Wizard-of-oz’ and proved valid by combining the results of quantitative and qualitative research. As one of the results of the evaluation, this project also proposes the idea of “Designer as the facilitator of the human-robot collaboration”. The designers can be the ones who help to bring in the background knowledge and the patterns of the predictive relation and indicate the ways for humans and robots to co-perform reliable and meaningful daily practice in their partnership. Eventually, this project takes designing a guidebook as one of the ways to clarify the idea and integrates the main results of the project into the guidebook to facilitate the collaboration between humans and predicting robots.","Artificial Intelligence; human robot interaction; Robot Autonomy; Transparency; Acceptance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The primary objective was to investigate dangerous circumstances with foil sailors to research the mechanisms that cause injuries and develop a design solution to prevent them. The research performed provides an integrated perspective into the subject of foil sailing safety. The research methods include participatory observational research, one-to-one interviews, multimedia evidence analysis, incident reporting archives study, and explorative retail analysis. Current wetsuits fail to protect sailors from foil strikes, as they only cover limited areas of the body. Four primary objectives are established. Impact and cut protection on the entirety of the wetsuit's surface, comfort, and aesthetics, which are two factors in attracting the use of such a suit. The product's name is Websuit 1, which is a protective wetsuit designed for Olympic foiling sailors. Full-length woven Dyneema lining is stacked with lightweight neoprene and GRDXKN foam— a mix of comfort and unprecedented protection. Results of several iterations have proven that GRDXKN can be printed on Guard Shield. Furthermore, based on the tests, 100% Dyneema lining can be bound to neoprene rubber thanks to lining glues. The proposed wetsuit manufacturing method is the same as the current one, with the addition of a GRDXKN screen printing and heating phase. Under the impact tower, the GRDXKN absorbed 56% of the maximum force applied from a 10J impact. The developed reinforced neoprene has been shown to distribute the energy over a larger surface, which decreases the stress applied to the body. Furthermore, the reinforced neoprene did not tear or break under stresses caused by 50J impacts. In contrast, conventional neoprene concentrated the applied force on a smaller area for the same energy impact and was torn. This project provided the first steps into connecting innovative textile technologies with the sailing world.","sailing; wetsuit; websuit; foil; strikes; nacra17; iqfoil; formula kite; injuries; injury; Personal Protection equipment; design; suit; protection; crash; foiling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

For steel bridges, this means that the deck structure does not meet the current demands. A solution would be to replace these existing deck structures with Glas Fibre-Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) sandwich webcore deck panels. However, the ministry of infrastructure in the Netherlands has voiced its concern about the fatigue performance and displacements of these deck panels under the high traffic load and intensity. Furthermore, the knowledge about the fatigue performance of GFRP deck panels, applied in the main road network, is still limited. At the time of writing this report, the technical committee, CEN/TC 250 (responsible for developing structural eurocodes), establishes a technical design specification for Fibre-Reinforced Polymer (FRP) structures. This technical specification requires full-scale fatigue testing due to the complex failure modes that can occur. General fatigue damage summation methods like Palmgren-<br/>Miner [30, 41] are not allowed by this technical specification. This report discusses the development of Virtual Fatigue Stiffness Simulation (ViFaSS), a numerical non-linear fatigue stiffness reduction model that can predict the fatigue performance of in-plane stress dominated Glass Fibre-Reinforced Polymer components, with a wide range of lay-up compositions, based on existing knowledge and experiments, including the damage development under multi-axial stress states and stress redistribution. The damage development includes damage accumulation dependency on damage history and damage development dependency on the load type, e.g. Tension-Tension (T-T) or Compression-Compression (C-C). With the low utilisation of the material strength in civil engineering applications, the research is limited to the stiffness degradation of the material. The numerical model is coupled with the Finite Element (FE) software SOFiSTiK where the component is modelled with shell finite elements. The fatigue material response is characterised on a unidirectional ply level based on principal ply directions and based on experimental results from the Optidat program [36]. The coupon response predicted by ViFaSS for constant amplitude T-T and bending fatigue loading was in reasonable agreement with experimental results. For future work it is recommended to extended the model with the ability to use non-linear material behaviour and to include the strength degradation caused by fatigue.","Glass fibre-reinforced polymer; Fatigue; Virtual stiffness verification; Stiffness prediction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When considering the application of wireless power transfer for Electric Vehicle(EV) charging, higher efficiency and lower cost can be achieved by reducing the number of stages of the system at the grid side. This thesis explores the feasibility of an AC/AC matrix converter for wireless power transfer application. To begin with, different existing topologies of the converter module are discussed and qualita­tively compared to the matrix converter. Subsequently, the plausibility of single stage matrix converter is verified through simulation. Due to the converter’s high switching frequency, this configuration results in injection of higher than permitted harmonic content into the grid. Fur­thermore, the feasibility of three phase matrix converter and its advantages are studied. The converter working is verified through simulation. To make the grid current less distorted, closed­ loop control is introduced. This control con­sists of an inner current loop and an outer voltage loop which are both implemented using a PI controller. To conclude, three phase matrix converter acts as a plausible solution for the desired applica­tion. Furthermore, the control ensures balanced grid current and desired output power.","Matrix Converter; Wireless Power Transfer; Inductive Charging","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); van Beers, Cees (graduation committee); Hinrichs-Krapels, S. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Technology has an increasing role in the modern day health care system. Healthcare Technology Management (HTM) is an area of biomedical engineering including the domains of planning, needs assessment, selection, procurement, donations, inventory, installation and maintenance of medical equipment (WHO, 2017). This thesis deals with HTM in Dutch hospitals from the viewpoint of procurement of high-cost medical equipment. Procurement is considered the main shifting point between resources and being able to provide care with the available technology.Through literature search and semi-structured interviews, we study the decision process for health technology procurement from the hospitals perspective, to answer the following question: What procedures improve the effectiveness of the multi-layered decision making process of procurement of health technology in hospitals in the Netherlands? To be able to answer this question, three perspectives are described.First of all, actor and stakeholder interaction within the decision arena. In the hospital we can define three actor types: clinical, operational and business actors. The project team for procurement processes generally includes a project leader, medical technology and clinical physics, procurement and users. Although it is preferable to have business oriented project leaders, the role is often fulfilled by operational or even clinical actors.The second perspective concentrates on external influences on the decision arena. Two types of external influence are described: regulation and industry influence. The recently introduced agreement medical technology is considered to be the most influential piece of regulation, despite it being a directive and not a law. The agreement medical technology introduced new procedures in terms of risk analysis and justification and induced big steps towards an increasingly formalized procurement process. Despite the fact that the covenant and all other applicable regulation steers to set up procurement processes as functionally oriented as possible, relational capital appears to be important in practice. However, statements about industry interference are variable.The third and final perspective introduced a process view. Procurement processes can generally be described in six steps: specification, selection, contracting, ordering, monitoring, and, aftercare (Veeke and Gunning, 1993). However, two preceding steps are suggested which are: budgeting and initiation. Budgeting holds the allocation of a yearly budget to the division which is the result of a dialogue between applicants, an investment committee and planning &amp; control. The initiation phase is a second gatekeeper in which the actual project initiation is justified and accepted. When we combine the three perspectives several lessons can be learnt.<br/>• Frequently a project leader lacks the competencies to lead a project properly. This has major influence on going through the project steps and the project outcome. A project leader should be a neutral actor who has no advising role towards the project team in terms of content. A competent project leader could increase buyer-supplier relationships which would decrease negative effects from disproportional social capital between physicians and manufacturers. It is suggested to consider full time project leaders with proper education to contribute to an effective purchasing process.<br/>• In the procurement process the ability to save financial resources decreases as is proceeded through the steps. Assuming that the added steps of budgeting and initiation are executed well, the specification step is crucial for the outcome of the project. Participants indicate however that the means of specification does not serve the goal. Detailed programs of requirements are the status quo but lack the ability to differentiate between options because too many basic requirements have to be registered. It is suggested to change towards a best value approach where the desired outcome is described.<br/>• A best value approach improves and demands buyer-supplier relationship. The specification and selection step melt together and the specification of solutions happens in cooperation with a manufacturer. Hospitals and the industry are dependent on each other for executing their purpose. Therefore cooperation between the two industries is already perceived as positive but legislation counteracts this. At this moment this is in this form not allowed for academic hospitals as they are subject to the tender law.<br/>We can conclude that an improved systems approach is essential for an effective procurement process and a project leader should provide in this. Having proper project lead creates the opportunity to experiment with the best value approach and break loose from the strict program of requirements homogenizing the healthcare technology market. Future research could test the potential of this method to increase opportunity for innovation for manufacturers, as well as hospitals.","HTM; Healthcare decision-making; healthcare logistics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
