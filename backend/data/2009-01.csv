(mentor); Hermans, W.J.A. (mentor); Van Dorst, M.J. (mentor)","2009","A design was made for the Calve/DSM site in Delft. It is a factory site which is being abandoned by its users, leaving 16 ha to be developed in the coming future. The aim is to develop a socially sustainable creative district through means of self-organisation. The project is restricted to the borders of the design location and takes the open urban system, in which it is set, as context. Dealing with self-organisation in process and design is what distinguishes this project. It is necessary to create a successful knowledge district and to make it socially sustainable. The method chosen for this design study uses a matrix as a testing and selection instrument. This Matrix method is used to streamline the organisation of urban space by its stakeholders. The basic assumption of this approach is that ""urban planners can play a pivotal role [in urban processes] by mapping out the existing situation, reconnoitring the various starting-points, assessing the margin for potential solutions, and then translating the outcomes of this process into a clear-cut plan."" (Veldhuis, 2003). Research in the thesis plan (Van der Kooij, 2008a) and two papers (Van der Kooij, 2008b; Van der Kooij 2008c) has led to formulate fourteen characteristics for the design of the district. Five of these design criteria are spatial preconditions to enable successful self-organisation of an urban district. The five rules imply creating recognisable territories, as these provide a readable privacy-zoning. This enables every individual -resident, visitor or passer-by- to regulate their own social contacts. This should not lead to a social network, but it does make the resident jointly-responsible for their physical and social surroundings.

(mentor); Soeter, J. (mentor); De Vries, J. (mentor)","2009","The main research question: ""Which real estate strategies have been successful for Dutch multinationals, and what can be learned from these successful strategies for the future""? Methodology: In order to answer this research question, both theoretical and empirical research is necessary. The theoretical research consists out of three chapters: business strategy, real estate strategy and economic context. The empirical research is based on four Dutch multinationals: Royal Ahold, AkzoNobel, Royal Shell and ING Group. This empirical research is a combination of document analysis, observations and multiple interviews, resulting in case descriptions. Subsequently, a cross case analyses will be made which, together with the theoretical research, will form the basis for the conclusions and recommendations. Conclusions: This research shows that when using a pro-active alignment, real estate is used as fifth resource in order to achieve organizational objectives. When a pro-active alignment is used, the chances increase that real estate strategies are more successful. Main reason is that real estate is used as fifth resource, and the fact that pre-determined organization- and real estate strategies are consistent and have a clear process and content, which makes real estate used more efficiently, provided that the context is supportive. However, this is not always the case. The research also shows that when using a re-active alignment, real estate is not used as fifth resource in order to achieve organizational objectives. Yet, the real estate strategies could still be successful. Research shows that sometimes, dependent on the combination of high contextual influences and type of organization, a re-active alignment is preferable. The research shows that the contextual influences are very important and always have to taken into consideration. The research shows that the context influences both the process and the content of both organizational- and real estate strategies. Based on this research, several context aspects that influence the organization could be presented: the 4th and 5th Kondratiev wave, market tendencies, governmental regulations, product demands, corporate image, and customers-whishes. It could be concluded that a successful real estate strategy does not have to consist out of certain pre determined themes. Successful real estate strategies are strategies that support the organizational objectives. The research shows that well-organized strategies with explicit themes (Like Ahold and Shell) often have a greater chance of success. In the case of AkzoNobel, the real estate strategies are context based and do not contain clear themes. Nevertheless, these strategies were successful too. For future successful real estate strategies, it could be stated that when designing a real estate strategy, one should investigate the context and possible future developments (for example scenario planning) and determine the possible threads and opportunities. Depending on the type of organization, branch and context influences, the decision should be made whether or not to use pro-active or re-active alignment.","strategy; real estate strategy; successful; multinational","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Architecture, Real Estate & Housing","","","","","","","","Architecture","","","","",""

The research was driven by a more specific question, being whether it is possible to detect if metastasis to the bone has occurred in cancer progression studies, using GFP cancel cell lines, i.e cancer cells that produce Green Fluorescent Proteins (GFP), at a continuous known rate. We tried to give generic answers by researching the following two subquestions. 1.) Is it possible to register a 3D mouse atlas to 2D Bioluminescense or Fluorescence photographs, based on only those photographs? 2.) Can we make qualitative statements on the location of gene expression, after registration with an atlas? The first question is covered in a paper called: 'Atlas Driven Registration of 3D Voxel Data to Multi-view Photographs Based on 3D Distance Maps.' It explains a method to register a 3D piecewise deformable mouse atlas to 2 or more photographic sideviews of a mouse. Based on a distance map that we generated from multiple backprojections of the sideview, we were able to construct an energy function that resembled a 'goodness of fit' of the registration. Comparisons were made with a gold standard and we obtained good results with our method. The second question is covered in a paper called: 'Testing for Spatial Gene Enrichment in C. Elegans Using Chronograms and a 1D Worm Atlas'. In this paper we did not focus on the registration process, because this was a straightforward procedure. With an atlas registered to an expression dataset, we applied different statistical tests to answer the question that given the atlas and the expression profile, the observed expression shows enrichment in a selected organ or not. In this paper we show that we are able to filter highly enriched signals out of our complete dataset. We further discuss the added value of our atlas since it is difficult to validate the obtained results of our tests.","3d distance map; 3d/2d registration; atlas; gene expression; enrichment","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Media and Knowledge Engineering","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

(mentor); Lakshmanan, M. (mentor)","2009","Wavelet Packet based Multi-Carrier Modulation (WPMCM) offers an alternative to the well-established OFDM as an efficient multicarrier modulation technique. It has strong advantage of being generic transmission scheme whose actual characteristics can be widely customized to fulfill several requirements and constraints of advanced communication systems. In the last decades wavelets have been favorably applied in signal and image processing fields but they just recently attracted attention of the telecommunication community. Therefore, some research questions remain to be addressed before novel WPMCM can be used in practice. One of the major concerns involves the performance of WPMCM transceivers under various synchronization errors. In this thesis we analyze the interference in WPMCM transmission caused by the carrier frequency offset, phase noise and time synchronization errors. Using standard wavelets the sensitivity of WPMCM transceivers to these errors is evaluated through simulation studies and their performances are compared and contrasted to OFDM. New wavelets are designed to alleviate the WPMCMs vulnerability to synchronization errors. Consequently, a filter design framework is built that facilitates the development of new wavelet bases according to the specific demands. In this regard the expressions for Inter Carrier Interference (ICI) and Inter Symbol Interference (ISI) in WPMCM transmission are first derived and stated as a convex optimization problem. Then an optimal filter that best handles these deleterious effects is designed and developed by means of Semi Definite Programming (SDP). Through computer simulations the performance advantage of the newly designed filter over standard wavelet filters is proven and further its performance is compared to the conventional OFDM.","wavelets; synchronization; filters; design; wpmcm","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Telecommunications","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

Differences of random Cantor sets","Don, H.","Dekking, F.M. (mentor); Aardal, K.I. (mentor); Kraaikamp, C. (mentor)","2009","This thesis consists of two parts, which are separate with respect to content. The first part considers a subject in the field of number theory, while in the second part a subject from probability theory is studied. The first part of this thesis deals with a variation on the Three Gap Theorem. The Three Gap Theorem states that the fractional parts of the first n multiples of an irrational number divide the interval [0,1] in subintervals of at most three different lengths. Instead of the fractional parts of these multiples, we considered the distances to the nearest integers, so the main question in this part of the thesis is: What can we say about the distribution of the distances of multiples of an irrational number to the nearest integer? We found a result similar to the Three Gap Theorem: these distances divide the interval [0,1/2] in subintervals of at most four different lengths. We give a proof of this result and also some additional properties are derived. The second part of this thesis is devoted to differences of random Cantor sets. The main question is the following: Under which conditions does the algebraic difference between two random Cantor sets contain an interval? There exist already some results in this direction. Dekking and Kuijvenhoven found some conditions under which the algebraic difference of two random Cantor sets contains an interval almost surely. In particular, they formulated the joint survival condition which they need to prove their main result. In the first chapter of Part II we try to find weaker conditions under which the result of Dekking and Kuijvenhoven can be proved. This results in the triangle growth condition and the max-min growth condition, of which the latter is the most promising condition. In the second chapter we consider a canonical class of random Cantor sets: correlated fractal percolation. Due to the elegant properties of this class, it is justified to pay special attention to it, but it also serves as a test case for the max-min growth condition. After derivation of some general results for correlated fractal percolation, we study some cases of flimsy correlated fractal percolation.","nearest integer; steinhaus theorem; random cantor set; palis conjecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied Mathematics","","","",""

(mentor); Hermans, E. (mentor); Van der Berg, R. (mentor); Caso, O. (mentor)","2009","The border between a city and its surrounding landscape comes in all kinds of forms. It is hard to say if one is better than the other. But can they help in orientating in the city? The cities of Flanders all have a very vague transition to the landscape. In the past the government has always stimulated the people to move into the countryside, creating many direct roads (steenwegen) between the cities. These roads where used for ribbon development, hiding the green chambers behind it.Antwerp has an interesting location in Flanders because of the river Schelde, its harbour and its location near the Netherlands. Since 1970, the government has noted that the connections between city and landscape (which is divided by the ring road of Antwerp) should be improved for more efficient transport to the city centers. But few thought is spent on creating public space around the ring road which is attractive for slow traffic, connecting the different city parts on a lower scale. An opportunity exists for creating one Antwerp with a strong identity. The main focus point of Antwerp development nowadays is in 't Eilandje, an old harbour district in the north. This will move to the Zuidrand because of several large projects, which consist of dwellings, offices and the first bridge ever to cross the Schelde. These separated developments miss the chance to develop the whole area as one, and creating a low scale connection between city and landscape. The moving petrol industries, its increasing mobility because of the Oosterweelverbinding and the Schelde river offer opportunities for large developments and giving identity to the South of Antwerp and the city in total. The design for the structure vision of the Zuidrand focuses on creating low scale connections, accenting crossing points, keeping open space where possible and orientation on the Schelde. Transfer points between different modalities offer an efficient transportation to the city center and the landscape. Flexibility is important in the plan. This is achieved by creating building envelopes for people to build in, the possibility for people to build their own houses and using a strategic phasing plan to realize the whole or parts of the plan. The main transfer point is a crossing of all kinds of transportation: pedestrians, bicycles, cars, train and trams. It offers the opportunity for a transfer place and large public functions. A lively and pedestrian friendly place is created by placing different kinds of functions in high density on a small surface area. This makes it attractive and efficient to use public transportation systems to go to your destination and than walk to your goal. An icon along the Schelde is created, forming an example for the rest of the city to also return to the Schelde, which is the origin of the city. In this way a marking point between city and landscape arises, helping in orientating in Antwerp.","urban design; transferium; mixed use; periphery; metropolitan design","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Architecture, Urbanism","","","","","","","","Architecture","","","","",""

(mentor); Schrijnen, P.M. (mentor); Ravesloot, C.M. (mentor); Verhagen, P.W.M. (mentor)","2009","In opdracht van het advies- en ingenieursbureau lv-lnfra en de Technische Universiteit Delft is onderzoek gedaan naar de effecten van het gedrag van het ingenieursbureau op het verloop van het ontwerpproces en de samenwerking met de opdrachtgever. Het doel van dit afstudeeronderzoek is om inzicht te krijgen in de interactie tussen de opdrachtgever en het ingenieursbureau gedurende het ontwerpproces van een infrastructureel project en aanbevelingen te doen over het gedrag van het ingenieursbureau ten opzichte van de opdrachtgever om een project volgens onderlinge afspraken en de eisen en wensen van de opdrachtgever te Iaten verlopen in evenwicht met de eisen en wensen van het ingenieursbureau. Door middel van een literatuuronderzoek is een theoretisch beeld geschetst van het verloop van het ontwerpproces volgens drie verschillende projectmanagementmethodieken: PRINCE2, Projectmatig Werken en Projectmatig Creeren. De drie beschreven projectmanagementmethodieken verschillen op verschillende aspecten, voornamelijk in de aanpak van een project. In PRINCE2 speelt hierarchie een grote rol. Deze methodiek geeft een zeer uitgewerkte en gedetailleerde projectaanpak, die is gericht op het realiseren van een vooraf gedefinieerd eindresultaat. Bij Projectmatig Werken en Projectmatig Creeren spelen de menselijke kant van het managen en de structuur van een project een grote rol. Het verschil tussen Projectmatig Werken en Projectmatig Creeren zit vooral in de visie en filosofie van beide methodieken. Projectmatig Werken is ontwikkeld vanuit een 'ingenieursvisie' en baseert de projectaanpak op vier met elkaar verweven processen: faseren, beheersen, beslissen en samenwerken. De methodiek Projectmatig Creeren vindt zijn oorsprong in een filosofie over hoe organisaties (moeten) werken. Deze methodiek richt zich daarbij hoofdzakelijk op het project als creatieproces. In dit creatieproces staan de mensen binnen de projectorganisatie en het ontwikkelen van een hoogwaardig product centraal. Daarbij spreekt de Projectmatig Creeren in termen van energie, inspiratie, commitment, scheppend vermogen en plezier. De drie projectmanagementmethodieken dienen als 'kapstok' voor het gedrag van het ingenieursbureau ten opzichte van de opdrachtgever in de later op te stellen scenario's. Daarbij is het gedrag van het ingenieursbureau op de volgende wijze gekarakteriseerd:  reactief I passief projectmanagement (PRINCE2);  neutraal I responsief projectmanagement (Projectmatig Werken);  pro-actief projectmanagement (Projectmatig Creeren). Na het literatuuronderzoek is het feitelijk ontwerpproces van het ingenieursbureau lv-lnfra geanalyseerd aan de hand van het theoretische ontwerpproces, het kwaliteitsmanagementsysteem van de lv-Groep en het referentieproject 'Verlegging van de N207 ten behoeve van de Overslag Terminal Alphen aan den Rijn (OTA)'. De opdrachtgever van dit project is de Provincie Zuid-Holland en het project is aanbesteed als onderdeel van de Raamovereenkomst lngenieursdiensten. lv-lnfra voert voor het project verschillende antwerp- en engineeringwerkzaamheden uit ten behoeve van verschillende fasen in het ontwerpproces. Dit project is als referentieproject gebruikt door de rol die lv-lnfra binnen dit project inneemt en doordat tijdens het ontwerpproces vertraging is ontstaan door het ontbreken van de benodigde gegevens afkomstig uit het explosievenonderzoek en grondmechanisch onderzoek. Om een beeld te krijgen van de invloed van het gedrag van het ingenieursbureau op het verloop van het ontwerpproces zijn verschillende scenario's beschreven. Aan de hand van het feitelijke verloop van het ontwerpproces ten behoeve van het referentieproject 'N207 verleggen in verband met de Overslag Terminal Alphen aan den Rijn', het kwaliteitsmanagementsysteem van de Iv-Groep en de drie projectmanagementmethodieken PRINCE2, Projectmatig Werken en Projectmatig Creëren zijn vier verschillende scenario's opgesteld. Door middel van deze scenario's is gekeken naar het effect van het gedrag van het ingenieursbureau op het verloop van het ontwerpproces ten behoeve van het project 'N207 verlegging in verband met OTA'. Daarbij is onderscheid gemaakt tussen de effecten van het gedrag op de korte termijn (ofwel op het verloop van het project) en de effecten op de lange termijn (investeren in het vertrouwen van de opdrachtgever in het ingenieursbureau). Hieruit blijkt dat op korte termijn, afhankelijk van de opdrachtomschrijving en de risico's binnen het project, het reactieve gedrag een positief resultaat oplevert voor het ingenieursbureau en het project. Indien uit de opdrachtomschrijving blijkt dat er in het project een aantal onzekerheden en risico's zitten, is het neutrale gedrag van het ingenieursbureau de beste optie voor een positief ontwerpproces. Wil het ingenieursbureau investeren in een samenwerking op de lange termijn dan blijkt pro-actief gedrag de beste mogelijkheden te bieden, zowel voor de opdrachtgever, het ingenieursbureau als voor het totale project. Aan de hand van de scenario's zijn verschillende aanbevelingen gedaan aan het ingenieursbureau lv-lnfra met betrekking tot het gedrag van het ingenieursbureau ten opzichte van de opdrachtgever. Daarbij speelt de strategie van het ingenieursbureau een belangrijke rol. Deze strategie is gebaseerd op de missie, visie en doelstelling van het ingenieursbureau. Het ingenieursbureau kan gedurende het ontwerpproces haar gedrag aanpassen aan de hand van de specifieke eisen, wensen en persoonlijke kwaliteiten van de opdrachtgever. Als de strategie van het ingenieursbureau gebaseerd is op een samenwerking op de lange termijn (investeren in toekomstige projecten), dan levert het neutrale gedrag of het pro-actieve gedrag ten opzichte van de opdrachtgever het beste rendement. Richt het ingenieursbureau zich op de korte termijn, zonder aandacht te besteden aan de lange termijn, dan levert het reactieve gedrag het meeste rendement op voor het ingenieursbureau.","","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

The main residual sediment transport patterns in the delta have been found to look as follows. On a large scale there is a counter clockwise circulation of sediment. The Wielingen/Scheur channel transports sediment from the seaside towards and into the estuary. Along the eastern side of the delta there is a net transport of sediment towards the north/northwest, through the Oostgat and Deurloo channels as well as through the Geul van de Walvischstaart. Along the western (seaward) edge of the delta there is a resulting sediment transport towards the south west. The Vlakte van de Raan sits in the centre of this cyclic pattern and the main transport direction across the Vlakte van de Raan is to the southeast. On the southern side of the Westerschelde inlet there is a residual sediment transport into the estuary, while on the northern side of the inlet there is a residual transport from the estuary into the delta. Changes in the sediment transport patterns have been investigated using computer model simulations for the years 1970, 1983 and 2002. The development of the delta and the changes in the transport patterns in these years are dominated by the influence of human activities in the delta. Notably the deepening of the Wielingen/Scheur and the entrance channel to the port of Zeebrugge as well as the expansion of the breakwaters of the port of Zeebrugge around 1980 have had a significant impact on the transport patterns along the southern side of the delta. A representative morphological wave has been determined to investigate the influence of waves on the sediment transport patterns in the delta. The wave considerably enhances the tide induced sediment transport in most of the delta, except for the Wielingen/Scheur channel. In the channel the wave causes a decrease of the flood directed transport and in the western part of the channel it changes the residual transport direction from flood to ebb. The wave influence at the inlet causes a decrease in the residual transport to the estuary.","sediment transport; Westerschelde; Westerschelde delta","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor)","2009","In the works of Guy Debord and Asger Jorn, durnement played an essential role in the construction of art during the early stages of the SI (Situationist International). For the Situationists durnement was used to create political statements rather than art. In order to explain this topic I will start with a brief description of both Guy Debords and Asger Jorns histories prior to their union in the SI. The construction of a time line will help to illustrate the sequence of events that eventually lead up to the student revolts in 1968 in the streets of Paris and other parts of France. This thesis will be concerning the formation years of the SI, in particular the events surrounding Debord and Jorn from the late 1940's just after WWII, until about 1960 when the SI had been formed. Th e people they worked with prior to meeting each other very much defined the directions they were to take. Although their interests were very similar, the forms of expression that each of them gave to them were quite different. Debord's more theoretical and textual approach complemented Jorn's more artistic approach to finding a new form of expression and communication. Debord was a strategic man; he always thought everything through, theorizing before acting. Jorn was just the opposite and believed that the theory would get in the way of his artistic spirit; instead he would work in concentrated intervals on a project or series, only to try and understand it and theorize it afterwards. His written contribution to the art world and the SI is not to be neglected. Each of these men was in search of a world, they dreamt of it, and attempted to show what it could look like, in their joint work. More than art, their work became, or essentially was a political message. Against a changing society that induced passiveness, they attempted to stage a revolt from within. They were aware that the medium they needed to communicate their message was the same medium that was the cause of this state of mind. They experimented with new implementations for media. Jorn worked with painting and collages in search of meaning in primitive and folkart together with numerous groups and movements, many of which he initiated. Debord investigated the textual and cognitive aspects of language, coming in contact with the Lettrists Movement early in his life. These events made their awareness of the medium all the greater, combined with their theories and conception of a new world they paired up (along with others) to form the SI, which built on concepts developed by the Lettrists as well as the many artists active in the Avant-garde at the time. This paper comments on and illustrates the use of media by Guy Debord and Asger Jorn during the founding period of the Lettrist International (LI) and the Situationist International (SI). The maps they made together based on their theories of the dve, durnement and psychogeography, and in particular they way in which Fin de Copenhague (Copenhagen: 1957) and Mires (Copenhagen: 1959) have come into being.","history paper; situationist; Guy Debord; Asger Jorn; détournement","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Architecture, Architecture","","","","","","","","Architecture","","","","",""

Today in the dense city of New York, every square meter is regulated by government. Their top-down method of city planning is driven by money, in which the use of public space has become restricted by an increasing amount of imposing rules. They have caused more barriers between the city and its residents and strongly influenced people’s involvement with their city. Goal. To explore a new design process that can connect research and design, in which the research is based on an investigation of the informal in public space and its potential that is deeply related to the everyday life, in a city where its residents are driven by the global economy. Method description. The starting point for my research is that a city functions on two different forces; the formal, belonging to governmental institutions, and the informal ones, based on the individuals activities. Although government is trying to regulate a city as much as possible, the real value system of a city is reflected in its informal side. The private chair in public space is an element that represents this informal side. It belongs to that part of the city which constitution is based on use. At first sight it might seem an insignificant element, but the fact that a private seat can be found in the streets of New York every 225 meters, shows the opposite. Despite of its small scale, the chair is of great importance in how the city functions. Besides showing courage and some egoism, putting a chair in public is a social gesture. The border between public and private place becomes a zone in which interaction between those two becomes possible. The fact that citizens create this interactive zone shows their affiliation with the city; they want to be a part of it. The private seats on the streets of New York clearly show the quality of its everyday life. With the private seat the inhabitant extends or creates a private territory within public space: a temporal territory containing the flexibility to adjust to people’s activities. To create these territories, each city got its own language. The language of New York is subject of investigation by mapping the chair, using it as a metaphor to get to an architectural level. The mapping concerned the relationship between space and movement and the position of the chair in public space. My method of investigation begins with observation of private seats which are encountered in the city of New York and analyzing their specific location. Through different ways of interpretation, the research provides a strategy for design.","informal; chairs","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Architecture","","","",""

(mentor)","2009","Wireless sensor networks are being deployed extensively to collect sensory data in various environments under different conditions. A wireless sensor network consists of multiple nodes, each with the ability to communicate using radio waves. The characteristics of the radio link between nodes are largely influenced by their environment. For instance, a radio link between two nodes with obstructed line-of-sight behaves more erratic than one that is not obstructed. This thesis focuses primarily on the characteristics of radio wave propagation in metal train compartments from a Computer Science standpoint. It means that the electrical aspects of this subject are not discussed in detail. In this work, we focus mainly on matters such as transmission output power, signal strength, preamble length, and packet reception rate. Various tests were performed throughout the length of the project. The purpose of the tests was to gain insights on the characteristics of radio wave propagation under various circumstances. We examine the effect exerted on radio wave propagation by varying transmission output power, antenna orientation, and antenna position. The characteristics reported in this thesis are signal strength, preamble length, and packet reception rate. The tests were carried out in an open field and in metal train compartments. The open field tests were used to create benchmark data for which data from metal train compartments could be compared with. The tests have led to several important findings. They show that radio links could be established within metal train compartments and even between two compartments. The latter seems to contradict rational belief that radio waves cannot propagate from one train compartment to the other, because of the metallic structure. Furthermore, there are some indications that antenna orientation may greatly influence radio wave propagations in compartments for low transmission output powers. This thesis also examines the preamble length. It finds that the preamble length could potentially be reduced to two bytes without affecting packet reception rates. And finally, the results show that higher transmission output power leads to greater packet reception rates and stronger received signal strengths, regardless of the environment. These and other findings are discussed in detail in the remainder of this thesis.","radio; wave; propagation; metal; mote; network; NS; train; communication; tnode; wireless; sensor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-10-02","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Embedded Systems","","","",""

The currently used procedure to estimate the properties seems cumbersome and inefficient and uncertainty regions of the estimated properties are not yet available. In this report the focus is on evaluating the current well test methods from a system identification point of view and on improving the well test analysis. The latest and best performing well test method in literature is evaluated by simulations and the results are compared with results of a new well test analysis method using Prediction Error Identification (PEI). PEI is a black box identification method. Both methods contribute to improvements in the field of well testing. The new method estimates a full expression for the system, consisting of the reservoir and well bore. Direct property estimation, without the interpretation of so called type curves, reliable uncertainty regions and large cost reduction are now within reach.","well testing; system identification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","DCSC","","","",""

The focus in the living with water research is on the design requirements and qualitative characteristics of an urban living environment. The study also concerns the creation of a safe and sustainable living area. The design requirements deal with the spatial, formal and functional requirements of living with water and will be integrated in the urban living typology. The living with water will be on the scale of the architectural object and the neighbourhood area. The sub-questions concerning this topic are: what is living what water and what are its spatial, formal and functional requirements? What existing living typology with water are designed and implemented and how do they function? What is the role of water in the urban area and in relation to the architectural object? The climate change focuses on the important aspects of the current and future changes and the requirements to the urban design. A study will be done on the changes on a global scale and the specific changes in the Netherlands and to the Dutch polder landscape. This topic also focuses on the environmental aspects for the sustainable development. The study also concerns the urban requirements of the integration of urban planning and flood risk management. The sub-questions for this topic are: What are the future changes in climate on a global and national scale to deal with within the project? What urban adaptation to the climate change of the Dutch polder landscape is needed? What are existing sustainable urban developments and what are there functional and formal requirements? To what extent can urban planning contribute to flood risk management? The third topic is the Commandeurspolder, the context. The focus in this research is on the spatial, functional and formal aspects of the current situation of the Commandeurspolder, with themes like landscape, water, buildings, infrastructure, leisure, etc. The urban requirements for the Commandeurspolder will be mainly on the scale of the polder. The study will also lead to two possible location for the implementation of he urban living typology. The sub-question for this theme are: What is the existing formal, spatial and functional situation of the Commandeurspolder? What are the future plans and visions of the city council, provincial government and the water board? What are of the polder can be used for the implementation and what are its specific needs? These three main topics should be combined to answer the main question. What safe, sustainable and qualitative urban living typology can be designed in order to adapt to climate change? The answer of this question is the design of the urban living typology which will be checked with the urban requirements of the theory paper, which focus on the contribution of urban planning to flood risk management. To check and proof the possibilities of the urban living typology this answer will be connected to the context. By doing this, the strengths and weaknesses of the urban living typology will be clear and the urban living typology can be ad justed to this specific location. This creates an overview of the general and location specific aspects of the design. To what extent can we implement the safe, sustainable and qualitative urban living typology in the two cases of the Commandeurspolder? The answer to these research questions is used to design the safe, sustainable and qualitative urban living typology, which will be able to adapt to climate change in the Dutch polder landscape.","sustainable; water management system; Commandeurspolder; urban design; future","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Architecture, Urbanism","","","","","","","","Architecture","","","","",""

(mentor); Hobma, F.A.M. (mentor)","2009","De Nederlandse historische binnensteden zijn over de eeuwen heen erg veranderd. Talloze ingrepen hebben plaatsgevonden om deze aan de eisen van het veranderende gebruik te laten voldoen. Denk hierbij aan de grote doorbraken ten behoeve van het autoverkeer. Tegenwoordig gaan we veel voorzichtiger om met ons cultureel erfgoed, we zijn meer bewust geworden van de waarde van onze historische binnensteden. Daarom zijn de meeste van deze ook aangewezen als een beschermd stadsgezicht. Daarnaast gebruiken ook steeds meer steden hun historische binnenstad om een identiteit te cren en te concurreren met andere steden. Het toenemende besef van cultuur en erfgoed heeft met zich meegebracht dat ingrepen in de historische binnensteden erg ingewikkeld en gevoelig zijn geworden omdat er met elke vernieuwing een deel van het verleden van een stad verdwijnt. Dat er iets moet gebeuren op sommige gebieden is niet de discussie maar de manier waarop dit gebeurd wel. Volgens sommigen gaat dit ten koste van het cultureel erfgoed en kan het op een andere manier waarbij meer rekening gehouden wordt met behoud van de aanwezige gebouwen en structuur. Deze groep vormt dan ook meestal het verzet tegen de ingrepen met als gevolg een 'lange' procesduur van gebiedsontwikkelingsprojecten in de historische binnensteden. En de lange duur van projecten kan er uiteindelijk in resulteren dat gebieden en zelfs historische binnensteden leeglopen en verpauperen. De stad Leiden is hier een goed voorbeeld van. Het Aalmarktproject komt hier maar niet van de grond met als gevolg dat het gebied verpaupert en leegloopt en de stad zijn concurrentiepositie ten opzichte van andere steden verliest. Om gebiedsontwikkelingen interessant en haalbaar te houden moeten er dus manieren gevonden worden om de lange duur te verkorten. De doelstelling van dit onderzoek is het verkrijgen van meer inzicht in de problematiek rondom de lange duur van projecten en het aangeven van mogelijkheden om deze te verkorten. De centrale onderzoeksvraag van dit onderzoek is: Is het proces bij gebiedsontwikkelingen in Nederlandse historische binnensteden te accelereren en zo ja op welke manieren is dit mogelijk? In dit onderzoek wordt eerst een theoretisch kader gevormd omtrent de begrippen historische binnensteden en gebiedsontwikkeling. Ook zijn hierbij naar de geldende wetten en regelgevingen in historische binnensteden en naar andere soortgelijke onderzoeken gekeken. Aan de hand van de verkregen kennis is het overig deel van het onderzoek verricht, namelijk een casusstudie. Uit het onderzoek is gebleken dat het proces sneller doorlopen zou kunnen worden maar dat de marges erg klein zijn. De duur van het proces hangt van veel dingen af en het is het samenspel van de verschillende aspecten die uiteindelijk ervoor zorgen of een project upt door gegaan is en hoe lang het dan geduurd heeft voordat de plannen gerealiseerd zijn. Ter verduidelijking hiervan is het aspect draagvlak. Een betere informatievoorziening kan erbij helpen om meer draagvlak te cren, maar dit is niet gegarandeerd. En dit is van bijna voor alle gevonden mogelijkheden te zeggen. De punten waardoor het proces sneller doorlopen zou kunnen zijn: - Een kwalitatief betere informatievoorziening - Meer aandacht voor draagvlak - Meer aandacht in de fasering voor: * Meer tijd voor de definitiefase, * Meer aandacht voor verwervingen en mogelijke onteigeningen, * Onderhandelingen, * Taken, * Draagvlak cren en behouden, zowel maatschappelijk als politiek, * Expertise, * Actoren, * Risicoverdeling. - Betere risico-inventarisatie - Samenwerkingen meer tijd geven zodat er meer een vertrouwensband ontstaat - Missende expertises in kaart brengen, zowel bij gemeente als bij marktpartijen - Juridisch gezien het begrip 'belanghebbenden' strikter definin - Meer aandacht voor procesmanagement - Een standvastiger en een professioneler gemeente","gebiedsontwikkeling; historische binnensteden; proces","nl","master thesis","TU Delft, Architecture, Real Estate & Housing","","","","","","","","Architecture","","","","",""

(mentor); Vermeersen, B. (mentor)","2009","Only 6 out of 16 missions to the surface of Mars have been successful, all have been NASA missions. The landing sites of all the successful missions have been carefully selected in a process where: 1) scientists propose candidate landing sites, 2) engineers check whether these sites allow for a safe landing, and 3) over a few iterations, the number of sites is brought down to the final site and a back-up. ExoMars will be the first lander to Mars designed by the European Space Agency. It will explore Mars in search of signs of past and present life. An extensive landing-site selection process is required to find a landing site that is safe from both an engineering perspective and that will help to answer the mission’s science objectives. This research has identified four developments that decrease the efficiency of the current landing-site selection process: 1) there is more and more data available on Mars, which makes combining and analysing all this data manually no longer possible; 2) the technical capabilities of the landing system are increasing, which makes a larger part of the surface available; 3) the questions posed in the scientific and exploration objectives become more and more specific, which sets more stringent requirements on where these questions can be answered; and 4) the Martian surface turned out to be more variable in composition than was previously thought. This study recommends a set of improvements in the form of a decision support system (DSS) that assists experts in the landing-site selection process. The DSS developed for this research includes two prototypes 1) a method that emulates the pattern recognition of a trained, terrain-analysis expert (i.e. a geologist) on a computer, called the terrain fingerprinting method (TFM); and 2) a platform that provides the interface through which all stakeholders in the landing site selection process (scientists, engineers, students, managers) can efficiently interact. This study concludes that I) the TFM can be used to find a landing site that optimises both the safety of the mission and the possibility for scientific return at the site. II) A central platform is required in order to empower the landing site selection community by sharing higher level data products, tools (e.g. TFM software tools), a forum, and documentation. III) The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is the central authority in the planetary sciences community in the USA providing standardisation support, the lack of such a central authority in Europe will negatively affect the process of landing-site selection by European scientists for all future planetary landers. And IV) for the various stakeholders to effectively collaborate and interact in the process of landing-site selection, standardisation of elements related to geographically referenced planetary data is essential.","Mars; Decision Support System; Landing-site selection; ExoMars; Solar System Exploration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-03-07","Aerospace Engineering","Astrodynamics and Satellite Systems","","","",""

(mentor); Bruining, J. (mentor)","2009","Case II (super)-diffusion is characterized by a diffusion like process that goes faster than the square root of time. Superdiffusion can occur in polymeric structures if a stress gradient enhances the diffusion process. In such a case the part of the polymer invaded by the penetrant, e.g. CO2, undergoes a transition in structure from the glass state to a rubber like state. In ideal cases the transition zone can propagate proportional to time. The Thomas & Windle model, a model that describes anomalous diffusion behavior in polymers, was also proposed to describe diffusion of CO2 in coal. The proposal was due to the similarities in structure between coal and glassy polymers. Coal has a molecular structure of carbon-carbon bonds with ‘open holes’ between the chains. If these holes are smaller in volume than the volume of a CO2-molecule, the uptake of CO2 leads to a geometric problem. The CO2 molecules will squeeze themselves into the structure, resulting into a swollen rubbery coal. This phenomenon is happening due to the fact that a carbon-carbon dioxide bond is thermodynamically favored above the carbon-carbon bond and is more stable than the other. Analysis of the Thomas & Windle model shows there is a time where diffusion is much faster than conventional diffusion. The results also show that super-diffusion is only a transitional effect, i.e., there is an initial phase where relaxation dominates, a transitional phase that exhibits anomalous diffusion and a long time phase that shows the typical square root of time behavior of an ordinary diffusion process. This study gives details of a numerical model used to solve the stress induced diffusion equation using the Finite Element Method implemented in Matlab. The numerical results show that for some favorable set of parameters diffusion can indeed be faster than Fickean diffusion during an intermediate stage. For other parameters the diffusion can be slower. A comparison to a laboratory result shows an example where diffusion appears to be slower.","CO2 sequestration; finite element modelling; Thomas & Windle Model; superdiffusion; stress-enhanced diffusion; greenhouse gas; case II-diffusion; non-Fickean diffusion","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2009-09-21","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Petroleum Engineering","","","",""

However, most of the designs introduced so far were proven to be unsuitable because of the complex urban wind conditions and because of the fact that the design of urban wind turbines is by its nature a challenging process, with many different issues needed to be taken into consideration. The thesis deals with the conceptual design of an Urban Vertical Axis Wind Turbine, with main purpose to improve the state-of-the-art of the design of these systems using Systems Engineering and Knowledge Engineering. A distinct and integrated design procedure has been established. Based on this procedure, the most relevant issues for the design were investigated, including the operational environment. The requirements of the system were derived and the SE process was used for transforming these requirements into optimum design solutions. The resulting topology was analyzed, the components and the interactions between them and the operational environment were identified, together with the design considerations. The necessary scientific knowledge for the design of these systems was identified and allocated to the different components. The application of the methodology focused on the rotor. Additional SE tools were used and the detailed design procedure for the system and for the rotor was addressed. The procedure was supported by Knowledge Engineering/Knowledge Management techniques, and the software tool PCPACK was used for capturing and structuring all the knowledge required for this project. As a result, an initiation of a knowledgebase for the urban VAWT systems has been established.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Wind Energy","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Volta is a new technology that targets simplifying this type of software. It offers developers a toolkit that enables Web development in any .NET language. This is done by recompiling the CIL code to JavaScript for the client tier (browser) and a .NET application for the Web server. The decision of determining on which tier certain code should run is easily carried through by adding an attribute to a class. A showcase has been developed stretching the possibilities of the first Community Technology Preview (CTP) of Volta. A CTP is a pre-release version of software intended as a proof-of-concept for the community. The idea of the showcase was to provide users an impression of their carbon-footprint relative to others, accomplished by using Web services and information provided by users themselves. The experiences gained by building this showcase have been used in the research for Voltaâs value for Web application projects. The showcase was also submitted for Microsoftâs Imagine Cup software development competition, which imposed additional requirements on the showcase. Many issues were encountered during the development, which forced the project group to adjust the requirements while implementing. The end result offers users login functionality, the ability to enter its food, house and travel CO2-emission and provides an overview of the userâs past and present carbon-footprint. The project also focused on researching the possibilities of Volta. A number of research questions were posed and investigated in order to provide better information about the strengths and weaknesses of Volta. This led to the discovery of a number of problems from which the following suggestions for improvements were derived: 1. Provide more documentation 2. Equalize the behavior of Volta code in Debug and Release mode 3. Decrease the number of restrictions on classes 4. Increase cooperation with other technologies 5. Optimize performance 6. Increase security functionality Although a developer should still be aware of the traps of distributed computing, Volta can offer benefits for developing applications. Web applications can be built with all .NET languages. Developers do not have to worry about the communication code between tiers. The facilities of the Visual Studio IDE can be used for testing, debugging and cooperating with other technologies. The end-to-end profiler is a useful tool for analyzing and optimizing a tier-split application. The community technology preview of Volta looks promising. It is currently not fit for developing actual Web applications, but if the developers continue working on Volta and address the issues mentioned, Volta could prove to be a useful toolkit for Web development.","volta; .net; tier-splitting; recompilation; javascript","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

Wanneer men de stad in- of uit wilde gaan kwam men door een van de vele stadspoorten uit op een plein. Het plein diende als ontmoetingsplek in de stad en als uitvalsbasis naar de buitenwereld toe. De Singelpleinen zijn vernoemd naar de dichtstbijzijnde stad die reizigers en kooplui onderweg naar Amsterdam passeerden. Aan de Singel zijn nu nog steeds het Leidseplein, het Haarlemmerplein en het Weesperplein belangrijke plekken binnen de stad Amsterdam. Hoewel de fortificaties lang geleden gesloopt zijn geeft het Singel Amsterdam nog steeds een belangrijke structuur. Het water is de laatste ring van de beroemde grachtengordel. Aan de oostzijde van de stad aan de andere kant van de Amstel is de Singel drooggelegd en is het water omgeleid door de Nieuwe Vaart naar het Amsterdamrijnkanaal. Nu het pad wordt herontwikkeld tot volwaardig stedelijk gebied maakt de Nieuwe Vaart definitief deel uit vsn de Singel. Met een nieuw plein achter het water wordt het ontbrekende plein toegevoegd. Het Almeerderplein als moderne uitvalsbasis naar een jonge stad. De plek wordt gedefinieerd aan de hand van een pleingebouw. Het pleingebouw is onafhankelijk van de stedenbouwkundige structuur, waarbij een belangrijke eigenschap is dat deze zich als eenheid naar buiten presenteert. De eenheid van het Almeerderplein wordt bewerkstelligd door een gesloten sculpturale massa die dramatisch boven de onderbouw zweeft. Bioscoopzalen, collegezalen, archiefruimte en een discotheek annex popzaal hebben allen een blinde gevel en worden in de massa gesitueerd. De sculpturaliteit wordt benadrukt door trappen en door de tribunes van de college- en bioscoopzalen. De stedenbouwkundige randvoorwaarden bepalen de vormgeving van de massa. De belangrijke verbinding stad-plein wordt aangeduid door aan deze zijde de sculpturale ring omhoog te trekken. Onder de massa is ruimte gereserveerd voor een restaurant met uitzicht over de binnenstad. De secundaire toegang naar Almere - de Panamalaan - wordt aangeduid door een golfbeweging van de massa. Sculpturaliteit staat in dienst van de stedenbouwkundige context.","plein; bioscoop; singel; pleingebouw; sculpturaal","nl","master thesis","TU Delft, Architecture, Architecture","","","","","","","","Architecture","","","","",""

Het nieuwe land werd zo ontworpen dat zowel de ruimtelijke inrichting als het functioneren van de samenleving geheel ten dienst stond van de landbouw. De kolonistenselectie, het verkavelingspatroon, het ritme van de boerderijen en de positionering van de dorpen en het poldercentrum onderstrepen de planologische voorbeeldigheid van die tijd. De bewoners waren allemaal op een bepaalde manier aan de landbouw gerelateerd. De wijze waarop deze landbouwsamenleving functioneerde is nog steeds afleesbaar uit de ruimtelijke structuur van de hedendaagse Noordoostpolder. Het is een produktielandschap. Landbouw was, is en zal in de toekomst de primaire functie van de Noordoostpolder zijn. Maar door de mechanisatie en de schaalvergroting van de agrarische bedrijven is het aantal boeren gehalveerd en zijn de overige bewoners geen landarbeider meer. De samenleving van de Noordoostpolder is niet meer eenzijdig gericht op de landbouw en krijgt meer stedelijke invloeden. Daardoor is de landbouwidentiteit van de samenleving afgezwakt. De bewoners in de Noordoostpolder hebben onder andere behoefte aan functies gekregen die gericht zijn op vrijetijdsbesteding. De provincie Flevoland ziet hier een nieuwe bron van inkomsten, doordat ook mensen buiten de polder deze functies in de Noordoostpolder zullen gebruiken. Voor deze functies is een masterplan ontwikkeld dat de Noordoostpolder opdeelt in drie zones: een landbouw-, een cultuurhistorische en een vrijetijdsbesteding zone. Deze opdeling is volgens mij een misstap. De zonering zal de eenheid van het karakteristieke Noordoostpolderlandschap aantasten. Ook zal de identiteit van de Noordoostpolder, die zo sterk samenhangt met haar ruimtelijke context, door deze zonering veranderen.","","nl","master thesis","TU Delft, Architecture","","","","","","","","Architecture","","","","",""
