The available housing is either too expensive or simply unfit for families. They are therefore forced by the circumstances to move to the suburbs, away from their job, family and friends in the city. In the process, the city loses valuable middle class workers and the social cohesion that families ensure. We need solutions to this lack of affordable urban housing that is suitable for families. This project explores one alternative form of housing that has the potential to meet that challenge: co-housing. The key in this kind of housing is the externalization of those functions that don’t necessarily need to take place in the private realm. In that way, co-housing provides with private units that share common spaces, usually a large kitchen and dining room, as well as playing spaces for children. This brings down the housing costs and suits the needs of the urban middle class families. The project therefore answers the question: How to provide affordable and suitable housing for middle class urban families in a high-density urban context? The solution involves the use of stacked co-housing communities.","Dutch; Dwelling; Co-housing; Cohousing; Urban families; Amsterdam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Dwelling","","52.399183, 4.877120"

To achieve this, we need to change the way we build, this accounts as well for construction materials. For thousands of years, humans have lived in clay and timber hybrid constructions. These hybrids are made of sustainable, possibly circular, highly available and renewable materials with low embodied energy. However, the labour-intensive production makes these hybrid constructions expensive. This was, among others, one reason why modern architecture and construction looked to other, industrial and artificial building materials to satisfy our need for cheap, fast and prefabricated construction methods. The promising, traditional combination of earth and timber has barley been used for prefabricated wall components and façades, despite their huge ecological benefits. On the contrary, questionable and polluting building technologies and materials are used to increase the efficiency within the construction sector. <br/><br/>As designers and engineers, we should start looking back into clay/timber hybrids as one solution architecture can offer as an answer to the climate crisis, despite the high labour cost of this construction type. Digitalisation might be a solution to tackle these high costs. Customized computational design, large-scale 3D-printing and file-to-factory robotic fabrication allow the automatization of certain labour-intensive production steps. It offers new perspectives on production techniques and material usage. The fourth industrial revolution could, in combination with changing legislation and CO2 taxation, lead to a revival of clay/timber hybrid buildings. These hybrids could be made of timber with a density decreased non-structural gradient material infill, such as 3D printed with clay. <br/><br/>Exploring material mixtures, production techniques and building components results in a computational, informative workflow for customized nozzles and the building component. This allows to coordinate and customise the nozzle design according to the limitations of the material properties, the building component and the 3D printing process. <br/><br/>But how can the density of a 3D Printed clay prefab wall component with a 6-axis robotic arm be gradually decreased? Designing a gradient material that is dense on the inside and gets increasingly lighter towards the outside could increase the efficiency by adding another function to the earthen building element. The created cavities reduce the density, the thermal conductivity and the material usage compared to a traditional solid earthen infill. To simplify the toolpath and reduce the cycle time each density class of this stepwise gradated wall system has its customized nozzle. The customization of the nozzle allows to print a complex cross-section geometry with a simplified, otherwise complex toolpath.<br/><br/>Establishing an informative workflow between the building component design, the production tools and the material mixture should lead to a feasible design that is considering the limitations of each input category. Ideally, this approach reduces the necessary amount of adaptations before the earthen component infill can be printed. The nozzles will be customized to reduce the cycle time and shorten the toolpath by creating a gradient material at the same time. This material can be used as an infill for a hybrid wall structure. <br","Gradient Material; Additive Manufacturing; Clay; Earth; Robotic; Prefabricated Wall Component; Nozzles; Customized design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","",""

Until now, mostly small blocks from structural cast glass have been generated in the building industry, revealing a research gap regarding massive components. Apart from the size, the unlimited shape potentials of cast glass have hardly been explored so far. This is because glass casting can be a very challenging process when it comes to the solidification of the material which needs to be completed under specific program settings. Except from the brittleness of the body during the annealing process, it can take months, even years for a large-scale element to be completed, because of the full controllable conditions under which the annealing process takes place. In addition, the mould types that are currently used for cast glass components present several restrictions such as the manufacturing costs, the accuracy or the sizing. An existing glass slab in the Acropolis museum, in Athens, was chosen to embody the research goals. The slab is located on top of archeological discoveries making the need for transparency necessary. The current slab consists of float glass panes with a concrete substructure which severally restrains the viewing. The thesis aim is to develop a free-form monolithic slab exclusively from cast glass without the need of external substructure. In order to address the above demands, the topology optimization method was introduced. Several algorithms of topology optimization have been developed. A compliance-based optimization was demonstrated as the most appropriate for the specific project. Obtained from the literature framework, the main principles that the design follows gravitate towards the structural, cast glass and manufacturing requirements. The external applied load, in addition to the allowable structural values were calculated. The importance for a flat upper surface, where a safety float glass layer of a permitted deformation should be laminated, was established. Regarding the cast glass demands, it is necessary to acquire a design with smooth surfaces, round edges and uniform distributed material throughout the entire model. For the current project, the optimized slab is decided to mainly consist of borosilicate glass.. A slab separation is crucial for transportation reasons. After the definition of the main design principles that the final product should respect, the design development was conducted with the combination of three methods: topology optimization, manual design and structural validation. The final result of the optimized slab successfully fulfills the preset design criteria, as the obtained structure presents 55.2% less mass than the solid version that was initially designed to replace the existing slab in the museum. In addition, a more efficient material distribution in the optimized model renders the slab more compatible for the cast glass annealing process. The result of the topology optimization technique was a quite complex geometry which is not that effective to be produced in the conventional moulds that are currently available for cast glass applications. Therefore, a new technique needed to be explored, which follows the 3d printing evolution in the building industry. The main restriction of the printed moulds is the limited available sizing that the commercial printers provide. As a solution to this problem, the separation of the large-scale mould into smaller segments was studied, as well as the development of the connecting system of these parts. The entire fabrication technique, from the moulds printing method, to the assembly components and glass melting was investigated. Finally, the transportation and integration of the slab into the building was explored, concluding with structural solutions that respect the museum and the assembly order that the slab can be attached on it.","Cast glass; Topology Optimisation; 3d printed sand moulds; Structural glass; Transparency; Glass slab; Compliance-based optimization; Ansys optimization; Infill density","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","",""

Peri-urbanity in East-Asia - or Desakota, a term coined by Terry McGee in the 1990s - can be conceptualized as a combination of easing urban agglomerations and different forms of rural transformation. Being bypassed by economic metropolitan structures, it forms a diffuse mix of agricultural, industrial, and residential patches. Dramatic levels of air pollution and the loss of agricultural land threaten environmental and social structures. What was once called the hinterland has lost its original function. The shortcomings of spatial planning practices and regional governance should be counteracted by readjusted principles of urbanism. It is hypothesized that integration and compactness can be suitable tools to contribute to the sustainable development of megaregions, if they adapt to the complexities and scales posed by mega-regionalization. This hypothesis is explored through in-depth analyses on multiple scales and their translation into (design) strategies. European case studies help to make transitions between well-known icons of regional planning and design, and the unknowns of the Chinese megaregion. The methodology lays out an agenda that leads to three concrete outcomes. Firstly, the “Desakota Dilemmas” clarify the difficulties of balancing environmental and social concerns. Secondly, the “Desakota Strategies” present proposals for alternative forms of peri-urbanization that are based on the diversity of village communities and the detailed analysis of spatial pre-conditions. Thirdly, the “Jing-Jin-Ji Planning Framework” synthesizes the outcomes of analysis and design, and presents recommendations that advocate for a type of regional planning that is based on collective action, multi-scalar cooperation, and the recognition of uncertainty.","Desakota; Peri-urbanization; Megaregions; China; Compact City; Villages","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","","39.454340, 116.559527"

Starting in Germany during the late 1990s and early 2000s, and then slowly but surely spreading across most of Europe (Bontie and Musterd, 2012). Nearly half of Europe's cities home to one-third of the continent's population- are shrinking in one way or another. Shrinkage is a very diverse and complex process in urban development, but one of the most intuitive phenomena is structural population loss, constant and considerable. Whether the reason for shrinkage is deindustrialization or postwar politics, urban lifecycle is the spatial effect of economic circular development (Martinez-Fernandez at el, 2012).In a shrinking city or more generally, a shrinking area, social problems and economic problems are eventually affecting local residents' life, causing decrease in security, amenity, comfort, social vital ity, etc., reducing economic circulations and putting the future of the region into worrying uncertainty. Parkstad Limburg, in south part of Limburg Province in the Netherlands, has a long history, and experienced rapid urbanization and development in 20th century due to mining industry. However, after shutting down of mine sites, this region has been facing shrinkage even till now. Before Industrial Revolution, Parkstad has an agricultural-based history since Roman time; although urbanization and expansion reduced farming area significantly, there are still many heritages of ancient natural landscape and agricultural production existing in Parkstad. The unique hilly landscape being found nowhere else in the country also makes the region a really popular tourism destination for visitors from home and abroad. Currently Parkstad is undergoing economic restructuring in this post-mining period and it's looking forwarding to a sustainable regional economic development using its tourism resource which has great potential. Shrinkage has brought challenges as well as opportunities to Parkstad. In this post-industrial era, with the background condition of shrink age, how to promote economic circulation and social vibrancy using local material to trigger new types of spatial programming? This landscape architecture design project, taking Parkstad as an example, proposes reintroduction of agricultural landscape elements in order to reproduce the idyllic beauty and attract tourists. In small scale, a typical South Limburg farmhouse is transformed into a green care farm for the elderly with traditional agricultural elements such as high-stemmed orchard. How reintroduction of agricultural landscape elements can improve attract tourism and investment in a regional scale is also explained. This project is hoped to explore how adaptive reuse of landscape heritage especially agricultural heritage can improve living quality, boost economic activities, stimulate social vitality to present Parkstad with a regional development of positive circulation","shrinkage; landscape heritage; aging society","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","Harvest Lab","50.91571, 5.86417"

The occurrence and development of flood disasters are restricted and affected by many factors such as meteorology, hydrology, underlying surfaces and human activities. In recent decades, the changes of evaporation and stream flow caused by land use in the river basin have been more and more important. By calculating the long-term average proportion of all land use types in each catchment during the study period, the effects of six main land use types are evaluated one by one, including forest, grassland, pasture land, cropland, shrub land and wetland.<br/>This thesis mainly uses Budyko framework to analyze large-sample catchments with different land uses in the United States. Totally 200 small catchments (&lt;1000 km2) located almost evenly in the continental United States are selected as the research samples. Budyko framework is established with long-term mean precipitation, potential evaporation and actual evaporation from 1981 to 2013. The difference between evaporation index estimated from data and theoretical evaporation index calculated from theoretical Budyko equation is regarded as the best indicator to evaluate the impacts of different land uses qualitatively. Then, the Budyko framework is divided into five bins according to the dryness index and these watersheds are studied in each bin. Besides, the effects of each land use are quantitatively evaluated by making multiple linear regressions. It also discusses two other methods, Fu's equation and Zhang's equation. The best-fit values of parameter w of the main land types are calculated by nonlinear regression. The best-fit w values in this thesis are compared with previous researches to find out some possible reasons causing the differences. <br/>From the results in this thesis, forest and shrub land coverage evaporate less and lead to more runoff. However, cropland, grassland and pasture land coverage evaporate more and lead to less runoff. It needs to be emphasized that the results show forest land evaporates more than grassland, which is contradictory with what others found. Some physical and hydrometeorological characteristics of the catchments are the possible reasons to explain the results, including mean slopes, precipitation, root systems and so on. Lastly, the evaluation of the impacts of land use in small watersheds on evaporation and stream flow also provides strategic guidance for future land use planning.","Land use, catchments, evaporation, stream flow, Budyko framework, qualitatively, quantitatively","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For visually impaired people this is often not the case, even though museums have a social responsibility to make  their collections accessible for everyone. Especially since the United Nations agreed on the rights of persons with disabilities to live independently and participate fully in all aspects of life (2006). The process of creating a more inclusive cultural sector is well underway, but people with a visual impairment are often excluded from truly experiencing the art world. In my thesis I explored opportunities for Dutch museums to bridge this gap. The Netherlands counts 320.000 people with a visual impairment (in different forms). Having a visual impairment affects many aspects of life, ranging from practical to psychological and social problems. Being dependent on others is experienced as a key disadvantage. Visually impaired people want equal chances in what society provides to the public, including art. They like to be free in choosing when to go to a museum and what artworks to explore rather than depend on special museum tours and selected art to experience with multiple senses. They also like to explore art together with a companion; a sighted friend, family member or partner. They want a playful social interaction; they dislike experiencing art only through the eyes of their companion. The question is how to create an equal, balanced experience with a sighted person. In order to explore the value and richness of an artwork, visually impaired people put a strong emphasis on the use of multiple senses. Unlike visually impaired people, sighted people can explore artworks, as they prefer. I found inspiration for my design in two principles on how sighted people explore visual art: Visual Thinking Strategy (VTS, 2020) and a principle by Panofsky. VTS is a learning method to observe, listen and build on each other without judgment when looking at art. The Panofsky principle consists of 3 layers: 1. Gather visual information; 2. Apply meaning to what is observed; 3. Think about what is observed and seek to broaden the meaning. (Messham-Muir, 2014). Visually impaired people can receive pure visual information through observational techniques. Sighted people can learn from using other senses than just sight. Both get a deeper understanding by talking to each other, seeking the underlying meaning and building knowledge together. After my analysis, I designed and prototyped ideas. The most promising idea turned out to be a toolkit with guidelines and tools for multi-sensory experiences: describing, (tactile) drawing, enacting, talking and touching. I developed this idea into a concept design and tested it with the target audience. The playful and interactive tools create an equal museum experience for visually impaired people (different levels) and their sighted companion. The toolkit is designed in such a way that interaction leaves room for own imagination and interpretation about the artwork. Visually impaired and sighted visitors will discover equally interesting information. It helps them to interact socially, start dialogue and exchange thoughts about artworks. The toolkit can be used independently at any time, at any museum and for any type of artwork.","Visually impaired people; Art; Museums; Toolkit; Inclusive design; Accessibility; Design research; Blind people","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The independent artists, activists, working-class people, among many other low- and mid-income groups who gave Amsterdam its unique, diverse and open character, have been driven out of the city centre for decades. Their place in the city is increasingly being taken by a homogeneous high-income group, leaving a unilateral street culture. Most striking about this issue is that artists are often accused of being contributors to this process called gentrification. The creativity of artists is often used by urban policy makers and developers to revitalize deprived urban areas. Their presence changes the perception of an area and forms an attractive business climate for today’s creative-knowledge economy. This adds value to the assets of property owners which causes an increase in house prices and leads to the eviction of the local inhabitants and even the artists themselves. In their search for a new place to live and work, groups of artists started inhabiting old, mostly industrial light spaces but it seems that no matter where they go, gentrification is just around the corner. As a response to this unfair gentrification process and the decreasing amount of affordable live- and workspaces, the final design facilitates a new and permanent ‘live-work’ building for many different types of artists to give them back their right to the city.","Amsterdam; Arts; Culture; Artist Housing; Broedplaats; Gentrification; Creative Class; Creative City; Collective Housing; Collaboration; Connectivity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Dwelling","","52.397691, 4.875745"

Industry 4.0 is new reality, but it hasn’t been yet fully developed. As a result, there isn’t enough practical knowledge on what will affect the location of the new industries. In order to meet the changes of Industry 4.0, the Netherlands developed an agenda under the name “Smart Industry” with various actions for promoting it, and one of them are the “Fieldlabs”. Fieldlabs are practical experimental environments for innovation, created by multiple actors in which they cooperate in order to succeed in implementing innovative projects in the industrial sector. These fieldlabs are annually multiplied in the Netherlands and can affect the relations of the urban fabric, since people from knowledge institutions, companies and governmental authorities cooperate and co-work in them. The goal of this report is to investigate if and which spatial conditions have an impact on the location choice of these fieldlabs. In order to do this the location factors affecting the fieldlabs will be researched. These location factors are gathered, analyzed and tested on different types of fieldlabs. A literature review on the concepts, will be held together with surveys and case studies in order to approach methodically the goal of this master thesis. Semi-structured interviews with representatives of the fieldlabs are conducted for analyzing better the case studies and getting more useful insights. As an outcome, the main research question is answered and concluded into the location factors that influence the location choice of the Dutch Industry 4.0 fieldlabs. The three main factors are; the core stakeholders and the scope of the fieldlab, from an organizational point of view; the financial power of the fieldlab from an organizational point of view, that translates to dependency on available location; and the network of partners of the fieldlab from a spatial point of view, since it drives the fieldlab to be located in the relevant locations that the network is situated. This research is also including a plan approach with spatial guidelines for supporting the future fieldlabs selecting their ideal location and the cities in order to organize them better, as also relative guidelines for policymakers in order to gain the maximum experience out of the generation of fieldlabs for the future spatial planning.","Fieldlabs; Network; Smart Industry; Industry 4.0; Location Factors; Triple Helix","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

The problem is formulated as a decentralized system. Each aircraft is modeled as an agent that uses local observations while being limited to heading changes only. During learning, information about the actions of surrounding agents are added. It is shown that for low air traffic density scenarios the model is able to provide collision avoidance and approach the correct runway under realistic limitations. However, due to the lack of global coordination and limited modeling of spatial relation between states this method is unable to solve more complex and higher air traffic density situations.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

According to Leslie Sklair (2010): “Consumerism - or more accurately, the culture-ideology of consumerism - refers to a set of beliefs and values, integral but not exclusive to the system of capitalist globalization, intended to make people believe that human worth is best ensured and happiness is best achieved in terms of our consumption and possessions.”In addition to that, according to ‘The Harvard Guide to Shopping’ by Rem Koolhaas, “Shopping is arguably the last remaining form of public activity”, and “perhaps the beginning of the 21st century will be remembered as the point where the urban could no longer be understood without shopping.” Nowadays shopping is taking over every program imaginable. As a parasite it attaches itself to different programs, finding ways to survive and dominate, invading almost all human activity (Leong, 2001). Through psychoanalysis and psychogramming, people are being manipulatively forced to consume even more for the sake of making economic profit (Hosoya &amp; Schaefer, 2001).The fact that one of nowadays most common public activity in gathering people is been led by manipulative strategies is shocking and urges to consider a place for the public that does not intend to manipulate for the sake of making economic profit. Therefore the public condenser in Copenhagen provides a place in which multiple activities can take place for different target audiences, not for the sake of making profit, but for the sake of providing valuable and unique experiences to the public in complete honesty, trustworthiness and transparency. Here, value refers to the immaterial profit as a counter reaction on consumerism while uniqueness refers to the extraordinary activities that can be achieved without the need of extravagancy. Honesty and trustworthiness refer to the anti-manipulative character of the building, while transparency refers to its straightforwardness and (visual) permeability.","Consumerism; Non-commercial; Multiplicity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","The Public Condenser","55.670111, 12.553861"

This thesis discusses the design of the energy harvesting and control module, which is one of the three sub-modules of the system. The goal is to sustain the energy demands of the sensor in a durable way, in order to operate for 20 years without requiring maintenance. To achieve this, several ambient energy sources and their harvesting techniques are investigated and simulated to examine the energy that can be harvested. This resulted in the use of solar energy, harvested by a solar cell and controlled by a maximum power point tracking module. Next, different energy storage implementations are considered to store the harvested energy temporarily. The use of a 5 F supercapacitor is concluded. Furthermore, an energy monitoring circuit is designed to measure the energy stored in the supercapacitor. Full system reliability simulations are done to verify the complete design by utilising the solar irradiance and temperature data of the past ten years. From these simulations is concluded that the design can sustain the energy demands of the sensor at all times.","Energy harvesting; Sustainable Energy; MPPT; MPPT module; Solar cell; Solar; Supercapacitor; Supercapacitor storage; Energy monitoring; SPV1050; Energy control; Smart agriculture; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor nodes; Sustainable harvesting; RF energy harvesting; SPV1050 implementation; Ambient energy sources; Ambient energy","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","The Autonomous Temperature Sensor for Smart Agriculture project","51.9962559, 4.3758659"

One of these applications is the generation of albedo maps. However, it could take some time to map an area. Therefore problems can occur the with respect to its flight range, which typically lies between 20 to 45 km for mini UAVs. The goal of this project is to design a PV powered drone that can create an albedo map of an area that is equal or bigger than the area of the Technical University of Delft. This is done by choosing and modelling an UAV system, where after choosing and modelling a PV generator system. Based on these models, power dynamics and flight ranges are calculated. The usability is tested for different weather conditions of Delft. The UAV system with PV generator without protection layers has a flying range between 129 and 250 km, depending in the irradiance. For the same system with protective layers, the flight range varies from 117 to 208 km. the total flight range that is needed to map the area of the TU Delft is 48.75 km. Therefore, there can be concluded that in both cases our goal has been achieved.

However, when comparing this system to a system with additional batteries, the latter will achieve better results. In order to make sure that the PV generator system will guarantee a longer flight range, limitations regarding times, periods and places are made.

These scheduling problems are often considered from a long-term perspective in which an expected number of ground engineers is divided among the incoming aircraft to execute as many tasks as required, during the turn-around of aircraft. Given the uncertainty of workforce availability, the varying workload on aircraft and the turn-around restrictions the line maintenance operations lead to tasks being left for execution, delays and cancellations. This MSc. research describes a framework for combined labor and task scheduling that aims to contribute to these line maintenance operations from a short-term perspective. This implies generating an optimal schedule for the day of operation through the use of a binary integer linear programming model in which task executions are maximized. The optimal schedule is realized through the assignment of the maintenance crew teams that are capable of handling the allocated aircraft, without interfering and disrupting the flight schedule of an airline.<br/>Results from a case study confirmed an increased number of task executions during the corresponding time frame, thereby leading to a decrease in the remaining future workload.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-06-30","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Recently, industrial areas such as Hudson Yards have been transformed to gain more area to build on. Hell’s Kitchen forms one of the few exceptions for this trend of densification. The combination of an industrial waterfront and the protection of the low-rise character has prevented new developments from taking place. The industrial waterfront, however, is undergoing a transformation with manufacturing and warehouses moving out of Manhattan. The vacancy creates opportunities for the development of a city with a different character along the waterfront. This desolated waterfront is unique in its character as is the only waterfront stretch in Manhattan that has not been developed further in the post-industrial time. What is lacking in the current situation is the lack of destination and purpose of being along this waterfront. Culture is often used as a means of sparking a new type of development in an underserved area. At the same time, the lack of culture in the current situation makes that there is nothing that brings people together. Therefore. the introduction of a new cultural attraction also binds together these new types of development along the waterfront. This led to the research question of this thesis: “How can a new type of inspiration lab bring people together and spark an all-inclusive redevelopment in the post-industrial waterfront of Midtown New York” The project is a 38.000 square meter inspiration lab and public park, showcasing the new public waterfront of Hell’s Kitchen. Along this waterfront, the project creates a new destination and acts as a trigger for urban redevelopment. With its location on the pier, the building signifies the change from a manufacturing society to a knowledge-based society. While the building extends the public Hudson River park further north, it is mostly aimed at serving the new developments as well as the Hell’s Kitchen area directly. The building is very flexible in its program and integrates a more diverse mix of functions as compared to a traditional library to connect people and inspire them to create, share and consume knowledge in a new collective space along the waterfront.","Library; Cultural hub; New York; Hells Kitchen; Midtown; Inspiration; Catalyst; Urban redevelopment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Complex Projects","Midtown Graduation Studio","40.765912, -73.998103"

However, globally, cities are turning their back to the water. Despite their potential for urban development, many canals or watercourses are losing their identity in urban areas. There is a potential of turning the canal or watercourses back to a lifeline for the city by landscape methods. Through landscape methods, there are potential to turn the role of water in cities more positive and let it influence life in the urban area.   The Grand Canal (known to the Chinese as the Jing–Hang Grand Canal) in China, start from Hangzhou to Beijing, was a backbone for urban life and played an important role in social, culture, ecology and economy in history. Tongzhou, located in a low-lying area in the southeast corner of Beijing, was in history a hub along the Grand Canal that connected Beijing city center and southern China. Now, the Grand Canal in Beijing part is no longer used for transportation because of the lack of water. Even though the Grand Canal doesn't benefit Beijing as in the past anymore, it is still a strong urban element for creating public space and potential backbone for urban development in Tongzhou district. The Grand Canal can serve as a landscape infrastructure in Tongzhou district, creating spatial conditions for social-ecological inclusive urban development.   There are always roads or a stretch of green in parallel to the canal, several public area or waterfront dock located along the canal in the longitudinal dimension. The stretch of green was mostly planned as part of a park or public area. Space was only expanded in parallel to the canal almost in all types of waterfront. Longitudinally, the existing green area next to the canal is a separate system from the city. The opening of the green areas is always facing a wide road without any form of connection to the communities. The accessibility to the public area can be improved in the lateral dimension. Vertically, there is always a boundary in the border of water, it is hard for people to touch the water, which is considered dangerous being close to the water. To transform the Grand Canal as a landscape infrastructure, we need to make use of the expansion area and create a connection between city and water, people and water. Hence, space is going to be considered as a zone instead of a line around the canal and from the upland trail to instream. Moreover, the Grand Canal as one of the most important water source carriers is in charge of keeping water and keep the quality of water. There are moves of water retention and purification to be made in the design process. In conclusion, most of the space along the canal only expanded longitudinally but lack of consideration on the lateral and vertical dimension.   This project explores the potentials of the Grand Canal as a backbone for urban development. It is considered to be an urban landscape infrastructure that exploits the longitudinal(amount of water and water connection), lateral(connection between water and city, ecology connection) and vertical(connection between water and people, water and ecology) dimensions and creates conditions for the development of a social-ecological inclusive urban landscape and sustainable water management.   ","urban landscape infrastructure; Adaptive development; Identity; Grand Canal","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","",""

Phase Change Materials (PCMs) are researched in this thesis as an energy dense passive Thermal Storage Device (TSD). This energy density comes from the melting of the PCM. To determine the feasibility of this TSD. The thermal storage device needed to be able to keep certain components from overheating while keeping other components from getting too cold. This thesis successfully tested that the PCM was able to store heat from a radio and use that heat to keep a CubeSat battery warm. The TSD is meant to stabilize the temperature of all components connected to it by maintaining a temperature around the melting temperature of the PCM. Prototypes were made using eicosane wax, it is a paraffin wax with a melting temperature of 36.7∘C. This PCM was chosen due to its safe and predictable properties, and because of its previous use in the space industry. Two different casings where tested with two different filler materials and casing sealing methods. Although the filler materials had a relatively small effect on the thermal response of the casing at the heat fluxes tested. The fin filler material used less mass and was simpler to manufacture than the honeycomb filler. There was a large difference in the sealing method of the casing that was glued together sealed better than the one laser welded together, the casing which had fill ports that were clamped with a thread with a rubber filament O-ring between them sealed better than the one that was glued on. Although the degree to which this could be tested was limited and is therefore difficult to draw definitive conclusions over. The tests proved that the TSD was much more effective than traditional heat sinks at storing heat. This will allow energy dense CubeSats with large intermittent heat-loads to be designed for their average temperatures and not for extreme peaks and valleys. The complexity this casing adds to the CubeSat is more than traditional heat sinks but much less complex than active thermal control systems. The casing thermal response could be predicted within a 5∘C accuracy using a simple Finite Element Method (FEM) model using the built-in conduction and Phase Change Material modules in Comsol. The remaining obstacle with this research project is that more work needs to be done to be able to prove that the casing is completely hermetically sealed and will not contaminate other hardware while in operational.","Thermal control; CubeSat; Phase Change Material (PCM); paraffin","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Two proofs of this continuation were given by Bernhard Riemann in his famous article ``Ueber die Anzahl der Primzahlen unter einer gegebenen Grösse'' from 1859. Those proofs are studied in detail in this thesis after introducing all the required foreknowledge on the gamma function. The prime counting function π(x) counts the number of primes less than or equal to x. An explicit formula for π(x) in terms of the nontrivial zeros of the zeta function will be constructed in a similar way as Riemann did in his article. Finally, the prime number theorem will be proved. This theorem describes the asymptotic distribution of the primes among the natural numbers. Using the analytic continuation of the zeta function and a Tauberian theorem, the prime number theorem can be proved quite easily with only basic theory from complex analysis.","complex analysis; Riemann zeta function; Riemann's explicit formula; prime number theorem","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

This thesis revolves around the design and implementation of a subsystem for the creation of a solar powered drone. The goal of the solar powered drone is increasing the flight range of a commercial drone with the addition of photovoltaic (PV) panels. The subsystem designed and implemented in this thesis is split up into two separate systems namely, the control part and the image processing part. The control part revolves around the design, implementation and validation of Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) for the PV panels. The image processing part revolves around the design, implementation and validation of an albedo processing pipeline.<br/>For the MPPT, a variable step size perturb and observe algorithm has been implemented with a worse case tracking delay of 40 milliseconds during a change of irradiation from $900 W/m^2$ to $100 W/m^2$ and and more than 99\% power efficiency in steady state conditions. For the albedo pipeline, multiple RAW images are loaded one after another. Vignette correction is applied making the pixel values at the edges and the center of the image compatible with each other. The user can annotate a known reference target that is used to calibrate the albedo generation. Finally, the images are stitched together using Open Drone Map to create a complete albedo map. The results indicate accurate visible band albedo generation, however additional sensors would be needed to obtain wide band albedo generation.","drone; uav; Albedo; MPPT; PV System","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They must be accurate and well maintained, as they are used by companies or authorities for purposes like urban planning or demographic statistics. However, especially cities are in a constant change. Old buildings are torn down, new buildings are built, and complete streets and neighbourhoods are changed. Monitoring these changes is difﬁcult and identifying and updating the virtual maps is still done mostly manually today. A method is developed to detect changes on the ground and identify changes for the virtual maps automatically using machine learning approaches. As input data the virtual map, their corresponding aerial images and point clouds from different years are needed. As a case study for this thesis, this method is developed and applied to the BGT, the Dutch virtual map with a resolution of 20cm. The research area is the city of Haarlem for 2017 and 2018. High resolution aerial images are used in combination with point clouds created by Photogrammetry. The output is again a digital map of the area where every polygon has a probability score of how likely its category (for example building, street, etc..) changed. This can support the manual updating process eminently, as a minor percentage of polygons (for which the algorithm was unsure) must be checked manually. The research question of this thesis is to check whether this change detection is feasible even for highly heterogeneous structures like cities. Many visual changes in the aerial images are happening that are not relevant for the virtual map. In the one year, a street can be full of colourful cars, in the other year, the street is empty and completely grey. Many scenes are easy for humans to distinguish but are challenging for an algorithm. The goal is to detect a high amount of true changes while keeping the number of false positives low to reduce the manual work as much as possible. To achieve good change detection and answer the research questions, the machine learning library of XGBoost is used. It provides a gradient boosting framework for many different environments, including Python. Many weak learners, each classifying a change only with a very low detection rate (for example minimum height of all points inside the polygon), are combined to get a strong learner. This learner should be able to classify polygons with a high accuracy into polygons that change and polygons that do not change. With this method it is possible to detect a high amount of changes. 80% of all changes can be found within a reasonable number of False positives. Especially for buildings almost all changes can be identiﬁed. It is furthermore possible to localize the changes in larger polygons. However, not all changes can be identiﬁed, so that this approach should be seen as an aid for manual change detection and not to replace it.","Machine Learning; Digital maps; change detection; XGBoost; point cloud","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","","52.380278, 4.640556"

For this reason a bachelor graduation project was proposed to get one of the sensors designed by the Electronic Components, Technology and Materials group (ECTM) out of the lab and into the hands of potential end users. This thesis is one of three from that project, and describes the calibration and user interface components of the portable parameter analyzer that is developed for the OoC sensor.<br/><br/>First, an analysis is performed on the amplifier design that was given with the sensor. The analysis showed that the biggest sources of error in the overall gain are the offset and gain error, while non-linearity was not significant. Therefore, a two-point calibration method was deemed sufficient for the amplifier calibration. It is performed by taking two reference voltages as input of the amplifier, and measuring the corresponding output. With those points the actual gain and offset voltage can be calculated and corrected in measurements.<br/><br/>Because of circumstances it was not possible to test in a lab environment whether the amplifier and the two-point method would meet the requirements. Therefore a second calibration method is proposed, the `sweep' method. For each input voltage step the corresponding output voltage is measured. This mapping can be stored in memory, and any future measurement can be looked up to find the correct voltage. The sweep method can also be used with a slight modification of the current hardware in order to simply plot the gain of the amplifier, to verify that it is linear as intended.<br/><br/>Because the portable parameter analyzer is operated remotely, there was a need to develop a communication protocol on top of the Bluetooth link, in order to allow for parallel development of the GUI and embedded software on the analyzer. Once the communication between GUI and analyzer was defined, it was also possible for the other group to calculate the power consumption of the communication module.<br/><br/>Finally, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) needs to be developed that can interact with the analyzer (connect, change settings, retrieve data, etc.) and it should display and store the measured data. A framework called Qt is chosen for developing the GUI, and a graphical design was made. Two modules are implemented in the GUI: A Bluetooth scanner to connect to the analyzer, and a way to plot data from the analyzer.","Organ-on-a-chip; portable; parameter analyzer; ISFGFET; OoC; calibration; user interface design","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2021-05-01","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

The stadium design process requires to blend multiple components together, while evaluating different performances and complying with several requirements. In addition, the complexity of the process is increased in case of a renovation by considering the constraints and the components of the existing stadium. Hence, the decision-making process of the designer results to be difficult and it is likely to produce few inefficient designs. The introduction of computational methods can facilitate the decision-making process, allowing the designer to explore multiple solutions and to produce more efficient designs. This study explores how a computational method can be developed for stadium renovation to support the designer into making decisions in the early design phase, allowing them to explore multiple solutions that improve the initial performances of the stadium. A digital workflow was developed to generate different existing stadiums and to evaluate the performances related to the viewing quality and the roof structure. The study highlights how a designer is able to identify the portions to be kept based on the performances of the stadium and to develop a concept for the renovation, from which multiple design alternatives can be produced in the optimization process. Inefficient designs can be identified quickly and discarded, allowing to concentrate on more efficient concepts for the renovation, which will be further developed in the subsequent phases of the design process.","Computational Method; Stadium Renovation; Viewing Quality; Structural Design; Multi-Objective Optimiation; multi-disciplinary optimization; Design Exploration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","",""

Studies have shown that project managers are among the key players in BIM implementation. Especially when there is no clear vision on BIM, implementation is highly dependent on the project manager of a specific project. This research was initiated by a practical problem in the Dutch building industry. It has been observed that a group of project managers is still present who are reluctant to apply BIM to their projects. Furthermore, a research gap was found on how BIM is perceived by project managers. This research explores the perspectives of project managers towards BIM implementation in the building industry. This research aims to visualize the perspectives of project managers and develop a strategy to deal with contemporary barriers that project managers perceive towards BIM application. Through Q-methodology, three perspectives of project managers are found. Perspective one [N=17 participants], also called (BIM) supporters, consists of a group of enthusiastic BIM drivers who only experience the benefits of BIM and perceive no barriers to implement BIM. Perspective two [N=4 participants], also known as the moderately hesitant group of project managers, experience resistance to implement BIM because of multiple barriers. Not only do they lack knowledge about the possibilities, rules and standards of BIM, they also experience a lack of comfort to manage a project in which BIM plays a role. Perspective three [N=3 participants] is a critical group of project managers who are unsure whether BIM's benefits outweigh the investment costs. Furthermore, this group has doubts about whether the client is ready to apply BIM for facility management, in which, according to these project managers, the most benefits of BIM can be achieved. A strategy is developed to deal with the barriers found in this research. The strategy is based on well-known change and transition management theories such as Kotter’s eight-step model to lead change and Bridges’ transition model. To outline the structure of the proposed strategy, it is recommended to (1) identify the perspectives of project managers within the organization through a “BIM Insights” session, (2) implement a customized approach to deal with barriers of the perspectives, and (3) monitor the implementation of BIM through recurring “BIM Sharing” sessions. The customized approach aims to deal with the barriers perceived by the project managers from different perspectives in a tailored manner, in which the focus shifts between guidance and/or education. This research contributes to the research gap on the perspectives of project managers towards BIM application and presents a strategy that can be applied to stimulate project managers to apply BIM and reduce resistance to change.","BIM, Building Information Modelling; Project managers; Building industry; Q-methodology; Resistance to change; Change management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

In fact, in the case of Tashkent interesting urban scenarios emerges from this process of urbanization. Tashkent is no longer a historical centric city from the 19th century that operates within the city walls –fortress– that serves at the same time for the protection of the city against invaders. On the contrary, Tashkent is a polycentric city – the earthquake in 1966 has contributed to this process– that gives birth to new centres such as ‘Tashkent City’ with new international business districts. This huge man-made object is under construction and from this process of urbanization new centres are emerging at this moment and more will appear in the future. Equally as important as the centres themselves is the infrastructures that is also constructed to connect them. The infrastructure of Tashkent is the chain of the necklace that is able to give place to different additional attachments.<br/><br/>It is well-known Rossi’s interest with the relationship between architectural form and the city and this form is not independent. For instance, cities such as Athens, Rome and Paris. The form of the city actually reflects the architectural form, or it is even better explained by saying that the city’s form is the summarization of architecture of the city.<br/><br/>Rossi argues that from the form we can read the city and consider the cities problems. The architecture of the city is not that simple. By architecture of the city we refers to two fundamental different things: Rossi states ‘’first, the city seen as a gigantic man-made object, a work of engineering and architecture that is large and complex and growing over time; second, certain more limited but still crucial aspects of the city, namely urban artifacts, which like the city itself are characterized by their own history and thus by their own form’’.<br/><br/>the notion of time in relation to understand on the one hand the city and on the other to address its problems. The architecture of the city is the skeleton of the urban tissue. In this context skeleton refers to the history and memory of the city. The skeleton actually entails the index of both the action that have taken place and the action that will take place in the city. When the notion time is reintroduced in the architectural form of the city, therefore it is fundamental to understand that Rossi is not merely concerned with the history, but also with future. The architectural form is an object that implies singularity and it is independent of its use. In architecture ‘use’ or ‘function’ is time related, but through this notion of singularity the concept of timelessness.","architecture of the city; primary elements; urban artefacts; Tashkent; Silk Road; urbanization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-06-30","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","41.311081, 69.240562"

The core experiment of this research focused on the influence of different variations of building envelops—these include the roof geometry, facade geometry, construction systems, and materiality—on the propagation of aircraft noise. Several design variations were proposed and simulation for their effectiveness and ineffectiveness to attenuate aircraft noise propagation in an urban area. Two case studies, in Rijsenhout and in Bangkok, were used as a base for the simulation for each variation. Finally, a set of general urban guideline for urban planning will be proposed, as well as a strategy for design a healthier urban environment in the airport regions.

The one-dimensional model is derived using the physical laws of conservation of momentum and conservation of mass and uses a Finite Volume Method in combination with a high resolution flux difference splitting. First, the behaviour of the model is compared with established models in a network of 55 main arteries and then in a network of 111 main arteries including in vivo results. Finally, the model with the 111-artery network as a baseline is combined with inflow boundary conditions and a scaling factor provided by MRI blood flow data<br/>to make it patient-speciffic. The adapted model is used to investigate how well characteristics in the distal part of the network can be predicted. It is found that the Finite Volume Method in combination with the high resolution flux difference splitting produces results that are highly comparable to those of established models both in the 55- and 111-artery network. The patient-speciffic model proves to be capable of predicting the pressure value in the arm to a reasonable degree. The flow in distal parts in the aorta is underestimated for all patients, but the degree of this underestimation varies per patient. Combining the results with a novel colour representation of pressure and velocity, it is possible to show patient speciffic evolution of pressure and velocity in their arteries. Further research should focus on adapting baseline networks with different key characteristics to increase the accuracy of the predictions for patients with different characteristics than the baseline model used in this study. Such characteristics include the number of bifurcations in the aortic arch (three or two) and the tapering of the aorta.","one-dimensional modelling; blood flow; MRI","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2021-07-24","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

Shifts on the drivers, structures and economic factors of the residential market are causing the middle-segment to be excluded from it. As a consequence, the middle-segment rental stock needs to increase.

However, they still have a chance to do so with new investment funds. Therefore, the development process and the market of the middle segment was researched so that pitfalls that halt the delivery of the middle-rental stock could emerge. These pitfalls were discussed through semi-structured interviews with institutional investors and knowledge experts so they could be validated and expanded. As a result, recommendations that solve the pitfalls were created. These recommendations thereby aim to increase the middle-segment rental stock.

Conclusion: Recommendations aimed at institutional investors and municipalities were tailored. Capacity-building, diversifying, shaping and stimulus instruments were used for this purpose. In this regard, investors should pursue measures such as the diversification of their portfolio by investing in various cities, having a holding period of 10 to 15 years, setting up a program of requirements and making a public statement of intentions. While municipalities should develop a framework to guide investors, establish a tax break for investments in the G4 cities, make use of ground lease, focus on quality when issuing a tender, establish a tax break for developers and increase skills and capability of their workers. Limitations: This research focuses on institutional investors and therefore, the perspective of developers and municipalities about the pitfalls was not collected. Thus, the outcomes of the research are upheld by institutional investors but not by the two other actors of the development process. Further research that collects the point of view of developers and municipalities should be conducted.

The proposition is derived from the larger purpose of adapting native design characteristics in modern built environment. Focusing on the Asian context, one of the essential characteristics of their traditional architecture, lattice patterns, is taken as an inspiration and a reference to be explored in the project. Grid-shell is an emerging building typology in contemporary architecture due to its unique features in terms of lightness and abundance of natural daylight. In modern construction technology, there is an advancement in the method of fabrication and its applicability in complex curved forms. However, its surface character remains very similar in various context. Therefore, it is important to explore how the surface can be more vibrant and can improve the overall experience if space with different geometries. The main research focuses on developing a method to generate such patterns in a parametric workflow, design grid-shell with it and examine their structural performance. The literature research focuses on three topics, 1) Variation and complexity of traditional lattice patterns and different ways to generate them in the parametric environment, 2) Types, designing methods and construction techniques of grid-shell structures, 3) Multi-objective optimization method to optimize the overall material quantity of structures. The development of this method is carried out by first selecting structurally suitable lattice patterns and developing them in a parametric workflow. The structural performance these patterns is investigated gradually from small flat surfaces to large span complex forms with multiple shell surfaces; this investigation is carried out simultaneously with the development of grid-shell generation workflow. The final results for all the patterns are documented and compared to draw conclusions for general structural behavior if these patterns. Finally, the methodology to optimize the material quantity for any patterned grid-shell is used to compare selected sample patterns. As a final outcome it validates the usability of the collected information regarding designing and analyzing patterned grid-shell for future design and research exercises.","Lattice; Pattern; Gridshell; Parametric Design; Structural analysis; Structural mechanics; Multi Objective Optimization; Material optimization; Native architecture; Shell structures; North Asia; Traditional art; Train Station; Shelter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","","35.849884, 127.161857"

Predictions warn about the need of additional million houses for 2030. The rising number of immigrants arriving to the dutch capital city forced the municipality of Amsterdam to prepare a vision for Havenstad 2050 - a development of industrial areas for the residential purposes. A big challenge and responsibility lies in the urban planning that would prepare the area towards the new function in the city. Hence the proposition of the urban plan for Minervahaven was one of the first confrontations with the area. High density that characterised it raised the question: how to organise the life of inhabitants in a way that the density wouldn’t be experienced? The research of Robin Dunbar, british anthropologist and evolutionary psychologist, about the diversed relationships in groups of different numbers became my main inspiration and focus of interests for the graduation project. It influenced the organisation of the building and the decision to cluster people in communities of certain sizes to stimulate certain relationships by encounters between tenants. The final design is an attempt to find an answer for the lack of suitable family housing in the city and decreasing feeling of creating a community.","Dwelling; Co-housing; Amsterdam; community; architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Dwelling","","52.399702, 4.870955"

The aim of this master thesis was to design a product which could reduce the pollution of harmful noise during hip replacement surgery. Noisy workplaces and especially within this procedure carry a large risk of noise-induced hearing loss, as sound levels of more than 120 decibels are generated by the usage of (powered) instruments. In the analysis phase observations in the operating theatre and interviews with experts are conducted to get insights and background information about the total hip arthroplasty procedures. It was found that noise levels experienced during surgery generated levels above the human pain threshold, ranging between 120-130 decibels and caused temporary and long-term noise induced hearing loss. Via a design vision and a list of requirements multiple concepts where generated. In the embodiment and evaluation phase, cadaver and saw bone testing showed that the new instrument design functioned and implant parts and/or tools could be implanted successfully. The outcome of this project is a new surgical instrument, which can press-fit (impact) and extract various implant components used during surgery. The instrument has multiple unique selling points compared to the currently used mallet as it reduces the noise level with more than 15 decibels and scores better on aspects of safety when looking into the risks at musculoskeletal disorders by improving surgical ergonomics. The instrument could be improved further when looking at the design and the current surgical workflow. Further research and clinical testing is necessary to see if this product is suitable for hip replacement surgery.","Orthopedics; Surgical techniques; Sound design; Ergonomics; Critical Alarms Lab; Instruments; Tools","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Zero Emission Fuels (ZEF) is developing a small-scale methanol plant, which utilizes atmospheric CO­2 and H2O vapor as feedstocks for renewable methanol synthesis. In this study, the vapor liquid equilibrium (VLE) of CO2 and aqueous solutions of tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) was measured and correlated using thermodynamic models. The equilibrium pressure of aqueous solutions of 30, 70 and 80 wt% TEPA was measured from 313.15 to 393.15 K using a mechanically stirred and temperature controlled autoclave. The binary VLE data was correlated using Wilson's activity coefficient model. Using the same experimental set-up, the equilibrium solubility of CO2 in aqueous solutions of 30 and 70 wt% TEPA was measured at 313.15, 353.15 and 393.15 K. A simple chemical model, incorporating the extended Debye-Hückel law for activity coefficients of ionic species, was regressed to the ternary VLE data. Additionally, a theory was proposed that the polyamine can be modelled as a multiple of smaller amines, using the ratio of the amine groups as a scaling factor. Both models were applied in a simple process simulation of the absorption and stripping column of the direct air capture unit of ZEF to provide an estimation of the energy demand of the process under different conditions. The lowest regeneration energy demand was 533 kJ/mol CO2 absorbed, which is approximately 3 times higher than that of monoethanolamine, the current benchmark solvent for amine-based CO2 capture. However, through the addition of a rich-lean heat exchanger and process optimization to minimize the required reflux stream, this value could potentially be decreased.","VLE; CO2 capture; Direct air capture; zero emission fuels; ZEF; Amine; polyamine; Sustainable Energy; Power to fuel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-06-30","","","","","Zero Emission Fuels",""

On the other hand, laser metal deposition (LMD) is gaining momentum. This flexible technique, where material is added in a layer-by-layer fashion with a minimal heat input offers solutions for a wide range of production and repair purposes. Especially restoration or replacement of large and complex high-performance parts with long production times could profit from these developments. Industrial gears are certainly such type of parts. Occasionally, unforeseen tooth breakage of gears occurs, often leading to the replacement of the parts. No reliable repair techniques have emerged yet, due to the desired material properties and the uneven distributed hardness seen in carburized gears. This study was initiated to examine the feasibility of LMD for the repair of industrial gears with the goal to reduce both material waste and down time while retaining or exceeding the required mechanical performance. The initial part of the research is focused on finding the best suitable material and deposition parameters to ensure the desired mechanical properties of the core and a good bonding of the structure to the gear. Multiple deposition parameters are varied followed by destructive and non-destructive testing. It was found that the mechanical properties of deposited structures Inconel 718 and its bonding to a carburized substrate can be adjusted by accurately selecting the deposition parameters. Large differences in outcome were obtained by changing the deposition direction between each layer and tuning of the shielding gas flow rate. In further investigation the effects on the mechanical behavior of a deposited tooth structure were studied by altering the thermal cycle during and after deposition. The tests are performed on a specially developed static load testing setup. The results show a negative correlation between the interpass temperature and both the yield and ultimate tensile strength. This effect is attributed to a lower cooling rate during solidification at higher interpass temperatures. Ultimately, the results of a deposited tooth with hard flanks and built on a case hardened base were compared to a case hardened gear tooth that was manufactured according to the regular production method. It is found that the deposited structure exhibits significantly lower yield strength. Nonetheless, the superior ductility of the newly deposited tooth structure in the presented work is considered as a promising method for future gear repair.","Gear; Repair; Laser; Metal; Deposition; Inconel 718; Hardened; Carburized; Additive Manufacturing; Multilayer; Tooth; static load test","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-06-30","","","","","",""

They tell stories about where we come from, who we are and how we develop. In the face of major changes in our living environment, heritage offers recognition and gives us something to hold onto, and identity. In addition, monuments and historic neighborhoods first and foremost have values in themselves: they are the bearers of the past that we cherish for their own meaning and beauty. We are therefore pleased to pass them on to future generations. If we look at old photographs of Dutch residential areas, we can see how much has changed. Buildings and squares have been refurbished. Behind old buildings the past has appeared. This is the visible result of efforts to renovate historic buildings. But this can also be done differently; by giving the very same building a new lease of life, by connecting the heritage to the great challenges in our living environment and by making use of the linking value of that heritage. However, as life changes over the years, such transformations are often forced to focus on certain aspects that may influence the assignment. One of those major concerns is the ageing of the population and individualization. Partly thanks to this, we are facing a major problem in terms of housing shortage. When it comes to having enough housing for the market, we must build a second Rotterdam out of nowhere somewhere in the middle of the rural area, which is just impossible. So, the importance of heritage once again comes to the fore. All those millions of square meters with their own values and qualities demand a new, smart life for the housing question. And in addition to these concerns, it should not be forgotten that these, existing buildings that had very different rules in their own time, caused many of these buildings to fail to meet contemporary requirements, which clashes sharply with an important aspect such as living quality. The location of the project is in the neighborhood De Werven, which is part of the first developed land on the Flevopolder, namely Almere- Haven in the city of Almere. When the neighborhood saw its first residents move in in November 1976, the architect Joop van Stigt's idea, inspired by the structuralist movement of that time, was to design small neighborhoods in the whole neighborhood (Dutch= wijkjes in een wijk idee) in a way that the social cohesion between the residents would be very pleasant and strong. The aim was to use the cauliflower structure, that gave the urban development plan its shape, to make the courtyards serve as the dynamos for this idea. Among other things, the general problems listed above, which also occur in De Werven itself, have meant that the architect's intentions, which ultimately made a major contribution to the strong, and by the residents pleasant, village atmosphere, have gradually been lost. Privatization was on the rise, while collectivity gradually faded away. The aim of this project was to provide more housing opportunities without affecting the village atmosphere, but on the contrary to strengthen it by strategically creating the most promising spaces, the courtyards, together with the buildings. In the end, the task, requiring a good balance, focused much more on the existing structure, looking for the answer to be able to afford more housing for both the elderly and the younger classes. This goal has made itself plenary with the vision to direct these existing buildings towards the housing market of the future, and to design as energetically as possible while, just like comfort, the existing image and character of the neighborhood is been kept.","Heritage & Architecture; Almere; Transformation; Cultural value; De Werven; Almere-Haven; Structuralism; Sustainabilty; Energetic Materials","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","Almere-Haven","52.337061, 5.225728"

It should then communicate wirelessly to a base station which should have a compatible communication protocol. What happens after receiving of sensor data at the base station is beyond the scope of this project. One of the major challenges in the design process is energy efficiency, since the device should be small enough to fit on a baby and the battery should thus also be small. Additionally, the sensor patch should be able to operate for 3 days continuously. The overall design comprises sensors, a battery with battery control system, a microcontroller and a communication module. The overall design is split up over three reports. This report focuses on implementing the microcontroller and communication protocol. It is found that using a design with separate microcontroller and communication device is more efficient than using a so-called System on Chip where all of this is mounted on a single device. Then a comparison between different microcontrollers, communication protocols and communications devices is made. It is found that a design with an MSP430FR5994, Bluetooth Low Energy protocol and RSL10 communication chip fits the requirements best.

This study analyses the current state of this innovation and its potential impact on aviation. On a global level, full adoption of electric aircraft taxiing is expected to cause a reduction in jet fuel usage of 846 million kg per year, equivalent to 186 million euros of reduced costs and 2.67 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions. This results in a reduction of 0.3% of the total global carbon dioxide emissions of the aviation sector. Locally, airports and their surroundings will benefit significantly from the reduced emissions, because a substantial fraction of airport emissions are due to the taxiing phase. Analysis of the effect of electric aircraft taxiing to key stakeholders such as airlines shows that American airlines would reap substantially larger benefits than European competitors because of consistently higher taxi times in the United States. Low-cost carriers are expected to see smaller impact than traditional hub-and-spoke airlines, due to short taxi times in the secondary airports they predominantly fly to. KLM could save 17.3 million kg of jet fuel annually, representing a cost of 3.8 million euros, which would potentially increase profits by 3%, and a carbon dioxide emission of 55 million kg. Since the road to full adoption is still long, a strategic analysis of the fleet shows the marginal yearly cost reduction per installed electric taxiing system starts at 82 thousand euros for the first product, which reduces to 10 thousand after 100 systems have been installed. Especially the flights between Amsterdam and London, Paris and Manchester should be assigned to aircraft with electric taxiing systems, because these flights would have the most impact given their relatively low flight distance and high taxi times.","Sustainable Aviation; Electric Aircraft Taxiing; Fleet Assignment Optimization; Probabilistic Distribution Modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The aim was to identify the solar electricity generation potential of noise barriers in the Netherlands and the connection between this and future theoretical hydrogen demand for fuel cell powered two wheelers (scooters or mopeds). Noise barriers block noise from inhabited areas, which is also where mopeds and their owners reside. Noise barriers retrofitted with solar panels, or Energy Walls, coupled with a hydrogen production, storage and dispensing system is proposed. This system would enhance sustainable, carbon neutral mobility as well as contribute renewable energy to the grid electricity mix. Particulate matter, greenhouse gases and noise pollution are reduced with electric drive vehicles such as fuel cell powered two wheelers. A case study of a noise barrier on the A20 in Rotterdam Noord was modeled; other suitable locations were identified as well, such as Amsterdam or Delft. The characteristics of the barrier in Rotterdam provided a lower levelized cost of PV electricity and was thus chosen to simulate specifically. A range of electrolyzer capacities was also simulated to understand the effect of the electrolyzer capacity and the final cost of hydrogen to the user. The demand base case was 100 scooters which traveled 2.5 km/day each on average. Provided a single metal hydride canister has a range of 25 km and capacity of 45 gH2 , this demand configuration means 0.45 kgH2/day needs to be produced for the users. An hourly simulation of the energy production was modeled using two control strategies, which focused on maximizing the Energy Wall input and the use of the electrolyzer respectively. The second strategy had higher electricity costs as compared to the first, however the cost of the electrolyzer was minimal regardless of the number of panels. The cost of hydrogen depends on the size of the Energy Wall and the electrolyzer capacity; for the lowest cost setup the price of hydrogen ranged between 14.3 and 7.2 EURO/kgH2 . The cost per kilometer traveled by fuel cell scooters was found to be between 2.57 and 1.4 ¢/km. Battery electric vehicles are still much cheaper to operate in this aspect, driving at a cost mileage of between 0.3 and 0.6 ¢/km, however gas powered scooters had the highest cost per kilometer (3 - 5¢/km). This model finds that the operational costs of a hydrogen fuel cell scooter are lower than its gas scooter counterpart, but not low enough to compete with battery powered scooters. The one advantage of gas scooters is the range on one refuel, however with their relatively high operational costs and emissions, electric drive engines become favorable.

The FM detector is used to extract the original information signal from the received FM signal. The used procedure consisted of determining possible implementations, setting up the design equations, choosing component values and simulating the circuits in ADS. The sawtooth generator was implemented using a ramp generator, Schmitt trigger and a voltage clamper while the FM detector was implemented using a balanced slope detector and a differential-to-single-ended converter. The results showed that the sawtooth generator can successfully produce a sawtooth waveform and that the FM detector can successfully retrieve it. It was concluded that both the modules satisfy all the requirements, meaning that they should work as expected in the whole system.

This is due to electrical and mechanical limitations. The distortion is more noticeable at lower frequencies. This report is one of two reports, that will explain how to minimize this distortion. The motion of the loudspeaker cone will be measured and compared with the input voltage. This way the error in the output can be found. Finally, a system will adjust the current through the voice coil to decrease this error. An accelerometer is used as a sensor and the ADAU1777 is used to compensate for the error in output displacement. Finally, a voltage to current converter is used to convert and amplify the output voltage from the ADAU1777 into a current signal to drive the loudspeaker. This report focuses on the voltage to current amplifier. To begin the design, a problem definition and program of requirements will be given. Usually, loudspeakers are voltage driven. This report begins by first explaining why a current-driven loudspeaker delivers less distortion. Then an attempt is made to build a single operational amplifier (opamp) design that meets the requirements for a real load. For the single opamp design, a simple version of the operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) will be compared against a Howland model based on noise performance and circuit analysis, where it will be shown that the simple OTA has a larger signal to noise ratio and does not need to meet any additional criteria to maintain a high output impedance. However, the simple OTA still does not meet the Signal to Noise (SNR) . The simple OTA also did not meet the maximum Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) at 800 Hz. Then, a two opamp design will be constructed using a composite configuration to increase the SNR and decrease the THD. This design does meet the requirements given, at least for a purely resistive load. Then an electrical model of a loudspeaker, which has a complex impedance, will replace the resistive load. Now the composite design for the resistive load needs to be adjusted for the inductive characteristic of a loudspeaker at higher frequencies. The resulting design has a THD of 0.000427\%, a PM of 51$\degree$ and a SNR is 100.92 dB. All results will be given as simulations, because the current pandemic (COVID-19) does not make it possible to physically construct and measure this model.

The elderly, as one of the vulnerable groups of continuous hot weathers, are the first to be affected by the heat waves with regard to increasing mortality and morbidity while the aging population combined with uneven distribution of the urban heat risks is exacerbating the situation and placing challenge to the public. Public health interventions have been applied in the past few years which have been proved to be effective but the overall effect for the future scenario is questionable. Strategies from urban planning have been focusing on the mitigation of urban heat island and adaption to extreme weather conditions but the effect should be expected in a long term. Since the urban heat island and the uneven distribution of heat risks have strong interaction with physical environments in the urbanized areas, the thesis is seeking for the solutions to intervene within existing urban settings to reduce heat stress for the Dutch elderly through urban design approach to fill in the gap between public health and urban planning interventions. The thesis, by analyzing and researching in The Hague as the test field, introduced an approach to uncovered the causation of the uneven distribution of urban heat risks among the public and evaluate the heat risks level among the elderly from large scale to small scale. The further research on the courtyard block dwellings in the study areas reveals the potential heat risks from the perspective of building configuration and several interventions have been applied within the blocks to reduce the heat stress for the residents.<br/>The design outcomes consist of strategies and temporal spatial interventions, ‘Cooling sheds’, and urban microclimate design following the instruction of strategies has been applied in the study areas to the test effectiveness of the strategies.

However, this plan is not always followed since, during the actual flight, aircraft deviate either horizontally by rerouting, or vertically by choosing a different Flight Level. The issue arises when some airlines frequently deviate from their flight plans frequently, to the disadvantage of other airspace users. With this research we analyse aircraft en-route trajectory deviations for clusters of European airlines. We focus on two metrics: vertical flight level deviation, and horizontal deviation. We analyze these deviations for clusters of airlines operating in the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) airspace in 2017. The airline clusters are obtained using unsupervised machine learning algorithms with operational and Complex Network features. The results show that major Low-Cost Carriers deviate on average, per flight, 34% more vertically than major Network Carriers, while Network Carriers have on average, more efficient horizontal trajectories. However, NCs show a larger fraction of flights with equally planned and realized efficiency, which points to less horizontal deviations overall. The findings reflect a general, network-wide horizontal inefficiency in trajectory planning, and that LCCs deviate horizontally a larger percentage of their flights. Moreover, they manage to use the available Flight Levels consistently to their advantage. This research could be used for future policy-making on a fair and equitable routes and slot allocation.","flight plan deviations; unsupervised Machine Learning; airline clustering; flight efficiency","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); de Vries, Peter (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Purpose: Additive manufacturing has enabled innovative, cost and resource efficient mass customization of products over a wide range of manufacturing industries. Under the broad spectrum of options for manufacturing of metallic components, Wire + Arc Additive Manufacturing, WAAM, offers the combination of high design freedom and productivity at a comparably low cost. As a maturing technology, the application in the building industry of steel and stainless-steel products becomes increasingly interesting. Research is nevertheless necessary for the identification of the material’s performance under dynamic loading. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing procedure inherently produces a heterogenous material matrix and wavy surface, which may be susceptible to fatigue. Methodology: Based on a broad literature review concentrated on the material performance of stainless steels as welding consumable, stainless-steel SAE316L is chosen as the material of interest for characterization. Test coupons are extracted from heat-treated wire+arc-additive-manufactured single-bead walls to perform monotonic and fully reversed strain-controlled fatigue tests in both longitudinal and build directions. The material’s microstructural characteristics are documented. Test methods include Wavelength Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence for chemical characterization; X-Ray Diffraction for phase identification and quantification; and Scatter Electron Microscopy and Optical Microscopy for qualitative sub-grain and grain microstructural characterization. The latter methods are subsequently used to characterize the monotonic and fatigue fracture surface morphology of post-mortem test samples. A constitutive model for the material is described based on the results of the monotonic and cyclic behavior in both orthogonal directions. Inspection of the fracture surface of the tested coupons is realized to validate the assumptions made for the application of the fatigue models at hand. Addressing a commonly cited problem, the macroscopic surface waviness of the printed material is quantified, and its effect as a stress concentrator is numerically modelled and verified through a smaller group of tested coupons retaining the original surface waviness. Finally, suggestions for the extrapolation of these results are done for the design of structural components produced with the studied material and designed for Fatigue Limit State. Findings: Microstructural characteristics include a strong metallurgical texture in the build orientation, limiting the validity of X-Ray diffraction results. Ferrite is quantified at approximate 13% volume ratio through image analysis of SEM micrographs. Possible traces of σ-phase are identified through optical microscopy, specifically in inter-grain boundaries, although further work is necessary to confirm their constitution. Fracture surface analysis indicates mostly ductile material deformation, confirmed by the elongation capacity of tensile test results, and a predominantly smooth fatigue fracture surface populated by ridges with isolated striation locations, indicating crack propagation at a low stress intensity amplitude. The material shows marginally lower performance in terms of quasi-static characteristics when compared to the one cited by the consumable manufacturer for all-weld material. This remains nevertheless consistently higher than the allowed design values published by commercially available standards. A notoriously low elastic modulus is observed, source of which remains unidentified; the elastic modulus is measured between 54% and 58% of that of commercially available hot-rolled stainless-steel alloys. Cyclic material performance corresponds with all-weld predicted performance for ferritic-austenitic stainless-steels, where the first few cycles are characterized by a slight material hardening, followed by a consistent softening throughout the cyclic life of the material. Average fatigue performance is undistinguishable from mean design values proposed for structural stainless steels under standardized testing conditions. At a 95% reliability and 75% confidence interval, the material performance is superior to the design curves proposed by ASME. The theoretical stress concentration obtained through numerical analysis of the surface geometry is modeled as a function of maxima between 3.150 and 3.927 in the build orientation with a 75% reliability for component lengths of 20 mm for the former value and 100 mm for the later value. Similarly, the values 1.944 and 2.413 in the longitudinal direction describe the stress concentration effect for 20 mm and 100 mm component lengths correspondingly. Originality / Value: The research contributes to the characterization efforts made for the improvement of Wire+Arc additive Manufacturing technologies. This work is carried out both at a microstructural and a bulk level, allowing to establish a correlation between the manufacturing parameters, the microstructural morphology and the mechanical behavior of a given material. Design aids are presented at a typically cited reliability level for engineering practice, accompanied by a thorough description of design considerations based on the material’s inherit characteristics as a product of WAAM process.","Wire + Arc Additive Manufacturing; Strain-Controlled Fatigue testing; Fractography; Strain-Life Modelling; Notch effect; Surface-waviness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering - Structural Design","",""

However, their automatic creation is a difficult task, and so far, published methodologies cannot provide reliable solutions. The common and most recent approach is to design a road detection algorithm from remote sensing imagery based on a Convolutional Neural Network, followed by a result refinement post-processing step. In this project I proposed a deep learning model that utilized the Multi-Task Learning technique to improve the performance of the road detection task by incorporating prior knowledge constraints. Multi-Task Learning is a mechanism whose objective is to improve a model's generalization performance by exploiting information retrieved from the training signals of related tasks as an inductive bias, and, as its name suggests, solve multiple tasks simultaneously. Carefully selecting which tasks will be jointly solved favors the preservation of specific properties of the target object, in this case, the road network. My proposed model is a Multi-Task Learning U-Net with a ResNet34 encoder, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, that solves for the tasks of Road Detection Learning, Road Orientation Learning, and Road Intersection Learning. Combining the capabilities of the U-Net model, the ResNet encoder and the constrained Multi-Task Learning mechanism, my model achieved better performance both in terms of image segmentation and topology preservation against the baseline single-task solving model.

This well-known characteristic of the present-day’s society is caused by multiple factors like low birth rate and improvement of healthcare. Dementia is one of the most common diseases that occurs to aged people. Most people with severe dementia are usually situated in a nursing home where they are assisted by caregivers day and night. These are protected facilities, in both urban and suburban context, which are separated from the society and daily life. This leads to several issues such as isolation and loneliness within the nursing homes. Also, isolation simultaneously stigmatizes people with dementia. People who are still living in their homes and capable of functioning are being excluded from society. However, nursing homes are often not an option for elderly migrants who are suffering from dementia. There are not enough nursing homes where they can seek help at the moment due to lack of anticipation –the Dutch government is not yet prepared for the considerable amount of dementia patients with migrant backgrounds who has different needs and wishes. This large group of people are excluded from the society and are taken care of by their families who are often overloaded due to the fact that they usually don’t get help from professionals. Elderly who cannot get help are forced to return to their respective original countries and are afraid to age in the Netherlands. This project is a proposal towards a new form of living and ageing in a safe environment as an Asian migrant in the Netherlands, with the aim to social inclusion of the elderly. <br","Elderly housing; Rotterdam; Healthcare architecture; Migrants; social inclusion; Dementia friendly; Freedom; Safety","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","Health@BK-lab","51.918722,4.469610."

In this thesis, the control system will be created for a monopole and a dipole speaker specifically. It does so by sketching the outlines of such a system and examining possible designs for the components required to suppress distortion which is mainly created by the speaker. This thesis shows that the digital implementation indeed allows filtering with very little latency but there are limitations in accuracy due to the conversion from the analogue to the digital domain. It is shown in this thesis that a partly analogue and partly digital system is desired for better error correction. A desired input-output gain of 30=29.54dB is achieved. The controller that is suggested is a controller based on the transfer function of the speaker. By transforming the input signal with the inverse of this open-loop transfer, the closed-loop transfer will be flattened. The instrumentation amplifier used to subtract the feedback signal from the input signal is designed such that the influence of the quantization noise is minimized. Loop-gain is added by the instrumentation amplifier, the controller and voltage-to-current amplifier. By creating loop-gain as much as possible using the digital implementation, noise is suppressed from 30dB up to 90dB within the range of frequencies of interest. The designed components in the motional feedback system allow a loop-gain up to 70dB and an input to output voltage gain of 30dB before instability occurs.","Motional Feedback Control; loudspeaker; bass; Digital","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","EE3L11 Bachelor graduation project Electrical Engineering",""

Platform openness affects the ease of actors joining the platform. Hence, in order to increase the chances of platform success, platforms want to maximize market potential and consequently also platform openness. This is problematic because architectural configurations with the highest market potential do not necessarily represent the most favourable configurations for societal values. Although there is anecdotal evidence of safety and privacy risks resulting in adjusted platform openness, there is little literature explaining the drivers and the process of adjusting due to risks posed to societal values. Hence, this thesis build an initial theory on the process of how digital platforms adjust their openness upon learning about risks for societal values. A case study was performed to pattern match theoretical concepts in a critical case. The study found that concepts of organizational legitimacy, double-loop learning and background theories may explain how a digital platform sponsor adjusts openness due to societal risks. In addition, empirical findings suggest that organizational maturity may affect platform openness. Nonetheless, it was inconclusively found whether societal risks cause a change in the value system of the platform. This research found that the identification of a societal risk may change the theories-in-use of a digital platform and subsequently affect platform openness.","Openness; Digital Platforms; Platform Openness; Platform; Governance; Double-loop learning; Organizational learning; Legitimacy; Values; Risk; Responsible platforms","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Variant calling is a classic example of DNA data analysis, in which variants from DNA sequence data are identified. In recent years, a number of frameworks have been developed for implementing the variant calling pipeline. As a result, deeper scientific insights have been gained into genomics. From the computational point of view, however, these frameworks suffer from either excessive serialization and deserialization or lack of scalability. This work proposes using Apache Arrow as the unified in-memory data format and employing its associated communication protocol Flight to enable horizontal scalability for the sorting stage of a variant calling pipeline. Compared to other protocols, Arrow Flight features high throughput, low overhead, and compatibility with the Arrow format. For example, 43\% of the data shuffling time in a standalone distributed sorting application can be saved by replacing the original protocol with Arrow Flight. In addition, several techniques, including parallelization, hashing the keys for sorting to integers, and leveraging zero-copy conversion are proven to be useful for performance optimization under certain conditions. They together can reduce the execution time of the distributed sorting application from 71 seconds to only 12 seconds, achieving a 5.9x speedup. Linear scalability is also observed when the input data consists of integers keys. After integrating this sorting application into the variant calling pipeline, the performance of sorting in the pipeline outperforms the counterpart step in the state-of-the-art SparkGA2. Concretely, a speedup of 21x is achieved in the case of using 4 nodes and 10x is achieved in the case of using 12 nodes.","Apache Arrow Flight; sorting; DNA analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-06-29","","","","","",""

Recent literature proposes the Wall Shear Stress (WSS), the Time-Averaged Wall Shear Stress (TAWSS), the Oscillatory Shear Index (OSI) and the Transverse WSS (Trans-WSS) as possible factors influencing the initiation, growth and rupture of intracranial aneurysms (IA). Currently, scientist and doctors are still in disagree on the biggest factors of rupture of an IA. In this research project, Tomographic Particle Image Velocimetry (TPIV) is used to acquire data to calculate these before mentioned hemodynamic quantities. The experiment captured 2040 images during one simulated cardiac cycle in a phantom reflecting an IA. To obtain the WSS, TAWSS, OSI and Trans-WSS on the wall of the phantom these images were post-processed using Davis, Tecplot and Python. The hemodynamic quantities are successfully calculated and visualized on 3D models of the aneurysm. An accurate result for these hemodynamic quantities was achieved when using a minimum of 51 images evenly spread out during a cardiac cycle. In cases without time constraints, it is still recommended to use as many images as possible to account for local WSS fluctuations. In further research the data structure in DaVis should be altered to a constant Cartesian coordinate structure for every dataset of the phantom. This will remove the biggest error and will greatly increase the value of this thesis and the analysis of these quantities.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

Recent research focuses on using novel data sources and machine learning algorithms to improve the performance of 4D trajectory prediction, enabling safer and more efficient routing of aircraft. In this paper a framework for data sourcing and preparation for such predictors is presented, as well as a comparison of three of the best performing prediction algorithms from literature to a baseline method. Currently such comparisons are lacking, making it hard to determine which techniques provide the best results. Using an ADS-B antenna and various online data sources a trajectory set of 40,000 trajectories is built. Two clustering methods are tested and it is found that clustering trajectories using Density Based Clus- tering for Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) performs poorly on our data set of arriving flights. Too many trajectories are classified as outliers while DBSCAN is not capable of separating the trajectories in distinct clusters. A clustering method based on the STARs of the airport is proposed, which performs better in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Finally, a baseline simulation using Aircraft Performance Models is compared to a deep neural network, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network and to Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) for trajectory prediction. It is found that the latter outperforms the other methods overall, while it was expected that predictors based on LSTMs would provide more accurate results. It is concluded that long-term dependencies in trajectory data, on which LSTMs perform well, are less important than categorical indicators, on which GBMs perform better, in trajectory prediction.","4D trajectories; ADS-B; DBSCAN; deep neural networks; Gradient Boosting Machines; Long Short-Term Memory networks; machine learning; trajectory clustering; tra- jectory prediction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-06-29","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

There has already been some researches and regeneration of the buildings in these areas, but the public space quality is dissatisfied and most anticipated by residents to regeneration. The spatial problems, aging problems, and the ability to adapt climate changes are the most severe challenges of the public space of new workers' estates. The current urban regeneration generates 180 million tons of construction, demolition, and decoration waste (CDDW) per year in Shanghai. Because of the large amount of material flow and the harsh environmental impact, the regeneration mode of new workers' estates should change compared to the current linear construction. This research aims to use circular construction to improve public space quality solving spatial and aging problems in multi scales. Meanwhile, make the regeneration design future adaptive to changes. Through the literature review of the existing circular construction techniques, the methods suitable for applying CDDW to public spaces are selected. In order to meet the three principles of circularity, elderly adaptive and future adaptive at the same time, the toolbox of the modular design was designed. It will be applied to the case site showing as a design framework. In order to implement, systemize, and generalize the circular regeneration, use the collaborative circular construction network.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Wireless power transfer (WPT) is becoming a popular choice for charging of batteries in various applications. Particularly, the increase in popularity of electrical vehicles (EVs) and the pursuit of user convenience for charging the batteries makes WPT an attractive solution. The usage of WPT in e-transportation is not straightforward because the current standardization limits the allowed frequency operating range and magnitude of the irradiated magnetic field. Additionally, a fast control loop with high current or voltage sensing bandwidth is necessary to guarantee soft-switching of the inverter’s semiconductors which are commonly employed as part of an equivalent DC-DC resonant converter. The resonant circuit typically comprises of a H-bridge inverter, two passive compensation network one at each side of the air-gapped transformer formed by a transmitter and a receiver coil, and a diode-bridge rectifier. The control of the resonant converter can be cumbersome particularly in case of dynamic charging condition because of the natural change in equivalent load and coil misalignment conditions which cause themagnetic coupling to change. The main goals of this thesis are: to understand the challenges involved with the control of WPT for EVs; to propose and implement a digital control strategy for WPTs which not only maintain soft-switching but also realize other functionalities such as soft start-up, soft shut-down and over-current protection. With respect to power efficiency, it is important to operate the inverter with a frequency whichmakes the resonant converter to function in the inductive region enabling soft-switching turn-on of the implemented active semiconductors, such as MOSFETs. For that reason the inverter is typically operated at a frequency slightly above the resonance, however this must avoid the effect of bifurcation. Studies in the literature have found that the efficiency of the system is typically the highest at maximal magnetic coupling between the coils and when the resonant circuit impedance match the so-called optimal load resistance. Furthermore, the current available standards have set narrow requirements on the frequency range, minimum power efficiency and restriction of irradiated magnetic field for both, safety of living beings and electromagnetic compatibility. All these requirements makes the control implementation of WPT very challenging, especially for high power applications. In this work, the closed-loop control is successfully integrated into a TI microcontroller where the soft-switching mechanism is derived with a selective band zero crossing detection circuit of the inverter AC current. The current band is used to tune the instant where the semiconductor bridge turns from ON to OFF state because there is a minimal current that need to be impressed into the inverter to reach the desired soft-switching by compensating the accumulated charges across the parasitic MOSFET capacitances. This is also important to compensate the signal processing delays of the closed-loop control. This functional block is implemented externally to the TI digital controller with the existing high bandwidth current sensing and commercial analog logic ICs. Moreover, an over-current protection is incorporated into the zero crossing block, achieving a reaction time of 66ns. Finally, several strategies are proposed and tested for the soft start-up and a concept is made for the soft shut-down of aWPT experimental setup available in the laboratory.","Wireless power transfer; Electrical Vehicles; Digital control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-06-22","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Dekens, Bart (mentor); Hoch, Jannis (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The past decades, the increasing availability of data has paved the way for a new, data-driven generation of models. This research proposes a non-parametric Bayesian network (NPBN) to model hydrologic processes. The Bayesian network (BN) is a directed, acyclic graph in which the variables are represented by the nodes, and the conditional probability distribution between variable pairs is represented by the arcs. NPBNs are computationally less expensive than many conceptual hydrologic models and are sufficiently flexible to be able to handle different continuous data sources. The goal of this thesis is to make an NPBN for a lowland catchment and test its performance. The case study concerns the catchment of the Vledder, Wapserveense and Steenwijker Aa. This catchment makes this research the first one in which an NPBN is comprehensively implemented for (1.) a single catchment in which the catchment processes are modelled, (2.) a Dutch catchment, and (3.) a lowland, partially managed, catchment. For the BN model, seven hydro-meteorological variables have been selected for the model, complemented by the target variable, which is the monthly maximum daily average discharge (MMDAD). The aim of the BN is to be able to accurately predict the MMDAD, and the Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) acts as a performance indicator by which to optimize the BN’s parameters. For this thesis, the Gaussian copula was selected to be implemented for all variable combinations in the BN, because this type allows for the use of the multivariate normal distribution to calculate a conditioned network. The fit of the Gaussian copula to the data is tested in this thesis. This method is far more convenient than the alternative called the vine-copula method and most likely gives a better fit than the other alternatives. Three distributions are compared to model the marginal distributions, of which the Gaussian mixture model has been selected. This function extrapolated too little, so a novel alteration function has been proposed to shift the predictions. Several other parameters in the BN have been analysed as well. A sensitivity analysis has been performed to understand what influences of artificial errors would be. In general, random errors have a low influence on the prediction of the model, whereas new systematic errors have a larger influence. Criteria for a practical, well-performing BN have been presented and a strategy to create such a model that satisfies these criteria has been assembled. This strategy left the selection of some connection implementations up for interpretation. The chosen implementation has been decided based on which implementation produced the best predictions of the relevant variable within the network. The final model gave a median, k-fold tested KGE of 0.73 when predicting the MMDAD. It is also analysed how well the MMDAD is predicted if not all other variables are fixed. Another novelty is that a BN model is benchmarked against a SOBEK model, a neural network, and a multiple linear regression model. Compared to these models, the BN performs well. Moreover, all these other models lack some advantages that the unsaturated BN has.","hydrologic modeling; model optimization; data-driven models; non-parametric Bayesian Networks; lowland catchments","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","52.785623, 6.095020"

Extensive operations and continued human presence on the planet would require a robust space infrastructure. Be it navigation satellite constellations or scientific missions in low Mars orbits (LMO) and Areosynchronous orbits (ASO), every satellite would have a definitive period of operation after which it becomes derelict. At the end-of-life (EOL) the satellite could either be left unattended or dealt with in a sustainable manner. The first option is what has led to the problem of space debris in terrestrial orbits. To protect our access to Mars, proactive sustainability needs to be practised already in the design stages of such missions. This project aimed at providing graveyard orbit solutions in circummartian space for future Mars debris. 200-year period stability was studied for orbits using the symplectic integration technique. Extensive validations were performed and propagation settings were tuned to suit a variety of configurations. A plethora of graveyard orbit solutions were found and presented for orbits in ASO and LMO regimes. For example, it was found that transferring an ASO satellite to 400 km below the nominal orbit altitude would ensure a stability margin of +/-25 km for at least 200 years. The protected zones were found to be safe from debris even for an uncertainty in initial eccentricity of 0.01 and a tumbling satellite. Multiple orbital geometry orientations (combinations of semi-major axis, inclination, right ascension of the ascending node), satellite geometries (various values of area-to-mass ratios) and uncertainties were studied to produce a comprehensive analysis of long-term stability of potential graveyard orbits around Mars, making them attractive for such purposes.","EOL; Mars; Debris; Graveyard orbits; Long-term stability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-06-29","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Sánchez Gómez, S. (graduation committee); Lourens, E. (graduation committee); Bronkhorst, A. J. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","As buildings get taller and lighter, structural engineers are increasingly faced with the consequences of the dynamic response of high-rise buildings to wind. Damping is an important property for the dynamic response of high-rise structures, but is a combination of many mechanisms, which makes it a complex phenomenon to account for in the structural design. Empirical damping predictors currently exist, but a large scatter is found among predictors, as well as between predictors and identified damping from measurements. Damping values are prescribed in codes, but are not consistently conservative. Therefore, there is a strong desire from both structural engineers and researchers to obtain further understanding of damping behaviour in high-rise structures. <br/><br/>Damping identification techniques, such as the Half-power Bandwidth method and the Random Decrement technique are commonly used. However, these are not applicable to buildings with closely spaced modes, and require extensive measurements. Besides, they only provide a damping value, and cannot find damping of separate components of a system. A novel technique, the Energy Flux Analysis, approaches damping from an energy point of view, making it more widely applicable, and allowing for damping identification in components of a structure. The Energy Flux Analysis has been verified to lab structures, but its performance when applied to a high-rise structures using in situ measurements is still unknown.<br/><br/>The aim of this research is to investigate the sensitivities of and prerequisites for the application of the Energy Flux Analysis to high-rise buildings excited by wind using spatially limited measurements. The sensitivities were sought for in the uncertainty of required input for the Energy Flux Analysis: structure motion, which includes internal forces, wind load, data acquisition, and structural properties. The research was performed through application of the Energy Flux Analysis to the New Orleans tower in Rotterdam. <br/><br/>While the sensitivity to structural properties and the magnitude of measurements is limited, the Energy Flux Analysis demonstrated to be highly sensitive to the phase of structural motion, internal forces, and wind load. The first two points are relevant for computing the energy flux at the boundary of a system, when one is interested in damping in the superstructure and due to soil-structure interaction separately. The last point is relevant when one is interested in the total or superstructure damping. <br/><br/>The phase differences occurring between structure motion and internal forces are a direct result of damping. Material damping resulted in a phase difference between stress and strain in the numerical model, while a local damper resulted in a phase difference between structure motion at different locations. The many damping mechanisms occurring in a high-rise structure may each affect the phase of structure motion and internal forces differently. When these phase differences are not taken into account in the Energy Flux Analysis, for instance due to extrapolation of measurements, an erroneous result will be obtained. A brief investigation was performed as to whether these effects can be expected in true structures, but additional research is required. <br/><br/>The fluctuating wind load at the natural frequency of the structure is dominant for the flux of energy from wind to the structure, which is obtained by multiplication of the wind load with the structure velocity. Again, the phase of this wind load is highly important. When measured at one location, little is known about the phase of the wind load at other heights. Different approaches of extrapolating the measured wind load demonstrated a large scatter in the Energy Flux Analysis results. In this research, the Energy Flux Analysis found not to be repeatable, which was proven to be a direct result of the phase difference between the measured wind load and structure velocity. Possible causes for this varying phase difference were formulated. <br/><br/>It is essential, but due to the major advantages of the Energy Flux Analysis also profitable, to perform further research into its application to high-rise structures. Therefore, this study provides extensive recommendations mostly focused on simple numerical and lab experiments.","damping; high-rise; wind; Energy Flux Analysis; mode coupling; Half-power Bandwidth; Random Decrement; spatial incompleteness; measurement accuracy; measurement uncertainty; pressure tap; foundation stiffness; soil-structure interaction; phase difference","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Structural Mechanics","","51.90516, 4.48791"

This type of poverty is closely linked to the dichotomy between developed and developing regions. This project argues that tackling energy poverty first needs to be addressed by understanding energy injustice between the urban and rural areas of developing countries. This outlook is significant because energy poverty can be seen as a vector of resource availability, power and spatial needs which is similar to the ideology of the ‘poverty vector’ (Gupta, S. P,1984). The lack of such a cohesive perspective has led to the ongoing negative impacts on economic development, health and access to basic amenities. The project sheds light on the need for a holistic approach to implement resilient energy networks that emphasizes on renewable energy transition and spatial development to address energy poverty.

CMR can improve the outcomes of CVD during long term follow-up. 4D Flow MRI is a three-dimensional time-resolved CMR technique that uses phase contrast sequences with three-directional velocity-encoding and allows evaluation of the blood flow. 4D Flow MRI data can be analyzed with particle tracing.Particle tracing is a technique that releases virtual particles in flow data (seeding) and traces the path the particles follow throughout the vasculature by integrating the flow data. The particle traces can subsequently be quantified with flow distribution analyses and visualized with pathlines. Important settings for particle tracing are the integration method, integration timestep and data interpolation method. The aim of this research is to investigate the effect of different particle tracing settings on the accuracy and computation time and provide a recommendation on the use of particle tracing in 4D Flow MRI data and which particle tracing settings to aim for.MethodsA particle tracing algorithm with a graphical user interface was developed for an existing inhouse developed 4D Flow post-processing workspace. Two 4D Flow MRI datasets from previous studies were acquired. One dataset was of a total cavopulmonary connection of a patient with Fontan circulation and the other was an intracardiac dataset of a healthy volunteer. Particle tracing with common settings and variations in integration method, integration timestep and data interpolation method was performed in both datasets and computation time, flow distributions (pulmonic distribution and four-component analysis), and number of particles that left the structure (missing particles fraction) and number of integration errors were quantified. The latter three were a measure of accuracy of the algorithm. Particle traces were subsequently visualized with pathlines.ResultsParticle with common settings gave a good accuracy for both datasets (missing particles fraction &lt;20%). No differences in visualization, flow distributions and missing particles fraction were found for varying integration methods, interpolation methods and timesteps of 20ms or shorter. For timesteps of 30ms or longer, flow distributions changed compared to results with other settings and number of integration errors increased. Computation time increased almost linearly with the order of the integration method and almost inverted linearly proportional to the timestep.DiscussionFor 4D Flow MRI based particle tracing we would recommend using a low order interpolator (e.g. a third order Runge-Kutta integrator), a maximum timestep of half the temporal resolution of the data, and quadrilinear data interpolation. The results of the particle tracing tests with common settings were comparable to literature, except for the direct flow and retained inflow components of the four-component analysis. To enable accurate particle tracing, the particle seeding method must be chosen adequately and the MRI data and segmentations must be of good quality. Additional techniques such as segmentation shape interpolation and adaptive timestep control might be beneficial and their effect on the accuracy can be investigated in further research.","Cardiovascular disease; MRI; 4D Flow; Particle tracing; Integration; Interpolation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-07-09","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

Sea level rise has a high impact on society and the improvement of forecasts are vital to generate both adaptation and mitigation strategies. A recent comparison of 15 ice sheet models projected that the Antarctic Ice Sheet could contribute -7.8 to 30 centimeters of sea level rise between 2015 and 2100, meaning that sea level rise could increase a lot although the uncertainty is high. To better predict the future of the AIS, more accurate simulations of the evolution of the AIS are needed. The Antarctic ice sheet consist of three main components: grounded slow-moving ice, fast flowing ice streams or outlet glaciers and floating ice shelves. Over glacial-interglacial cycles, the evolution of an ice sheet is influenced by Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) via two negative feedback loops. First, vertical bedrock deformation due to a changing ice load alters ice-sheet surface elevation. Second, bedrock deformation will change the location of the grounding line of the ice sheet. GIA is mainly determined by the viscosity of the interior of the solid Earth which is radially and laterally varying. Underneath the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS), there are relatively low viscosities in West Antarctica and higher viscosities in East Antarctica, which affect the response time of the above-mentioned feedbacks. However, most ice-dynamic models do not consider lateral variations of viscosity in the upper mantle in GIA feedback loops when simulating the evolution of the AIS. The main research question of this study is: •What is the effect of the interaction between Glacial Isostatic Adjustment and ice sheet dynamics on the Antarctic Ice Sheet growth during the last glacial cycle? This study presents a new method to investigate 3D GIA feedback effects in detail at any chosen period during the last glacial cycle. The method is applied using ANICE and a 3D GIA FEM model. This led to the development of a fully coupled ice dynamic-3D GIA model with coupling timesteps of 1000 and 5000 years. Following the new method, the model computations alternate between the ice-sheet model, ANICE, and a 3D Finite Element Method model until convergence of the ice thickness occurs at each timestep. We simulate the evolution of the AIS from 120 000 years to 115 000 years before present, considering 1D and non-linear 3D rheologies. The results of the coupled model are discussed in detail for the period 120,000 years to 115,000 years before present with a focus on the Siple Coast and the Ross Ice Shelf. The maximum difference between the uncoupled deformation (iteration 1) and the coupled deformation (average between the last two iterations) for the period 120,000 to 115,000 years BP is 3 to 8 mm per year, depending on the viscosity of the upper mantle. The maximum difference in ice thickness at 115,000 years BP is 50 meters close the Ronne Ice Shelf and the Ross Ice Shelf. The grounding line position differs up to 80 meters when applying the coupling method compared to the uncoupled result. The increases in deformation using a 3D wet rheology with a grain size of 10 mm are highest at the Siple Coast, the Ronne Ice Shelf, and several other locations along the grounding line of the AIS. The results of this study emphasize the importance of the 3D GIA feedback effects when simulating the evolution of the AIS during the last glacial cycle. Therefore, the GIA feedback effects should be taken into account in future studies.","Glacial Isostatic Adjustment; Antarctic Ice Sheet; Ice-sheet-shelf model; Numerical modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","",""

Even though these solutions are widely deployed for this purpose they have one serious shortcoming which is the huge amount of false alarms that they are generating. Different measures are taken to tackle this problem such as manually changing the settings of the intrusion detection systems. However, this is an infeasible approach for organisations since a network is changing regularly and specialists that have good knowledge of both the environment and the solution are required. The existing unsupervised approaches cannot be implemented as fully automated solutions because of the need to tune hyper-parameters. Additionally,the implementation of the existing solutions is complicated since often multiple models and the constant updating thereof is required which is a computationally intensive process considering the selected algorithms. In this work, the possibilities to reduce the false alarms in an automated manner are investigated. This is done by applying unsupervised anomaly detection techniques on the resulting alert data to distinguish regular alarms from high priority ones. Real alert data is collected from a network of a large organisation and an additional synthetically generated data set is used to evaluate the proposed approach. Four unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms are chosen to model the regular alerts. These are Local Outlier Factor (LOF), Isolation Forest (IF), Histogram-based Outlier Score(HBOS) and Cluster-based Local Outlier Factor (CBLOF). We show that this approach can greatly reduce the false alarms in real environments. By adding noise to the data we evaluate the performance of the models and propose a method that can be used to determine when the model needs to be retrained. This is done by deriving a metric that is used to trigger the system to automatically retrain on the most recent historic data. This is necessary in order to make the system automated and adaptable to changes in the network.","Intrusion Detection; Unsupervised Machine Learning; False Alarms; NIDS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Cyber Security","",""

However, this phenomenon co-exists on building surfaces establishing a hybrid relationship, which poses several advantages on the building life-cycle. Apart from being a protective coating, its environmental benefits, like CO2 reduction in air, air purification through dust removal and cooling effect through evapotranspiration, has been known and researched through decades, but has not been brought into practice in the building industry.

A whole new landscape is being built, one with many more challenges and externalities than the previous one. <br/>Besides the correlation that these intense urbanisation processes have with climate change, more subtly, they relate to a conceptual separation of the natural and built environment. As of today, socio-economic growth cannot be met without environmental degradation, and while many efforts are present towards ecological conservation, none has proved adequate on a global and continental scale. <br/>A reason behind this ineffectiveness lies in a 'weak' understanding of the concept of sustainability, in which environment, society and economy are loosely interchangeable. Furthermore, the current administrative division of territories poses yet another challenge to the management of ecosystems which often have a cross-border nature. First, this thesis proposes a 'strong' sustainability concept, based on the coexistence of natural and human domains.<br/>Also, in the European context, a massive push to decrease our impact on the environment is being developed through the European Green Deal, which sets out to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. This thesis aims to exploit this urgent transition towards climate neutrality as a way to prepare for the following transition towards climate resilience, one in which built and natural environment will be able to adapt, together, to changing climate conditions. <br/>To do so, the two hypotheses of multifunctional and multi-actor development are advanced and applied to the context of the Scheldt estuary, at the border of the Netherlands and Belgium. Multi-functionality refers to the possibility of having multiple and different functions (environmental, social and economic) within single spatial developments. Multi-actor, instead, refers to the complementary need to include an extensive and diverse range of stakeholders in the decision-making process. <br/>These two hypotheses hold the potential to increase preparedness in an evolutionary-resilience perspective. In fact, opting for a multifunctional development that couples economic and environmental functions today might facilitate further adaptation measures needed in the future.

Multiple floating solar parks are installed on inland water bodies. This trend is a result of the lack of surface for PV systems and a result of legislation on national and international governmental levels, for the reduction of greenhouse gasses. This inland technology is currently well established. Still, in densely populated areas such as the Netherlands supplementary surface could be beneficial to unlock the full potential of solar energy. Ocean and sea surfaces are a possible, but challenging solution to this problem. These offshore water surfaces could be used for electricity or synthetic fuel production. Offshore locations are attractive because of the abundant availability of surface. Still, an OFPV-system needs to overcome multiple technical and non-technical challenges and requirements. This challenge demands technical solution within the constraints of a suitable business case. Furthermore, the impact on people and ecology also needs to stay within ethical borders. An OFPV can be subdivided into three physical subsystems: an energy converting system, a position monitoring or mooring system and a floating support structure. Multiple concepts were proposed in literature or by the industry. All proposed concepts are variations of support systems that provide a surface for conventional PV-technology. It also was concluded that none of the proposed concepts is fully developed. Currently, only one system is in the testing phase. The current state of the technology, and the high potential of an OFPV are the drivers behind the search for a new concept design. In this thesis, the requirements for an OFPV support structure were formulated, and a brainstorm resulted in the buoy and beam concept for further research. The buoy and beam structure is a system in which submerged beams form a triangle grid are held together by floating buoys. The buoys support triangle platforms, by carrying the corners of the platforms. All connections between the buoys, beams and platforms are fully hinged. Because of the hinges, the structure can move with the waves and therefore mitigates the loads it experiences. In the second part of this thesis, the feasibility of the buoy and beam structure was assessed. It was concluded that the heave response is the most critical response to the feasibility of the concept. When the platform would heave too much, the waves will slam into the platforms and the solar panels, leading to damage and excessive loads on the structure. Consequently, the heave response and the relative wave height seen from the moving triangle platform are researches and modelled. The structure was identified as a hydrodynamic transparent structure. Consequently, the relevant hydrodynamic loads are obtained with the Morison equation and Airy wave theory. All damping terms are linearised. A differential equation incorporated the constrains for both, the construction and the hydromechanic loads. The mechanical equations can be linearised by assuming small angular displacements of the beams. This differential equation is implemented in a calculation tool in MATLAB. The code is verified over multiple steps. The tool made it possible to obtain the response based on the topology and the main dimensions of the buoys and the beams. With this calculation tool relations between the dimensions of the buoys and beams on one side and the frequency response, on the other hand, are identified by simulating different variations of a simplified starting design. The following conclusions were made on the eigenfrequencies. Firstly, it was noted that the eigenfrequencies of the system are in proximity to each other. Secondly, it was shown that the first and second eigenfrequency could be calculated in a simplified manner. Thirdly, it was seen that the buoy diameter to mass ratio has a positive linear correlation with respect to the eigenfrequency, i.e. the stiffness to mass ratio of the system severely influences the eigenfrequency. Furthermore, it was seen that an increasing beam length has a slight linear correlation with the eigenfrequency. Also, it was concluded that a large hexagon system (for example, nineteen buoys) could be beneficial because a hexagon structure creates a large surface with respect to the number of buoys. Moreover, in reality, the response should be lower than the model prediction, as a result of the high number of beams that cause damping. Additionally, a hexagon system should have a minimal change in response for different incoming wave angle. To obtain a feasible system, the response peaks of the structure should not overlap with the wave spectrum. Based on the additional simulation, it was concluded that it should be possible to design a system with a low eigenfrequency resulting in a system that will only slightly move with the waves. Additional relations between the dimensions of the buoys and beams and the response peaks were found. The requirements to obtain a low eigenfrequency and a modest response match, which positively influences the feasibility. Some further steps on the research of the heave response and the relative wave height are needed. The calculation tool can still be improved. A preciser estimation of the response peaks is of significant importance. Some further iterations must be executed to determine the full potential and feasibility of the concept design. Furthermore, in a scientific point of view, it will be highly interesting to validate the model on a model scale. In the development of the buoy and beam structure, additional critical responses need to be researched. The forces in the hinges and the response in horizontal direction need to be known for further assessment of the feasibility. Next to the technical aspects, the human, ecological and economic implications of the buoy and beam structure need to be researched.","Solar; Offshore; Support structure; Flexible; Response","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

More specifically, it considers the use of helical flexure geometries in motion stages. Insight into the linear kinematic behaviour of various helical surfaces with varying curvature is provided with the usage of parametric optimization, screw theory, unified stiffness method and a performance metric. The newly acquired insights served as a prerequisite for selecting a suitable topology capable of guiding a stage. For demonstration purposes, a motion stage prototype was fabricated consisting of three helical flexure elements.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","In the last few years organ-on-chip (OoC) has been emerging as a new method for more reliable research to screen the effects of new drugs on the body. This is a novel technology mimicking the in vivo environment of tissue cells, making it a more suitable candidate for experimentation than traditional 2D cell cultures. However, in order to ensure smooth and swift implementation of this technique, some issues must be addressed first. One of these issues concerns perfusion: most OoC devices require external equipment to provide the necessary dynamic flow that makes the OoC unique, so that cells experience continuous fluid shear and are perfused sufficiently. In this thesis a model of an on-chip electro-polymeric pump is designed for application on an OoC. From a background study the design aims are defined: a membrane actuated pump with a nozzle-diffuser channel providing pump action. The membrane is made from ionic polymer-metal composite (IPMC), a material that deforms under electric current which is produced at TU Delft with the intention to use it in OoC applications. Its low voltage operating range and its biocompatibility make it an excellent candidate for this. Furthermore, the nozzle-diffuser elements avoid the need for moving elements inside the channel, instead providing pump action based on a pressure gradient over the nozzle elements. Finally, three design aims are defined, being: high flowrate, high flow pulse and low flow rate and pulse applications, corresponding to various needs in the OoC field. A base model is designed using COMSOL Multiphysics software, using similar devices described in literature. The model consists of a combination of solid mechanics (for membrane movement), fluid mechanics (for flow movement) and a fluid-structure interaction module to combine the two. This model is then tested for a range of parameters, first independently and later in pairs. General conclusions drawn from these simulations include: - Between the membrane displacement and -frequency (which can both be varied after fabrication), the membrane displacement magnitude affects the output more significantly than actuation frequency - The membrane width is positively correlated with flow rate output and pulse amplitude - The channel depth is positively correlated with flow rate output, but only if the membrane displacement scales along with it - A long slender nozzle yields lower flow output than a short, squat nozzle - The results from this model are consistent with nozzle-diffuser theory, stating that nozzle resistance and membrane movement affect the flow most significantly. This leads to three designs according to the three application wishes expressed earlier. The pump is designed such that it can be manufactured on a silicon wafer using electronics cleanroom equipment. The combination with the process developed for IPMC provides a novel pumping mechanism that has the potential to fully integrate an important aspect of an OoC on-chip, greatly increasing user friendliness and allowing for wider implementation of this technology.","organ-on-chip; IPMC; microactuation; microfluidics; COMSOL Multiphysics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-06-26","","","","","",""

In order to ensure the safety of these dikes against a number of different failure mechanisms such as backwards erosion piping, wave overtopping and macro stability, a detailed safety assessment has been created. The focus of this thesis is on the failure mechanism known as piping. Which consists of three different sub-mechanisms; uplift, heave and backwards erosion piping. The safety assessment against piping consists of a multi-step approach. First an elementary assessment is done, followed by a detailed assessment of the different sub-mechanisms and lastly a final analysis is done using more detailed data and software. Currently, Sellmeijer’s design rule is used in the detailed safety assessment to design against the sub-mechanism backwards erosion piping. His design rule is the starting point of this thesis. Before Sellmeijer was able to derive his design rules, he had to make a number of different assumptions and simplifications. The most significant being, simplifying the three-dimensionality of the piping process to a two-dimensional process, by neglecting the meandering nature of the pipe and excluding the effect of the lateral groundwater flow on the pipe progression. By limiting the problem to twodimensions Sellmeijer derived a mathematical model on which his design rule was based. In his design rule Sellmeijer relates the progression of a pipe to a hydraulic gradient. Over the years, Sellmeijer’s design rule has been adapted three different times. Each adaptation resulted in a more accurate design rule accounting for more and more parameters. However, with each adaptation, Sellmeijer’s design rule did not become more transparent. During the derivation of his design rule, Sellmeijer fails to account for the effect of a leaky layer on the critical hydraulic gradient for pipe progression. This limitation in his design rule is the focus of this thesis. In order to determine if leakage affects the critical hydraulic head for pipe rogression, a study is done using a two dimensional groundwater model in which his design rule is implemented. From these simulations it was observed that the presence of a leaky layer results in an increase in the critical hydraulic head. In the simulations studied, a maximum of 12 % increase is observed. Next an analysis is done on the results of these simulations. On the one hand an attempt is made to determine if and how leakage can be included in Sellemijer’s design rule. The simulations show that the effect of leakage on increasing the critical hydraulic gradient for pipe progression is largely dependent on the hydraulic conductivity of the cover layer. However, in order for a leakage term to be determined, and included in Sellmeijer’s design rule, additional simulations should be done. In MSeep it was also observed that leaky layers significantly impact the groundwater flow under the dike. The effect of this was quantified by looking at the effective depth. Which is defined as the portion of the aquifer which is responsible for groundwater flow towards the pipe and uplift channel. In order to further analyse the effect of leakage on groundwater flow, a number of quasi 3D and 3D scenarios were modelled in iMOD. For these simulations the effective depth, the effective width (in 3D) and the discharge in the well is determined. In this way, the effect of leakage can be quantified. In all three of the models similar trends are observed: a increase in the hydraulic conductivity of the cover layer resulted in the decrease of the effective depth. However, in the full 3D model the impact of leakage on the groundwater flow resulted in a larger range in the results. The results of this thesis, show that derivation of a leakage term would greatly benefit the output of the design rule. As a ’quick fix’ it is recommended to derive a leakage term which can be included in Sellmeijer’s design rule. However, further developments of a 3D model which correctly implements the effect of a pipe on the groundwater flow is also beneficial.","Backward erosion piping; leakage; modelling; 2D; 3D; Sellmeijer; piping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Moreover, we test whether examples of Braess’ paradox, which states that adding an edge in a network can locally improve flow but globally cause congestion, can be found in a small network. Increasing the capacity of the power grid lines and implementing time delayed feedback are shown to have a positive effect on the stability of the grid. For a specific grid (the German power grid) it is shown that replacing a large power generator by many smaller generators can indeed have a positive effect on the stability, but this result has mediocre statistical certainty (p-value of 0:16). No instances have been found where removing a line from the network has a positive effect (Braess’ paradox), however this is insufficient to conclude that no such instances exist.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

As technological developments in the workplace accelerate, workplaces are connecting to a variety of sensors, actuators, and dedicated networks in the Internet of Things (IoT). Sensor data can be collected on aspects of workplace performance and occupants’ behaviors. While the performance of the workplace is evaluated, the validation by facility managers is under-development and dominated by perceptual self-report measurements. In Post Occupancy Evaluation (POE) the main instrument used by facility managers is surveys. Due to the properties of the instruments, surveys and other self-report measurements raise concern for the effectiveness of verifications to maintain and improve the performance of the workplace environment. With new ways of working, Activity-Based Working (ABW) is a promising workstyle focused on people, place, and technology, but several performance issues have been identified. Limited studies focus on the application of sensor data, and IoT is only recently recognized to make a significant impact on the validation of the workplace performance by facility managers. Research aim and goal. The main research aim is to explore the application of sensor data for the validation of the ABW performance by facility managers. The research goal is to identify the opportunities and limitations of the current sensor data in an IoT from a Facility Management (FM) perspective. Research method. The exploration of the sensor data is conducted utilizing both research and design in a case study. The case study is a prominent smart building located at Schiphol that has embraced the concept of ABW. In the case study, the available sensor data is collected and explored for opportunities and limitations. Components of an interface are designed from a FM perspective to explore the sensor data structurally in an ABW environment. The exploration of the data is conducted using hypotheses. Three hypotheses are formulated based on performance issues in ABW from literature, and further specified based on the case study. Key findings and conclusion. The exploration of the sensor data illustrated that the role and decision-making process of a facility manager can drastically change within the ABW environment of smart buildings. The facility manager can validate the workplace performance with goals set for each activity. Facility managers can shift from a complaint-driven reactive attitude to a proactive data-driven analytic of the workplace performance. With the sensor data, the facility manager can additionally rely on continuous quantitative and objective data of the workplace performance. The use of both subjective inputs from occupants’ perception in combination with objective sensor data can improve the reliability of the data for more effective verifications in the ABW environment. Nevertheless, the current state of smart buildings is not up to expectations. The sensor data is the critical input in an IoT and lacks on many fronts. Researchers and practitioners are encouraged to align the data of the sensors with KPIs from a facility management perspective by (re)considering the functionality of the sensors. To benchmark the sensor data with aspects of employee satisfaction, productivity, and well-being, a consensus is required amongst organizations for the application of sensors with similar output values.","Facility Management; Activity-Based Working; Workplace; Data-driven; Sensor data","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

Aim: The development of a strategy for creating adaptable office buildings, highlighting the relation between the actions proposed and the value they can deliver to the corporations that implement them. The large scale ambition of this strategy is to assist actors in understanding the value of adaptability and sustainability, and consequently contribute in stimulating the markets interest towards a more sustainable and future-proof future. Research Question: How can adaptability strategies be applied in the development of new office buildings to add value for corporations and address the mismatch over time between buildings and users’ demands?Methodology: A qualitative approach has been followed, supported by quantitative data in order to answer the paper’s research question and achieve its aim. Conducting an empirical study, through literature review, provided background knowledge on the topics of adaptability and added value, which constituted the basis for developing the preliminary strategy. Continuing, for the second part of the thesis a research by design approach was adopted. Qualitative data were collected from a series of case studies – via documentary analysis and interviews - providing insights from practice which were then used to formulate findings and synthesize a definitive and concrete final strategy.Finding: : The increasing pace the world is changing, has resulted in the market’s gradual shift towards adaptability. Though, actor’s inability to understand adaptability’s long-term and indirect value, constitutes a boundary for the development of responsive real estate. The creation of this paper’s strategy – “The value of adaptability”, illustrates the links between a number of adaptability related strategies and tactics with different forms of added value. In addition, the significance, risk, impact &amp; risk assessment and life expectancy of each tactic is presented, providing the implementers more criteria for choosing which tactics best fit their objectives. Despite the significance of adaptability in order to reduce the mismatch between the dynamic environment and the static nature of the built environment, the shift towards adaptability requires time. The strategy formulated, can assist actors into understanding the benefits of adaptability, and stimulate the shift towards a future-proof and sustainable environment where adaptability will become a standardised requirement. Limitations of the research: This being the first attempt of linking adaptability with the different forms of added value, the findings were based on qualitative research and in a limited amount of cases. Expanding the research in more cases and the collection of quantitative data can provide more generalised input and strengthen the strategy.Practical implications: The strategy developed through this research can assist: real estate managers in the creating adaptable office buildings based on the core business and objectives of their organisation, developers and investors whose goal is to construct adaptable projects – as adaptability has started to impact real estate financial value- and finally by architects and related engineers, in order to create more adaptable buildings for their clients. The strategy provides the implementer the potential of tailoring it in order to it to fit their goals and objectives. Originality/ value: This thesis addresses the shortage of future proof real estate, by presenting a comprehensive strategy that can assist the development of adaptable buildings, something that according to Estaji (2007), and Gosling, Naim, Sassi, Iosif and Lark (2008) is still lacking. Real estate constitutes a significant component of corporations. Despite this, combining strategies of adaptability, with the corporate real estate management view and models of added value comprises an unexplored field in scientific research.","adaptability; flexibility; strategy; design; Corporate Real Estate; real estate; real estate development; Project Development; Architecture; addded value; competitive advantage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

One of the most challenging properties were the limited volume constraints placed on the orders in the limit order and the constraint that the sessions had a binary charge speed, meaning they can either fully charge or not charge at all. This combination creates and NP-hard optimization problem. The second main difficulty is online nature of the market, meaning a solution for the hard optimization problem has to be done within seconds. Current research in the field of smart charging on the intraday markets and smart charging in general has not been able to provide this research with a feasible scheduling optimization method. This leads us to the main contribution of this research: the proposal of a new optimization method which computes an (online) approximate scheduling of a fleet, with binary charge settings, that optimizes on the costs of multiple electricity markets including the ETPA intraday and day ahead market. Through empirical testing it has been shown that re optimization in an online environment can be done within maximally a quarter of a second, with a fleet of 10000 EVs per day. Testing has also shown that it can schedule these EVs with a maximum error or 33 kW per PTU, which is an error of 0.16% on a 10000 session per day fleet. The newly proposed optimization methods has immediately been utilized to test the maximum trading possibilities of the ETPA intraday market. Only purchasing on the day ahead and intraday market has shown some possible opportunities, but the real opportunity lies within full trading on the day ahead and intraday market. Cost reductions of up to 6ct/kW could be achieved compared to not smart charging at all. Online tests, using no forecasting model, has shown almost no cost reduction compared to only smart charging on the day ahead market. This is due to the algorithm trading when the least of profit can be made, wasting the profit possibility. This research has provided the first building blocks to achieve a optimization model for smart charging on the ETPA intraday market. For the optimization model to be completely ready it must be able to optimize over PTUs, that have different lengths, and be able to make use of forecasted prices and volumes computed by an external forecasting model.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-06-26","","","","","",""

Especially turbulence parameter 푇퐼 is still giving food for thought. Three important aspects of LiDAR measured 푇퐼 that are considered key are picked out and feature in this work, which attempts to contribute to the handling of LiDAR measured turbulence. Firstly, the accuracy in measuring several wind characteristics compared to met masts,which have been the standard in wind science and industry for the past centuries, is an issue. This thesis evaluates a LiDAR met mast comparison for a Dutch onshore wind farm site to support the handling of the biases between both sources, with a focus on 푇퐼. It finds LiDAR suitable for basic wind measurements, but it still struggles with measuring turbulence accurately. Patterns in biases are exposed and explained and propositions of an alteration of the internal LiDAR correction factor 퐶, as well as the use of a new turbulence parameter called transience 휏m, are made. The second factor addressed in this thesis is an indirect one and originates from the fact that turbulence, and so 푇퐼, plays an important role in the fatigue lifetime damage of a wind turbine. It is tried to answer the question what influence small biases in 푇퐼 have on the fatigue lifetime damage of the tower and blades of a common wind turbine by means of a simulation based sensitivity study. Increments with an order of magnitude found in the first part of this work form an input for this. It is found that the fatigue damage due to stresses from certain bending moments is higher than others and that the blades and tower are affected differently by turbulence. The third factor is related to the inherent flexibility of LiDAR devices. This forms a big advantage over met masts in general and also possibly paves the way for short-term measurement campaigns by LiDAR. It is proven that 푇퐼 shows intra-annual variability, which would therefore require extrapolation techniques. The Measure Correlate Predict (MCP) methodology is chosen to conduct a case study on the application of several MCP algorithms on 푇퐼 data, containing several experiments. It was found that the linear regression method (LR) is unsuitable for making long-term turbulence predictions, but that the variance ratio method (VR) shows promising results on the used performance metrics. It seems that it does not matter whether the short-term data length is 3 or 6 months and that the picked season does not harm the final result significantly.","LIDAR; remote sensing; turbulence; Measure Correlate Predict; met masts; Fatigue Analysis; turbulence intensity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-06-27","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (2014), ALS, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease which attacks motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. This results in the wasting away of muscles, by which they are weakened. Patients gradually lose the ability to move, speak, swallow, and, eventually, to breathe unaided within an average of two to four years after the onset of the symptoms (Andersen, P. M., Abrahams, S., Borasio, G. D., de Carvalho, M., Chio, A., Van Damme, P., Weber, M. (2012).<br/>Discover<br/>According to the ALS Association (n.d.), ALS limb onset starts with distal muscle weakness (further away from the heart) and gradually move in the proximal direction (closer to the heart). This means that in most cases, finger strength is lost before weakness in the wrist appears, which is followed by loss of power in the arm. This study starts by evaluating if an arm balancing exoskeleton contributes to performing activities of daily living (ALDs) for ALS patients. However, not being able to control hand movement causes patients not being able to perform essential ALDs. An arm exoskeleton which lacks hand support will not contribute.<br/>Prominent problem<br/>Patients become highly dependent on the care of informal caregivers and assistive aids, which is emotionally and mentally burdensome for both. When patients can perform small tasks like ADLs themselves with assistive aids, it will contribute to the level of independence and unburden the informal caregivers. This study aims to investigate the most prominent problems occurring in the daily life of patients by interviewing four patients. It is found that patients primary prefer to complete dining activities independently because of alleviating their informal caregivers and avoiding home care during these valued times.<br/>Develop<br/>Based on this insight, exploration research is done to find the best way on how to support ALS patients during dining activities. The activity is detailly analysed by dividing dining into smaller actions, which presents the underlying problems. This shows that grasping objects is the first problem which limits patients. A second study compares the applicability of three types of hand support which solve grasp failure: active (dynamic) support, hybrid support, and static support are researched. These supports are discussed with patients and medical experts. The type of support which is operated by patients in the simplest way regarding basic movements and straightforward controlling is chosen to continue for further development. ALS patients can longer operate this type of support, and use this assistive aid immediately without long learning time.<br/>Deliver<br/>A tailor-made static hand orthosis is developed, which provides independence to ALS patients during dining activities. By automatically connecting and releasing to frequently used tableware, no strength of their fingers is required. The orthosis contributes to the level of comfort and addresses the individual differences for patients because it is tailor-made. The orthosis connects to frequently used objects by using a designed connector with magnetic capabilities and a mechanical lock.<br/>Evaluate<br/>This first iteration is evaluated by an ALS patient having mild paralysis in hand. The orthosis is tested while consuming breakfast consisting of fluid and food intake. The orthosis connects well with frequently used objects and operates straightforwardly and simply, which results in performing the dining activities with more independence and ease. Secondly, the results of the study are evaluated with an occupational therapist who agrees that this assistive aid could increase the level of independence for ALS patients. This first iteration can form a base for further development. Still, many iteration steps combined with user tests should follow. The first step would consist of improving the usability of the current connection to cups and other utensils like a fork and a knife.","Hand; Orthosis; Exoskeleton; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; tailor made","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

The dependence on fossil fuels is reduced with the aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In the Netherlands this means that natural gas is slowly faded out of our society. One consequence of this is the electrification of some functionalities that natural gas had, like heating houses and cooking. Additionally, more and more people are choosing to drive electric vehicles. On the supply side more and more renewable energy sources are being installed to increase the renewable energy mix in our electricity market. Because the supply and demand of electricity increases faster than new cables can be installed, the electricity grid is put under strain. The electricity grid was designed, decades ago, to only transport electricity from central, large energy generation plants to the consumer. However, nowadays there are also developers that are building 'decentralized' PV parks and wind farms. These decentralized generation systems are unable to be connected to the MV-grid. Energy storage has been identified to be a valuable asset to help with the penetration of renewable energy. Energy storage can help to match the supply and demand, improve the power quality, improve the variability of the power supply and smooth out the peaks of over-generation most associated with the congestion on the MV-grid. It is also possible to (temporally) replace the necessary grid reinforcement. However, energy storage is still very expensive. So it needs to be examined how energy storage can be interesting for this problem. A knowledge gap exist on energy storage for decentralized renewable energy generation for the Dutch medium-voltage grid. Additionally, no method was available to simulate such an problem. So this was researched in this study. The study has included a suitable financial model, various energy storage systems and operating strategies. Additionally, the interest of the developer of the DG plant and the DSO were included. For the developer the study has investigated the profitability of the system. The DSO is interested in minimizing the cost and resources of the connection of the hybrid DG system. From this the following research questions are formulated: Under what conditions can energy storage for decentralized renewable energy generation be economically feasible to mitigate connection scarcity on the medium-voltage grid? This was answered in three steps. Firstly, a model was built to accurately simulate energy storage in a hybrid DG system. This model must satisfy all technical requirements and be applicable to the Dutch electricity markets. Secondly, the simulation model was used to examine the hybrid system design to optimally profit from the storage system. From this it was concluded that a small energy storage system adds relatively more value in energy output and earnings than a large storage system. Additionally, it identified the pumped heat electrical storage system as the most profitable system for decentralized generation and the best performing technology is the LFP Li-ion battery. Also, storage is more beneficial for PV solar energy than for wind energy. In this section it was also found that in alleviating connection scarcity, grid reinforcement is more profitable than energy storage. And thirdly, different operating strategies for the hybrid system were investigated to optimally use the energy storage system. For a hybrid system with cable capacity limitations, peak shaving of over-generated energy is the most profitable operating strategy. This research has shown that energy storage can improve the energy output and revenue of a decentralized system with connection capacity limitations. Nevertheless, not adding energy storage is more profitable. A small energy storage system with a PV solar park can become economically feasible and more interesting than grid reinforcement. For this, energy storage technologies need to improve, especially the capital cost need to reduce, with more than half of the current cost. Additionally, this hybrid system needs to be located where grid reinforcement is costly or not possible.","Energy Storage; Decentralized Energy Systems; Connection scarcity; Energy Storage Devices","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Process and Energy Technology","",""

However, these investments are exposed to climate-related risks. This means that Development Finance Institutions need to explore climate adaptation interventions, particularly in view of the fact that developing countries themselves have few resources for climate adaptation. This thesis aims to establish how, using an agent-based model, Development Finance Institutions can achieve long term investments by financing climate adaptation, while creating societal benefits and financial returns. This implies positively contributing to society, for example by creating jobs, generating a stable income, and supporting the resilience of households, while securing profitability for development banks. An investment by the Dutch Development Bank FMO in the cocoa sector in Ghana serves as a case study. Three main steps are followed in the study: (1) translating global climate scenarios at the local level; (2) capturing local behavior in a bottom-up model because understanding the specificity of the local context and individuals’ response is key to really make an impact; and (3) testing climate adaptation interventions. Downscaled climate scenarios are used as input in an agent-based model capturing the behavior of Ghanaian cocoa smallholders. Experimenting with climate adaptation shows that Development Finance Institutions have to make trade-offs in terms of priority, timing, and activity. This step-by-step approach could encourage DFIs to capture the impact of climate change and the dynamics at the local level, and to design tailored interventions. It is also a way to take a holistic perspective and look at the broader picture of economic and societal impacts of climate change, and the response across the whole value chain.","Agent-Based Modeling; Climate Adaptation; Development Finance Institutions; Scenario Analysis; Physical Risk","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

Since the Dutch government has the ambition to be fully circular in 2050, the concept of a circular economy is more and more linked to area development in the Netherlands. As a result, existing inner-city production areas are, partly because of urbanization, being transformed through a circular design approach into residential and commercial areas. However, due to these transformations, production processes disappear from areas, which in fact makes the areas less circular because the circular functioning in the areas is no longer included. Hence it can be questioned in what extent contemporary circular area developments are actually circular, or whether these circular area developments only consist of a circularly designed area that does not take into account the circular functioning of the area. Objective – The main objective of this research is to understand how circular functioning can be taken into account in the development of circular areas. Based on the understanding of how the circular functioning of an area is or is not taken into consideration during circular area development, recommendations will be drawn up. The research question that is answered: ‘’Which recommendations can contribute to an area development with regard to the circular functioning of an area?’’. Methods – The research process is divided in three parts. First of all, a literature review has been carried out to collect information in order to gain an understanding and insights about circular area development. Secondly, a case study and several interviews are conducted in order to gain insights of what criteria the recommendations should suffice to with the aim of improving the circular functioning of an area during a circular area development. Thirdly, an expert panel is held to validate draft recommendations to ultimately formulate final conclusions and recommendations. Results – The results of this research show that circular area development consists of a circularly designed environment and a circularly functioning environment, in which the use of resources and energy is minimized by closing, slowing down and narrowing cycles. In addition, a circular area consists of as much local production and transactions as possible, creating opportunities for the highest possible reuse of products, materials and resources. Further findings claim that area development can significantly change an area's program. As a consequence of an increasing program, material consumption and waste generation increase within an area. It can therefore be argued that, with regard to the circular functioning of an area undergoing an area development, more processing of materials and waste should take place as locally as possible. Conclusion – Several recommendations have been identified in this study that can be divided into three categories. First, overarching recommendations focus on (1) the specific formulation of guidelines for achieving sustainable and circular objectives and (2) stimulating innovations during area developments. Second, the focus should be on creating both a circularly designed area and a circularly functioning area during area development. This category consists primarily of rethinking the development plans, by analysing the current situation in the area and assessing how the current built environment, infrastructure and established activities can contribute to a circular economy. Subsequently, the following five aspects can be applied: (1) circular criteria for land issues and tenders, (2) design and build according to circular principles, (3) new forms of financial value assessment, (4) introducing flexibility in the existing zoning plan, and (5) stimulating local partnerships to close cycles. The third category, monitor, evaluate and improve, serves to assess whether the sustainable and circular objectives of an area development are achieved and, if possible, to make adjustments to improve the sustainability and circularity of an area. This category consists of the following six components to monitor, analyse and improve: (1) incoming and outgoing flows in an area, (2) existing and future raw materials in an area, (3) energy consumption of an area, (4) climate adaptation of an area, (5) health and well-being of residents in an area, and (6) local economy. Discussion – COVID-19 broke out during the research process. On the one hand, this created obstacles for the research: respondents were often not available for interviews. Nevertheless, all questions previously drafted in the protocols have been answered. On the other hand, the coronavirus outbreak has shown that the circular economy principle is more topical than ever, in which port cities in particular should focus more on less volatile manufacturing industries rather than international processes. As a result, countries will be less dependent on international processes and besides, the total number of international transactions will reduce. This given is in line with the principle of a circular economy. Moreover, the focus on less volatile manufacturing industries of port cities will eventually create new job opportunities for local residents. In other words, bringing (re)consumption and (re)production back or closer to port cities not only contributes to the ecological aspect, but also to the local economy.","Circular Economy; Circularity; Circular area development; Networks; Built environment; Urban metabolism","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","",""

Leading to adopting circular design practices within the industry which is incentivized by the nationwide programme towards creating a 100% circular economy by 2050 with an intermediate goal to reduce the use of primary raw materials and by 50% until 2030. This has led to exploring flexible and adaptable design strategies in office buildings. In a building floor-systems cater to more than 50% of the total material usage, thereby contributing to the highest impact on the environment. But a floor-system in a building is not always a standalone component, it shares heavy interactions with services such as mechanical, electrical and plumbing installations. Services integration into the floor-system poses flexibility related challenges, as it often interacts with building products that are of varying have varying durability (life spans). An integrated floor-system approach is a multidisciplinary problem and one of the key challenges is flexibility. Furthermore, multi-disciplinary design decisions made in the early design stages create a huge impact on the flexibility, environment and material circularity aspects. Therefore, this research aims to address the complexity of this problem by developing a knowledge based decision support system driven by data and heuristic logic, that can support the decision-makers involved in the early design stages of an integrated floor-system design.

Organizations are essential to society, as people are more productive in groups. For their continuity, it is important that organizations continuously keep adapting to their environment. The new economy requires agile organizations that can quickly (co-)produce customized responses to the demands of the market. At the present moment, the hierarchical organizational structures face limits of their usefulness and are being replaced by a lean form of organization. In their place, these decentralized organizations are growing to overcome the limitations of these hierarchical structures. The coronavirus pandemic enforced a working from home policy that strongly decreased the access to work. This development stimulated organizations to move to decentralized organizing with a marketplace for team formation. The introduction of self-managing teams enables this desired dynamic and leads to an agile organization. Virtualization has further enriched and diversified these teams. These self-managing teams are useful for constructive conflict, diversity, innovation, performance gains, and synergy. The coordination of work changes with the introduction of self-managing teams. These teams in here in a strong individual choice of people, which is both a benefit and a risk for people and organizations. A digital marketplace is a supporting institution that can provide overview, insights, and access to several opportunities by combining supply and demand of teams and talents across organizational borders. Connecting workers to relevant teams is also the main performance criterion. Still, bounded rationality can result in non-optimal individual choices on the marketplace and a one-size-fits-all approach does not match the preferences of the heterogeneous workers. A filter within the marketplace is needed to decrease the obstacles of decentral coordination of activities, however, there is limited research available on this subject. This research follows the theory of design science research with the three cycles. The design objective is to support users in self-managing team formation with a recommender system and custom filtering algorithms. This is achieved with twelve design artifacts: personalization, criteria and objectives, recommender system, data engineering, ETL script, logical data model, custom filtering algorithms, data science, validation queries, hybrid filtering algorithm, DevOps, and advice on UX design and usage. The designed system was built with the requirements of the program of business demands. The constraints for the recommender system with custom algorithms are personalized recommendations for each worker and the incorporation of platform rules. The objectives are regular updates, scalable, open-source, and easy to set up.","algorithm; collaborative filtering; data engineering; data science; design science; marketplace; matching; personalization; recommendations; recommender system; self-managing team","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Analysing the interpersonal learning process, the individual learning processes prior to the project and learnings about the partners behaviour during the first meetings and challenging situations were determined as crucial to the emergence of partnering relations. Moreover, most formal partnering components seemed to have an overall positive but also paradoxical effects depending on the project and the individual. To overcome paradoxes, joint problem solving seemed the most commonly applied and favoured management practice during partnering. Applying sensemaking to collected case data, it is concluded that named factors and their effect differed depending on the individual’s perception. Based on a conceptual model, it is explained that factors promoted the emergence of partnering when they were perceived as in harmony to the individuals understanding of partnering. Ultimately, picking up on the suggestion of Kadefors (2004) to apply trust theory to study partnering, it is suggested that the individuals starting level of trust, the individual’s choice and ability to trust, the human preference for reciprocity as well as the individuals abilities, benevolence and integrity should be considered as factors when researching the emergence of partnering.","Urban Development Management; Partnering; Public-Private Partnerships","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

Life in Central Places is expanding; life in remote territories is vanishing. For centuries, subsistence agriculture sustained rural communities the world over; that raison d’être has now largely vanished. Cities mine the territory for fuel, material resources, food and even population. Simultaneously, our globalised world faces serious challenges as we try to move beyond oil and to a circular economy. The remote island of Flotta in the Orkney archipelago exemplifies these themes, and offers possible visions for a future world in which the remote territory exists in symbiosis with the centralised city. In the coming decade, the Flotta Oil Terminal will close. Flotta’s population is aging, and its vital services are gradually vanishing. There is a small but significant influx of people fleeing the city- looking for an old, but now-vanished way of life in the remote territory. Friction on Flotta is rising as these few, new romantics interact with the pragmatically-minded last generation of Flottarians. Community is not always rosy. The closure of the oil terminal will likely be the nail in the coffin of human habitation of Flotta. Orkney also has a waste management problem- shipping scrap metal to distant, central locations. Simultaneously the Orkney archipelago is ‘the Saudi Arabia of renewable energy’. It already generates much more electricity than it needs, but struggles to export the surplus via a subsea cable designed to transfer power to and not from the islands. Renewable energy is not best suited to central cities- it is Energy at the End of the World. Traversing the island, the Bruck-Mining Saga forms a connection between the point where the Flotta subsea electricity cable lands and the remote edge of a ruined, wartime landscape facing out to sea. It pragmatically mines metal bruck at infrastructural scale, creating new material for export and thus a new economy by using the locally generated renewable electricity surplus. The metal recycling plant occupies the site of an abandoned airfield from the early days of the oil terminal- which constitutes a form of spatial bruck. In time, the oil terminal will also become bruck. The creation of ‘new metal’ in turn facilitates the embellishment/ establishment of a craft metal working/ jewellery making tradition on the island. This draws Flotta into the existent Creative Orkney Trail and brings bruck metal mining to the scale of the human, and indeed even to that of the wearer. These workshops inhabit a series of wartime ruins, which are of course a form of architectural bruck. They preserve and embellish the romantic attraction of this story to visitors of Orkney. Such stories of the remote are vital to humanity: ‘Once upon a time in a land far, far away…’ Where does the community fit in- complete with all its beauty and imperfections? It occupies a point of transition between these two spheres of production, where a series of spaces house the rich tapestry of Flotta stories past, present and future. These subterranean spaces form a modern monument which both record and enable the telling of stories that are crucial to the plural identities of the evolving Flotta community, and which in turn reflect our broader humanity. In doing so, they become simultaneously a museum, community arts space and landmark. More permanent than any infrastructure can or ever should be, they cement a part of our humanity in the remote island territory. They say: ‘We’re still here.’","Anthropocene; Transition; Permanence; Infrastructure; Human; Centralisation; Decentralisation; Symbiosis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Transitional Territories","","58.828700, -3.115500"

Teachers often use the design cycle which consists of six phases: 1) Exploring &amp; formulating the problem, 2) Generating &amp; selecting ideas, 3) Generating &amp; selecting concepts, 4) Building prototypes, 5) Testing &amp; optimising and 6) Presenting. There are several tools available for teachers to use when doing a design assignment in class. These tools are focused on exploring, ideating and presenting, but tools for prototyping are missing. In a previous project Nadine Rodewijk developed a game, the Prototype-discussion-game, which was meant to help children in purposefully prototyping. This game is the starting point of this project and the goal of this project is to develop materials that are a contribution to the available tools for designing in primary education and make children use prototyping in a meaningful way.Explorative research, interviews, observations and literature, show that children often do not have a goal when prototyping, while experts use prototyping to find things out. Designing is an iterative process and prototyping allows you to iterate. At the moment children often only make one prototype at the end of their process for communication purposes.In this project three tools are (further) developed in order to stimulate the children to purposefully prototype and use prototyping to iterate in their design process. Due to COVID-19 all the tests in this project could not be performed in schools, since all schools were closed. Therefore, all the tools are tested at home. One of the developed tools is the Skill tool. The goal of this tool is to teach children necessary skills for prototyping. When children do not know how to make things, they will not be able to make meaningful prototypes in a design assignment. Children get a step-by-step instruction in text and image which they have to follow. In the last step the children need to apply the skill they just learned in a different context. This way children already have practised applying the skill in a different context before they have to create a specific prototype in a design assignment. Another tool is the Prototype-discussion-game of Nadine which is further developed. The goal of the game is to make children aware of the different goals prototypes can have. The Prototype-discussion-game is a card game in which groups of 3-4 children have to combine prototypes with goals. The children have five cards with different goals for prototypes on them and they need to combine one of the cards to a card with a prototype on it. The children need to give an argument for their choice and need to discuss which goal fits best with the prototype card. The tests in this project show that the game makes children aware of the different goals and is experienced as a nice and educational game to play. The last tool developed for children is the Iteration tool. The goal of this tool is to guide children through the necessary stages in order to iterate (see Figure 1). In order to iterate you first need to look forward and plan for the prototype you are about to make. Then you execute your plan and once it is finished, you look back and reflect on your progress and process. Lastly, you process your learnings and decide on what the next step would be before you enter the iteration model again by planning for your new prototype. The tool consists of multiple worksheets which are related to the stages of the iteration model. The tests show that using the Iteration tool helps the children to prototype purposefully. In this project there is also a tool developed for teachers. This Info booklet provides information about the role of prototyping in a design process. The booklet also provides examples and information about the tools developed in this project that can be used in class when prototyping. Teachers mentioned that this booklet is very informative and can be useful when preparing a design assignment.","design; prototyping; primary education","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The full extents of automation, resulting in a post-labour organisation of economy, envisions the return of the homo ludens and enhances play as fundamental base of the new society. The explosive decentralisation of production and distribution suddenly wipes out the city, the core centre of our consumerist lives, and promotes the return to the landscape, where new pillars of society are established. On this island of utopian playground, individuals are now fully capable of engendering the shape of their existence, clustering around the ludic elements and interacting with each other in playful activities, while machines take care of their fundamental needs. Among the elements, the Theatre represents the highest form of play and, therefore, the most essential component of public life. Facing the growing automated port and the perished city, the machine of the theatre is a bridge between land and sea, on the particular conditions of a site that constantly changes under the cyclical variations of the tide. In front of the spectacle of automation, what humans stare at is the activity that has been taken away from them, the agency of their actions. A new kind of theatricality is therefore needed. Since the demise of labour invests anyone with the possibility of becoming actors of the play, the sense of spectatorship itself is questioned. Far from the optical relation of the theatron (sight), that has so far embodied its cornerstone, the theatre has now to be subjected to another relation, suggested by the word drama (action), thus endowing the becoming performative of production. The Theatre of Automation is therefore a social endeavour, aiming at bringing the theatrical performance to the level of a collective form of life, where the role of the spectator merges with the one of the actor. In other terms, the machine of the theatre takes active part in the transformation of the site, unfolding and accelerating the artificial manipulation of the territory at the hand of technology. As an act of formation, first, of physical, cultural and ultimately of political nature, the Theatre measures the pace of changes, interpolating the urgency of human artifex with the rhythm of natural systems. When climate change and sea level rise will set the eventual limit of the Machine, interrupting its floating dance on the tides, the Theatre will come to its final act. Rich with the collective memory of the site, it will close its stage and set sail towards new destinations, bearing the paradigm of a new society, on the threshold between human, machine and nature.","automation; labour; play; theatre; machine interaction; automated landscape","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Transitional Territories","","70.644806, 23.633861"

Furthermore, the concept of sharing is introduced in the context of collaborative housing. The findings from literature and the collaborative housing projects are reviewed for their possibility to make urban living, and therefore cities, more sustainable. Sharing in collaborative housing serves as a catalyst for more sustainable cities, not only by its presence, but also as role model and experimental space for housing and urban development projects.","collaborative housing; sharing; urban development management; social, environmental, economic; sustainability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

This equilibrium is manifested in the Svalbard Free Zone, where all nations are free to make use of its resources, yet the presence of Norwegian population, and mining as raison d’etre of inhabitation, has acted as the entity of governance and ambassador for the best interests of the region. Nonetheless, with the ongoing end of coal mining in Svalbard, and the demise of Norwegian presence in the archipelago, the ‘free zone’ will face a state of uncertainty, vulnerable to the interests and disputes amongst the Arctic nations. As the ‘free zone’s’ uncertainty threatens the stability of the entire region, mining waste becomes a glimpse of hope towards a new form of political representation. While the Arctic communities face the havocs of such waste, its potential reuse makes it a novel resource and a chance for cooperation to counterbalance both its environmental effects and the political crisis that is about to unfold. Hence, the Embassy of Waste is a political manifesto that introduces the recollection and recycling of mining waste in the decaying mining community of Longyearbyen, Svalbard, in an attempt to become a novel tool towards the governance and self-sufficiency in the region.","Arctic; Svalbard; Norway; Crisis; Political; Waste; Mining; Free Zone","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","","78.216667, 15.633333"

The execution performance information of multi-inference batch jobs under combinations of loading and scheduling policies were determined under varying levels of constrained memory. These results were obtained using EdgeCaffe: a framework developed to execute Caffe networks on edge oriented devices.

We combine this with further research in the memory usage and swapping behaviour when performing these inference tasks. Using these results, we show that if the memory overhead becomes too large, loading and executing DNN layers in an interleaved manner provides significant gains in run time.

Since systems are not a product of nature, but rather made by humans they are called Artificial Intelligence (AI). The field of Side-Channel Attacks (SCA) has benefited from applying AI systems to their problems. Operations previously to resource-intensive to perform can now be executed using AI. Currently, the focus lies on exploring which parameters result in the optimum performance when classifying side-channel traces. But since this application has only recently been applied, there is much more research to be done. As of now, the literature claims that a reduction in the size of the architecture would result in an improvement of the explainability of the models used. However, this change in explainability has not been explicitly proven to hold for SCA models. This created a gap in knowledge. This paper aims to close this gap by exploring these assumptions. The goal is to explore if a reduction in complexity of SCA models leads to improved explainability. An experiment was conducted using two existing SCA architectures with a small and large complexity respectively. Using heatmaps, the explainability of these models were assessed to investigate the existence of patterns. The results show a difference in the consistency of the classification process, where the model with the lowest complexity could more consistently state why a certain classification was made. The results indicate that the explainability of a given SCA model can be improved by decreasing its complexity.","Heatmap, Visualization, Side-Channel Analysis, Explainability, Artificial Intelligence","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

(mentor); Nguyen, M.P. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Preclinical SPECT systems such as the U-SPECT have been able to achieve sub-half-millimetre spatial resolution with the use of cylindrical pinhole collimators. Utilising this type of collimator comes at the cost of a reduction in the total number of detection events that take place. In order to compensate for this either the activity of the radio pharmaceutical must be increased or the exposure time must be extended. Ideally the dose received by a patient or subject is kept to a minimum. The goal of this study was therefore to investigate the application of deep learning to SPECT imaging, specifically to improve low count images to resemble high count images in the projection domain. The projection domain was chosen over the image domain as projections are easily generated in large quantities, while reconstructed images take large amounts of time and computation to generate. A previous BSc Thesis study constructed a neural network (a Perceptual Loss Network) to this end, and it was concluded that the training set was too small and specific for the neural network to be more generally applicable. In this study therefore the training set of the neural network was expanded on with different phantom types such as Derenzo hot rod phantoms, Jaszczak phantoms and uniform phantoms of various shapes and sizes. Phantoms were simulated and measured using the EXIRAD-3D, and projection pairs (low and high count) were generated. Several network architecture improvements were also explored, such as processing the projection images from different detectors together using width concatenation or applying down sampling. Phantom test sets were used in order to determine whether expanding the training set and making adjustments such as width concatenation or applying down sampling had a positive effect on the neural network’s ability to improve varying SPECT projections. The projections of these test sets were improved by the neural networks and then reconstructed to 3D arrays in the image domain. The reconstructions would then be compared against the low count reconstruction as well as those produced by the original neural network. It became apparent that the neural networks do not perform well on very low count projections. It is assumed that this is because the projections have too little information contained within them for the neural networks to determine how to improve them. It may be possible to improve the neural networks by expanding the training set further with very low count projections. The quality of the reconstructions was determined quantitatively using the Contrast to Noise Ratio (CNR) for Derenzo type phantoms and uniformity for uniform type phantoms. Expanding the training set showed slight improvement in reconstruction CNR but was not considered significantly better. Applying width concatenation as well as expanding the training set seemed to improve results further, but the increase in resource requirements and computing time may not be justified for the marginal increase in CNR. Expanding the training set and applying down sampling proved to be very promising, increasing the CNR from anywhere between 0.35 to upwards of 0.75 in some cases. It also showed the most potential when it came to improving physically measured SPECT projections. The uniform phantoms had varying results. Very low count uniform cylinder phantoms were able to be improved by neural networks, but did not seem to benefit much from training on the expanded training set. It also seemed that trying to improve higher count uniform cylinder phantoms was difficult for the neural networks as there seem to be artifacts in the neural network reconstructions that decrease uniformity. It is recommended to further examine and improve the down sampling technique used in this study. It may also be interesting to combine the individual improvements, expanding the training set, using width concatenation and applying down sampling simultaneously, to see whether this can offer a better neural network for improving low count SPECT projections.","Deep Learning; Tomography; Machine Learning; Collimator; Neural Network; Phantom","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

Blocking microcirculatory oxygen supply bypressing the measurement probe on the skin allows the measurement of mitochondrialoxygen consumption (mitoVO2). Combining the static mitochondrial parameter(i.e. mitoPO2) and the dynamic mitochondrial parameter (i.e. mitoVO2) canprovide useful information about different aspects of the mitochondrialfunction in sepsis. However, it is not yet known how these mitochondrialparameters relate to the traditional systemic hemodynamic parameters, such aslactate and central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2). The first aim of thisstudy is to develop an analysis method to derive a measure for oxygenconsumption. The second aim of this study is to investigate the associationbetween the macrocirculation and the mitochondrial oxygenation, in particularmitoPO2 and mitoVO2, and to investigate the association between these twomitochondrial parameters in critically ill patients with sepsis.  Methods We performed a prospectiveobservational study in critically ill patients with suspicion of sepsis whowere admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of the Leiden Medical UniversityCenter. A patch containing 5-aminolevulinic (ALA) was placed on the anteriorchest wall of the patient to induce PpIX in the mitochondria. MitoPO2 wasmeasured by the oxygen-dependent fluorescence of mitochondrial PpIX. MitoVO2was determined by a dynamic mitoPO2 measurement (taking up a series of mitoPO2samples) while blocking the microcirculatory oxygen supply by applying pressurewith the measurement probe of the COMET monitor. MitoPO2 samples and bloodsamples were collected at the same predefined time points. A sigmoid functionwas used to fit the raw mitoPO2 signal of the dynamic mitoPO2 measurements. Amixed linear model was used to study the association between themacrocirculation and the mitochondrial oxygenation and the association betweenthe mitochondrial oxygenation and oxygen consumption. For this second model, wedivided the mitoPO2 levels into a low, medium and high mitoPO2 group. Results Atotal of 202 mitoPO2 measurements were performed in 41 critically ill patientswith sepsis. However, due to poor signal quality or insufficient fitperformance, 29 (14%) dynamic mitoPO2 measurements of different patients wereexcluded for further analysis. The results of this study showed that highermitoPO2 levels were significantly associated with lower lactate levels (β = -0.002744, p = 0.023). Moreover,mitoPO2 levels of the low mitoPO2 group were significantly associated withhigher mitoVO2 rates (β= 0.103822, p &lt; 0.001). Interestingly, mitoVO2 could not be induced in 31(15%) dynamic mitoPO2 measurements.   ConclusionThese results show that mitoPO2 levels are associated with lactate levels incritically ill patients with sepsis. Mitochondria with low oxygen levels are instress and will switch to anaerobic metabolism leading to lactate production.Moreover, these mitochondria have no reserves and will directly suffer from theacute cessation of the oxygen supply because these mitochondria consume thepresent oxygen faster compared to the mitochondria with higher mitoPO2 levels.","sepsis; mitochondria; mitochondrial oxygen tension; mitochondrial oxygen consumption; COMET","en","master thesis","","","","","","Related dataset 4TU.ResearchData https://doi.org/10.4121/uuid:b45c0507-b4ac-4da9-9880-9543f65804c1","","2022-08-01","","","","Technical Medicine","",""

Literature suggests that a holistic approach to further compacting a city means also integrating urban life qualities. This is currently lacking in Western European practice due to pragmatism, decentralisation and neo-liberal plot-led development. This while both concepts are crucial for sustainable cities. Therefore an optimization of their relation is needed in order to make better choices regarding densification. The result is a research-by-design that researches three distinct themes that are related to incorporating urban life. These are urban volumes, urban network and urban quality. The Dutch densification site ‘Central Innovation District’ in the Hague is used as a case study for applying the found design principles. In order to measure and predict the character of spaces, modern modes of measuring the city are used. Most prominently are the methods of space syntax angular integration, betweenness shortest path algorithms and the spacematrix GSI/FSI density ratios. Moreover, because of its focus on the human scale, 3D modelling is a crucial part of the research. The research concludes that the compact city and urban life can be integrated with eachother by following a set of principles for volumes, slow traffic networks and urban quality. What is needed is a broader overview of what attractors and pedestrian flows will emerge in a plan area. The associated centralities can then be used to shape the volumetric properties in such a way that significant densification can be achieved while urban life values like human scale stay assured.","Compact City; urban life; research by design; Urban design; Den Haag; Liveability; densification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","","52.077942, 4.328770"

The focus is on the flow structures around the inlet: the shape, the processes and the effect on sediment transport. Groynes have been replaced by longitudinal training walls in an 11-km long pilot project to optimize training of the river Waal in the Netherlands. These training walls have many advantages, making it worth exploring the performance of these new river training structures further. The inlet sill affects the discharge and sediment transport distribution and hence the morphological stability of the system. However, currently operational morphodynamic models cannot reliably compute the sediment flux from the main channel towards the sheltered side channel behind the longitudinal training wall. Therefore, the research aim was to develop a description of the sediment transport over the inlet sill of these longitudinal walls for implementation in two-dimensional depth-averaged river models. Since knowledge on the flow structures and validation data lacked, a series of flume experiments with the inlet area has been performed. This study shows that the blocking effect due to the sill that functions as obstacle is dominant at the upstream side of the inlet and helical flow due to curvature at the downstream side of the inlet are the dominant three-dimensional flow structures at the upstream side of the sill. Further research is needed for the identification of the shape of the flow structure due to blocking.","inlet sill; longitudinal training wall; flow patterns; flume experiments; river engineering; side weir; longitudinal training dam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

A method for analysing the hybrid passivity and finite-gain parameters of reset systems, that can be extended to other classes of nonlinear systems, is developed.

Implementing a circular economy is a challenge, but it proves to be significant given the rate at which resources are being consumed. Designing is one of the most important tasks to achieve the circular agenda. Highlighted by Augusto, Ribeiro and Hotza “considering that design process determines 80% of the environmental impact generate by a product or service, it is important to develop production processes able to support companies in the development of environmentally friendly products or services in a fast, reliable and pragmatic manner” (Augusto, Ribeiro, &amp; Hotza, 2019). The design process has a significant weight in the repercussions a project might have in the environment. Even though such design only refers to the architectonic or product design, the current research takes it a step further and also envisions strategic design. Reverse logistics is a vital component of the circular economy, as it would solve major loopholes and answer the questions that are currently being asked. Understanding the market and having a clearer picture of the behaviour of the materials is vital to assess the current situation and the solutions to be proposed. As mentioned by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, “thinking of systems” (Ellen MacArtur, 2017) is one of the pillars of circularity, which is what reverse logistics might address. The current research analyses the existing conditions, applied to a specific product, and then proposes a product and strategy redesign to facilitate a reverse logistics process. The general objective is to develop a framework that is useful to analyse current construction practices and that also helps identifying possible solutions, both at product and system level, facilitating the implementation of reverse logistics in the façade industry. At the end, a framework that organizes RL is proposed as well as a theoretical basis for DfRL, Design for Reverse Logistics, considering the steps needed to facilitate RL. An application of both formats is performed in a specific case, the CITG building facade panel, and an eventual design exercise is made. Universal panel solutions are proposed, a configuration that will allow interchangeability between products.","Circularity; Reverse logistics; Facade; Circular Design Strategies; Circularity assessment; Strategic framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","Facade ReLog","51.998954, 4.375506"

Although there are many kinds of research on the theoretical part of the participation process, it is not yet clear which factors are essential for meaningful participation, while becoming socially sustainable as well. Besides, this study focuses on mixed-use (re)developments, where the configuration of actors is more diverse. Therefore, the main question of this research is: How can a meaningful public participation process be achieved in mixed-use (re)developments and thereby become socially sustainable? To answer the main question, a literature study and empirical study are conducted on participation processes in mixed-use area development. Two extremes of participation processes are selected for the case-studies: top-down and bottom-up. They give insight into the relationship between participation and social sustainability, the social relation of the affected public and the preconditions for meaningful participation in mixed-use areas. The conclusion of this study indicates factors as “observed mutual help”, “improvement of the willingness of affected public” and “transparency” as crucial elements overlapping the communicative planning approaches, preconditions and social sustainability.","social sustainability; meaningful public participation; affected public; mixed-use (re)development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

This research is focused on the case study conducted at; the headquarter of a bank in the Netherlands, whereby the building users are criticizing the indoor comfort. Moreover, the building materials are end-of-life and the building is using a large amount of energy. The following research question is answered: ‘How can the indoor comfort be improved in a circular way, by creating an optimal floorplan including the interior and technical aspects for, the case study, one pilot floor of the headquarter of a bank in the Netherlands, while taking the energy consumption into account?’ Within this study different research methodologies are applied. The first research method is literature study and reference projects to gather knowledge about the indoor comfort with the following possible stressors; indoor air quality, thermal comfort, light and visual quality and acoustic comfort and circularity within the building environment. This information is derived from the Dutch regulations, certification rating systems, the case study and articles with the same theme. The literature study and reference projects are analysed to draw up criteria which the measurements and the design of the floorplan must meet. The second research method is material analyses to identify the materials and products which are used in the interior of the case study and how they can be improved to contribute to the indoor comfort, circularity and energy efficiency. The third research method is analysing the existing survey conducted in 2019 by the company Leesman. Analysing this survey can profile the building users and rate the satisfaction level of their workplace, activities, and facilities. The last research method is analysing the performed measurements. To study the current situation of the case study by testing the indoor comfort stressors on the criteria prepared with literature study and reference projects. These measurements are performed with 24 GreenMe cubes which records the indoor comfort values every ten minutes for three weeks, which resulted in 3024 measurement points within ten categories of the indoor comfort stressors. The research results are translated into a circular and indoor comfort framework and floorplan design including the interior and technical aspects. The analyses results show that it is desired to renovate the headquarter of the bank in the Netherlands. This conclusion is based on the following results of this study, first of all most of the materials and products are not demountable. Therefore it cannot be cleaned well and it pollutes the air. Moreover, it is not fully circular when only the materials are obtained sustainable, but cannot be reused or remanufactured after its first lifecycle, when they are not demountable or additives are added. Secondly, the building users are not satisfied with the indoor comfort within the headquarter of the bank. According to the satisfaction and importance level of the indoor comfort stressors. The indoor air was rated with 28,6% satisfaction and 71% importance, thermal comfort with 19,1% satisfaction and 80,7% importance and acoustic comfort with 13,9% satisfaction and 75,1% importance. These results show a low satisfaction level, while the building users rated these facilities as very important. Furthermore, the measurements results show that the indoor comfort stressors exceed the permitted values during office hours. The carbon dioxide concentration is measured 1,7% above 800 ppm, total volatile organic compounds is measured 0% above 120 ppm. In addition, the temperature under 20°C and above 24°C is measured 10,5% and the relative humidity under 30% and above 70% is measured 14,6%. Moreover, the light level under 500 lux is measured 72,2% and flicker light under 0Hz and above 50Hz is measured 2,6%. Lastly, the average background sound level above 57dB is measured 2% and average installation sound level above 35dB is 0%. These values needs to be improved according the program of requirements of the case study. The analyses emphasize the importance of the renovation of the case study. Measures are recommended to improve these values. The measures have been compiled on the basis of the circular and indoor comfort framework and the developed ‘Circular Indoor Comfort Step Strategy’. This strategy is as follows: 1) Improving the source 2) Improving situation without energy 3) Improving situation with renewable energy 4) Improving processes The measures are categorized in interior aspects, improving the building users activities, and technical aspects, improving the indoor comfort stressors. Every measure contributes to the environment and supports the wellbeing of the building users. One of these measures is a green wall, which is mostly composed from raw materials from biological cycles and contributes to the mental state of the building users. Moreover, it improves the indoor air by filtering the air, thermal comfort by increasing the relative humidity, and the acoustic comfort by absorbing background sound. This product is sold as ‘product as a service’, whereas the producer keeps the responsibility and reuse every part after its first lifecycle to new products with the existing raw materials. This research shows that a big difference can be made by performing small interventions to maintain the current situation and increase the existing value. Moreover, these interventions have a positive influence on the satisfaction level of the building users, meeting the Dutch and the bank’s regulations and rating certificates to renovate and create a healthy circular headquarter.","indoor comfort; circularity; offices","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

This research addresses speaker recognition from a new perspective, analysing the transcription of a fragment of speech with text analysis methods. Since text analysis is based on the transcription text only, it can be assumed independent from current automatic speaker recognition software. Hence, it would contribute significantly to the overall evidential value. The analysis is based on the frequencies of non-content, highly frequent words. We study whether information about the identity of the speaker is contained in the transcription of spoken text. The value of evidence is quantified using a score-based likelihood ratio. The score-based approach is chosen because in most forensic cases, there is not enough data from the suspect or of the disputed speech fragment available to model a robust feature-based likelihood ratio. Different methods to model the system from feature vector over score to likelihood ratio have been compared. As a baseline, a distance based method is used, where the score is the distance between the feature vectors. To improve upon this baseline, machine learning algorithms are implemented. The results from SVM and XGBoost are explored. As a third method a feature-based likelihood ratio is calculated and used as a score instead of as a direct likelihood ratio. With this method, both similarity and typicality are taken into account. The model is trained and tested on the FRIDA data set from the Netherlands Forensic Institute, consisting of Dutch conversations from a homogeneous group of 250 individuals. The performance of the likelihood ratio system is evaluated through computing the cost log-likelihood-ratio (Cllr), which is a measure for the accuracy and quality of the likelihood ratios, and the accuracy (A) of the likelihood ratios solely. The performance is also evaluated by inspecting the Tippett, empirical cross-entropy and pool-adjacent-violators plots. Different values for parameters used in the calculation of the likelihood ratios are investigated: the length of the sample, the number of frequent words (number of features) and the number of samples needed to train the model. The distance method showed a strong baseline, with good performance for large sample lengths. The SVM method outperformed the distance method for all parameter settings, with a peak performance of A=0.94 and Cllr=0.24. The XGBoost method showed promising results for smaller samples lengths, but a too large amount of data is needed to obtain good performance for larger sample lengths. The LR score method showed moderate results, but no improvements due to the necessity to estimate high-dimensional distributions. This thesis shows that information about the identity of the speaker is contained in transcriptions of speech. The complete process from data to likelihood ratio is constructed, where the likelihood ratio quantifies the evidential value of a transcribed speech fragment.","Speaker recognition; Likelihood ratio; Evidence evaluation; Text analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

The proposed strategy is to deploy a constellation in Polar or Equatorial Medium Earth Orbits (PECMEO) based on GNSS technology, which can be utilised as universal lunar navigation system: the Lunar Positioning System (LPS). The system will provide navigation for lunar missions on a more autonomous base and without limitations on the number of receivers. However, for the nine LPS navigation satellites to provide accurate positioning for lunar objects, it is crucial that the positions of the satellites themselves are estimated with high accuracy. This is because the ephemeris error of navigation satellites is a dominant factor in the position error of lunar objects. This thesis investigates the achievable position estimation accuracy for the LPS. The estimation is based on observations provided by GNSS constellations, but also by precise inter-satellite ranging within the constellation to enhance the position knowledge of the satellites significantly. This research focuses on the feasible position estimation of the LPS satellites and, specifically, what improvements can be achieved by including ISL. In order to correctly perform the estimation for the ISL systems, modified least-squares algorithms have been developed suitable for observations linked to multiple satellites and the simultaneous position estimation. The average 3-dimensional position error is 7.84 cm if no ISL is used. When ISL is added to the estimation, the average 3-dimensional position error reduces to 1.80 cm. Therefore, it is shown that significant improvements can be achieved for the positioning of the LPS satellites by using ISL.

One roots people to their contexts, tying them to its borders, properties and complex systems of relations; the other suggests the possibility for limit-less, unconditional wandering, an overwhelming experience of movement, in both space and time. This ancient tension between the anthropic process of colonizing Land – as the space of exploitation for collective survival – and the unseizable wilderness of the Sea – the realm of individual bravery – is the founding act of western societies. However, this delicate balance – or perpetual confrontation – is now endangered by its own premises. Land, as intrinsically limited, is reaching its maximum capacity: to ensure our survival and growth, the Sea is being identified as the new frontline for the rationalizing logics of territorialization. The Sea-as-a-territory is a political imposition: it is the tool for the collectivity – or the state – to enforce its hegemony on the sea-scape. Being the Sea a context-less space, dynamic, free from roots and limitations, the logics of colonization and exploitation are projected with even more harshness and strength. The Sea is facing the risk to lose its original role as memory of individual freedom – beyond the state; nevertheless, its exploitation is crucial to the survival of the collectivity and cannot be avoided. Therefore, the notion of the Sea-as-a-territory needs to be mitigated, in order to re-establish a coexistence of opposites, or at least to create awareness of the dualistic relation between the two paradigms of Land and Sea. The North Sea is urbanizing quickly and violently; such trends appear to be most visible in the Flemish Coast, a region which is deeply struggling to rule on its waters – groundwater and sea – while planning further expansions towards the sea, to protect the coast from storm waves. To meet the needs of the region – and of the collectivity – while mitigating the territorialization processes towards the Sea, the construction of an island is proposed, to be realized in four phases: the formation (I) or the act of imposing order with the definition of a protective wall; the accommodation (II) or the territorial reclamation using natural conditions; the production (III) or the desalination of seawater as act of exploitation; and the colonization (IV) or the human element, through the construction of a system of pools. The constant confrontation of these four elements – the wall, the landscape-in-formation, the desalination plant, the baths – constitutes the possibility for a different interpretation to the Sea-as-a-territory. Their relation – spatial and temporal – might become the trigger for a new consciousness on the mitigated narrative of territorialization, this time ruled by the intrinsic condition of ephemerality of the process itself. The island-as-an-outpost – or the island-machine – is a fortress; and fortresses are always doomed to surrender.","Territorialization; Island Condition; Edge; Sea-as-a-territory; Dichotomy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","","51.379865, 3.072556"

This research was initiated to get more insight into transporting renewable hydrogen carriers (RHCs) by ship, which is one of the transportation options. The research was conducted in three steps. First, a system description with a literature study was made to select suitable RHCs, based on the production, and the performance as a hydrogen carrier. Secondly, a basic model for three transportation cases was made. Thirdly, a more detailed model was created to evaluate different transportation options. The four most attractive RHCs to be shipped are the synthetically produced: methanol, liquefied natural gas, liquid hydrogen, and liquid ammonia. In the model, short and long term options are evaluated for the same, mild and strict regulations compared to today. The following statements can be made, based on the results of the second model: • Ammonia is best suited in a scenario with strict regulation compared to today. Ammonia has a noncarbon nature; therefore, it is the most promising option in the long term. • Methanol is best suited for small scale transportation in the short and long term, in which the same regulations are active. The storage of methanol on board of the ship is relatively simple and it has a relatively high hydrogen density. • LSNG is best suited for large scale transportation in which the same regulations are active. LSNG has the highest hydrogen density of the discussed RHCs. The advantage of SNG is that during the reconversion to hydrogen, extra hydrogen will be produced because of the added steam, during steam methane reforming (SMR). • Liquid hydrogen is from a shipping point of view not the most suited for the transport of hydrogen, due to its low volumetric density and complex storage. Shipping liquid hydrogen has the advantage that it reduces extra conversion steps in other parts of the supply chain. Shipping RHCs and using the carriers as a fuel is an option which involves higher cost compared to current fossil fuel options. This relatively high share of fuel expenses using RHCs will make efficient powertrains relatively more attractive because it enables higher fuel cost savings. The most attractive engine configurations are a two-stroke internal combustion engine with a mechanical powertrain and a SOFC with a battery in an electric powertrain. The last option is especially promising for the long term, because of the technologic developments and increasing regulations in shipping. Overall the results indicate that shipping NH3 and using the carrier as a fuel is the most promising option for the transport of RHCs by ship. This research and constructed models can be used as a tool to evaluate different transportation options. However, used values are based on various sources and their corresponding assumptions, which can change significantly in the future.","Green hydrogen; Techno-economic analysis; Renewable Energy; Renewable Hydrogen Carriers; Alternative fuels; Green Ammonia; Green Methanol; Shipping; Synthetic natural gas","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

This is even more prominent in recent years as sports become more widely available o the mass population. Reducing the chances of athletes experiencing injuries not allows them to maintain optimal performance during training and competition but is also psychological benefits for the athletes. Amsterdam UMC has gathered weekly OSTRC data from 19 Waterpolo athletes over 109 weeks. By using this data, it is possible to build a model that can provide an indication of possible injury risks thus helping athletes in controlling possible injuries. Traditionally, statistical models are used for this kind of analysis. However, this often requires large amount of time and a-priori knowledge. Hence an injury risk classifier method based on longitudinal data (OSTRC) and machine learning algorithm was proposed in this study. The chosen ML algorithms for this study are ANN, LSTM, and Random Forrest. To investigate the importance of time dependency between data entries, sliding window, and forward chaining are used during data processing. All models trained with minimally processed data, sliding window data, and forward chaining data to investigate the impact of time dependency on model accuracy. The OSTRC data set is pre-processed, and SW and FC methods are applied. Data is then split into training and testing data set. Metric used to assess model performances are accuracy and confusion matrix. The results of this study show that both RF-SW and LSTM-SW produced an accuracy of 92.17% and 91.67% respectively. Accuracy of ANN on training data indicates adequate performance, but the confusion matrix indicates poor performance. Confusion of RF-SW and LSTM-SW show small variation due to differences in the test data set, which can be mitigated as more data are available. Inconclusion, the high level of accuracy from both RF-SW and LSTM-SW proves that it can be used to provide insight to athletes, helping them to reduce the chances of injury.","Machine Learning; Longitudinal Data; Injury Risk; Time dependency; Waterpolo; Prediction model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","CAS Project",""

I believe it can be easily adapted by communities of poor regions. Those communities struggle with poor quality water for living which is the cause of many deaths. To change it, a solar-based system is proposed to purify any kind of input water. Widely known simple solar stills are typically designed as single units serving only individuals, moreover, its efficiency is usually low. Therefore, an improved solar still concept is adapted in this research, and its principles are used in the roof system to produce water for the basic living needs of 50 people daily. Providing clean water to rural communities without access to the national grid is crucial and the most important aspect of this project. Based on the research elaborated in Phase I of this report, the most adequate to both climate and the economic-social situation prevailing in Beira, way to provide water is to purify raw water on-site using the energy of the sun. This solution not only does not require the construction of additional infrastructure outside the site but has a chance to be developed and multiplied in the least urbanized areas - often inhabited by a significant part of the region’s population. Due to the situation in the region, the use of only low-tech solutions and very cheap materials for the entire project is very important.

Constructing a city model with 3D buildings requires elevation data (such as LiDAR or Digital Terrain Models), but unfortunately, data of sufficient quality is often unavailable. This thesis focuses on the use of machine learning methods to estimate the height of building footprints and thus bypassing the use of elevation data completely. Three different methods are tested and compared: Random Forest Regression (RFR), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), and Support Vector Regression (SVR). A case study is performed for the conterminous United States of America (USA) because of its availability of a nation-wide building dataset, containing roughly 125 million building footprints. The high diversity in urban layouts is considered, where a distinction is made between Central Business Districts (CBDs) in cities and all other regions (e.g. suburbs and rural areas). All building footprints are characterised by nine features derived from their geometry, which are then used (in several combinations) in the model training and predicting stages. Furthermore, the influence of additional features – including census and cadastral data – on the results of the building height predictions is analysed for the city of Denver, Colorado. The experiments show that it is feasible to predict the height for all buildings in the conterminous USA in under 6 minutes. Both the MLR and SVR method even accomplish it in under 30 seconds. The height prediction results show that the different prediction models struggle to accurately estimate the height for buildings in CBDs. The lowest achieved Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is 31.81m, whereas for the suburban and rural areas it is 1.41m. Adding additional, non-geometric features (e.g. census data) to the prediction models for one city (Denver) proved to be successful; the RFR method reduced its MAE from 1.35m to 0.96m for the suburbs, achieving sub-metre accuracy. The CBDs, however, are still problematic with an MAE of 16.87m. These results show that for the suburban and rural areas, the accuracy recommendations from the CityGML specifications for LOD1 models can be met (5m limit). For the CBDs, improvement is required. The experiments also proved that the proposed methodology can be used to generate 3D city models of very large datasets if no elevation data is available. Moreover, the method is, in theory, generic enough to be applied outside the USA.","Machine learning; 3D city model; Building height inference; Random forest regression; Support vector regression; Multiple linear regression; United States of America (USA)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

Deep learning algorithms called convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown to outperform traditional computer vision and machine learning approaches in tackling semantic segmentation tasks. Furthermore, addition of height information (Z) to aerial imagery (RGB) is believed to improve segmentation results. However, discussion remains on the following: to what extent height information adds value; the best way to combine RGB information with height information; and what type of height information can best be used. This study aims to answer these questions. In this research work, the CNN architectures FCN-8s, SegNet, U-Net and FuseNet-SF5 are trained to semantically segment 10 cm resolution true ortho imagery of Haarlem, potentially augmented with height information. The outputted topographic maps contain the classes building, road, water and other. Experiments are conducted that allow for the comparison of 1) models trained on RGB and on RGB-Z, 2) models combining RGB and height information through data fusion and through data stacking, and 3) models trained using different types of absolute and relative height approaches. Performances are compared based on scores on the performance measure (mean) intersection over union (IoU) and through visual assessment of outputted prediction maps. The results indicated that on average segmentation performance improves by approximately 1 percent when absolute height information is added. The class building showed to benefit the most from the addition of height information. Furthermore, extracting features from height information in a separate encoder and fusing these into RGB feature maps, led to a higher overall segmentation quality than when height information is provided as a stacked extra band and processed in the same encoder as the RGB information. Finally, models using relative height delivered a higher quality segmentation than when absolute height approaches were used, especially for large objects. The best performing model; FuseNet-SF5 trained on RGB imagery and pixel-level, relative height, retrieved a mean IoU of 0.8427 and IoUs of 0.8744, 0.7865, 0.9131 and 0.7966 for the classes building, road, water and other respectively. This model was able to correctly classify over 90% of the pixels of 67% of all the objects present in the ground truth. Overall, this study showed that, when considering semantic segmentation of aerial RGB imagery, 1) height information can improve segmentation results, 2) adding height information through data fusion can result in a higher segmentation quality than when data stacking is used, and 3) providing relative height to a network, rather than absolute height, can improve semantic segmentation quality.","Semantic segmentation; Remotely sensed data; Topographic maps; CNN; RGB-Z; Aerial imagery; DSM; Deep learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

Furthermore, as turbine size and rated power increase, bearings display an enhanced tendency to fail. Unscheduled bearing replacement at sea is a complex, costly, weather-dependent and time-consuming operation that results in high turbine downtimes. Market trends show an increase in turbine rated capacity and a noticeable shift towards deeper waters and far-off remote sites which further delays and complicates unscheduled maintenance activities and aggravates the cost penalties of idle turbines. Detecting an incipient bearing fault (diagnosis task) is therefore a major aspect to evaluate drivetrain and overall wind turbine reliability. Moreover, estimating the remaining useful life of bearings and predicting their operational state in the future (prognosis task) can achieve a breakthrough in optimising maintenance programs, improve wind farm operation and decrease wind turbine downtime which can bring about a significant cost reduction. The purpose of this work is to investigate the health monitoring and prognostics possibilities of drivetrain bearings in a floating spar-buoy offshore wind turbine. The drivetrain concept considered in this work is based on DTU’s 10-MW reference wind turbine.

This research aims to search for a way to ensure indoor thermal comfort in a passive way without worsening the UHI-effect. This is done by creating an alternative design for a case study that is planned in a Dutch urban center and measuring its impact on the urban microclimate and its indoor thermal comfort performance in a future climate scenario. The alternative design is put together by designing and testing different compositions of passive measures found in the existing literature. These passive measures compositions are then analyzed by software simulation to assess their performance and the effect they may have on the urban microclimate and in turn what this changed urban microclimate means for the implementation of the passive measures. The final result is a building design that not only ensures indoor thermal comfort in current and future climate scenarios but also makes its surroundings more comfortable which in turn results into more manageable microclimate.

The long history with water also means there are many opportunities (ecology, aesthetic, and cultural heritage) in the area, but the difficulty is how to weave together ecological function and spatial experience in landscape design. So, the second aim of this study is to find ways to communicate ecological function through spatial design.<br/><br/>Through exploring the history with water over time, three categories of local historical water management approaches are summarized and they are adjusted to different water retention and ecological principles to formulate design strategies involving stream re-naturalisation, water retention, and water purification.

The incidence of the disease has rapidly grown over the last decade. There is no specific course of medication to treat dengue. But determining the intensity of fluid leakage is essential in managing the progression of the disease. Bioimpedance technology is an inviting tool for safe, inexpensive and non-invasive monitoring of body fluids. However existing systems are not attractive for continuous and long term assessments. In addition the system performance is also susceptible to variations in posture and motion related artifacts. This work presents a motion aware bioimpedance measurement system (AMBICA) for fluid monitoring using AD5940 and accelerometers to overcome the mentioned limitations. The primary aim of this thesis is to characterize the performance of the developed device with a commercial device(BIACorpus). Additionally a framework to detect the variation in posture and motion is presented.Bioimpedance and movement data was collected from 14 healthy volunteers. The impedance values measured by the device showed high correlation (r&gt;0.98) while the reactance values showed weak correlation (0.10 &lt; r &lt; 0.67). The bias and limits of agreement estimated for impedance measurements are -4.50_13.01 and [21.0,-30.0] respectively. The estimated bias and limits of agreement for reactance measurements are 14.84_19.64, the limits of agreement are [53.36,-23.68]. The precision scores indicated a higher variability in measurements for BIACorpus device compared to AMBICA. The proposed framework was able to identify the active and inactive periods and gross postures like supine, sitting and standing with an accuracy of &gt;95% and 94.6% respectively. The results in this study showed that the impedance and reactance values followed a typical trend agreeable with bioimpedance measurements. However, the values measured by AMBICA agree more closely with BIACorpus for impedance measurements than for reactance measurements. Inconsistencies are observed for both devices and they are attributed to parasitics and imbalance of interface impedances at the inputs of the AD5940. Due to the difference in technologies used, the values from the devices do not measure the exact same values. Therefore values above or below the reference values may still have clinical significance. AMBICA can be used in the future for fluid assessments in dengue affected subjects. Furthermore motion related information gathered using the framework proposed can be further incorporated to develop contextual bioimpedance monitoring applications.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-12-24","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

The aim of this research is to find the difference in challenges to conversion of tall office buildings, focused on the Randstad in the Netherlands. This research will be carried out in two parts. The first part focuses on the past research, by carrying out a literature study consisting of challenges and solutions to conversion. The second part studies cases in the Randstad, comparing different cases to find the challenges to conversion of tall office buildings to housing. Concluding this research, there are not neccessarily new or other challenges in the transformation of tall buildings as opposed to the transformation of buildings that are not classified as tall. How- ever, some challenges, especially those on technical level, can have a higher impact on the transformation of tall buildings. This report contains the problem statement and context, together with the literature study, methodology, empirical findings and conclusion.","Adaptive reuse; Conversion; Transformation; Office buildings; Structural vacancy; Housing shortage; Tall buildings; Challenges; Opportunities; Solutions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

Therefore more high tech equipment on the construction site is introduced, while also opting for more sustainable materials. These interventions are based in the city center of Rotterdam, on parasitic like empty building plots. By looking at the target group, tiny houses are suited best for this particular case (this target group). A mobile 3D printer is used to print buildings in-situ, with a sustainable construction material called basalt fiber reinforced polylactic acid. This material is made from renewable and natural sources and can be used in a circular material economy, while it can still be separated to its original raw materials. The design of the building is completely parametrically, meaning this procedure can be used for multiple small locations within the city, but can also be applied to other cities.

This project was created with the recently founded Reinier Haga Orthopedic CenterLiterature and Field studiesTo understand the problem and identify solutions, research studies were conducted.A literature study identified potentials solutions, tt also provided insights into the condition of knee arthrosis and how healthcare is currently organised.Two field studies were also done. The first were interning sessions that provided additional knowledge on the organisation of the healthcare.The second were interviews with patients and treatment providers which, resulted in an understanding of what patients and medical professionals miss in the organisation of the care trajectory.Design goalFrom the literature and field studies came that a cause for the problem is the interaction between stakeholders. Information exchange between the medical professionals was chosen as the design problem. As a lack of information about a patient as a whole explains the ill fitting care trajectories. The missing information was identified as implicit contextual patient information. This often left out of the referral and can not be used when making the treatment decision. Based on the above, a design goal was formulated:Enabling easier sharing of contextual patient information between the GP and the OS in the initial referralCreative processA co-evolutionary creative process was used to create a solution. This was heavily influenced by the COVID-19 outbreak, resulting in more validations with the client rather than large stakeholder sessions.CICSThe result is the Contextual Information Communication System (CICS). CICS consists of the Contextual Sharing Tool (CST) and the requirements for its functioning.The CST is a visual tool that enables fast capture and review of contextual patient information by the GP. The GP uses it by setting 5 points for the respective information rubrics along an axis that indicates the significance of that rubric for a patient.This CST gets shared with the orthopedic surgeon, together with the textual referral. It does not provide him with the detailed information, but with an overview of significant information rubrics. The surgeon uses this impression to direct their anamnesis during patient consults. If the consult has not resulted in an explanation of the CST, there is an opportunity to clarify it with the patient’s GP in a conversation. EvaluationEvaluation was done, to validate the design. From this evaluation came that the CICS did indeed meet the design goal.Points of improvement were also identified among which the usability of the current visual design and the need for education on how CICS should be used.Recommendations &amp; Implementation roadmapTo provide the orthopedic center the next steps in CICS development, a recommended implementation roadmap was created. This roadmap shows the steps necessary to reach three defined horizons:The start of a CICS pilotFull CICS implementation in the knee arthrosis trajectoryExpansion of CICS to other care trajectories.","Healthcare Design; Healthcare; Communication; Information sharing; Value based health care; Networked care; Reinier Haga Orthopedisch Centrum","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Driven by the need, obligation, desire or simply possibility to store a growing amount of both - physical objects and digital data, and encouraged with a constantly increasing capacity of digital media storage - we keep on gathering more. Often unconsciously or with little curation of the collected content, we keep on creating a limitless cloud archive, that has an overwhelming physical presence that takes over hectare after hectare of land. Huge, anonymous, dark and hot space, placed in a remote location – that is a typical data centre. Blending into the neighbouring storage halls is easily omitted and stays hidden from the public sight. Data storage came a long way from the representative architecture of banks, archives and city halls to a unit defined storage facility. Therefore, one may say that data centre is a continuation of the typology of storing and archiving. And a storage type that emerges is an opaque container defined by the size of a stored unit - server. These content defined buildings, technical as they are, allow for almost no human presence, but do potentially manage through their sheer size to organize and control the context they inhabit, the territory. One cannot underestimate their urban impact. Current trends in technology, among others, the Internet of Things and a growing amount of latency dependent applications will generate a need to introduce data into the cities. That gives a unique opportunity to redefine existing data centre typology. Even though data is already fully integrated and present in our lives, we rarely acknowledge it. What is more, due to a lack of understanding of data flows we are often excluded from the discussion on the degree of its presence in our lives or surveillance. The proposed project, is a gesture that brings data, technology, citizens and urban context together, emphasizing interconnections and interdependence of all aforementioned. This way introducing one of the most significant elements of our infrastructure physically into the culture, giving digital data a physical weight and interface.

Over the years, the research community has developed several automated approaches to ease debugging. Among those approaches, search-based crash reproduction, which tries to generate a test case capable of reproducing a given crash to make it observable to the developers, solely based on the stack trace included in the crash report. We believe that this makes crash reproduction the perfect candidate to achieve end-to-end crash fault localization. In this thesis, we explore and empirically evaluate the usage of search-based crash reproduction combined with spectrum-based fault localization on 50 real-world crashes. Starting from a crash report, we generate crash-reproducing test cases and use them in conjunction with the existing or an automatically generated unit test suite as input for spectrum-based fault localization. Our results show that, although, hand-written test cases remain the most efficient in the general scenario, automatically generated crash-reproducing test cases still reduce the number of statements to be investigated by developers. Additionally, when considering the best-case scenario where only crash-reproducing test cases covering the fault are evaluated, we observe no statistically significant difference between the accuracy of fault localization when using hand-written or automatically generated test cases. Our results confirm the feasibility of end-to-end automated crash fault localization. The results also identify new challenges for both automated test case generation and fault localization, as well as when they are combined.","Search-Based Crash Reproduction; Automated Fault Localization; Search-based Software Engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The Internet has grown from a few interconnections of trusted parties to an incredibly large network with many different use cases. While the Internet grew, threats emerged as well. Although there are many different threats on the Internet, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are a threat that keeps rising in the threat landscape. The asymmetry between adversaries and defenders is enormous - whereas DDoS attack can be started for less than 5$, DDoS prevention takes up the majority of operational cost in data centers and damages are in the billions. Thus, it is of vital importance that more effective methods of DDoS prevention are found and implemented to improve defensive effectiveness and to reduce costs. DDoS attacks consist of various types, but the largest share of DDoS attacks are of the subtype Distributed Reflected Denial of Service (DRDoS) attacks. Adversaries that execute DRDoS attacks use vulnerable servers to create incredibly large attacks and to stay anonymous. Previous work by Rossow showed us which vulnerable services are typically used for these DRDoS attacks, and how well these vulnerable services are exploitable for these attacks. However, we do not know why an adversary uses one vulnerable service but not another. Thus, this work fills that research gap by researching how adversaries react to differently configured vulnerable services, using a large scale experiment. This work shows that the amplification factor of a honeypot is a primary factor that determines whether an adversary will use a vulnerable server in an attack or not. This work also shows that attackers do not distinguish between regular vulnerable servers and their obvious honeypot counterparts. Furthermore, the response time of a system is of no influence, and some honeypots with packet loss attract fewer adversaries. Additionally, different attacks can be detected while using different service providers and geographical locations for honeypot deployment. Finally, the MD-honeypot framework that was developed for this research may be further developed into fully-fledged DRDoS mitigation software.","ddos; drdos; reflection attacks; distributed denial of service; distributed reflected denial of service; cyber-attacks; cybersecurity; cybercrime; Cyber Threat Intelligence; honeypot","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-04-01","","","","Computer Science","",""

As the popularity of these devices continues to grow, so does the discussions around their potential dangers. From reports of children developing aggressive behaviours to studies on the perpetuation of sexist stereotypes, our interactions with smart speakers are accompanied by a series of risks. This project aims to propose a repertoire of meaningful voice interactions that mitigate those impacts and foster well-being instead. To achieve this, a categorisation of seven dangers of voice interactions was created based on literature review: impoliteness, aggressiveness, gender stereotyping, exposure, shallow mindedness, emotional dependency and social detachment. Each danger was analysed to define which of the fundamental human needs of the Self-Determination Theory they harm: autonomy, competence and relatedness. This theory proposes that people experience well-being when these three needs are satisfied. Also, a phase of exploratory research was conducted, combining established research methods such as user interviews with emerging More-Than-Human design approaches in the form of Thing Ethnography. The findings inspired the ideation phase, where more than 70 ideas were created to prevent the dangers of smart speakers. These ideas were clustered, filtered and remotely tested with participants who expressed their perceptions and examined the potential impact on the fundamental human needs. The resulting data revealed the interaction concepts perceived as most meaningful, which served as the basis for the final repertoire of voice interactions. The repertoire includes design guidelines, traps to avoid, in-depth analysis and reflective questions to guide ideation. Its goal is to serve as a tool for designers and researchers involved in voice-related projects to foster well-being by designing more humane voice interactions. It was designed to be shared as an online platform and a booklet, but its content could take various forms beyond those.","Smart Speakers; Voice Assistants; Well-being; Voice Technology; Voice Interactions; Design for Emotion; Thing Ethnography; More-than-human design; Conversational Agents","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

In a multiple damage occurrences scenario, i.e. several aircraft competing for limited resources, differences have been found. While TOPSIS and VIKOR generate similar recommendations, WSM yields different results. Furthermore, it was found that VIKOR is not suited for the used heuristic approach, as it results in an ambiguous performance score of several solutions relative to each other. Its sensitivity makes its use in an operational environment questionable, as small changes easily lead to a different recommendation. Looking at the frequent use of a DSS in an operational environment as opposed to a strategic one, WSM is the best choice.

In order to select these locations first the weakspots need to be located. Weak spots are areas that do not have enough (proper) waste managementservices. Since Mexico does not have a national solid waste information system, a method to locate theseweak spots needs to be developed. With the use of the weak spots a method can be developed to select the potential locations for sanitary landfills that also takes the social, economical and legal constraintsinto account. The following research question is formulated: What are the weak spots in the current waste infrastructure network in Mexico and, based on this, where should strategic investment be madeto improve waste disposal? By answering this question, information will be provided on the issues withthe management of waste in Mexico with a focus on the areas of the weak spots and the locations where investment can be made to develop new sanitary landfills.<br/><br/>To detect the weak spots, a set of factors of different scenarios were developed, scored, overlaid, and visualised in maps. Regions that have the lowest score were detected as weak spots. To select the potential locations for investment in new sanitary landfills a spatial decision support system (SDSS) was developed and implemented as a QGIS plugin. The weak spots that corresponded to urban areas were used for analysis in the SDSS. This is due to the fact that it is more economically beneficial to construct sanitary landfills in urban areas.<br/><br/>The weak spot analysis showed that the southern region of Mexico, especially the state of Oaxaca, hadthe highest deficiencies in waste infrastructure. With the output from the QGIS SDSS plugin we are able to determine potential areas for new sanitary landfills in an automated manner.<br/><br/>This research has resulted in the visualisation of the weak spots in the Mexican waste infrastructure and the selection of potential locations where investment can be made for the construction of new sanitary landfills. The approach for locating the weak spots of the waste infrastructure can be used to find the weak spots in other types of infrastructure on a state and country scale in Mexico. The QGIS SDSS plugin could also be used to locate sanitary landfills in Mexico that violate the standards and regulations. The approach used to develop methods to detect the weak spots in the waste infrastructure and select potential locations for investment into new sanitary landfills could be used as a model for other countries to develop their specific approaches.","waste management; Mexico; open dumps; sanitary landfills; spatial decision support system; QGIS plugin","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","Synthesis Project 2020",""

(mentor); Posthuma, Andrys (mentor); van Grunsven, Frans (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The rising demand for minerals and metals and the depletion of land-based resources has created a renewed interest in the extraction of resources from the deep ocean, i.g., deep sea mining. This research focuses on the mining of manganese nodules, these are potato-shaped objects, 5-10cm in size, composed of metals half buried in the seafloor. A Seafloor Mining Tool (SMT) is used to mine the nodules, however, during mining besides the nodules, also the sediment around the nodules is collected. This sediment is separated in the SMT and discharged through a horizontal diffuser located at the rear of the SMT, thereby creating a sediment plume. The sediment plume needs to be reduced for environmental, economic and legal reasons. The sediment plume causes changes in the sediment characteristics, clogging of pores of suspension feeding organisms and burying of the benthic fauna. The plume will spread in all directions, thereby burying still to be collected nodules and reducing the pick-up efficiency, making the process inefficient from an economical perspective. Legal issues will arise when the discharged sediment plume spreads to other exploration areas owned by other parties or to environmentally protected areas. The aim of this research is to investigate the influence of the choice of diffuser height on the reduction of the sediment plume. To achieve this goal a Matlab model was made and small-scale experiments in the laboratory of Dredging Engineering were done. The Matlab model is based on the JETLAG model, described in 'Jets and Plumes' by Lee and Chu (2003), and is a Lagrangian model predicting the centerline trajectory of the plume. The small-scale experiments provide insight in the behaviour of the horizontal discharge plume at different diffuser heights and generate measurements to validate the model. A diffuser designed specifically for these experiments is produced and the height and flow velocity are differed. The experiments consist of visualization experiments, capturing top view and side view images of the buoyant jet, and experiments measuring the velocity and bottom concentration at different locations. The velocity profiles, sediment concentration, deposition pattern and impingement range are compared and analysed. The combined results from the model and the experiments show that the start of the impingement range increases with increasing diffuser height. Furthermore, a lower diffuser height increases the amount of bottom deposition near the diffuser outlet. The measured velocity profiles, near bottom concentration and impingement range are in agreement with this observation. The measured near bottom velocities at 15D from the diffuser outlet are approximately 0.1 and 0.2m/s, depending on the discharge velocity, both have the potential of resuspending settled sediment. This research suggests that the spreading of the plume can be reduced by the choice of diffuser height above the seafloor. Based on the diffuser heights tested in this research a diffuser height of 100mm is recommended. Since a higher diffuser decreases the amount of particles settling close to the source and a lower diffuser increases the potential for erosion. This research has shown that up to a distance of 15D from the diffuser, the near bottom velocities are large enough to cause erosion. Research into the near bottom velocity decay and magnitude further away from the source, inside the turbidity current, is necessary as well to understand the full spreading behaviour and the potential for erosion. Furthermore it is recommended to do research into spreading behaviour of finer particles, especially the behaviour of the actual deep sea sediment in combination with salt water causing flocculation. Moreover, research into the influence of the forward motion of the SMT is recommended since the SMT will create a wake that will influence the spreading behaviour of the plume. Research into the potential creation of a recirculation region caused by the limited entrainment at the rear of the SMT is recommended as well, this can be done by aligning the diffuser outlet with a screen.","Deep Sea Mining; Plume; Horizontal plume; Small-scale experiments","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-06-23","","","","","",""

In software engineering (SE), it might help in improving team composition through a combination of personalities within a team, and it could help explain work preferences and work satisfaction. Earlier studies in the field of software engineering have focused on extracting personality from developers with the use of questionnaires and automatic tools such as psycholinguistic tests. Psycholinguistic tests infer personality based on the words people use. As taking questionnaires is time-consuming, the interest in automated tools has grown. However, there is a lack of studies comparing different psycholinguistic models on actual SE data to validate to what extent these tools apply to software engineering. In this study, we compare two well-established academical models proposed by Yarkoni and Golbeck et al. and the popular industrial model Personality Insights by IBM. We use the three models to infer personality from comments on open-source projects on GitHub and compare the found scores to a ground-truth obtained through a questionnaire among software developers. In this study, we establish a baseline and compare three models on their performance to this baseline. We show three methods to perform almost equally when mean-centered, indicating the three methods may work on different scales. We show log-transformations to improve LIWC category scores found by reducing the effect of outliers and give recommendations for thirteen preprocessing steps to improve the inference on SE data. We found 600 to 1200 words per person to provide sufficient accuracy while remaining resource-aware and recommend a minimum of a hundred words for all three methods. Furthermore, we do not find enough evidence for discrimination by all three methods for people proficient in English compared to those who found themselves non-proficient in English. We find existing psycholinguistic models to be most useful for software engineering when used on a group or team level. When used on an individual level, one should take into account possible inaccuracies and consider the potentially harmful impact the misuse or misinterpretation of scores may have on an individual.","Software Engineering; personality inference; psycholinguistic models","en","master thesis","","","","","","Related dataset 4TU.ResearchData http://doi.org/10.4121/uuid:6b648676-26f4-4eb1-89dc-050810909b3b","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

Since Gaudium’s foundation it worked together with Kvadrat, which holds today the top position in Europe’s textiles market. The long-standing partnership between the Danish company and Gaudium is growing closer. Kvadrat announced that its stake in the company will increase from 10% to 87%. However, the current state of the building complexes of Gaudium cannot answer this need of Kvadrat. This has to do with on one hand sustainability, Kvadrat strives for ‘green’ solutions in terms of energy use and also comfort in their working environments. However, there is no such thing as a thermal mass or renewable energy within the current state of Gaudium’s building ensemble. Besides, for a long period there was a lot of uncertainty about the future use of this building complex. Consequently, no structural investments were taken for the management and maintenance of the ensemble. In short, there might be a major chance that the Danish textile company decides to continue with Gaudium elsewhere because of the current state of its building complex. Consequently, Winterswijk could lose a part of its identity. The craft of weaving played a role since the initiation of the settlement. Thus the aim of this design project is to stimulate all of the interested parties to start conversations about this matter before it's too late.

Urban informality emerges as the answer to a lack of opportunities and spatial offers, evidencing the inability of the existing planning structures to embody and decode the complex conditions, dynamics, and vulnerability gradients that these environments entail. Bogotá’s upgrading program, despite being crucial instrument in the transformation of informal areas, has proven to be insufficient to overcome the fragmentation between formal and informal urban dynamics, in which the generic and rigid approach has impeded the achievement of a structural change and local empowerment in a long term perspective. The thesis proposes an alternative assessment and planning framework, as an opportunity to improve the current planning methods within a new long term perspective, that embraces and increases the adaptive capacity of the diverse vulnerable groups and systemic interrelations in the current structures of Bogotá. This, by redefining the current overview of risk and to vulnerability, as potential tools to improve the local conditions from a co-evolutionary socio-ecological approach. The proposed Framework is therefore not a definitive and static project. In turn, it is a dynamic tool to reveal the diverse challenges but also the amount of endogenous opportunities in the local informal environments. By redefining the role of nature and the role of formal and informal actors as co-agents of change in the development process, the proposed model aims to transform the segregated dynamics of the city, empower the local and most neglected communities, reinforce bottom-up approaches and provide alternative possibilities for more resilient socio-ecological systems that in turn are prepared to an uncertain future.","Adaptive planning; informal urbanization; socio-ecological resilience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Complex Cities","","4.60971, -74.08175"

Approximately ninety-one per cent of the build environment was damaged. This made the existing housing shortage, caused by a growing population, even more significant. Now, three years later, the residential area of Philipsburg is mostly deserted. With the departure of its residents, the sense of community in the neighbourhood also vanished. Throughout history the island is connected to natural disasters. To rebuild after a natural disaster, self-building was commonly used within the local building culture. However, this tradition disappeared in the last three decades. This research is looking into opportunities to reintroduce a form of organized self-help housing (OSHH), to contribute to the answer against the housing shortage and turn this district of Philipsburg into a lively neighbourhood again. Within OSHH the community have to build themselves, so residents need to have time to realize the project. Unfortunately, this is not the way things are done on the island, so the project will not be accomplished. A possible solution is found in the bottom-up approach of a Collective Private Commissioning (CPO). The design objective during this project is to examine whether urban densification is an opportunity to meet the demand for extra housing. This is often accompanied by extra paved surface which can provoke the heat island effect. Due to the hot climate and the urbanization, residents prefer to stay in their homes with the air-conditioning on. Within this project the goal is to reduce heat accumulation and stimulate the outdoor life. This combination can reintroduce and encourage the social interaction and strengthen the sense of community on Philipsburg.","Caribbean; Sint Maarten; Philipsburg; Natural Disasters; Housing Shortage; Self-Help Housing (SHH); Traditional domestic architecture; Contemporary domestic architecture; Balloon Frame System; Urban Densification; Heat Island Effect; Reduction Of Heat Accumulation; Passive cooling; Vegetation; Social Cohesion; Future Resilient Community","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It had been postulated in media in reports (De Ingenieur, 2014; „MIRT-verkenning Grevelingen”, 2012; Slootjes et al., 2010; Slootjes, 2013; Lammers, 2014) that because of this, large pumping stations are required in the Rhine-Meuse delta in the Netherlands. To investigate this postulation, a simulation model in Python was created that describes the Rhine- Meuse delta as four separate water basins with flow exchanges and boundary conditions (astronomical tides and river inflow). From this simulation model it was concluded that every 86–137 years, flood flow rates of the rivers are such, that the design maximum water level is compromised. The acceptable flooding risk is only once every 2.000 years, so this situation is unacceptable. Dutch engineer answered to the postulation and invented a high-capacity pump called the „Deltapump”, with a capacity ranging 170–200 m3s-1. Moreover, a conceptual design for a pumping station was created. After a conceptual design creation, verification calculations and a cost-to-merit evaluation, a pumping station with 28 Deltapumps in total, based on the conceptual design of Schut, was created. This pumping station is integrated within the Haringvlietdam and is covers an area of 420 × 190 m2. Its capacity, dependent on water levels in the Haringvliet, ranges 4.900 to 5.250 m3s-1, making it by an extremely large margin, the biggest pumping station in the world. Its costs, expressed as Net Present Value, are estimated at € 915 million by the year 2100, 70% of which covers the mechanical components of the pumping station and 30% the civil components. After the flood risk analysis and the pumping station design, it was posed that, whilst the pumping station itself has advantages—better capacity per unit width and less costs per unit capacity, it is not a cost-effective method to prevent flooding in the Rhine-Meuse delta. Calculations and the simulation show it only requires operation once every 92 years. It would therefore seem more cost-effective, and a permanent solution, to upgrade all dykes and dams along the Rhine-Meuse delta, so that more water can be stored. This should be investigated in future reports.","pumping station; flood risk analysis; Rhine-Meuse Delta; enclosed-screw pump","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This master thesis proposes two ways to accelerate their development as part of the master’s programmes in Mechanical Engineering and Science Communication. The Mechanical Engineering part focuses on the development of system identification techniques themselves. For this study, an ensemble-based algorithm is developed to identify intrinsic and reflexive joint stiffness during voluntary movements. The algorithm combines two methods from previous research: the Parallel-Cascade method to separate intrinsic and reflexive stiffness and an instrumental variable approach to allow subjects to carry out voluntary movements and apply closed-loop identification. A simulation and experimental study are conducted with the human wrist joint in which a sinusoidal angle reference trajectory is followed using multiple realisations of the same trial. To elicit the modulation of intrinsic parameters, a torque field is applied that is linearly dependent on the wrist angle with a greater flexion resulting in a higher torque. In the simulation study, the intrinsic and reflexive pathways are separated and over 98% of the variance is explained. In the experimental study, the modulation of intrinsic stiffness is estimated with an explained variance of over 90%. Intrinsic stiffness is highest during the peaks of the trajectory and lower during the transition phase from one peak to another. However, the torque response of the experimental study shows that no significant extra torque is added during the reflexive EMG peak. The obtained results underline the promising potential of the algorithm and open up new possibilities once the algorithm is tested on an experimental task where more reflexes are elicited. The Science Communication part focuses on developing a shared mental model to transfer knowledge on the processes behind cross-disciplinary collaborations to mechanical engineers, as devoting time and effort to the metacognitive process helps in coping with it. However, most theories on cross-disciplinarity are written from a social sciences paradigm and are inherently difficult to interpret from a mechanical engineering paradigm. An analogy is developed to link concepts from both epistemologies together. This is done by assembling a theoretical framework containing concepts on the processes behind cross-disciplinary collaborations. These concepts are linked to analogous counterparts from mechanical engineering by relying on conceptual similarities between mechanical stiffness and collaborative pliability. As a result, knowledge of cross-disciplinary collaborations can be immersed with existing conceptual knowledge of mechanical stiffness. Collaboration theories become part of the primary discipline instead of being treated as a separate discipline. The model, called the Collaborative Pliability Model, is assessed by a group of six mechanical engineering students. The students considered the model to be an effective tool for learning about cross-disciplinary collaborations. By using the model, they came up with numerous new factors affecting the success of their collaborative process. This gives a promising outlook for the future and opens the door for new applications for developing an analogy used to transfer knowledge between specific target groups.","Stiffness; Pliability; Wrist Joint Stiffness; Parallel-Cascade; Instrumental Variable; System Identification; Shared Mental Model; Analogy; Interdisciplinary; Cross-disciplinary; Transdisciplinary; Multidisciplinary","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

So, new connections need to be sought with Winterswijk in a new function and future proof redesign, to make it again the community center it used to be.

The open areas surrounding the Jacobuskerk and the park on the north side are connected by a grid formed by the Jacobuskerk, Raadhuis and Burgemeesterswoning. South of the Jacobuskerk the square in front of the church is a resting place along the Misterstraat, with a café in the rectory and a terrace. On the west of the church is the workshop building and a partly covered outside space for reading or studying; and on the east side is a quiet enclosed garden. In the church the library is located in the aisles, three floors high. With this intervention it is possible to experience the church from different heights, and get close to parts of the building that are always far away, like the vaulted ceiling and the windows.

A bike lane and parallel walking routes connect the town centre towards the hinterland, where the area functions as transitionary space. Secondly, there will be an introduction of new functions in the area to stimulate mixed-use.

A large part of the other new functions accommodated according to the different typologies of the buildings and accompanying characteristics, have a connection with timber (craftmanship). The whole project will be developed through different stages in time, where it is important for such heritage projects in villages like Winterswijk to grow slowly. Here the goal is to provide something new, but also to keep the memory of the past alive. People of Winterswijk, but also visitors are invited to enjoy the lively public space, the commercial activities and leisure possibilities facilitated in Timber Town.

The buildings and neighborhoods do not respond to the tropical savannah climate that they are in and when walking through a typical middle class neighborhood you would not expect these buildings in a tropical climate.<br/><br/>This way of building was not always a normality.

Buildings were constructed using a wooden frame and wood finishes placed on a foundation of local natural stones.

Methods have been proposed for solving these problems. However, it remains unclear what methods work best in scenarios with multiple similar objects of interest present in the same image, which is important for training computer vision with applications such as automatic quality control in factories. We researched which parameters are important to optimize, which methods are worth considering and what those selected methods score with regard to the parameters cost and quality. This was done through a literature review and substantiated by an experimental crowdsourcing campaign that focused on the annotation of Legos in images. It was found that the parameters to optimize were cost, optimized by reducing the time workers spent on tasks, and quality, optimized by improving the mean intersection over union value of the annotations. We concluded that majority vote, rejecting workers, majority vote adjusted to be resistant to outliers, rejecting workers with the same adjustments and decomposing tasks were the most promising methods. From our experiment we concluded that a clear trade-off exists between cost and quality. The adjusted rejecting workers method, that uses worker credibility, showed to have the highest mean quality. While the method that decomposed the components of the task and distributed them was the cheapest method to use overall and also best when looking at mean quality over cost, it was worse quality wise. These results were similar to the expected performance of the methods. From this we concluded that the best method for crowdsourcing is dependent on the error tolerance of the computer vision model that will be used and the budget available.","Crowdsourcing; Image annotation; Annotation quality; Annotation cost","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","Can deep learning recognize Lego pieces?",""

The existing tool EvoMaster has already implemented some global evolutionary search algorithms to solve this problem. In the context of RESTful APIs however, to this date, little attention has been given to a much simpler search algorithm: hill climbing. In contrast, hill climbing has been studied both inside and outside the context of search-based testing, and has found to be beneficial in a range of applications. The goal of this paper is to investigate the application of hill climbing within the context of testing RESTful APIs. The paper proposes a new local algorithm and compares its performance in the empirical study. Results comparing the local algorithm with the evolutionary counterpart show that the state of the art global algorithm is still superior.

Although moral decision-making during the uncertainty pandemics is suggested to be more motivated by individual incentive than collective incentive, decision-making in COVID-19 agent-based models is often modelled implicitly by cultural, social and economic characteristics, making it difficult to investigate the relation between decision-making and individual pay-off. The main research question of this paper is: ``What behavioural strategies can maximise an individual's quality of life in an agent-based social simulation of COVID-19?''. This is answered for two basic behavioural strategies, Isolate and Ignore, modelled in an existing agent-based model of COVID-19 called \textit{ASSOCC}. Patterns in quality of life per strategy are investigated by what they look like over time and how they are influenced by the degree of isolation and distribution of isolation strategies. The two main conclusions from the experiments in this paper are (1) isolation behaviour can be an acceptable or even a preferable strategy if and only if it is done full-time and collectively and (2) although collective isolation is preferable over collective non-isolation, there is an individual incentive not to join in on this collective isolation. These results can only be seen within the confines of the agent-based model and any proof towards its extension to real life is left for future work.","COVID-19; ABM; Behavioural model","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

This paper addresses this concern by comparing the performance of the popular deep Q-learning algorithm using one baseline and two state of the art exploration approaches, and their combination. Specifically, $\epsilon$-greedy is used as a baseline, and compared to the exploration approaches Bootstrapped DQN, randomized prior functions, and their combination. This is done in three different traffic scenarios, capturing different traffic profiles. The results obtained suggest that the higher the complexity of the traffic scenario, and the larger the size of the observation space of the agent, the larger the gain from efficient exploration.

Therefore, this paper introduces a normal form game that can be used to analyse the impact on local and global performance when optimising traffic signal control. Results obtained from a realistic traffic simulation suggest that it is sometimes possible for each player to choose a traffic signal control strategy that optimises its own welfare but also maximises the social welfare.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The feeling of belongingness, to be a member of a group, is rooted in human evolutionary history. Cooperative behaviour within such groups has since been an important research topic. The evolution of cooperation in the iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD) has been shown to be an effective tool of simulating and analysing this behaviour. However, it is unclear what the effects of group-based agents on IPD strategies in evolving spatial environments are. This paper investigates how this cooperation emerges by proposing an evolving spatial model that applies a genetic algorithm to its agents, extended to work with three distinct group types. This genetic algorithm makes use of four genetic operators: cloning, crossover, mutation and inversion. The groups considered are kin, clans and their combination. Cooperation is measured by examining (1) populations levels divided into nice, balanced and nasty groups, and (2) average cooperation levels of both strategies and games played per iteration. Experiments for all group types with two reproduction preferences were conducted. Three distinct conclusions can be drawn from the results. First, strategies evolved through domestic reproduction exhibit more cooperation for in-group opponents and more defection for out-group opponents. Second, strategies evolved through wealthy reproduction exhibit the same increase and decrease of cooperation as domestic reproduction, but to a smaller degree. Third, an evolving spatial environment with group-based agents develops subgroups, defined by similar strategies and restricting group-wide cooperation. Thus, agents with cooperative domestic strategies and defective foreign strategies win, and there is a positive correlation between group size and restriction of group-wide cooperation.","prisoner's dilemma; kin; clans; genetic algorithms; evolutionary games; spatial games","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

The addition of waypoints to this problem (MAPFW) gives rise to the possibility of more complex applications, such as in vehicle routing, aviation, computer games or robotics. Yet no algorithms have been proposed that can provide optimal solutions efficiently in practice. Starting with an established algorithm for multi-agent pathfinding, A* with operator decomposition and independence detection, this paper provides an extension to find optimal results when waypoints are present that the agents need to visit. This is achieved by altering the heuristic to make use of a solver of an adapted version of the traveling salesperson problem, to calculate the shortest path to visit all the waypoints for each agent individually. It is then empirically shown that this algorithm can solve problem instances of decent sizes, and it is compared to another algorithms that were developed at the same time based by others based on different pre-existing MAPF solvers. While the extension of A* is less performant than alternatives, the difference in performance can be small depending on the type of problem. Together with the relative ease of implementation, this means that A* can be an effective algorithm to optimally solve multi-agent pathfinding problems with waypoints. Additionally, the extension techniques used to adapt A* to MAPFW can also be useful to other algorithms that utilise A* in the context of waypoints.","Multi-Agent Path Finding; Waypoints; a-star","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

The resolution improvement in SIM is done by analyzing the obtained image and restored the observed sample with software. This process is sensitive to the measured PSF, as the PSF is the main factor to do the image deblurring and parameters estimation. Frequently, the PSF of a SIM system is obtained by ﬁtting the recorded beads image with the Gaussian function. However, the Gaussian ﬁtting cannot retrieve the aberration and noise in the PSF. The blind image deconvolution method is a family of algorithms which can be used to restore the object and corresponding PSF from the degraded images. The novel Tangential Iterative Projections (TIP) algorithm is a kind of blind image deconvolution algorithm proposed by Wilding et al.. This algorithm is simple, fast and robust to the noise condition. It is proved that TIP can be implemented on both the multi-frame deconvolution scenario and single-frame scenario. The aim of this thesis is to verify whether TIP algorithm can retrieve a PSF, which can be used to do the SIM image reconstruction, from the SIM data. For this purpose, a simulated SIM optical system is built in Matlab to generate the SIM images, and both the single-frame TIP and multi-frame TIP frameworks are used to do the PSF retrieval. In addition, a new constraint for the PSF which is generated based on the diﬀraction limit of the optical system is implemented. In order to reduce the execution time and avoid the overﬁtting of the algorithm, a stop criterion is introduced. The result shows both the multi-frame TIP and single-frame TIP can be used to retrieve an eﬀective PSF from the SIM data, and the single-frame TIP is more applicable and more accuracy compared with the multi-frame TIP.","Structured Illumination Microscopy; PSF Estimation; Blind Deconvolution; Tangential Iterative Projections; Fourier Ring Correlation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

In this third part a technical design is proposed for developing zero energy office buildings within the framework of the new Dutch policies. The technical design is tested by making redesigns for the studied cases and used to evaluate the boundaries for developing zero-energy office buildings within the framework of the new policies. This research concludes that new energy efficiency policies are still not completely in line with the international agreements. Furthermore, it concludes that it is technically and financially feasible to develop zero-energy office buildings up to six floors within the framework of the new policies. This conclusion takes current market standards and proven technologies into consideration. For developing Paris-Proof office buildings, 10 to 15 floors are considered feasible. There are no limits on the number of floors for developing BENG compliant office buildings according to this thesis.","zero-energy building; BENG; Policies; Technical feasibility; Financial feasibility; Office","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

Cities are reaching their physical boundaries, limiting the possibilities for horizontal expansion. Solutions towards the problem of densification of cities such as tall buildings are becoming increasingly popular. Existing urban economic literature revolving around this topic has mainly focussed on the horizontal scale of cities and buildings while largely ignoring the vertical aspects. In this study the vertical economics within tall buildings are further researched with an objective to shed light on the interrelationship between price premiums per floor level, vertical sorting through the willingness to pay for height of tenants and productivity measured by revenue per employee within tall buildings in Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague. These factors have contributed to the following main question of this research: What is the interrelationship between price premiums per floor level, vertical sorting and productivity of firms in multi-tenant office buildings in the three largest cities (Amsterdam, Rotterdam &amp; The Hague) of the Netherlands?Empirical analysis through several models results in a highly significant vertical price premium of 0,6% increase of transacted rental price per square meters for each consecutive floor level. In similar fashion a vertical price premium of 1,5% is found for each consecutive relative floor level. Both of these percentages indicate a strong relationship between both absolute and relative floor level height and willingness to pay for height effects such as view and status. Floor levels are grouped in brackets of 5. A non-monotonic trend for floor price premiums is identified, suggesting a progressive trend up to floor level 25th, after which the trend becomes regressive. The regressive pattern after floor 25 could indicate a turning point in terms of rent premiums where the trade-off between amenities and accessibility diminishes and the cost of transportation to the highest floors outweigh the benefits that view and status offer.The results through vertical sorting analysis indicate a difference between sectors ranging from 49,6% to -2,6% in terms of willingness to pay (WTP) for absolute height and 54,7% to 25,8% for WTP for relative height. All analysed industries are more willing to pay more for relative height while there are significant differences between sectors for absolute height. Insurance carriers and law offices tend to locate higher within a building. The results indicate a significant difference between insurance &amp; law offices and the other analysed industries starting from the 50th and 75th percentile.Finally, a significant, but not robust elasticity between the models is found between the floor levels and productivity, indicating that tenants who have more revenue per employee locate higher within a building. The observation where, as productivity increases by 1%, the floor level increases by 4,8%, is a confirmation of previous research and literature where firms who have a higher productivity value have an increased willingness to pay for height.","Height premium; Vertical sorting; Productivity; Tall buildings; Urban economics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

The presence of this noise in interactions challenges cooperation, as one party cannot determine whether the other party did not cooperate on purpose.

Recent studies that have used the Prisoner's Dilemma to show that harsh environments promote cooperation, currently do not take noise into account. This article therefore uses the Prisoner's Dilemma and Agent Based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS) to describe the relation between the harshness of the environment and noise. From the simulations it follows that the adversity of the environment benefits cooperators and can make cooperation more robust against mistakes. Harsher environments also encourage greater generosity to cope with noise. Yet when uncertainty is high due to higher probability of mistakes or more potential defectors in the environment, contrite behaviours are most successful.","prisoner's dilemma; noise; harsh environments; generosity; contrition","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science and Engineering","CSE3000 Research Project",""

Shrinkage is caused by evaporation of moisture from the drying material. In the design- and construction-standards, this complex process is not described on a fundamental level. Using finite element modelling to simulate the flow of Moisture through the concrete, it is possible to simulate drying shrinkage. The research question of this thesis is: ‘How can a parametric FEM model efficiently simulate drying shrinkage in industrial concrete floors?’. Verification of the produced model is performed. The outcome is compared to shrinkage <br/>measurements of concrete prisms. The theoretical framework presented in this thesis is based on the fact that the relative pore humidity is changing during drying. In a finite element model, the changing relative pore humidity (pore-RH) over time is calculated. Drying is caused by internal diffusion of moisture, which is driven by differences in concentration. The moisture flow is modelled using the transient heat equation. The resulting pore-RH values are used to determine the hydrostatic capillary pressure based on the equations of Kelvin and Laplace. The material response of cement paste subjected to the capillary pressure is calculated using Bentz law. At last, the models of Pickett and Neville are used to include the restraining effect of aggregates and determine the absolute deformation of concrete subjected to drying. The initial conditions of the material are determined based on HYMOSTRUC cement simulation and Powers’ volumetric model. The results of the presented theoretical framework are reasonable. Usage of the framework and the heat equation for modelling drying in FEM, proved to be successful. A significant uncertainty is found in the restraining effect of aggregates. The theoretical model is based on material modelling of drying cement paste. However, the deformation of concrete is only <br/>16%~23% of the total deformation of cement paste. Recommended is to further research the (local) effect of aggregates on drying shrinkage. Drying shrinkage has been calculated according to the construction standards and compared to the measured drying shrinkage of the concrete prisms. From this, it can be concluded that calculations by structural engineers on drying shrinkage are preferably done according to the ‘Model code 2010’.","concrete drying shrinkage; FEM modelling; Cement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering - Structural Design","",""

As new regulations come into place, a transition towards a more sustainable energy system must be realised. Hydrogen usage is regarded as the key enabler of such systems. The heart of these hydrogen-based energy systems (HESs) is the hydrogen back-up system (HBS) which is responsible for the production, transport and storage of hydrogen. This study investigated how the power-to-gas efficiency of a HBS is governed by various sources and services. Two services are defined for the HES; Service 1: Constant hydrogen supply for the chemical industry. Service 2: Interruptible hydrogen supply as a fuel for power back-up. Both services can use a wind farm or the power grid as the source. A fully transient mathematical model of the system was built in Matlab Simulink. This model uses a rectifier and a PEM electrolyzer to convert the source power into hydrogen. A transport system, consisting of a pressure control station (PCS) and a 50 kilometre transmission pipeline, delivers the hydrogen to the salt cavern. Here, the hydrogen is injected into a 1000 metre deep cavern by a PCS and an injection pipeline. After a discharge pipeline, a third PCS is installed to adapt the hydrogen temperature and pressure for another 50 kilometre long transmission pipeline. A final PCS adapts the flow properties to the desired service values. All components are able to fully capture the intermittent nature of the cases. Historical data of the spot prices for power and wind speeds of 2017 are used for the sources and services. The resulting production and consumption profiles for 2017 were used to size the HBS for each case, ensuring full use of the cavern capacity without over- or underproduction. Simulations of the defined cases showed that the caverns only completed one full charge-discharge cycle during 2017, showing that all cases demand seasonal storage. The power-to-gas efficiency of both the grid-powered cases is 58%. The wind-powered cases show efficiencies of 44% and 41% for the chemical industry and the power back-up cases, respectively. The main conclusions as to why these difference are present are described below. Wind-powered HBSs lead to roughly 24 – 28% more power losses due to a mismatch between the wind farm power output and the PEME operational power input limits. The most significant losses occur during low wind speeds when the wind farm output is between zero and the minimum PEME operating power. The PEME efficiencies are in the range of 67.5 - 70.1%, making it the largest contributor to the total HBS losses. The transport and storage systems for all cases have an efficiency of roughly 95.0 - 95.5%. The efficiency of wind-powered PEMEs is 2.3 - 2.6 percentage points higher compared to grid-powered. The service has no significant effect on the efficiency as the service pressure for all cases is for large part of the year lower than the transport and storage pressure, resulting in negligible power requirements for the transport system.","Hydrogen; Energy system; PEM electrolyzer; Storage; Matlab Simulink; Renewable Energy; wind farm","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The iron oxides (ore) are charged into the furnace in the form of sinters and pellets containing the iron ore. Iron ore interacts with reducing gases and coke to form molten iron which in combination with slag are collected in the hearth of the blast furnace and tapped separately. Since blast furnace is a counter-current reactor, the permeability is of prime importance for its efficiency. When temperatures reach 1100 °C to 1200 °C the ore layers start to soften and gradually melt, and this region is called the cohesive zone. The cohesive zone consists of a series of approximate ring-shaped, doughnut-like masses of semi-molten, pasty ferruginous burden material. Here the loss of permeability is caused by melt onset and deformation of the solid phases due to the pressure of the burden. The shape and position of the cohesive zone affect the efficiency of the process and it is advantageous to have the cohesive zone located at as high temperatures as possible and its thickness as small as possible. This is governed by the properties of the pellets and sinter which in turn depends on the nature of ore or concentrate, associated gangue, type and amount of fluxes added, and their subsequent treatment. With the depletion of high-quality iron ore resources, the consumption of iron ores with high alumina (Al2O3) content is increasing. Therefore, it is important to investigate the influence of alumina on the reduction, softening, and melting behaviour of iron-bearing materials like sinters and pellets, hence its effect on the cohesive zone. This thesis explores the effect of alumina on the pellet’s behaviour in the cohesive zone, for which Reduction, Softening, and Melting apparatus (RSM) is used as a blast furnace simulator. With RSM, the pellet samples with similar basicity but varying alumina content are subjected to conditions similar to the blast furnace, and their reduction, softening, and melting behaviour are compared. It is observed that with an increase in alumina content the cohesive zone shifts to a lower temperature and its thickness increases, therefore the resistance offered to the gas flow increases. The alumina plays a multifaceted role, where it affects reduction degree, degree of carburization, the viscosity of primary slag, and finally wettability of slags with coke and iron. Alumina causes reduction retardation in heterogeneous conditions, due to the formation of low melting interfaces. This on one hand does not influence the total reduction degree but on the other increases the rate of homogenization of the pellet microstructure. Alumina induces reduction retardation in homogenous condition, by increasing the rate of melt formation due to an increase in the fraction of low melting phases. This causes an increase in the rate of softening and early melting. Degree of reduction is not the only factor that influences softening and melting behaviour, as a pellet sample with lower reduction degree and lower alumina showcase better softening melting properties than the pellet sample with a higher reduction degree and higher alumina content. Alumina acts as network former in the chemistries considered, increasing the viscosity of primary slag, hence increasing the resistance to gas flow. Alumina increases the proportion of high melting phases in the FeO lean slag. The possible effects of alumina on carburization and wettability are explored with the help of literature, one possibility is that alumina decreases the wettability of slag with iron shell, hence increases the degree of carburization causing early melting of iron shells. Simultaneously, the possible effects of basicity are also explored using literature; it seems with an increase in basicity the negative effects of alumina lessen. <br","Blast Furnace; Iron Making; Pellets; Alumina; Reduction Softening and Melting; Cohesive Zone","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

To predict this morphology, simulations made by morphological models are used. To base decisions on this morphology predictions, we want the uncertainties in these predictions to be small. The goal of this research is to get a better insight in the uncertainties in a morphological model. By having a better understanding of these uncertainties, the decisions made using modelled predictions are stronger substantiated. The specific area focused on in this research is the Frisian Inlet, which is located between Ameland and Schiermonnikoog in the Wadden Sea. To achieve the goal of this research, data assimilation is used. Data assimilation combines data with prior knowledge of a model to find the distribution of probabilities of estimates of a true state. In this research, the used data are bed level measurements and the estimates are simulations for the bed level height made by Delft3D. Data assimilation methods make use of a distribution of model outcomes which should cover all possible outcomes. So, to set up data assimilation successfully, we want to use a parameter that induces a significant change in the bathymetry outcomes of Delft3D. Therefore, a sensitivity study is performed which considers the following six parameters: current related roughness, wave related roughness, wave-related suspended load sediment transport factor, wave-related bedload sediment transport factor, the transverse bed slope and the tidal amplitude. For each parameter, ten values are chosen to simulate. Which of the parameters induces the most change in bathymetry is assessed, using the difference between simulation result and the observation and the mean squared error skill score. The transverse bed slope shows the most variation and is further used in the data assimilation method, which is a particle filter. Hundred uniformly distributed values of the transverse bed slope, between 0.5-100, are used to create different Delft3D simulations that give a bed level prediction. This initial distribution is used for three different periods: 1970-1975, 1975-1979 and 1979-1982. These epochs are defined by the availability of bed level measurements. After one iteration of the particle filter, a new distribution of the parameter values is found. This is used in the next iteration in the same epoch. In each epoch, three iterations are made. The methodology as described in this thesis leads to a convergence of the initial distribution. In epoch 1 and 3, the distribution focuses on values of the transverse bed slope in the high range of the initial distribution. The resulting distribution of epoch 2 focuses on values around a transverse bed slope value of 70. This study shows that it is possible to get a better understanding of the distribution of \gls{alfa} values that leads to probable bedlevel predictions by applying a particle filter. The application of this method brings the simulations closer to each other, but the simulations did not get closer to the observations. The contribution to our understanding of data assimilation for morphodynamic models is that it can be used as a calibration tool for a specific parameter.","Data assimilation; Particle filter; Frisian inlet; Delft3D; Bathymetry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By introducing a decomposable time-series regression model to predict demand we can isolate the effects of trend, seasonality and recurring events without having to introduce new data. Introducing price as a module enables us to control for the desired future demand.

Finally, we look for an automated way of finding similarity across venues using the associated historical sales data and use this to estimate the variation in error when grouping venues in a controlled experiment.","Dynamic Pricing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-06-19","","","","","",""

AF is associated with an increased risk of stroke, heart failure, impaired cognitive function, and increased mortality. An obstacle for optimal diagnosis and treatment is the relatively unknown (electro-)pathophysiology of AF. In combination with intra-operative cardiac mapping, accurate analysis of the AF burden using post-operative continuous rhythm registrations might provide great insight into the underlying mechanisms of AF development. However, manual analysis of these continuous rhythm registrations is both time-consuming and subject to interpretation. Therefore, the aim of this study is to develop an automated AF detection algorithm for use in the research setting. Methods Using 6,400 manually annotated 30-seconds electrograms (ECGs) derived from the post-operative continuous rhythm registrations in the Erasmus Medical Center (Rotterdam), and 192 annotated records from standard MIT-BIH ECG databases, a classifier was developed with three output classes: <i>AF</i>, <i>No AF</i>, and <i>Unusable </i>(due to noise/artefacts). QRS-complexes were detected using a method based on the Pan-Tompkins algorithm. Subsequently, P- and T-waves were detected and features were extracted, which can be grouped into eight groups: RR-interval characteristics, peak-interval characteristics, amplitude characteristics, P-wave characteristics, T-wave characteristics, QRS-morphology characteristics, autocorrelation characteristics, and noise. Multiple classifiers were trained using a training set containing 4,800 post-operative ECGs and a hidden test set containing the remaining 1,600 post-operative ECGs. The optimal classifier in terms of accuracy was further optimized. Results Optimal classification was achieved using boosted decision trees. For the hidden test set, this resulted in an accuracy of 96.44% (95% CI: 95.41% - 97.24%) for detection of AF with a false negative rate of 2.8% (95% CI: 1.5% - 4.9%) and a false positive rate of 3.8% (95% CI: 2.9% - 5.1%). Of all 74 misclassifications, 36 (49%) were made in the group with irregular rhythms without AF. Classification was mainly based on the RR-interval characteristics. Conclusion An automated AF classifier based on post-operative continuous rhythm registrations for use in the research setting was proposed. Careful use of the classifier in combination with manual validation of detected AF segments makes the classifier suitable for supervised research purposes.","Post-Operative Atrial Fibrillation; Telemetry; Classification; Algorithms; Machine Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Concomitantly, advances in micromanufacturing techniques overlap with progress in tissue engineering to produce microenvironments that better mimic in vivo systems. The convergence of these fields has given rise to microfluidic 3D culture platforms which have resulted in a large shift in the understanding of how many biological processes unfold due the platform’s ability to highly control microarchitectures, biochemical gradients, co-culture conditions, and mechanical stimuli. So-called Organ on Chip’s (OOCs) have been instrumental in shifting the paradigm in which cell culturing is carried out and in which ways scientists think about testing potential drug therapeutics. <br/>The microfluidic OOC platform, inCHIPitTM, by BIOND Solutions, B.V. is a versatile tool designed for co-culture with a variety of macroscopic tissue types, such as organoids, explants, spheroids, and microtissues. It is a silicone (a.k.a. PDMS) and silicon-based platform that has the capacity for pneumatically controlled flexions and monitoring bioelectrical potentials. The inCHIPitTM model has already be implemented to model various organs, including midbrain organoids and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). The purpose of this study, however, is to further characterize the laboratory tool itself rather than the potential biological applications. Here, optical coherence tomography (OCT) is used to interrogate the OOC device’s construction and culture capability by making use of properties of interfering waves and backscattering light. Furthermore, the microfluidic fluid flows and diffusion events in an OOC were characterized with OCT for the first time. And, as proof of concept, organoid-like bodies (OLBs) and their impact on flows in culture were examined.<br/>inCHIPitTM consists of two microcompartments – a straight microfluidic channel and a culture well separated by a microporous PDMS membrane – which are supported by a series of interlocking plates and a culture lid, all composed of different materials. In terms of imaging quality, the plate material choice and lid optical traits played a key role by limiting background noise, yet, for instance, the culture lid qualities would prove inhibiting to OCT measurements during actual cell culture experiments. Moreover, the fluid velocity profiles within in inCHIPitTM microfluidics were observed and were demonstrated to exhibit characteristic velocity profiles. It was also shown that mass transport phenomenon across the porous membrane in the cell culture well occur and follow typical diffusive mechanisms. Further, initial observations as to the effects of OLBs on fluid flow characteristics in the inCHIPitTM platform were reported. The compilation of OCT and OLB measurements and observations make a strong argument for the potential of inCHIPitTM system as a staple of biomedical applications.","Organ-on-a-chip; Microfluidics; Optical Coherence Tomography; Organoids","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-06-19","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

The laryngectomy removes the possibility to speak. Fortunately several speech reinstatement techniques have been found. However, all current speech reinstatement techniques do not produce a lot of volume. As a result the laryngectomised person will have difficulties speaking in busy environments, up to the point were the condition can lead to isolation because of the inability to communicate. Moreover with the current methods it costs a lot of energy to speak, the produced speech is less stable and the fundamental frequency has become lower. In this thesis a device is designed to improve the speech produced by a laryngectomised person realtime. The speech is recorded with an electret microphone. The resulting signal is prepared to be quantified to then be processed by a digital signal processing unit. Then the signal is adaptively filtered using the dynamically determined fundamental frequency. By tracking the fundamental frequency some instability from the voice is removed. The fundamental frequency will be determined using the cepstrum, a technique separating the fundamental regency of a voice from the high frequency components added by the oral and nasal cavities during speech. In another thesis a system is designed to amplify the signal to make sure that speaking takes less energy \cite{shiftgroep}. Furthermore a suitable power source is determined for the system.

(mentor); Infante Ferreira, C.A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Universiteit Leiden (degree granting institution)","2020","This study provides suggestions to decrease hot utility use and impact on the environment of a skim milk powder (SMP) processing plant. These suggestions are based on the integration of waste streams with processes in the production of SMP. To identify appropriate waste and process streams, process integration has proven to be a successful method. This concept addresses the issue of waste heat of a process by pointing out to the importance of the relation between unit-processes. In this study, the integration of waste streams is accomplished by heat exchangers, heat pumps and a zeolite wheel. The general assumption underlying this research, is that recovering heat from unused waste streams decreases hot utility use. Multiple methodologies were used in this study. To accomplish process integration, the pinch analysis forms an essential tool. This analysis was used to identify potential heat recovery schemes in the SMP plant. Furthermore, to fully understand these schemes, a thermal, environmental and economical analysis was done. These analyses were based on mass and energy balances, (in)direct CO2 emissions and investment and operational costs. Several conclusion can be drawn from the pinch analysis. First, the pinch temperature is 50◦C. This represents the dividing line between processes which require heating and cooling. Second, the heating and cooling demand is known. The SMP production process requires 6.8 MW of external heating and 1.7 MW of external cooling. Third, the amount of recoverable heat is equal to 5.3 MW. Fourth, appropriate heat sink and sources are identiﬁed. The heat sources, i.e. waste streams, are the spray dryer exhaust and the the condensate streams from two evaporators. The supply temperatures of the exhaust and the condensate streams are respectively 77, 65 and 55◦C. The appropriate heat sinks are the spray dryer air inlet and the evaporator product inlet streams. The target temperature of the spray dryer inlet and evaporator inlet streams are respectively 190, 75 and 70◦C. Seven heat recovery setups are proposed. In terms of saved energy, the spray dryer exhaust has the most potential for heat recovery. The zeolite wheel is the best performing heat recovery technology in the spray dryer process, with a recovery of 3.5 MW. Furthermore, a heat exchanger-heat pump combination and a stand-alone heat exchanger recover respectively 1.8 and 1.6 MW. In contrast, the evaporation process has less potential for heat recovery. The best performing conﬁguration is a heat pump, recovering 1.4 MW from the evaporator condensate. The environmental performance is strongly related with the amount of energy saved. This is because the most decisive parameter in the environmental analysis is the carbon intensity of natural gas and electricity. The best performing conﬁgurations in terms of saved CO2 emissions are the zeolite wheel (3806 ton/yr), the heat exchanger-heat pump combination (1934 ton/yr) and the stand-alone heat exchanger (1593 ton/yr) in the spray dryer process. In the evaporation section, the heat pump saves 1485 ton CO2 per year. The total annual costs are derived from the equivalent annual costs of the asset, carbon savings and utility savings/costs. The best performing conﬁguration is the heat pump in the evaporation process. This technology has an annual return of 145 ke per year. Other conﬁgurations with a high return are the stand-alone heat exchanger (143 ke/yr), the heat exchanger-heat pump combination (128 ke/yr) and the zeolite wheel (123 ke/yr).","Pinch analysis; Dairy processing; Waste heat recovery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

Rhythmic cues during FoG can help patients to resume walking. FoG can be detected from lower limb acceleration data, but current detection algorithms lack context, resulting in false positive detection and initiation of cues when these are not required. Cues are only required during ambulatory motion. Adding a task classification model to an FoG detection device can help to increase specificity. Furthermore, using this model, an activity log of PD patients can be kept in the home environment, thereby facilitating disease evaluation. A decision tree model using Bayesian classifiers was developed for task classification. Predictors were extracted from raw data of an ankle-worn tri-axial accelerometer and the best predictors were determined at each decision node using feature selection methods. The proposed decision tree model (trained using healthy subject data) was tested on PD patient data to evaluate transferability. Furthermore, to compare performance and computational speed, our Bayesian decision node classifiers were compared to Naive Bayes classifiers. The proposed model was over 30 times faster, compared to the computational speed of using Naive Bayes classifiers at the decision nodes. Ambulatory windows were identified with a sensitivity over 91% for both healthy subjects and PD patients, showing that the Bayesian decision tree model developed in this study can provide context for an FoG detection wearable, to enable effective cueing. This will help patients to walk more confidently and to keep active.","Accelerometry; Task Classification; Freezing of Gait; Parkinson's Disease; Decision Tree Model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-06-10","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

These rivers are important in the Kitui region of Kenya, where water shortage impedes rural and urban development. The seasonal rivers of Kitui provide suitable water for domestic, livestock and agricultural use, particularly small-scale irrigation. A majority of the population of Kitui county depends on the ephemeral river for water supply. In dry periods, water levels drop and water can only be found in scoop holes (holes dug in the riverbed). The water shortage is where NaBWIG, an abbreviation for Nature-based water infrastructures in Ethiopia and Kenya for #GlobalGoals (NaBWIG), focuses on. Its goal is to increase resilience through sustainable water supply with the use of stored water within ephemeral sand rivers (Karimi, 2018). This research is part of NaBWIG where, based on 2 months fieldwork trip to Kenya, an evaluation was done using Q-methodology. This study aimed to define which elements of water access are valued by people who use water from sand storage dams in two sub-regions in Kitui – Kenya. This research revealed the broad definition of access to water, specifically when zooming in to local sand dam utilization. Main elements that seem to be most important like distance, time, water quantity, water quality and also reliability of a water source. Other elements are also related to water access such as social capital, income and terrain. Results suggest that ‘one community’ does not exist in either of the regions. The results from the Q-method show different perspectives within both communities on both domestic and agricultural water use, with specifics of perspectives depending on whether one takes the respondents as a whole or analyses them per community. In both regions, comparable elements arise, but different groups appear too. These two ‘communities’ are diverse in perspectives and one must look at both regions with different ‘lenses’ as their position is different from each other. The researcher may force these people into groups, which then are called a community, but in reality, is still a group of people with different interests. The alignment of these different factor groups is important to ensure the community benefit the most of a sand dam structure, which does not stop after construction. This research aimed at creating a better understanding of the interplay of multiple factors regarding water access and provided a more thorough understanding of the dynamics of local communities and their appreciation of water access regarding sand storage dams.","sand storage dams; water access; Q-methodology; community dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

Adaptive optics is a modern technique for detecting and correcting real-time wavefront aberrations and is widely used in biomedical imaging and astronomical imaging. Wavefront sensing lies at the core of Adaptive Optics and is known to pose some challenges. Measurement of the wavefront cannot be done directly and has to be estimated through an intensity distribution on a detector. One approach to wavefront sensing is by using a Shack-Hartmann (SH) sensor. A Shack-Hartmann sensor (a pupil-plane sensor) subdivides the wavefront into N spatial areas using sub-apertures. The individual slopes across all sub-apertures are integrated to reconstruct the wavefront. The major advantage of using a Shack-Hartmann sensor is its fast operation speed, caused by the linear relationship between local slopes and original wavefront. This enables real-time wavefront reconstruction. The Shack-Hartmann sensor however, has some limitations. Its ability to reconstruct higher-order aberrations is restricted by the amount of lenses within the micro-lens array. Furthermore, a centroiding algorithm is used to compute the local slopes. Going from spots to centroids decreases the amount of informative pixels and greatly limits its wavefront reconstruction potential. Moreover, these centroiding algorithms often add a measure of uncertainty since spots can have irregular shapes or cross-over/overlap. In this Master Thesis a novel approach to phase reconstruction from the raw SH measurement is proposed. Here, we show that Deep Learning techniques in combination with a micro-lens array can surpass traditional SH phase reconstruction methods and alleviate their current limitations. The proposed method uses the entire Shack-Hartmann Pattern (HP) as input to a neural network, supplying the network with more information than existing Deep Learning SHWR methods, which still rely on centroids. Using this approach, we can combine the accuracy of sensor-less techniques with the speed of a Shack-Hartmann sensor. Three different neural network architectures are considered in this thesis. Two of these neural networks (Alex-Net and Xception) are adapted to output a series of Zernike coefficients. Using these estimated Zernike coefficients, a wavefront can be reconstructed. The remaining neural network, U-Net, performs a direct pixel-wise estimation of the phase-map. The input Shack-Hartmann patterns are created using different micro-lens array (MLA) geometries, consisting of 25-, 256- or 900 lenses. The networks are evaluated on their ability to reconstruct a combination of 32- or 100- Zernike coefficients.","Deep Learning; Wavefront Sensing; Adaptive Optics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Water production and injection are the primary mechanisms in Geothermal Energy. Both include injecting water into a porous formation under matrix injection conditions. While maintaining water injection is vital in these branches in the industry, so is the occurrence of formation damage (FD) due to suspended contaminants or brine incompatibility. Suspended particles in injection water are retained or deposited due to the creation of an External Filter Cake (EFC) or Internal Filter Cake (IFC) impairing the permeability. Consequently, FD results in Water Injectivity Decline (WID). In most cases, the negative impact on injectivity translates into operational and economic targets not being met. WID, as a result of FD, is highly connected to the Water Quality (WQ) of the injection water. A new approach to water quality (WQ) testing is proposed which suffices as a bridging application of membrane filtration and core flooding. To establish a foundation for this method, tests are conducted by performing particle-laden suspension injection experiments with porous outcrop sandstone 8 mm thin discs utilizing the ‘Con-vergence Hydra’. An experimental study is conducted investigating the effect of water quality (WQ) on formation damage, using dilute (20-100 mg/l) Baracarb2 (CaCO3) particle suspension as a model contaminant. Baracarb2 is tested for particle size distribution, mineral content and stability within synthetic brine (resembling Seawater). Subsequently, suspension flow experiments are conducted on porous thin discs (Bentheimer &amp; Berea sandstone) as well as membrane filters (MF0.45μm). As performing suspension injection test with porous thin disc test utilising the Hydra has not been done before, reproducibility of the experiments is tested. The reproducibility of performing experiments utilising the Hydra is high, with very little difference between the experimental outcomes.Varying WQ within each different porous media type illustrates remarkably similar trends. Moreover, it is demonstrated that by performing a similarity curve collapse, a master curve is obtained for each porous medium type which scales with suspension concentration for Baracarb2. The damage mechanisms explaining this master curve all demonstrate a linear permeability impairment in the early part of the experiments. Subsequently, a linear impedance trend is observed where it is assumed that cake filtration is dominant. The latter is demonstrated by calculating the Modified fouling Index (MFI), which shows a linear dependency with suspension concentration. SEM imaging and Micro-CT scan images substantiate the damage mechanisms hypothesized from the pressure and rate data.The Con-vergence Hydra utilising porous thin discs has great potential for on-site testing which allows fast and reliable results on permeability impairment, i.e. formation damage. Subsequently, monitoring of the water quality can be done by performing MFI analysis during cake filtration. ","Water quality; Formation damage; Con-vergence Hydra; Baracarb2; Calcium carbonate; Porous sandstone disc; MFI","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-06-18","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

Little is known about causes for these issues. Research has shown that implementation of innovations like nutrition education programmes is influenced by adoption which in turn is affected by a multitude of determinants. The first objective of this thesis was to investigate the adoption of nutrition education programmes at primary schools and the association with implementation dose. The second objective was to create a tool to support the adoption of Taste Lessons. School-based nutrition education programmes are regarded as educational innovations in this thesis. An innovation is defined in this thesis as a novel, inventive and useable solutions related to people’s needs. In this context adoption is defined as the process which starts from the moment the teacher hears about the programme until the decision is made whether to use it. The number lessons implemented by the teachers is referred to as the implementation dose in this thesis. To reach the first objective, the adoption of Taste Lessons, EU-Schoolfruit and school-based nutrition education programmes in general, was evaluated. Data analyses were performed to investigate the association of the score on adoption determinants with implementation dose of Taste Lessons. Multilevel analyses were performed to compare the changes in intended programme outcomes over time between implementation dose categories. To reach the second objective, a Delphi study was performed to gain insight into the key stakeholders’ needs in the adoption process of Taste Lessons. In addition to these insights, literature and expert consults were used to develop a tool. This tool aims to support the adoption of Taste Lessons. Twenty-eight determinants important for adoption have been established. Several determinants that could be barriers for the adoption of Taste Lessons and EU-Schoolfruit have been identified. Significant positive associations have been found between implementation dose and the number of support staff, awareness of the programme’s contents, descriptive and subjective norm, and correctness of the programme. A significant negative association has been found with the teacher experiencing support from professionals. The implementation dose was significant positively associated with change in children’s nutrition knowledge. No significant association of the implementation dose with change of children’s fruit and vegetable consumption was found. Based on the above mentioned results in combination with the results from second part of the thesis a tool to support the adoption of Taste Lessons was developed. The digital tool should show teachers how they can tailor the programme to their needs, inform them about the contents, effectiveness and substation of the programme, and stimulate them to take action for implementation. The take home message of this research is that adoption determinants are associated with implementation dose, which in turn, is associated with the programme’s effectiveness. Context specific strategies for support of the adoption phase in the dissemination of nutrition education programmes should be developed, of which the tool developed in this research is an example. The strategy should be based on literature and practice, to ensure the feasibility, desirability and viability.","adoption strategy; nutrition education programme; innovation; implementation dose","en","master thesis","","","","","","Master of Science in Nutrition and Health | Nutritional Epidemiology and Public Health and Science Education and Communication","","","","","","Applied Sciences | Nutrition and Health","",""

Some severely disabled patients can only produce yes-or-no responses to communicate. These responses can be created through a physical switch, eye blink, or a 'mental' click created by brain activity. The yes-or-no responses can be used to communicate by making multiple selections between two groups of letters. Through deduction paradigms the target letter can be determined. Current assistive devices use a Row Column or Huffman paradigm to communicate. Communication rates achieved with these paradigms are slow compared to regular conversation rates and to assistive devices using eye-tracking. Furthermore, these deduction paradigms have only been tested in assistive devices with no or little noise. Noise affects the yes-or-no responses and leads to the selection of incorrect letters. There are assistive devices that suffer from high noise levels which affect communication rates. This work evaluates four communication paradigms for a range of noise conditions to improve communication rates. Row Column, Huffman, and two novel paradigms are evaluated. The two novel paradigms, based on Variable-Length Error-Correcting code and Weighted Huffman encoding, are designed for environments with noise. Evaluation of these paradigms is done through simulation and human experiments. A mathematical model is developed for simulation, and an emulator emulating an assistive device is used for human experiments. Spelling speed and cognitive effort are used as performance measures. The simulations were shown to be useful as a tool for predicting the relative performance of the paradigms in real use situations. Results from the simulation and experiments found that the effect of noise is paradigm dependent and should be taken into consideration. A novel paradigm was shown to be optimal for selective noise conditions. Row Column scanning scored the best on cognitive effort, while Huffman encoding resulted in the fastest typing speed in almost all noise conditions. Through emulation and simulation, Huffman encoding is validated as the optimal paradigm to increase communication rates. The mathematical model set a basis on which more research into optimal communication paradigms for discrete control assistive devices can be conducted.","BCI; Assistive technology; binary codes; Communication design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This can have social, economic and environmental benefits. One of the most noticeable benefits is the reduction landfilled USW. To achieve this it is necessary to, firstly, understand the nature and magnitude of the USW problem and, secondly, implement treatment techniques for the different types of USW; yet these must fit the local socio-economic context. This quantitative research takes as a study case the city of San Cristobal de las Casas (SCLC), which is a main tourist destination in the south-east of Mexico. The research is divided in three parts. In the first part the nature and magnitude of the USW problem are mapped; this includes a field study of the USW footprint cause by tourism. The second part is an evaluation of the treatment techniques, for types of waste that are identified in the study case, that can be applied in the city to recover value from USW and match the socio-economic context. The third part, is a circular business case where organic waste, the largest waste type in terms of mass, is treated with pyrolysis to produce charcoal briquettes; the intention of this product is to reduce the consumption of cooking char and firewood from illegal origin in the city. The results demonstrate that, using the approach found in this research, it is possible to obtain a significant economic return and, at the same time, social and environmental benefits from the USW in SCLC by using a circular economy approach.

Nevertheless, the Dutch government lacks a clear strategy to reduce food waste. The city of Amsterdam also lacks such a strategy. Therefore, various social innovation initiatives are actively preventing food waste. These initiatives emerge from local collaboration and address a social problem in society that existing institutions have failed to tackle themselves. These initiatives call themselves “signaleringskeukens"" or food waste prevention initiatives. As there is a lack of knowledge on the impact and governance of food waste prevention initiatives, this thesis aims to answer the following research question: What is the impact of food waste prevention initiatives in Amsterdam? In doing so, it will look at the governance of food waste prevention initiatives, their environmental and socio-economic impact, and drivers and barriers that influence this impact. This thesis shows that it is difficult for food waste prevention initiatives to realize an impact. They are confronted with barriers in almost every aspect of their activities. Despite collecting a significant amount of food waste, food waste prevention initiatives are still merely scratching the surface compared to Amsterdam's total amount of food waste. The initiatives are aware of this and primarily focus on raising awareness of food waste and food waste prevention. Thereby, the initiatives reach thousands of people but fail to reach politicians, councilors, and food businesses. Consequently, food waste prevention initiatives have not yet realized system innovation and transformative change. Nonetheless, they show great potential for changing the food system as long as they establish strong networks.","Social innovation; Food Waste Reduction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

The consumption of electronic products leads to an increase in electronic waste (e-waste). More than half of all the e-waste that is generated in the Netherlands originates from domestic appliances (WEEE register, 2019) and only 9% of all the e-waste will be recycled (Renewi, personal communication, 2019). The remaining waste will be dumped into landfill sites, and the energy and resources used to make the products will get lost, therefor products need to be designed with a ‘circular approach’. The goal of the circular economy is to use products, equipment and infrastructure for a longer time, and to improve the productivity of these resources. (Ellen MacArthur Foundation). One of the strategies of extending the life time of products within the circular economy is refurbishment: “A process of returning a product to good working condition by replacing or repairing major components that are faulty or close to failure, and making ‘cosmetic’ changes to update the appearance of a product” (Ellen MacArthur Foundation). Right now, refurbished products are not a common consumer choice. Therefor the question that is answered in this master thesis is: How can the design of a household appliance be optimized to increase the consumer acceptance with regard to the refurbished product? The research was divided in three parts. First the motivation of the consumer was investigated by means of a literature review and a survey amongst consumers. Then the preferred aesthetics of refurbished appliances were researched through literature and doing in-dept interviews. Lastly a research was done in order to optimize this process of refurbishment. Interviews and observations where done with repairers and refurbishers. Based on the results of the consumer research three different target groups were identified; the ecological buyer, the economical buyer and the secure buyer. Consumer research shows that the three aspects reparability, cleanability and timelessness cause a more efficient refurbishment process and a greater customer acceptance of the refurbished products. These aspects are turned into a set of guidelines that will serve as proposed requirements to design for refurbishment. They must be taken into account when designing the product, choosing materials and maintaining the product. However, only incorporating these guidelines would not be sufficient to enhance the consumer acceptance of refurbished products. Research showed that not only performance of the product plays a large role in the acceptance of the product. Awareness and trust should also be created. In addition, the experience of buying a refurbished product should be as fun and exciting as buying a new product. It was found, that when the product still looks like new, the customer is more likely to trust the product. The concept ‘looking good, feeling good’ is created on this insight. The core of the concept is that part of the cover can be replaced or refinished. Therefor the machine looks new while preserving the internal components and 80% of materials used in the cover. The customers can compose their own refurbished product by starting out with a refurbished base and then choose their own new or refurbished cover to create a stronger product attachment. All findings where combined and translated to a redesign of a fully automatic coffee machine. This was done by improving the accessibility of internal components and to create a modular structure on the inside of the coffee machine in order to make the process of repairing and cleaning more efficient. Moreover, three different front designs were created that meet the requirements of the aesthetics that are preferred for refurbishment. Combinations of colors and materials were tested with the target groups and the result were evaluated.","Refurbishment; Circular Economy; Aesthetics; Product Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

Potential fuel consumption reduction by trim optimization is 0.5 to 3 % and to up to 7% in extreme cases. Stolt Tankers, a shipping company active in the chemical tanker market, wants to increase the energy efficiency of their ships in operation by trim optimization. For a limited number of ships, trim tables from model scale towing tests are available, but these are not used and the accuracy of these tables are unknown. The objective of this research was to develop a method to decrease fuel consumption by trim optimization, by a dynamic fuel consumption estimation model based on available operational data, that can be integrated in the voyage management system of Stolt Tankers. A dynamic fuel consumption estimation model has been developed, using mainly the noon report data of the C-38 ship class, consisting of six sister vessels of 38 000 DWT chemical tankers. Quality of noon report data is an issue: human error in observing and recording data causes noise and a mismatch exists between the snapshot of conditions on one hand, and the 24 hr averaged sailing speed and recorded shaft power or fuel consumption on the other hand. A data pre-processing framework has been developed and applied to integrate and transform the data, clean and filter the data. The model is able to extract the effects of speed through water, mean draft, trim, sea water temperature, wind force, sea state and swell state and their relative direction to the ship and days since last hull cleaning and propeller polishing. The model has shown to perform optimal using the regression model of Lutzen and Kristensen (2013), combined with a multiple layer feed-forward neural network, consisting of 1 hidden layer with 15 neurons. The model is able to estimate the shaft power with an average accuracy of 6.58 % for a random test set of the noon report data. It is able to extract the effect of trim on shaft power and to consider the effect of weather and fouling conditions. Model results show that about 1 to 2% of shaft power per 0.50 m can be saved, with trim by bow being the optimal trim. Based on sea trial results, it is concluded that the model performs most accurate for conditions that are represented by a high quantity of historical data. The model can be applied for speeds between 12 and 14 knots and for mean draft conditions of 9.5 m and more. Within this range, the effect of trim and weather conditions are followed with reasonable accuracy. It is confirmed by the sea trial that trim by bow is the optimal trim, with a much stronger magnitude of the effect of trim on shaft power. A difference of 6 to 8% in shaft power was found for a change in trim of 0.50 m.","Trim optimization; noon report; grey-box modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design, Production and Operations","",""

Road removal or road reallocation can be considered as a means to induce reduced demand for car mobility. Yet, the implementation of these measures can count on resistance. This resistance is negatively influencing the plan development and decision making required for the transition. The aim of this research was to gain insight in and obtain knowledge on the social feasibility of the implementation of measures inducing reduced demand, to be able to enhance this social feasibility and so to enable the transition. The main research question is: “How to enhance the social feasibility of the implementation of measures inducing reduced demand in car mobility?” To answer this question not only the practice of implementing measures inducing reduced demand has been researched, but also theory has been researched to gain insights on an abstract level which can contribute to answering the main research question. The aim of the research in practice was to gain insight in various aspects of social feasibility for road closure projects in Amsterdam. For this a case study was performed. The case study entailed of an combination of research methods: interviews with professionals, a survey and a reflection group as well as some methods to gain neighbourhood specific knowledge like socio demographics and traffic intensities. The theoretical research originates from the idea to reflect on the way how transitions, like the one to a sustainable car system, and innovations, such as road removal, come about. For this reflection literature in the realm of Actor Network Theory and Complex Systems Theory was reviewed. From this review two concepts were derived, namely ambiguity and uncertainty. These concepts were explored by interviewing innovators. To them it was asked: How to handle ambiguity and uncertainty in order to be able to innovate? It can be concluded, based on the analysis of the surveys, the interviews and the results of the reflection group, that social feasibility of measures is heavily impacted by ambiguity and uncertainty. Yet, from the reflection on theory, it can be concluded that embracing ambiguity and uncertainty will enhance social feasibility of measures. To achieve this, the professionals and innovators recommend the application of stakeholder involvement and experiments. <br","social feasibility; reduced demand; socio-technical perspective; case study","en","master thesis","","","","","","Joint Master of Science in Metropolitan Analysis, Design and Engineering at Delft University of Technology and Wageningen University & Research.","","","","","","Metropolitan Analysis, Design and Engineering (MADE)","",""

With the development of harmonic balance (HB) methods and adjoint optimization, questions arise on the concrete benefits of using one method over another. This research investigates the difference in predictive capability and computational cost between unsteady harmonic balance and steady-state flow solving methods in particular. The research is performed using the SU2 software suite. The relevant set of scaling parameters is established based on a dimensional analysis. Variation of several of these nondimensional parameters - namely the flow and work coefficient, specific heat ratio gamma, isentropic pressure-volume exponent gamma-Pv and volumetric flow ratio - constitute the different setups. Given the excessive computational times associated with full optimizations, this large set of case studies is subjected to one flow evaluation. Trends and conclusions are made based on the resulting data. It is found that the accuracy difference between steady and HB solvers decreases slightly with an increase in flow coefficient as reduced frequency goes down, and increases significantly with the stage work coefficient as Mach effects increase. Varying working fluids under the ideal gas law is found not to impact the stage and solver performance given the volumetric flow ratio as a similarity parameter. In cases where gamma-Pv is significantly larger than gamma, a major increase in stage Mach numbers is observed. Consequently, the difference between results found by steady-state and harmonic balance solvers is considerably larger. Upon increasing the volumetric flow ratio over the stage, stage efficiencies have been found to increase and solver performance differences to decrease. A pair of complete optimizations then aims to bring additional insights and to verify the validity of the simulation results. The optimizations illustrate the effects of the behavior observed in flow simulations on a full optimization process and reiterate the difference in computational time between both methods. In both cases, the HB-optimized turbine stages are more efficient than the equivalent steady-optimized cascades, namely by 0.58% and 0.12%. The predictive capability of steady-state solvers in comparison with unsteady solvers is found to be dependent on reduced frequency, work coefficient and stage maximum Mach number. A new parameter consisting of those three quantities, the adjusted reduced frequency, forms a linear relationship with the deviation in steady versus unsteady results. It can thus be used as an indicative parameter in preliminary design to trade off accuracy and computational time and select the right solver for a given case.","harmonic balance method; Turbomachinery; Adjoint optimization; computational fluid dynamics; shape optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

In these type of flows, the Boussinesq hypothesis does not hold and often leads to erroneous predictions by eddy viscosity models. In an attempt to capture these non-equilibrium effects, lag parameter models introduce a lag parameter, which is derived from an elliptic blending Reynolds stress model. A novel deterministic machine learning algorithm, referred to as Sparse Regression of Turbulent Stress Anisotropy (SpaRTA), has been used with the objective of developing a data-driven turbulence model based on the elliptic blending k − ω lag parameter model and evaluating its performance in terms of generalizability, interpretability and its ability to infer the quantities of interest. Corrective terms are introduced and computed directly from high-fidelity data to account for the model-form error by using the k-corrective-frozen-RANS approach. SpaRTA is then used to infer algebraic stress models for these corrective terms using a Galilean invariant integrity basis. It was shown that the k-corrective-frozen-RANS framework has the ability of representing the mean flow features by propagating the corrective terms through a CFD model in OpenFOAM and comparing its result to high-fidelity data. Cross-validation is used to test the performance of the models on unseen data using three flow cases that involve separation, namely periodic hills (Re=10595), converging-diverging channel (Re=12600) and curved backward-facing step (Re=13700). In order to assess the impact of the additional transport equation of the lag parameter, the same data-driven approach was applied to the conventional two-equation k − ω model. Utilizing an additional transport equation for the lag parameter in this data-driven approach did not result in any significant improvements in terms of predictive capability or generalizability, as both data-driven approaches showed a similar performance, although the data-driven k − ω models were more numerically stable. It was found that corrective terms formulated using a reduced integrity basis yields data-driven models that have a similar predictive capability compared to models that used the full integrity basis to construct the corrective terms. A significant portion of the resulting data-driven models showed an improvement in predictive capability over the standard (non-data-driven) k − ω model. Furthermore, most of the models were able to generalize their predictions to two-dimensional flow cases that had different complexity and showed a significant improvement over the baseline k − ω model.","machine learning; turbulence modeling; sparse symbolic regression; data-driven; RANS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This tunnel concept will consist of an immersed tube, either attached with anchor cables to the seabed or attached to pontoons floating on the water surface. The reliability of the tether-stabilized SFT is assessed in this research. A suitable target reliability is determined in order to design a full probabilistic SFT. Subsequently, a calibration of partial factors from Eurocode is performed. The robustness of the structure is also analyzed and improvements are suggested. Important failure mechanisms are defined as yielding and slackening of the tethers, longitudinal failure and transverse shear failure of the tube. A first-order reliability method (FORM) and a Monte Carlo simulation (MC) are performed for the limit state functions of these mechanisms. Design parameters are determined so that a target reliability index of 3.8 is met, because of consistency with Eurocode. Consequently, the design points from FORM are used to calculate partial factors for different loading types. The calculated factors and the general partial factors from Eurocode are compared. Slackening of the tethers proved to be the governing failure mechanism in this analysis. The resistance against slackening depends on the force equilibrium, whereas the resistance of the other mechanisms depends on structural strength. The influence factors from the FORM analysis indicated that permanent loading parameters were dominant, i.e.\ concrete density, water density and tube diameter. It was found that for the strength (STR) mechanisms, the factors from Eurocode result in an overly safe design of the SFT. The calculated partial factors for unfavorable permanent load and variable load are significantly lower than the corresponding general factors from Eurocode. For the equilibrium (EQU) case, Eurocode is not safe to be applied. The general partial factor for the unfavorable permanent loading is insufficient. The robustness of the structure is assessed by considering important scenarios. Excessive leakage has large consequences and will result in global structural failure. However, it has a low probability of occurrence. Mitigating measures are available to prevent failure due to leakage. Furthermore, an SFT will be constructed at a specific location. Wave conditions and geolocation need to be taken into account to reach an optimal design. At a depth of 30 meters, the impact of waves becomes insignificant. Lastly, failure of a single tether should not result in failure of adjacent tethers (i.e. progressive failure). A redundant system can be created by installing more or higher quality tethers. Consequently, when all four tethers of one element fail at the same time, this does not result in longitudinal failure. Overall, it was demonstrated that the reliability requirements of the SFT can be met in the design. Moreover, the design can be optimized by a full probabilistic calibration of partial factors.","Submerged Floating Tunnels; Eurocode; Tethers; Partial factors; First order reliability method; Monte Carlo simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

When this equilibrium is not reached, when the face support pressure is too low or too high, settlements will occur. In this research settlement and pore water pressure measurements are used to monitor the behavior of the soil and estimate the stability of the tunnel face. During boring of the tunnel, the exact stability of the face is not known. The TBM driver has to rely on the provided stratigraphy data, the advised face support pressures range provided by the geotechnical engineers and the experience of the tunnel boring team. Monitoring is not yet used to determine the face stability during construction. To do so, field data from a case study at RijnlandRoute is compared with analytical and numerical models. Sensitivity of the measurement equipment, and of both the analytical (DIN) and numerical model (Plaxis 3D) with respect to soil parameters, are considered. It has been found that the strength parameters of the layer in which the face is located have the highest influence on the minimum face support pressure. For the maximum face support pressure this is the volumetric weight of the entire soil profile above the face. For comparing the (soft soil) field data with numerical results, a Plaxis 3D model is built, and it is determined that HSsmall is a suitable constitutive model to capture the interaction between face stability, tunneling operations and soil behavior. It is shown that the tail void injection influences the settlements above and in front of the cutter head, but this influence is discarded and replaced by a wished in place lining, to simplify the numerical model. A scenario analysis on the sensitivity of soil parameters shows settlements do not vary significantly between the characteristic low and high values. In this analysis correlation of parameters is taken into account. The failure mechanism for the minimum face support pressure coincides with the active cave-in failure mechanism found in literature. For the maximum face support pressure the failure mechanism found in Plaxis 3D does not coincide with the expected hydraulic fracturing failure mode. The continuum representation of the soil in Plaxis 3D does not allow a hydraulic fracturing like failure mechanism to develop. Instead, a blow-out approximately 10 m. in front of the cutterhead occurs. This behaviour better resembles the failure mechanism of a EPB TBM. The field data gathered from the case study shows a thrust wave in front of the cutter head in both settlement and pore water pressure measurements. This thrust wave reaches up to 20 to 40 meters in front of the TBM. The heave induced by the thrust wave reduces the amount of settlements after the TBM passage. Excess pore pressures, induced by a high thrust wave, affect the face stability negatively. The excess pore pressure mainly depends on the advance rate. The higher the advance rate, the less time the pore pressures have to dissipate, leading to an increase in excess pore pressure. The accuracy of the settlements measurement devices is 0.8 mm., and of the spade cells 1.0 kPa. In general, the field data shows settlement curves corresponding to the Peck (1969) Gaussian curve (in lateral and longitudinal direction). Comparing the case study settlements with the numerically generated settlement curves show similar trends. The field data shows lower settlements than the numerical results. This can be due to the presence of excess pore pressures, the accuracy of the TBM data or its interpretation. A method to increase the accuracy, which is expected to result in a better fit with the numerical results, was found in a late phase of the research. This method takes into account the settlements which are induced by the thrust wave in front of the TBM. Comparing the numerical and analytically determined limit support pressures, it is found that the minimum face support pressure are similar in both methods. As similar failure mechanisms are found, numerical modelling seems a reliable way of determining the face stability. However, due to the limited range of applied support pressures available from the TBM data set, limit states could not be fully analyzed. To assure the reliability of a numerical model to determine the actual face stability based on surface settlements during the construction phase, additional research must be done. It is suggested to extend the methods used in this research with physical modelling. For maximum face support pressures, the analytical and numerical models do not coincide. Hydraulic fracturing cannot be modelled in Plaxis 3D. It is recommended not to use numerical modelling to determine the face stability based on settlements at face pressures higher than the face pressures at which an equilibrium is achieved.","Numerical Modelling; Face stability; Tunneling; Monitoring; Safety; Plaxis 3D; Settlements","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","RijnlandRoute",""

(graduation committee); Winsemius, Hessel (graduation committee); de Bruijn, Karin (mentor); Verhoeven, Govert (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The number of fatalities due to a potential flood event is traditionally determined utilizing 'mortality functions’. Data of recent large-scale flooding in the Netherlands are not available since the Netherlands was successful in flood prevention. Therefore, only data from the last coastal flood event in 1953 with 1795 direct fatalities are available. The mortality functions are empirical relationships to provide mortality as a function of three explicit flood characteristics, namely water depth, flow velocity, and water level rise rate. Many more factors are included implicitly since the functions were derived from 1953 data. These underlying factors are thus based on the circumstances of the coastal flooding in 1953 and might not be representative anymore for future flood events elsewhere in the Netherlands. The three flood characteristics in current flood risk assessments are determined by means of coarse flood simulations. Since modern software is becoming more advanced, more detailed flood simulations are becoming possible. Therefore, the applicability of the mortality functions needs to be studied if finer model resolutions are used. This report presents the case study of river area the Bommelerwaard in which the validity of the 1953-based functions, possibilities for alternative functions, and finer model resolutions in hydrodynamic models are tested and analyzed with regards to their impact on flood fatality risk. A hydrodynamic model is developed using the new software program D-Flow Flexible Mesh which is able to apply finer resolutions at locations that require more detail. The different model resolutions that are tested are 100m and 25m, and 5m for the area close to the breach. The flood simulations with these model resolutions resulted in similar outcomes for the number of estimated fatalities in this case study. Overall, the 100m model is preferred because it is sufficiently able to indicate the dangerous locations, provide the order of magnitude of the flood characteristics, while it demands short computation times and matches the level of detail of the data of 1953. However, it is recommended to model the area around the breach (‘breach zone’) with finer model resolutions because the resulting higher local peak velocities are relevant for potential building collapse. For the areas around obstacles and underpasses, it is also recommended to use finer resolutions or to make use of 1D objects or fixed weirs. This study concluded that finer model resolutions at dangerous locations have an impact on the individual risk value of the neighbourhood, and this can have consequences for the maximum individual risk value and thus the overall safety standard of a large dike ring. Furthermore, the case study illustrated that compartment dikes have a significant impact on the local mortality because of the high water level rise rates just upstream. It is recommended to look into possibilities to reduce this high local mortality rate and hence, individual risk, for example by optimizing the location and number of compartment dikes or exploring the effects of openings in the dikes. Moreover, this study identified the discussion points in the current Dutch loss of life approach by a literature study, knowledge of recent flood events abroad, and loss of life approaches internationally. Alternative mortality functions are proposed based on the literature and analyzed through sensitivity analyses in the case study. It is recommended to substantiate and take into account the factors water arrival time, improved building characteristics, and age in the loss of life approach. Preventive evacuation is already taken into account in this approach, but in addition, water arrival time can be included by means of fleeing. This study shows that water arrival time has a great effect on the number of fatalities because some areas have relatively large arrival times and this enables inhabitants to flee the area. Emergency response is thereby of crucial importance. Also in 1953 this factor proved to be relevant. The improved building characteristics compared to 1953 are shown to have a limited impact on the absolute number of fatalities in this case study but it reduced the maximum value of the individual risk and is thus of relevance, especially for dike ring areas with large water depths (&gt;2.1m) and high rise rates (&gt;0.5m/h). Moreover, this study underlines the vulnerability of the elderly during flood events. Since the age distribution has shifted since 1953 and significantly more elderly are present in society nowadays, it is relevant to take this explicitly into account. This case study shows that correcting for age can have a significant impact on the number of fatalities. The impact on the individual risk is limited, but this depends on the spatial distribution of the elderly and should be further analyzed. Finally, the individual risk is sensitive to the configuration of the neighbourhoods. It is therefore also recommended to look into more robust approaches to determine the individual risk.","Flood Risk; Flood fatalities; Loss of Life; Flood impact assessment; D-Flow FM; Flood simulation; Hydrodynamic model; Mortality functions; River flooding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","","51.806688, 5.284161"

Since the fifties of the XIX century, it has gained an important role in many sectors of water treatment applications. In general, the flux variability, the small space requirement, and the limited energy consumption excel as some of the most relevant advantages of the DAF system. However, because of its not always excellent removal efficiency, DAF applications are usually considered as pre-treatment technologies to reduce the particles' load from more effective technologies as sand or membrane filtration technologies. Briefly, the amelioration of the suspended solids' separation is of particular interest because it decreases the maintenance cost of the next filtration units and, in some cases, it might substitute them. Coagulation and flocculation processes prove to be of extreme importance for the DAF performance as it is characterized by particles cut-off around 1-10 μm. The purpose of this research was the application of extra-polymeric substances (EPS) as a flocculant to enlarge the floc dimension of an anaerobic digested sludge and improve DAF efficiency. In the literature the flocculation ability of EPS is not completely acknowledged, but there are some succesfully results with microalgae and activated sludge. Specifically, the feasibility of producing EPS directly on-site, is interesting because it makes the treatment plant possibly independent from the flocculant purchase. Moreover, an extra amount of EPS might be sold (1$/kg) or used for the production of other valuable products (e.g. biodiesel production). <br/>In collaboration with the Water Lab at the faculty of Civil Engineering in Delft and Royal Haskoning (DHV), it was possible to perform some experiments to understand the flocculation properties of EPS in the dissolved air flotation technologies. More specifically, the effects of the EPS were studied with two experiments: a jar test and a flotation column experiment. The sludge used for the experiment was collected from Harnashpolder facility after being digested for at least 25 days. With the jar test experiments, it was examined the effects of sludge settleability (5 gTSS/L): increasing EPS doses (200-1200 mgEPS/L), increment by 20% the original SVI value, on average. Furthermore, it was performed a small scale flotation experiment with two Alka seltzer pills. After a certain EPS dose (400 mgEPS/L), TSS in the formed foam resulted 1.78 times more concentrated. Finally, it was also analysed the particle size distribution (PSD) variation, but the measurements were characterized by a high standard deviation which reduced the reliability of the results. The scope of these first experiments was the individuation of a certain EPS dose to apply in the flotation column experiment simulating the DAF performance (800 mgEPS/L). The EPS addition did not improve the quality of the effluent (65%), and was slightly inferior to the blank series (69%). However, the obtained foam was almost 1.75 times more concentrated when compared to the blank solution. Towards the end of the experiment, a better removal efficiency was notated within the EPS series and it was correlated to the foam concentration (R2= 0.989). Despite the errors, PSD of the EPS series were characterized by a higher frequency of small particles, between 1-10 μm. In the discussion chapter two explanations are proposed considering the effect of zeta potential variations after the EPS addition. In conclusion, the use of EPS to enhance the solid-liquid separation of the sludge was not successful. However, further research with different doses of EPS and different types of sludge should be studied to assess the potential use of EPS to improve the efficiency of a DAF system.","DAF; EPS; Flocculation; solid removal; particles size distribution","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","LOTHUSHR",""

Daarom is het interessant om meer inzicht te krijgen in deze transitiezones en welke responsies zij leveren bij een overrijdende trein.<br/> Het doel van dit rapport is om deze responsies in kaart te brengen en vervolgens het effect van enkele maatregelen op deze responsies te toetsen. Dit leidt tot de volgende onderzoeksvraag: Hoe kunnen de responsies in een transitiezone met gebruik van de eindige-elementenmethode in een model worden verduidelijkt?<br/> Voor het modelleren wordt gebruikgemaakt van het eindige-elementenmethodeprogramma Ansys. Als uitgangspunt voor het model wordt de labopstelling van de TU Delft genomen. In deze opstelling bestaat de transitiezone uit een bak met ballast met daaroverheen een spoorweg. Aan de uiteinden vormen stalen liggers het regulier spoor en het civiel kunstwerk.<br/>Het gecreëerde model wordt vergeleken met de analytische Zimmermanmethode om het model te kunnen valideren. Verder geeft het Ansysmodel extra inzicht in de directe overgang van regulier spoor op het civiel kunstwerk en kunnen ontstane spanningen beter worden bepaald.<br/> Drie mogelijke maatregelen worden aangedragen om de spanningen en verplaatsingen te verminderen in de transitiezone, waardoor er een daling in de onderhoudskosten kan worden bereikt. Deze drie maatregelen, het verbreden van dwarsliggers, het aanbrengen van railframes en het verlijmen van ballast, zijn alle gericht op de bovenbouw, omdat deze op relatief korte termijn kunnen worden geïmplementeerd.<br/> Wat betreft de zakkingen in y-richting worden deze bij alle drie maatregelen kleiner. Hierbij zorgen de verbrede dwarsliggers en de railframes voor enkele procenten mindering van de normale zakking. Het verlijmen van ballast heeft nog meer effect. Met deze maatregel kan de maximale zakking met meer dan dertig procent worden gereduceerd.<br/> Als er gekeken wordt naar de verandering in spanning in het ballastbed en de ondergrond als gevolg van de voorgestelde maatregelen, kan een minder eenduidig beeld worden geschetst. Sommige spanningen nemen toe, terwijl andere spanningen kleiner worden. Wel kan worden gesteld dat door het verlijmen van ballast de spanning in de ondergrond toeneemt.<br/> Om die reden is het niet mogelijk om één maatregel te kiezen die het beste werkt om de problemen in de transitiezone op te lossen. Op basis van de zakkingen heeft het verlijmen van ballast het meeste effect, terwijl de verbrede dwarsliggers en de railframes juist zorgen voor een afname ofwel het gelijk blijven van de spanningen in het ballastbed en de ondergrond.","","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","Railway Engineering",""

This thesis focuses on developing a fully integrated five phase auction based coopetition model, a form of horizontal collaboration where competition is preserved. A combinatorial auction is used to exchange transportation requests without having to reveal critical company information. Freight forwarders submit requests into an auction pool, where they are grouped into attractive bundles by a central planner and offered for auction. The request selection and bundling procedures, developed in this thesis, are based on the time windows of the request deliveries. A freight forwarder’s bid on each bundle is equal to the marginal profit of that bundle, which is obtained by solving two NP-hard routing problems with a simulated annealing and large neighbourhood search metaheuristic. A unique aspect of the auction, is that the dock capacity of the ground handlers is taken into account, which helps to alleviate truck congestion at the ground handlers. The potential of the auction based coopetition model is shown for an air cargo supply chain scenario. There is a clear increase in profitability for the collaborating freight forwarders, because the auction model decreases the transportation costs for the entire coalition. This cost reduction is achieved by an increase in transport efficiency, while the collaboration disadvantages as seen in literature are limited.","Combinatorial auction; LTL Planning; Collaboration; Competition; Potential; Congestion; Dock Capacity; PDPTW; Request Exchange","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

Nitrogen oxides like Nitric oxide (NO) and Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are mainly responsible for the acid rain and smog. Nitrous oxide (N2O), also known as the laughing gas, is the major greenhouse gas that is responsible for the ozone layer's damage in the troposphere. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) report, one pound of N2O is 300 times more potent greenhouse gas than one pound of CO2. The significant emitters of Nitrogen oxides (NOx) are automobiles, agricultural sources, thermal power plants, and chemical processes like Nitric acid production plants, paint manufacturing, etc.   This study mainly focuses on the tail gas emitted from the Nitric acid production facility. The tail gas emitted during the HNO3 production consists of almost 2% of O2, 200-400 ppm of NO2, and NO, whereas 800 ppm of N2O.  As N2O is the most emitted gas from the Nitric acid production facility, it is followed by NO2 and NO, so it is essential to reduce these pollutants from the tail gas. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) is a well-known technique currently involved in reducing NOx via the adsorption process from the Nitric acid production facility. But the costs involved in these methods are quite high. Nanoporous materials like zeolite exhibit uniform pore size and high thermal stability are said to be the promising adsorbents of NOx. The availability of a large number of zeolites makes it impossible to identify the proper zeolite for NOx adsorption experimentally. In such situations, molecular simulations are a powerful tool that can help identify the perfect zeolite. The time and cost involved in the process of molecular simulations are very low.  In this work, Monte Carlo simulations involving reaction ensemble are implemented to obtain the equilibrium composition of NOx components at desired operating conditions in the Brick molecular simulation package. This is followed by Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations (GCMC) and Reactive Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations (RXMC-GCMC) for pure and quaternary NOx gas mixture adsorption in five different zeolites (FAU, FER, MOR, MFI, and TON) using simulation package RASPA. The composition results from the reaction ensemble are validated with the composition results obtained using the Gibbs minimization technique in the MATLAB model, and the results are in good agreement. The quaternary gas mixture adsorption results in five different frameworks from RXMC-GCMC simulations are then validated in Ideal adsorbed solution theory in the Python model, and the results are in good agreement at the given operating conditions.","Monte Carlo Simulation; Nitrogen Oxides; Reaction Ensemble; Grand Canonical Monte Carlo; Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory; RASPA; zeolites","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mobile C-arm use is evaluated in terms of radiation emission and radiation exposure, staff communication and procedural aspects. The current use of the mobile C-arms was evaluated based on radiation emission data obtained from the X-ray devices and systematic observations in the operating room. From the X-ray devices, the number of exposures, fluoroscopy time, Dose Area Product (DAP) and Air Kerma (AK) values were obtained for trauma, orthopedic and vascular procedures that took place in 2019 and 2020 (until 16-3-2020). These values were visualized and the correlation between the variables was investigated. Observations took place in the operating rooms of the RDGG to evaluate staff actions, staff communication, C-arm utilization and time courses. Finally, the results from previously performed experiments into staff exposure have been evaluated. For these experiments, DoseAware badges were used to measure the dose received by staff members real time during Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR). Radiation emission data of trauma procedures showed high variability and relatively low patient dose compared to vascular surgery. A positive correlation was found between the number of exposures, fluoroscopy time, DAP and AK. The strongest correlation was found between DAP and AK. During observations, the staff has indicated to be aware of how to keep radiation exposure as low as reasonably possible, however in practice, few actions are being undertaken to minimize the dose. Also, communication between surgeon and C-arm controller and the experience of the C-arm controller and surgeon seem to have significant influence on the radiation use and operating time. Mainly lack of experience of the C-arm controller has shown to affect the number of exposures and process flow. The heavy and large design of the C-arm also complicates communication and positioning. Finally, DoseAware experiments showed that during EVAR procedures, the anesthesiologist and C-arm controller receive a significant dose which can be avoided. From available data, it can be concluded that the C-arm is currently not optimally used in the Reinier de Graaf hospital. The dose received by staff members is higher than necessary in order to provide good patient care. Differences in dose received for different types of surgery that make use of the same fluoroscopy time can be appointed to the size of body parts that are operated and the use of metal. In order to optimize the use of the mobile C-arm, the number of exposures can be decreased by education of C-arm controllers and communication improvement. A redesign of the C-arm could make communicating and positioning of the C-arm easier. Also, staff awareness should lead to actions in limiting exposure by shielding and taking distance. Finally, the current system concerning C-arm controller allocation to procedures should be revised. In order to enable future improvements, radiation and procedural data should be stored more specifically and continuously.","Mobile C-arm; Operating room; Staff safety; Radiation exposure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-06-12","","","","","",""

The initial aerodynamic efficiency gain estimation was refined by Faggiano and Rubio-Pascual, confirming the interest of the solution. To prepare subscale test flights, wind tunnel tests were performed, showing a complex flow over the wing and providing an aerodynamic model predicting the longitudinal forces and moments in a given condition. In most of these works, the possible influence of the landing gear on the subject studied was mentioned, leading to consider its design. However creating the design itself is not the issue: landing gear have existed for as long as aircraft, thus methods exist to design them and they can be adapted to the Flying V. The more important question is about the influence of the gear on the aircraft: what are the consequences of adding a landing gear to the Flying V? This leads to a four step structure: choosing evaluation criteria for the gear, adapting the design method and criteria computation to work on the Flying V, validating the method and computations, and finally applying them to evaluate the consequences of the gear on the Flying V. Providing both quantified evaluation criteria and explicit design organisation, optimised design methods are used as support for the first two steps. The criteria retained are gear weight, ground manoeuvre, rotation ability, fairing drag, cabin floor height (equivalent to aircraft height from ground) and lateral stability derivatives. The last two were chosen after an exploratory study showing that the gear tends to be long, and<br/>can be shortened by increasing wing dihedral. The design methods from literature are adapted by removing the optimiser, and limiting the amount of iterations required since the gear design space on the Flying V is not fully known, which require designer decision more frequently than on conventional<br/>aircraft. Validation proves that the modified method is accurate when applied to the A350-900, with the only difference being a smaller gear track. Chosen for their simplicity, the empirical methods used to compute gear weight, shock absorber length (required in gear length) and stability derivatives prove to<br/>be quite inaccurate. The other criteria are computed using geometry, and show much better accuracy since there is no assumption of the aircraft configuration as for empirical methods. Following the outcome of the exploratory study, it is chosen to study two airframes with modified dihedral in addition to the original Flying V. The first is chosen to bring the cabin floor at 5.5 m from the ground, the second to have gear as short as possible. The main gear on the original Flying V is 6 m long, placing the cabin floor also at 6 m from the ground for an estimated total gear weight of 12.8 t. This is 10 % higher than the A350-900,<br/>and the gear is 20 % heavier than the A350-900 gear, for a similar mission and an expected lower takeoff weight. The other criteria are satisfactory. The gear on the modified airframes reduce in length by 12 to 56 %, while reducing in weight by 4 to 25 %, confirming the interest of varying dihedral as suggested in the exploratory study. Other criteria are unchanged by the dihedral variation,<br/>except for the lateral stability derivatives. Comparing with an airliner, rolling moment derivative due to sideslip is found to be 3.5 times larger, raising the question of Dutch roll and of controlling the roll angle when landing with sideslip. The other computed derivatives are slightly better but not showing<br/>interesting trends when dihedral increases. The consequences of a gear on the Flying V are then either to reduce the payload to accommodate the long and heavy landing gear, or to face undesirable stability derivatives if the gear is made shorter through dihedral.","Flying V; Landing gear; Design; Aerodynamic; controllability; Stability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flying V",""

Despite this growth, industry-wide rules and guidelines to analyse fatigue during cable installation operations are yet to be developed, even though fatigue can become an important parameter in the installation design.  In similar offshore operations, e.g. installation of pipelines or umbilicals, fatigue is assessed based on fundamental fatigue theory like rainflow counting, S-N curves and Miner's rule and therefore these principles form the basis of analysis in this research. However, submarine power cables consist of numerous layers of different materials that result in complex cable cross-sections. The fatigue behaviour of the cross-sectional elements due to external loads has been investigated to determine a maximum stand-by time during installation operations. In this regard, a cross-sectional analysis was performed to establish the stress-strain response of the individual cable components to the global cable deformations. For bending behaviour, the analysis was shown to be consistent with existing test data. However, this type of data is scarce and the analysis was based on a limited sample size. Moreover, geometrical cross-sectional data of submarine cables is rarely provided by suppliers and hence several assumptions were made in the analysis. For future work, it is recommended to develop in-house test data of cables such that the cross-sectional model can be accurately verified and improved. The cross-sectional stresses were implemented in a fatigue assessment model, in which the local stresses were calculated based on the output of global modelling software OrcaFlex and subsequently analysed with rainflow counting and Miner's rule. The model was applied to three cable types and it was found hat lead, used for cable sheaths, is the critical cable component in terms of fatigue. When no lead is used in the power cable, the conductors are the critical component. Furthermore, for mild loading scenarios, i.e. waves with significant wave heights H<sub>s</sub>≤1.5 m, the model yields components infinite life for all cable components. For higher load cases, i.e. H<sub>s</sub>≥2.5m, the model showed that fatigue mitigation measures are required to stay within the fatigue budget. Several mitigation methods were implemented, from which it was found that increasing the layback length of the cable combined with adjusting the vessel heading to favourable conditions most effectively reduces fatigue damage as all load cases with H<sub>s</sub>=2.5 m resulted in maximum stand-by times of t<sub>sb</sub>≥ 125days. However, for higher loading scenarios, i.e. Hs=4 m, all researched mitigation measures were insufficient to stay within fatigue budget. For future work, it is therefore recommended to improve the mitigation measures such that severe load cases can be survived. Lastly, the wave conditions were simulated as JONSWAP waves. These simulations are time-consuming and therefore not many loading scenarios were modelled. It is recommended to research methods to approximate wave conditions with regular waves, as the duration of OrcaFlex simulations will decrease exponentially. An increase in number of load cases will result in more accurate limit states for the cable components.  ","Fatigue Analysis; Offshore power cables; OrcaFlex; Offshore installation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-06-11","","","","","",""

The project kicks-off with an analysis phase where the electroluminescent material and relevant client products are introduced. This includes a detailed description of the EL material from working principle to pre-fabricated versions possible to purchase from online stores. Next the EL materials themselves and A+N products were tinkered with. New DIY techniques are introduced which can help to create quick prototypes. This phase also was helped by three searches: experiential characterisation, luminescence measurement and connecting a sample to an oscilloscope to see how frequency affects the colour output. The surface design phase started with rapid prototyping ideas; a few selected ones were iterated on and turned into phosphor covered models that light up under UV light. The chosen concept direction is a set of twisted stripe designs that can be organised into a large pattern on a wall. The concept development started with creating all the elements of the tile set and some possible large patterns. During a long iteration phase the final version of the concept - a simple tile set with two different twist designs was developed. The last chapter describes the production of the demonstrators; the making of the EL sheets and then the assembly steps. The chapter introduces the final design - the LUX TWIST tile site. The LUX Twist Tile set is a modular surface installation that uses electroluminescent (EL) material to create an illuminated 3D pattern on a wall. The base module is a tile with twisted electroluminescent strips on it. The set consists of different tile designs, the featured twist comes in a curved and a straight option, available in left and right orientations. An empty tile is also part of the set to increase the variety of creatable patterns. The tiles can be connected with wire plugs at the back, which allows the current to flow from one to another. The last tile has to be connected to an inverter, then it can be plugged into a socket. The size of the installation and the pattern created with the different tiles can be completely customized to fit a desired environment and lighting conditions.","Electroluminescence; Surface design; Lighting design; DIY; Smart materials; Installation; Material Driven Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","In this thesis, a new data-driven finite element is developed, which is referred to as a neuromorphic element (designated as NmT2). Its goal is to reduce the computational expense of FEA models with- out compromising solution accuracy by embedding a neural network, trained on an element level. The neural network is developed such that the traditional trial-and-error approach to determin- ing its hyperparameters may be bypassed. This is achieved through a multi-objective optimization algorithm that builds networks with random configurations and uses Latin Hypercube sampling to test them on a fraction of the overall data repository. Once the algorithm reaches a state of diminish- ing returns over the development of multiple networks, the program is halted and the best perform- ing neural network is saved. The resultant network is then trained over the entire data repository consisting of over half a million datasets. The entire process of a self-designing neural network is called a neuromorphic engine. The neuromorphic engine is designed to determine the local nodal force vector of a truss mem- ber based on the structure’s geometry and axial nodal displacements. Axial tension and compres- sion are the two modes of loading that are considered and are pushed to the nonlinear regimes by including post-buckling and material plasticity. In addition, the user is provided with the option of including structural defects in the truss members. Once trained, the neuromorphic engine can be inserted within a user-element subroutine and deployed in ABAQUS. The neuromorphic element is essentially a truss element which includes the deformation ca- pabilities of beam elements. Unlike traditional FEA methods requiring multiple beam elements, a single NmT2 element can be used when meshing a truss member to model complex behaviour such as post-buckling deformation. To test the capabilities of the neuromorphic element, three case studies are designed as a proof of concept, comparing the performance of NmT2 elements against traditional FEA elements (T2D2 or B22). Overall, the NmT2 elements managed to accel- erate the computing time of an FEA model by up to 1,000%, while maintaining solution accuracy within 5%. These results affirm the potential of neural networks within active FEA simulations in the field of data-driven computational mechanics as a means to define complex nonlinear element formulations.","finite; element; ABAQUS; neural; network; deep; learning; aerospace; engineering; structures; 3D; printing; user; subroutine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

For high or full automation, self-driving vehicles will have to be able to address and solve a broad range of situations, one of which is interaction with traffic agents. For correct and save maneuvering through these situations, reliable detection of agents followed by an accurate classification of the traffic gestures used by agents is essential. This problem has received limited attention in literature to date. The objective of this work is to establish and investigate a working traffic gesture pipeline by leveraging the latest developments in the fields of computer vision and machine learning. This work investigates and compares how well state-of-the-art methods translate to traffic gesture recognition and what application specific problems are encountered. Multiple configurations based on skeletal features, estimated using OpenPose, and classified using recurrent neural networks (RNN) were investigated. Skeleton estimation using OpenPose and feature representations were evaluated using an action recognition dataset with motion capture ground-truth. Three RNN network architectures, varying in complexity and size, were evaluated on traffic gestures. The robustness of the developed system regarding viewpoint variation is explored, combined with the viability of transfer learning for traffic gestures. To train and validate these methods, a new traffic gesture dataset is introduced, on which an mAP of 0,70 is achieved. The results show that the proposed methods are able to classify traffic gestures within reasonable computation time and illustrate the value of transfer learning for gesture recognition. These promising results validate the methodology used and show that this direction warrants further research.","Machine Learning; Intelligent Vehicles; Traffic Gestures; Pose estimation; Gesture recognition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This project began by examining the affects of the flexible office (flex-office) at Delft municipality focusing on the relationships between co-workers and their feeling of relatedness, and continued with designing to enhance this feeling of relatedness. Appreciation is a key factor in the need for relatedness. Recognition from peers can build a sense of teamwork and of being part of a bigger purpose, especially for employees who work remotely or are not physically in the office regularly (Vacqua, 2019). Knowing and then using someone’s name can be considered a subtle and very effective compliment (Carnegie, 1936) and can be a form of recognition. This is because our brains need us to be liked by others. People with a ‘best friend’ at work are seven times more likely to be fully engaged in their work. However, these close and intimate relationships are challenged by flex-offices, which are being introduced more and more. People form less friendships in flex-office settings, because they feel like everyone is listening in; flex offices seem ‘too open for transparency’. Trying to counteract this by creating acoustic privacy is a big operation and does not immediately create enhanced relatedness. My design goal was to enhance the social well-being of employees in flex-offices by satisfying and supporting their need for relatedness. The first step towards relatedness is knowing each others’ names. This is a form of recognition, a subtle compliment and thus enhances the feeling of relatedness. Knowing your colleagues’ names can cause a sense of control over your environment and can give you enhanced freedom. Think about if you forgot a colleague’s name, this can cause very awkward situations and even make you avoid that colleague. But knowing your colleagues’ names is only the first step. The main reason for people to connect is proximity and if there is a functional need to connect. This proximity is thwarted by flex working and the Corona measures so people will only connect if there is a functional need to do so. Providing people with information on what they can use other people for might cause people to connect. People do not want to spend a lot of time on learning their colleagues’ names so timing is important. Through an iterative approach several design interventions led to a design where people receive a link once the meeting is made and 15 minutes prior to a meeting, with a name-learning tool and information on what you can approach these people for. After a meeting, all participants are encouraged to express appreciation to each other. Testing shows that it indeed leads to enhanced social well-being.","Design; Relatedness; Appreciation; Gemeente; Delft; flexworking; Living; Offices","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

They engage in these activities because they want to and because it makes them happy in some way. Newman et al (2013) researched the underlying psychological pathways by which leisure evokes happiness. They proposed five core psychological mechanisms through which leisure promotes subjective well-being (SWB). These mechanisms are detachment-recovery, autonomy, mastery, meaning and affiliation. Which activity triggers which mechanism, can differ per person and one activity can trigger multiple mechanisms.This project focuses on the mechanism of detachment-recovery. By utilising a user-centred approach, it was found that people were not always satisfied with their leisure time, more specifically with the recovery time they spent on the couch. The dissatisfaction had two main causes. Firstly, they were distracted from the activity they were engaging in. Secondly, they spent longer on the couch then they initially had intended to. To tackle those two causes, a smart pillow was designed.The concept of a smart pillow came to fruition by using a new perspective on smart objects, the perspective of objects with intent (OwI) (Rozendaal, Boon, &amp; Kaptelinin, 2019). Objects with intent are everyday objects that act as collaborative partners in human activity. OwI’s are a type of agent and they take advantage of the meaning of everyday things as a site for intelligence and agency. Rozendaal et al (2019) prototyped the concept of an OwI by using a wizard of Oz style of prototyping (WoZ). In this setup, the researcher acted as the sensors and intelligence of the Object. In this project, I take a step towards the design of a fully autonomous OwI by applying a data-enabled design approach (J. van Kollenburg &amp; S. Bogers, 2019).In this project, I explore how I can apply a data-enabled design approach. I show my approach, the tools I use, the visualisations I have made and the insight I have gained. By doing this I aim to inform fellow industrial design students on how they also can apply the data-enabled design. In this process, one specific visualisation was found to be very useful. This was a 3D representation of the prototype of the pillow in which data gathered by sensors in the prototype were visualised on the 3D representations. This representation was an animation which was matched with video recordings of the usage of the pillow.","Data centric research; Data-enabled activities; Object with intent; Leisure; Pillow; Smart products; user centric design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Classical vibration theory forms the base for a methodology that is developed to assess transmittance of vibrations to adjoining floor fields. Especially when the source is out of sight, humans humans are tend to classify vibrations as annoying for low vibration levels. With the introduction of new engineered timber products made wood a more suitable and used material for residential buildings. Strength- and stiffness variation is reduced by homogenizing the material and regarding soundproofing innovative concepts have been improved, such as floating screeds and resilient materials. Based on these products and acoustic concepts, 32 design combinations are studied. A distinction between forced- and free vibrations is made and related to low- and high-frequency floors. Forced vibrations are in structural dynamics described by the particular solution, and free vibrations by the homogeneous solution of the equation of motion. This solution is found through the method of separation of variables, which multiplies the space- and time-related parts. Mode shapes are studied regarding transmittance and effective measures for prevention. Fundamental frequencies of floors supported either rigid and flexible are determined with one-dimensional undamped continuous systems where supported beams are represented by equivalent springs. All floors are transformed into Single Degree of Freedom systems to include damping. These systems are assessed making use of modal superposition, for steady-state- and transient response. The behaviour of floors under walking load harmonics provides the resonant response, and free vibration of the system due to initial conditions the transient response. Since the perception of vibrations by humans is frequency-dependent, vibrations are weighted accordingly. Eurocodes currently available are found to provide guidance regarding human-induced vibrations of lightweight structures marginally. Non-timber Eurocodes do not provide an assessment method, EN1990 only provides requirements when no assessment has to be done, and current code for timber structures prescribe criteria that are not sufficient as found in the literature. The future revision of Eurocode 5 holds several methods for assessment of vibrations but is generally focussed on rigidly supported floors. In extending to this code methods are developed to acquire fundamental frequencies of flexible, supported floors, and by transformation into SDOF systems an equation is developed for the appropriate determination of modal mass for two-span or beam supported floors using a simple formula. 32 combinations of floor configurations and support conditions are assessed at the excited field and at adjoining floor fields, where both steady-state and transient response are combined. Based on this assessment, transient responses are found to contribute significantly for low-frequency floors, where generally is assumed that the mass is sufficient to neglect this response.","walking vibrations; timber structures; steady-state response; transient response","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Despite these techniques' undeniable accomplishments, they still suffer from a lack of guidance coming from the data gathered from the production phase, which makes the generation of complex test cases harder for the search process. Hence, previous studies introduced many strategies (such as dynamic symbolic execution or seeding) to address this issue. However, the test cases created by these techniques cannot assure the full coverage of the execution paths in software under test. Therefore, this thesis introduces common and uncommon behavior test generation (CUBTG) for search-based unit test generation. CUBTG uses the concept of commonality score, which is a measure of how close an execution path of a generated test case is from reproducing the same common and uncommon execution patterns observed during the real-world usage of the software. To evaluate the performance of CUBTG, we implemented it in EvoSuite and evaluated it on 150 classes from JabRef, an open-source application for managing bibliography references. We found that CUBTG managed to cover more common behaviors than plain MOSA in 75% of the cases, and more uncommon behaviors in 60% of the cases. In up to 10% of the cases CUBTG managed to find more mutants seeded by PIT by using method sequences that plain MOSA did not find.","Search-Based Software Testing; Automated Unit Testing; Common Paths Coverage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

The successful transition to a society powered by renewable energy sources is one of the major challenges our current generation faces. Renewable systems will only fully establish themselves if high conversion efficiencies can be obtained at a reasonable cost, in order to compete with conventional, carbon-based sources. With this in mind, photovoltaic solar energy can be a promising solution.<br/>This study focuses on the investigation of the potential efficiency of a thin-film tandem solar cell, combining amorphous silicon and microcrystalline silicon for a high performance device. With the use of flexible, light substrates, inexpensive modules can be manufactured in a roll-to-roll configuration to produce high efficiency products for a large scale implementation in society. The semiconductor modelling software ASA was used to optimise the structure of the tandem, identifying the absorber layer thicknesses that maximise the efficiency. Moreover, the impact of possible optical variations in the design of the device on the performance were analysed.<br/>To start, model parameters of single-junction amorphous silicon and microcrystalline silicon cells were calibrated to recreate the performance of such devices based on experimental data. By conducting a sensitivity analysis of the model parameters, this was effectively achieved. The single-junction models were combined in a tandem structure to forecast the operation of the multi-junction device.<br/>It was found that the performance of the tandem was highly sensitive to the choice of refractive indices of the layers at the junction between the two subcells. A high mismatch<br/>between the refractive indices of these layers and the absorber layers of the subcells results in an increased reflection of light to the top cell. This is beneficial for the current production of this subcell, but is too detrimental for the operation of the bottom cell. By bringing the refractive indices closer together, an efficiency of 13.0% was predicted. The inclusion of an encapsulation at the front of the cell boosts this efficiency to 13.7%, at a top/bottom absorber layer thickness combination of 160 nm/0.6 µm.<br/>The possibilities of enhancing the efficiency with an intermediate reflector were examined. The optical conditions for the ideal light distribution with such a reflector were<br/>computed to provide estimations of the potential increase in performance. For the best performing device, an increase of the initial efficiency of 13.0% to 13.2% was foreseen, at slightly thinner top cells and similar bottom cell thicknesses.<br/>All in all, the predicted efficiencies of the amorphous silicon/microcrystalline silicon tandem solar cell evidences the potential of these devices for the production of cheap,<br/>highly efficient modules. The developed analysis of the ideal intermediate reflector can be generalised to other multi-junction solar cells to establish the potential efficiency increase such a layer brings along. This can help in the decision of whether the increase in performance justifies the added manufacturing complexity and costs.","Thin-film silicon solar cells; Flexible substrate; Aluminium substrate; Multi-junction device; a-Si:H; nc-Si:H; ASA; Modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","FlamingoPV",""

With future expansions of services in mind, the capacity provided by the legacy systems could be considered insufficient. The planned implementation of the ERTMS/ETCS Level 2 system might still not provide sufficient capacity in these locations. This thesis investigates how the technological developments of the Hybrid Level 3 and ATO (GoA2) systems could contribute to the capacity of the railway network with the objective to provide a solution for the busiest part of the Dutch railway network. The capacity effects of these systems are analysed through a simulation case study on the SAAL corridor on the Dutch railway network, using a variant of the 2030 timetable. Through timetable compressions, the capacity that the different systems (ATB/NS’54, ERTMS/ETCS Level 2, Hybrid Level 3 and ATO) provide in different configurations. A further comparison between the human driver behaviour and automatic systems is made to determine where possible capacity benefits could be gained from. The thesis was partly used as an opportunity to further develop capacity modelling methods for ERTMS/ETCS and ATO based on the constraints provided by the systems and modelling software. The timetable compressions provided an overview of each separate system and configuration step and their contribution to the capacity. The results of the timetable compressions indicated that the ERTMS/ETCS Hybrid Level 3 and ATO systems provided 4 main steps for increasing capacity. 1. Improving braking behaviour through the use of ERTMS/ETCS braking curves instead of the legacy system 2. The use of shorter block sections through the ERTMS/ETCS Hybrid Level 3 system 3. An optimisation of driving/braking behaviour through the ATO system 4. The possibility to limit headway buffer times due to homogenisation of train movements brought by the ATO Sizable variations in the timetable compressions on the different part of the corridor caused by variations in the service pattern and infrastructure configuration indicated that the effectiveness of these systems will vary based on the location. This shows the importance for infrastructure managers of investigating these systems on a case by case basis when using them to increase capacity on their respective networks. The results from the case study indicate that the ERTMS/ETCS Hybrid Level 3 and ATO systems could provide a possible alternative for costly infrastructure expansion projects to increase capacity on the Dutch railway network.

Three locks were chosen to model, as they are some of the busiest locks of the Netherlands. The Krammersluizen, the Sluizen Hansweert and the Kreekraksluizen. Passage times are not collected at the locks, therefore the model was compared to SIVAK. SIVAK is the standard model for research on locks at Rijkswaterstaat. To schedule vessels in locks three types of choices can be made. Every vessel needs to be assigned to a chamber, the initiation time of locking should be decided and the order of sailing in a chamber should bedefined. By optimising these choices, passage times can be decreased. Optimising is however not straightforward, as the problem is an instance of the job shop scheduling problem. No exact algorithm has been found to solve these problems in a practical amount of time. Therefore the challange is to find a balance in solution quality and the speed of the model when creating a lock scheduling model. In this thesis, four ideas to improve the lock scheduling model by Verstichel were researched. The first idea is to change the resolution of the timesteps. The gain in performance was however not found to weight up against the loss in solution quality for resolution to be useful. The second idea is to drop the first come, first serve constraint that Verstichel created. This idea was also not found to be effective. The third idea is to divide the scheduling problem up into chunks. This is called cut separation. Chunks of around 25 vessels were found to be effective. The fourth and last idea is that of a maximum waiting time. The maximum waiting time makes the performance of the model better and also makes the scheduling model fairer. Data from the year 2016 was used to schedule all lockings. The LOSCO model is effective for reducing the average assage time per vessel with about 3.9 ± 0.12 SE minutes for the Krammersluizen and 2.0 ± 0.14 SE minutes for the Sluizen Hansweert compared to the SIVAK model. At the Kreekraksluizen, the model could not find a solution, as the Kreekraksluizen are a lot busier than the other locks that were tested. At the Kreekraksluizen on average every 7.8 minutes a vessel arrives, whereas at the Krammersluizen and the Sluizen Hansweert respectively every 14.0 and 13.0 minutes a vessel arrives throughout the year. The LOSCO model is only better than SIVAK if the lock is relatively quiet. At the busiest time of the day, typically in the afternoon, SIVAK performs better. The models perform equal at inter arrival times of around 8<br/>to 10 minutes. Optimisation on economical value of the vessels was found to be less effective than optimisation on time. Optimisation on time was also found to be fairer. The LOSCO model is a step ahead towards a practical lock scheduling model. In order to achieve a fully practical model, some simplifications need to be expanded. It is recommended to first improve the model before it is applied in practice, as the model is able to outperform SIVAK in some cases, but not in the busiest cases. After this some extra features can be implemented, such as the model dealing with vessel delays and locks with 3 chambers.","Shipping locks; Locks; Scheduling; Constraint Programming; SIVAK; inland waterways; IWT; optimisation; passage time; Krammer locks; Kreekrak locks; Hansweert locks; job shop scheduling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A knitted fabric is stretchable without the yarn needing to be stretchable. This makes searching for good working conductive yarns easier, as non-stretchable conductive yarns are a lot more common. Previous research shows that creating sensors through knitting is possible and can be achieved with simple yarns. The structure of knitted fabrics is mainly useful for creating strain sensors. Using elastic yarn with silver conductive plated yarns, different sensor test samples are created. Optimization is done to improve the sensors' signal output. Two directions for knitting a sensor were tested. The optimized sensors are used in two prototypes that are able to measure the movement of the arm and the breathing pattern of the wearer. The arm movement prototype is tested with two sensors knitted in the vertical (wale) direction and the breathing sensor was made with a long strip of a sensor knitted in the horizontal (course) direction. Both arm and breathing sensors are integrated into a full garment prototype. This prototype is tested by doing different movements and seeing how movements affect the sensor behaviour. Possible designs of a shirt with integrated arm and breathing sensors are briefly discussed to show how the look of the shirt and the integrated sensors could complement each other. The final prototype's sensor data is evaluated and recommendations are made for follow up projects based on this research. This research sets a new and fruitful step in the direction of producing commercially viable body measurement clothing for the near future.","Knitting; Sensors; Strain; Textile","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

In the majority of these cycling accidents, no other road users are involved. Because the majority of the cycling accidents are so-called single vehicle accidents, understanding the control behaviour of the cyclist can spark new insight in to effective preventive measures. This thesis aims to achieve that by reviewing the current state-of-the-art in bicycle-rider control research and subsequently proposing a new rider control model that is developed using system identification techniques. The results of a literature review are used to propose a novel bicycle-rider control model structure that includes realistic human neural and cognitive characteristics to predict control behaviour for stabilizing a bicycle. Sensory integration is modelled with a Kalman filter, and human control and prediction capabilities are mimicked with a Linear-Quadratic-Regulator (LQR) and Tapped-Delay-Line predictor, respectively. Human neuromuscular dynamics are included in the model structure in the form of a second order filter and the bicycle dynamics are modelled with the linear Whipple bicycle model. Two different experimental data sets during which cyclists are laterally (roll) perturbed on instrumented bicycles are used: one collected at the UC Davis on both a horse treadmill and in a sports pavilion and the other collected at the TU Delft on a public cycling path (without other road users). The human steer response to the perturbation is separated from other effects caused by unknown disturbances and noise with a non-parametric Finite-Impulse-Response model. A structured system identification approach is used to determine the final free parameter set that approximates the non-parametric model in the best way possible. The data sets are split in a train set and a test set. The model structure is fitted to the train set. The predictive performance is verified by applying the resulting model to the test set. For the UC Davis data, the resulting model has one rider dependent parameter that describes human bicycle-balancing control behaviour for the entire evaluated forward velocity range (2-8 m/s). This parameter is the weight placed on the roll angle in the LQR control algorithm. The single-run training performance in terms of Variance-Accounted-For (VAF) with the non-parametric model reaches up to 97 %. Test performance incurred a VAF drop, on average, of around 10 %. The steer responses of the TU Delft experiment can be predicted with a model that has two rider dependent parameters: the weights placed on the roll angle and roll rate in LQR control algorithm. Training performance reaches up till 83 % and test performance incurred a VAF drop, on average, of around 7%. Promising future directions are the inclusion of a passive rider model to further increase the fidelity of the model. The investigation of the stability margins of the proposed bicycle-rider controller and their sensitivity to bicycle design and/or human sensory and cognitive decline can lead to tailored measures to reduce the injury rate among cyclists.","Bicycle; Control Identification; System Identification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-05-10","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Jiangsu Province is among these regions, which shows large socio-economic differences between north and south. The Chinese Central Government has allocated Binhai County as a new coastal development zone to lessen inequality. New infrastructure (e.g. Binhai Port) was constructed and industrialisation increased in order to boost local development. Binhai County is located at the Abandoned Yellow River Delta. In 1855, the Yellow River shifted its course which cut off sediment supply to the delta. Major land retreat was stopped by the construction of sea dikes from the 1930's. Ongoing erosion is undermining the present sea defence and endangers the hinterland. The erosion along the delta has engaged the disappearance of mudflat area. Furthermore, large development in southern Jiangsu has led to constraints in usable land for which large mudflat areas were reclaimed. Multiple research pointed the negative effects of reclamation activities on ecology (e.g. decline of shorebird populations). After recognition of the importance of mudflats by the Chinese Central Government, the national policy was set to protect and restore mudflats along the Chinese coast. The erosive features of the Abandoned Yellow River Delta (AYRD) needs counteracting measures. Within this research it is aimed to integrate a multi-purpose design in which engineering and ecology are mutually enhanced. Following the Building with Nature guidelines multiple innovative solutions can be presented. Within this research it is aimed to protect the delta by implementation of islands in front of the coast. Furthermore, it is aimed to enhance mudflat growth which adds ecological value to the delta area. It is expected that by implementation of islands a reduced energetic environment is created in which fine sediment can settle. The Jiangsu Regional Model (JRM) was made available for this research, which is based on Delft3D software. An outcrop has been made at the area of interest which was refined (3:1) and further referred to as the Abandoned Yellow River Delta Model (AYRDM). The hydrodynamical forcing was completed by the addition of waves. The AYRDM was set-up with three sediment fractions from which one added cohesive fraction. The production simulation was set-up for ten morphological years by using a morphological factor of 50. The better obtained understanding of the governing processes optimised island configuration design. Fifteen configurations were designed and subdivided over two series: the Basic- and Exploratory series of eight- and seven configurations respectively. The Basic series was set-up with a systematic approach in order to represent the concept of barrier islands. The Exploratory series comprehend designs based on the entrapment of sediment by using sediment transport patterns. The definition of a mudflat was set from -0.88 m to all above, relative to mean sea level in order to measure mudflat growth. The findings within the reference production simulation (without the implementation of islands) showed a flood dominant environment in which flood direction is south. Hence, south- and offshore directed residual sediment transport were observed along the AYRD. The outgoing sediment flux from the AYRDM increased by 2.2E7 ton/year when waves were included. The addition of waves increased the average grain size by 26 µm at siltation areas due to sediment stirring and cross-shore transport. The effect of island configurations showed most favourable sediment entrapment when elongated islands and small inlet widths were applied. The shallows induce larger friction on tidal movement for which current velocities and herewith sediment transport capacity is reduced over distance. Hence, depositional areas were found to be radially deflected to the south. Secondary flow, due to eddy formation, showed significant streaming induced sediment transport behind the islands ends. Small bed slopes induce larger distances between islands and mainland China, which holds for relatively larger mudflat areas. Wave penetration was reduced significantly when islands were implemented, which created a less energetic environment. The largest increase of mudflat relative to the reference simulation is 59.8 km2 after ten morphological years by implementing 16 km2 of island area. The findings within this study are representative for the Abandoned Yellow River Delta area and show the potential of islands in order to protect the delta and create additional ecological/recreational benefits alongside.","Building with Nature; Delft3D; Nature-based solution; Islands; Shorebirds; Yellow Sea; Jiangsu Province; Abandoned Yellow River Delta; Binhai County; China; Binhai Port; Mudflat","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","34.304677, 120.285646"

As this flood risk increases, initiatives to mitigate the effects of climate change in the coastal zone are also increasingly sought. During recent years, the view that these measures should be circular has gained significant momentum. In line with this, the idea that sediment should not be treated as waste, but as a valuable product in a circular economy has been widely accepted. Within this theme, the sediment uses as resources in circular and in territorial economies (SURICATES) was created to develop and execute eco-innovative solutions for the reuse of sediments in Western Europe. As a part of SURICATES, over the course of a nine week pilot, a total of 500 tonnes of sediment was reallocated in a designated area in the Rotterdam Waterway, with the expectation that this sediment would be transported out of the Rhine-Meuse estuary into the North Sea. The SURICATES project is one of the first real large-scale efforts to reuse sediment for economic as well as ecosystem services. Effective implementation of the SURICATES project, however, requires a thorough understanding of the governing physical processes impacting the distribution of the deposited sediment locally. Furthermore, to assess the feasibility of similar future applications, efficient modelling of the pilot project is necessary. The work presented here aims to elucidate the hydrodynamic processes that are governing in the Rotterdam Waterway, within the framework of the SURICATES pilot project, and assess the reproducibility of these processes by (two) predictive models that are currently operational at the Port of Rotterdam. A special 6-hour monitoring survey was set up to measure salinities, velocities, temperature, and suspended particulate matter (SPM) along a transect crossing the reallocation location. In combination with a literature review, this dataset provides the basis for research into the predictive capabilities of two currently operational hydrodynamic models. Analysis of this dataset reveals the dominant terms in the momentum balance, the influence of Coriolis, the occurrence of internal waves, and the effect that all these mechanisms may have on the SPM distribution around the reallocation location. When the system dynamics are elucidated, the model performance of the two hydrodynamic models is assessed—both quantitatively and qualitatively. It is also investigated whether phase shifts are introduced in the models. It is found that the primary hydrodynamic processes in the Rotterdam Waterway are related to the barotropic tidal asymmetry imposed at the river mouth, the tidal excursion of the salt wedge, baroclinic exchange flow processes, and turbulence damping at the pycnocline. Turbulence damping at the pycnocline generally poses an upper limit to the (re)distribution of SPM over the water column, although field data suggests that this damping may not be sufficient to counteract diffusion processes locally. This effect occurs under certain forcing conditions and during low water slack. Furthermore, an internal Froude number analysis provides evidence for the possible generation of internal waves in one of the river’s bends. The evaluated models, however, are not capable of reproducing all of these hydrodynamic processes adequately. Although both models adequately reproduce water levels and the vertical velocity structure, they have difficulties predicting the pycnocline height. Additionally, it is found that both models introduce a small phase shift in the velocity and salinity prediction. The research presented here is a contribution to the understanding of the governing hydrodynamic processes in the Rotterdam Waterway, and the effect that (in)accurate modelling of these processes may have on future studies. Recommendations following from this research could improve future modelling practices.","Hydrodynamic modelling; SIMONA; Stratification; Port of Rotterdam; SURICATES; Rotterdam Waterway; Sediment reuse; Eco-innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","51.928149, 4.225140"

It contributes to our social contacts, physical health and quality of life. Intimacy also plays an important role in the lives of elderly, despite certain prejudices. Nevertheless, there is often a lack of attention for intimacy in elderly care. This graduation project therefore aims to give intimacy a place in elderly care. During this project, a literature study and interviews with professionals are conducted to explore the current state of knowledge. An additional user research with resident in elderly care is done to explore the user needs. Multiple design directions are explored with creative sessions, quick prototyping and user testing. A final design is created based on all the collected insights, which is evaluated with care givers and residents. Intimacy is defined as a social interaction between two persons, which creates a reciprocal feeling of connectedness. It consists of intimate behavior and intimate experiences, that can take place with different intimate relationships. Intimacy is a broad concept and very personal, since everyone has different needs and desires. Care givers in elderly care are often unaware of the importance of intimacy for residents. Intimacy is barely discussed and care givers do not act on it considerately. Due to a lack of education about intimacy in elderly care, care givers find it hard to handle intimate needs and desires. Discussing intimacy is also challenging since it is a personal and sensitive topic. The goal of this project is to create awareness about positive intimacy for residents in elderly care, and to provide care givers with a conversation starter, by designing a small moment of intimacy in public that is active and light-hearted. Creating awareness about the existence and importance of intimacy is the first step in making a change in the behavior of the elderly care context. A Bed of Roses, or in Dutch ‘Onder de Wol’, is the final design of this project. The design is a humorous and intimate photobooth of a vertical bed, in which residents can take a photograph with their partner, family, friends or care givers. This photograph is then printed and can be used as a conversation starter in combination with a booklet. This booklet contains introductory questions and illustrations about different types of intimacy. Care givers can use to booklet to initiate a conversation with residents. The photographs from the photobooth are also largely printed and displayed in a public photo exposition in the residency. The final design is tested with residents and evaluted with care givers, who all react positively and enthusiastically. Intimacy can not be forced, but a small moment of intimacy can be stimulated with a light-hearted activity, such as A Bed of Roses. The final design brings a joyful and intimate moment to the residents with the photobooth, provides care givers with the booklet that gives them confidence for a conversation and creates awareness about intimacy in elderly care with the photo exposition.","intimacy; elderly care; social design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Endo, A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) are remarkable photon detectors, that have single photon detection and energy resolving capabilities in the near-infra red and higher frequency range. At lower frequencies, MKIDs are excellent radiation detectors as well, because of their high sensitivity and natural multiplexing capabilities, which enable large scale detector arrays.In the (near) optical regime, MKIDs can use their single photon energy resolving capabilities for direct exoplanet detection, in missions like Hab-Ex or LUVOIR. This would enable atmospheric characterization, potentially finding habitual exoplanets. However, two aspects of the MKID still need improvement for this application: the photon absorption efficiency must go from 30% to 50% and the resolving power must go from 8 to 100, both for wavelengths of 1 µm. In this thesis, we study the single photon response and generation-recombination (GR) noise in optical NbTiN-Al hybrid MKIDs, to find knowledge gaps and opportunities to improve detector performance. For the single photon response, we set up a model starting from the Rothwarf-Taylor and Mattis-Bardeen equations, including the pair-breaking efficiency as only fit parameter. Both at high (220 mK and 250 mK) and low (120 mK) temperatures, the model predicted the single photon response of 4 different wavelengths correctly, with a fitted pair-breaking efficiency close to expected values (30%-70%), but somewhat high, which might be due to a non-thermal distribution of quasiparticles caused by read power. In particular, the effect of phonon trapping was captured by the model, which was verified by considering MKIDs on substrate and membrane.At lower temperatures (120 mK), a second exponential decay in both the amplitude and phase single photon pulse tail was observed, which is not explained by the model. This second decay was faster for higher read powers. For the GR noise, also an unexpected feature was observed: the GR noise level dropped exponentially, when lowering temperature (&lt;250 mK), for the amplitude, phase and cross power spectral densities (PSDs). High read powers mask this effect, due to the creation of excess quasiparticles. The noise drop was present in all analysed MKIDs, except for an MKID with an 150 nm (instead of 50 nm) thick Al film, which might be due to read power induced excess quasiparticles. When assuming the GR noise to be Poissonian, we show that the behaviour could be explained by a process which limits the quasiparticle lifetime, while keeping the quasiparticle density thermal.We hypothesize the cause of both of these unpredicted measurements to be quasiparticle trapping, which is the localisation of quasiparticles. This process is known to degrade superconducting tunnel junction detectors and limit quasiparticle lifetimes in MKIDs. A secondary ion-mass spectroscopy (SIMS) analysis showed Fe contamination on the substrate-Al film interface, which is thought to be the quasiparticle trapping cause in our systems, consistent with the observation that increasing the film thickness diminishes the GR noise drop. To our knowledge, quasiparticle trapping has not be studied in steady state experiments, such as GR noise measurements.Different models including quasiparticle trapping have been set up and can predict the amplitude PSDs, when assuming that trapped quasiparticles cannot dissipate microwave power. However, comparison of the fitted model parameters with the trapping and detrapping rates calculated by Kozorezov et al., showed a orders of magnitude difference. Combining this with the fact that amplitude, phase and cross PSDs show similar behaviour, implying that they relate to Cooper-pair fluctuations, led us to conclude that the trapping process cannot be the cause of the observed behaviour. On-trap recombination most likely plays a role in the GR noise drop, but models including this process involve cyclic transitions and non-equilibrium steady states, greatly complicating the calculations. The second exponential decay could not be described by the trapping models, but also here on-trap recombination and Cooper-pair fluctuations must be considered.A qualitative analysis on the MKID detector performance (both single photon and radiation power integration) showed that quasiparticle trapping effects can increase the energy resolving power and noise equivalent power at low temperatures, when this effect replaces the usual lifetime saturation due to excess quasiparticles.","Quasiparticles; superconductor; Noise; Single Photon Detection; MKIDs","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-06-05","","","","Applied Sciences","",""

Heerema is an offshore construction company that is intrinsically motivated to improve their sustainability. They transport, install and remove all types of offshore facilities. All Heerema vessels have a warehouse on-board, containing spare parts. Spare parts are parts in-stock that will be used to maintain the vessel or execute projects. In total the warehouse contains 300.000 parts, with an average value of 13.000.000 US$. The total weight of the stored material is 1.400.000 kg. If a needed spare part is not in-stock, it is ordered and brought to the vessel. Both actions take up a lot of time and could risk a project being stopped, which influences the economic pillar of the Triple Bottom Line consisting of people, planet and profit. Having this many parts on-board, and always ordering a ‘new part’ when something breaks, is not seen as a sustainable project execution. Especially taking into account the possibility of repairing. Next to that, extra transports or air freights are needed to get parts on-board, which influences the sustainable pillar of the Triple Bottom Line. In some cases, parts used to be produced by suppliers that do not exist anymore, which makes it hard to order new ones or obligated to purchase packages. The preferred situation for Heerema would be to use Additive Manufacturing as an additional production method for spare parts. For the implementation of this technology, a sufficient quality of the printed parts is desired. Sufficiency for critical parts has to be qualified by external certification organizations. Sufficiency for non-critical parts is reached once it functions within the used application. Next to the quality of the prints, the time it takes to print a part is important. Both quality and time depend on the performance of the 3D printer, which will influence the adoption of the crew. The preferred situation can be seen as the goal Heerema if aiming for. To reach this goal, a Roadmap is recommended. This Roadmap is designed as being the most suitable way of implementing and using 3D printing on-board of their vessels. The Roadmap is based on three different phases: The Research phase, The Printing phase and The Opportunities phase. Within these phases, the printing phase exists of two sub-phases: a plastic and a metal print phase. Each printing phase exists of a testing phase, a limited use phase and an expansion phase. The transition from one phase to another is based on a stepwise approach to lower the risks that could occur while implementing a complex innovation. The stepwise approach is based on the level of trust among the vessel crew towards the level of complexity of the implemented innovation. The conducted research supports the proposed solution that leads to the preferred situation. The solution is assessed according the three aspects of the Industrial Design Engineering domain: Technology, Human Values and Business.<br/>The solution is shown to be feasible due to the chosen hardware, the study on printable spare parts, 3D print studies and mechanical tests at the TU Delft.<br/>Additionally, the solution is shown to be viable due to relative low investment costs, a decrease in man-hours and transports and a waste reduction based on Value Stream Mapping. Also, the solution is shown to be desirable due to the collaboration with current users, a promising partnership with Layertec and the fit with the sustainability aims of Heerema. The thesis is enclosed by mentioning the research limitations, reflections, recommendations and further research for Heerema.","3D printing; Additive Manufacturing; Spare Parts; Metal Additive Manufacturing; Bound Metal Deposition; innovation implementation; Offshore","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

The use of algorithms within complex planning processes is an interesting research field. These algorithms should help human planners with the planning process and therefore are called Planning Assistance Tools (PAT).

The lack of acceptance is often linked to the fact of human aspects that are missing within the PAT. This research provides a methodology to identify the missing aspects using a developed PAT, real-life planning assignments and experienced planners within the railway node planning. Based upon empirical experiments, a list of aspects is formulated that are translated to extensions that are implemented in the PAT.

Adequate RO feed pretreatment is necessary for biofouling and scaling control. The objective of this thesis was evaluated the effectiveness of ion exchange treatment with weak acid cation (WAC) and strong base anion (SBA) resins columns, in series, after ultrafiltration (UF) treatment for the pretreatment of municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent in order to be used for RO desalination. Specifically, the performance of two SBA resins, the Amberlite SCAV4 Cl (SCAV4) and the Amberlite IRA458 Cl (IRA458) was assessed at three regeneration levels (120, 100 and 80 g NaCl/Lr). The effect of the different regeneration levels on anions removal (sulfate, phosphate and nitrate), total organic carbon (TOC) removal and the operational exchange capacity was researched. Moreover, the subsequent effect on RO biofouling and scaling potential was investigated based on the product water quality of the two SBA resins with bio-growth potential tests and software tests (WAVE design, PHREEQC 3 and Avista Ci), respectively. Phosphate and sulfate removal was above 97% for both resins at all regeneration levels. TOC removal of about 70% was achieved in all cases. It was also observed that sulfate, phosphate and TOC removal remained the same up to the point where product nitrate concentration reached its feed concentration. The removal of nitrate was influenced by the regeneration level. For both SBA resins, a lower regeneration level caused a higher nitrate baseline leakage in product water, hence to a lower removal. The macroporous SCAV4 found to have higher selectivity towards nitrate compared to the gel IRA458. Nevertheless, the anion selectivity order for both SCAV4 and IRA458 was HCO3- &lt; NO3- &lt; HPO42- &lt; SO42-. A minor increase in the operational exchange capacity for both SBA resins was observed at higher regeneration levels. Overall, the influence of the different regeneration levels was found to be limited towards the product water quality and the operational exchange capacity. Also, both SBA resins resulted to similar product water quality. The operational exchange capacity of IRA458 at each regeneration level was higher than that of SCAV4, due to the former’s greater total exchange capacity. The RO feed water quality produced without ion exchange pretreatment (only UF) supported bacterial growth up to 54 ± 1.5 × 106 cells/mL. The RO feed water qualities produced with ion exchange pretreatment in the cases of SCAV4 and IRA458 supported bacterial growth up to 3.4 ± 0.3 × 106 cells/mL and to 1.25 ± 0.2 × 106 cells/mL, respectively. The resulted reduction in the bacterial growth potential was above 90% after ion exchange treatment with either one of the tested SBA resins. The growth-limiting nutrient for the RO feed water qualities produced by either SBA resin was phosphorus. The bacterial growth supported by the two RO feed water qualities produced with ion exchange pretreatment after extra phosphorus addition was 80% lower than that supported by the RO feed water quality produced without ion exchange. This difference suggests that both SBA resins removed a considerable fraction of assimilable organic carbon (AOC). It was concluded that ion exchange pretreatment with either one of the tested SBA resins resulted in nutrients removal (P and C) in the RO feed that lowers the biofouling potential compared to RO feed pretreatment with only UF. The software results suggest lower scaling potential for several scalant types in the RO feed after ion exchange treatment with either one of the tested SBA resins. Among them was calcium phosphate, which was found to have high scaling potential in RO feed without ion exchange treatment (only UF) either with or without anti-scalant dosing. However, the scaling potential of some silica and iron based minerals was high, thus anti-scalant dosing might be required.","RO feed pretreatment; Ion exchange; Anion exchange; Biofouling potential; Scaling potential","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

This report expands upon the novel approach from M. Hoeboer and P.M. Nijman. Their Smart Optical Diagnostic Of Schistosomiasis device (SODOS), combining the principles of flow cytometry and digital holography, was able to detect schistosomiasis haematobium eggs in a 10 ml urine sample. However the mechanical complexity made it difficult to control the flow and more than 650 frames needed to be processed for each sample. The reason for this was the small flow cell volume examined within each frame. This report shows it is possible to increase the volume while maintaining the required resolution for accurate diagnosis. The size of the volume is limited by the sensor’s pixel pitch, the sensor area, the shutter time of the sensor, the thickness of the volume, the density of particles and to a lesser extent the distance of the volume to the sensor and the wavelength of the source. The density of particles in combination with the thickness of the volume proved to be<br/>the main limiting factors. With to many particles the scattered light causes a cloudy, speckle pattern on the sensor, which does not give the desired resolution upon reconstruction. By using a 24MP APS­C CMOS colour sensor, present in the Canon EOS M50 camera, in combination with a larger volume it was possible to reconstruct eggs throughout 1.5 ml of urine using a single frame, decreasing the total required number of frames to 7. The volume thickness was 5 mm. Increasing the thickness to analyse the required 10 ml of urine in a single frame was not feasible due to scattering. However when<br/>immersing the eggs in a Phosphate­buffered saline solution a 14 ml volume, with a thickness of 43 mm, could be analysed successfully, showing the possibilities of implementing the technique in other fields as well. The Fraunhofer particle field holography theory proved to be a valid model when making predictions regarding the resolution throughout the volume as well as providing information on the axial position of the particles.","Schistosomiasis; Holographic; holography; Digital holography; Schistosomiasis haematobium","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

Recently, a record efficiency of 23.5% was achieved by employing molybdenum oxide (MoOx) as carrier selective contact. MoOx exhibits advantageous properties with respect to the p-doped standard amorphous silicon contacts due to its lower parasitic absorption and better thermal stability. However, achieving an efficient carrier collection is challenging and not well understood yet. In this work, transport of charge is studied from drift diffusion and atomistic approach by means of numerical simulations. Two different state-of-art computational tools are employed: TCAD Sentaurus for drift diffusion simulations, and VASP for ab initio simulations. Through drift diffusion simulations, the contact formation of molybdenum oxide as carrier selective contact is consistently explored including quantum confinement and transport based in mid-gap energy states. The work function of MoOx is shown to be the core for an efficient charge collection. Thanks to experimental results, it is revealed relevant phenomenon at MoOx/intrinsic amorphous silicon (i-a-Si:H) interface which includes silicon oxide formation and charge accumulated. Therefore, a special focus at interface is here presented, in order to study the inner physics of the detrimental effects and how to avoid them. Altogether, drift diffusion simulations reveal that MoOx thickness is an essential parameter because it strongly determines the work function and hence the efficiency of the solar cell. All the knowledge acquired is used to provide guidelines on the fabrication of these type of solar cells.<br/>Looking at MoOx/a-Si:H interface, ab initio simulations are employed to study interface properties. Accordingly, such interface is analysed using both materials in their crystalline matrix. It is demonstrated that oxygen deficiency tunes the MoOx work function, a statement which is key for the proper contact formation and consistent with drift diffusion results. Finally, the charge arrangement at interface reveals the creation of an interface dipole together with silicon dioxide interlayer which is coherent with drift diffusion simulations analysis.","SHJ solar cells; Sentaurus TCAD; DFT; modelling; MoOx","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-06-06","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Current Mars rovers by NASA, such as the Curiosity, provide excellent researching capabilities from a remote location. <br/><br/>However, these land based drones are slower and less manoeuvrable around obstacles than airborne vehicles would be. Due to the need of transportation and exploration, this report aims to get acquainted with current research on Mars flight and provide a preliminary design concept enforced by the following mission goal:<br/>”To aid future Mars colonists by providing a feasibility study of a flying vehicle capable of carrying a predetermined payload.”<br/><br/>To approach this goal, it was decided to determine which flying vehicle concept would be the most optimal in a Martian atmosphere via a trade-off analysis. Four options were considered and a balloon was deemed more optimal for a Martian environment compared to aircraft, rotor craft and flapping wing vehicles. The main reasons for this are that the balloon is the most power efficient and is a design that provides the least amount of risk concerning likelihood of failure and safety of astronauts.Thereafter, the process required to design a hot air balloon and the programming of the code is described. Results indicate that a balloon with a prolate ellipsoid shape is optimal with the ratio between the minor and major axis being 0.41, therefore resulting in a balloon with a major axis radius of 33.8 푚 and a minor axis radius of 13.86 푚. A surface area of 131.58푚² is selected for the flexible solar cells which have been calculated to be able to power a two propeller system ensuring that the balloon can counter headwinds of up to 15푚/푠. <br/><br/>Finally, to ensure altitude control is possible, a venting system is applied on the top of the balloon ensuring a venting volume of 117푚³ is possible. This is enough to ensure the balloon can land, take-off and control its altitude as desired.This thesis is therefore able to provide an initial design for a Mars exploration balloon capable of controlling not only its altitude but also its position. This is achieved by using the solar energy to increase the balloon’s temperature and a vent area of 19.03 푚² to control this temperature.

Such deviations are considered as an uncertainty component in PV energy yield assessments, and are seen as financial risk by investors and purchasers. A ±10% error in the Pmax temperature coefficient can result in more than 1% error in estimated energy yield (and thus financial return on investment), which is significant especially for utility scale PV. The goal of this work is to reduce the uncertainty of the Pmax temperature coefficients from ±10% down to ±5%, which will reduce financial risk and therefore support the roll-out of utility scale PV. This thesis will focus on identification and reduction of measurement uncertainty of the temperature coefficients. A measurement setup for PV module temperature coefficients, integrating a solar simulator and a temperature chamber, was developed by Eternalsun Spire. This setup will be evaluated using a Monte Carlo based uncertainty analysis. Additionally, uncertainty drivers - relevant for current, typical industry practice - will be demonstrated, contributing to further understanding of observed deviations between temperature coefficient measurement results from different laboratories. The k=2 expanded measurement uncertainty for the relative temperature coefficient for a PV module measured in the Temperature Coefficient Lab Flasher is approximated at 4.05%. Three major uncertainty components are: 1. Temperature induced spectral mismatch (2.46%) 2. STC uncertainty of the solar simulator (1.09%); 3. Temperature correction of the monitor cell (0.41%). Additionally, it is demonstrated that: 1. silicon heterojunction PV modules can exhibit non-linear temperature behaviour and therefore coefficients that are dependent on the range of measurement; 2. significant measurement errors can occur when the cell temperature and backsheet temperature are not in thermal equilibrium, which typically applies for the currently widely applied ”hot potato” method for determination of temperature coefficients; 3. the simulator spectrum can significantly affect the temperature coefficient measurement even for solar simulators with A+ rating for spectral match. Based on the uncertainty analysis it is shown that the temperature coefficient measurement setup can be used to achieve a measurement uncertainty of PV module temperature coefficients below 5%. Additionally, the demonstrated uncertainty drivers encountered in typical industry practice can support awareness and thus mitigation of uncertainty drivers previously not aware of. For this purpose, recommendations from this work have been included in an international IEC standard for measurement of temperature coefficients.","Temperature coefficients; PV; Photovoltaic; c-Si; silicon; Measurement; Uncertainty; Uncertainty Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-01-01","","","","","",""

To that end, a process model was created that receives the output of a Co-LTFT process as raw feed. The raw feed was prefractionated to remove the majority of the unreacted syngas, inert gases, light hydrocarbons (C1-C4) and water. The remaining stream was syncrude, primarily composed of alkanes and 1-alkenes in the C5-50 range.<br/>A Base Case was designed in ASPEN plus, with a distillation unit with two steam strippers and three pumparounds. The goal was to receive the syncrude and separate naphtha, kerosene and gas oil cuts, with least 90% purity and recovery of the components. The Fenske-Underwood-Gilliland method was used to estimate the number of stages and reflux ratio of the column, and the Kirkbride method was used to find an initial estimate for the feed stage. The TBP curves of the cuts were compared with similar cuts from literature and found to be similar. <br/>The Base Case underwent a sensitivity analysis in order to ascertain the effect of different design and process parameters on the separation quality and utility consumption. The parameters that were tested are cold condensate temperature, feed stage, condenser duty, feed temperature and stripping steam flow rate to the ADU. According to the sensitivity analysis results, for optimal separation between the syncrude and the other gases in the raw feed, the gases must be purged at a temperature of -70°C. Furthermore, the optimal configuration for the distillation of the given syncrude into naphtha, kerosene and gas oil fractions with at least 90% purity and recovery is as follows: The ADU has 40 equilibrium stages and a condenser duty of approximately -5.7 MW. The feed must be heated to 310°C and enter the column at stage 37. The stripping steam flow rate must be around 1.3 kg/s. <br/>Five alternative processes were modelled as well, with similar inputs to the column model, and the results of the distillate separation quality and utility consumption were documented as well. The alterations of the alternative cases include replacing the stripping steam with a reboiler in one of the strippers, adding a stripper from where an additional product was drawn, concentrating the pumparound duty on the condenser, using a vacuum distillation unit to fractionate the residue of the atmospheric distillation unit, and employing a heat integration network.<br/>The most important conclusions are listed. Firstly, the side strippers must use low pressure stripping steam instead of reboilers. Next, the minimum number of products must be drawn off in order to minimize utility consumption at a given separation quality. Furthermore, heat integration can save up to 50% in total utility consumption (heat and cooling water). It is recommended that further research, including a cost estimation, is conducted on refineries that produce on-specification final products.<br","syncrude; distillation; fischer tropsch; naphtha; kerosene; gasoil; aspen","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-06-03","","","","","",""

During the transport the crane suspended jacket hanging in air can start swinging due to swell waves. This can result in undesired risks such as a collision between the jacket and the vessel. To prevent this undesired risks from occurring a solution must be sought. A possible contingency scenario to prevent this risks from occurring is to (partly) submerge the jacket. The aim of this study is to investigate in which way the jacket motion response changes if it would be in the water. A research methodology will be derived to investigate this. This will be done by investigating the a jacket transport with the Thialf. As a starting point, and for later comparison, the behaviour of the a jacket in air, while it is free hanging from the cranes of the Thialf, will be investigated in a frequency domain solver Liftdyn. The resulting modes and response between the model and measurements indicate a good starting point. Thereafter the jacket will be lowered in to the water and the resulting forces will be determined. The forces on the jacket will be determined using the linearised Morison equation. For the damping two approaches are investigated, i.e. the absolute velocity approach and the relative velocity approach. Subsequently different submerged depths are investigated and the effect of adding tugger winches is investigated. The operability for the different scenarios is derived and compared. It is observed that by submerging the jacket the pitch mode is limiting the operability for wind waves. This mode can be damped by adding tugger winches. By submerging the jacket deeper the operability improves. For swell waves the operability is improved when the jacket is submerged. It is concluded that submerging the jacket can be used as a contingency scenario for a swell train, but it is crucial to know the behaviour of the jacket. Because submerging it at the wrong depth could lead to large resonant responses. And by understanding the behaviour of the jacket tugger winches can be used to damp out a specific modes.","Frequency Domain; Morison; Decommissioning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

This controller gains its popularity because of the ease of design through loop shaping, since PID can be analyzed in the frequency domain. However, PID is limited by linearity. Reset control is a nonlinear addition to PID control. Through linearization techniques it can be designed by analyzing the frequency domain. Through numerous numerical, analytical and practical experiments it has been shown that reset control can outperformPID. However, when practically implementing reset control, especially in motion stages, one aspect can cause severe performance degradation. Research is underrepresented in this field. Quantization can be described as discretization in the amplitude. This thesis aims to reduce the quantization induced performance degradation. Two methods are proposed: reset band and time regularization. Numerical analysis and practical experiments have been performed in order to analyze the performance degradation and proposed methods. Through the numerical analysis in matlab simulink of a mass system the performance degradation has clearly been addressed. Based on the new understanding tuning rules have been provided for both proposed methods. A preliminary sensitivity analysis shows the robustness of both methods. Both proposed methods show enhanced performance. In numerical analysis it was shown that the reset band solution and time regularization can achieve an improvement of up to 10 dB. It was shown through experiments on a high level motion stage that several dB improvement is feasible. For the reset band at a specifically detrimental frequency the error was reduced from 200 nm to 70 nm. The reset band shows an improvement of several dB. In one setup, the performance enhancement spanned a wide frequency range. Overall it is concluded that for quantization induced performance degradation both proposed methods clearly show improvement.

It has gotten more attention in the news for the upcoming Olympic Games in Tokyo, and for big marathons where this is becoming an increasing problem. Whereas, able-bodied persons are able to dissipate heat by means of sweating, a tetraplegic most likely cannot. When the lesion is above T6 there is a possibility of having a dysregulated thermoregulatory system. This means that the temperature signals are not received, and therefore no reaction will occur due to a rising core temperature. The fact that they cannot control their own body temperature gives them a high risk of hyperthermia. Research was conducted concerning the problem. The solutions currently used are wet towels, water beads, water spray, and cooling products such as evaporation and phase change material (PCM) vests. The downside for these products is their limited duration. Products based on evaporation need to be refilled after several hours, depending on the temperature. PCM packs need to be restarted at a cool place, such as a fridge or freezer. There is currently one active cooling product which cools the wheelchair user's back by means of air. The research showed that the users have a big need for an active cooling product, which could keep them cool for an entire day. Due to the lack of sweating for tetraplegics, it has been decided to implement air and liquid cooling. For tetraplegics the area in which the most heat is found is the upper chest and back, which are the areas with the highest sweat rate for able-bodied as well. The design goal of the project is to develop an active cooling system to prevent hyperthermia while outside, which can also be used by tetraplegics during their everyday lives. The goal is achieved when the user has a reduced increase of core temperature during their day outside. VENTS is a shirt that helps the user stay cool during warm days. VENTS has four fans, two on the front and two on the back, which will create an airflow and improve convection. There is a temperature sensor included to make it a fully automated cooling product. If the fans are not enough to slow down the temperature increase within the body, the water pump will start distributing water droplets across the torso of the user. This is done by having tubing at the collar of the shirt, with outlets to create the small droplets. This process will re-enact sweating as well as help with convection and evaporation heat loss. If the product works on full cooling power it can extract about 28 Watts worth of heat from the body. With the help of the Fiale model and the user testing data, a simulation was conducted with VENTS in an environment of 35°C and 80% humidity, along with an activity level of 4 metabolic equivalent of task (MET). This simulation shows a 3.94°C decrease of skin temperature compared to not using the product.","SCI; Cooling; Tetraplegics; Hybrid cooling; Spinal Cord Injury","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

The DEKF was applied to a range of time-varying simulations, both remnant-free as well as with realistic remnant based on an experimentally identified first-order model. In addition, the tests were validated using existing experimental tracking data.

General guidelines for the sensitive tuning process of the filter are proposed. The presence of coloured remnant noise in double-integrator tracking was found to greatly affect the quality of the estimates. Future versions of the filter should explicitly include models of remnant noise, to reduce its sensitivity and ease the tuning process. The obtained algorithm is applicable to single sets of measurement data without a priori assumptions on time-variance or the need for averaging. With some additional development, this makes the DEKF a suitable candidate for practical applications, such as driver monitoring and advanced driver assistance systems in the automotive industry.","Manual Control; parameter estimation; preview time; Dual Extended Kalman Filter (DEKF)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-06-02","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Presently, waste streams from the torrefaction process in the form of volatiles are usually combusted to generate heat required for the torrefaction process. Nevertheless, the chemical characteristics of the torrefaction gas combined with recent technologies have opened new alternatives that could be used for further valorization of volatiles in other ways than combustion. The aim of this Thesis was to ﬁnd alternative pathways other than straight up combustion of volatiles to valorize the volatiles released during torrefaction of biomass. Two types of biomass were investigated: corn stalk and sugarcane bagasse. Four diﬀerent conﬁgurations for valorization were developed for their prospects of valorization: (1) valorization via straight up combustion, (2) chemical looping combustion, (3) chemical looping steam reforming and (4) a combination of chemical looping combustion and straight up combustion. A model based on experimental data was build in Aspen Plus to simulate the drying, torrefaction and valorization for a torrefaction plant with a capacity of 100 kton/year. The results were analysed in terms of process eﬃciency and economics. Results indicate that chemical looping combustion of all volatiles is the most attractive option of valorization, both in terms of eﬃciency and economics. The gross LHV eﬃciency for this option is 92 % for corn stalk and 84 % for sugarcane bagasse. The production costs in these scenarios are €208/ton for torreﬁed corn stalk pellets and €180/ton for torreﬁed sugarcane bagasse pellets. The capital investment required for the torrefaction plant for this conﬁguration is €527/kW installed for corn stalk and €650/kW installed for sugarcane bagasse.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Potential has been found in propulsion­enabled units, and TU Delft is at the forefront of researching and developing suitable propulsion modules for thrust generation or attitude control of small satellites classified as Cubesats and Pocketqubes for the purpose of technology demonstration, presenting an open platform for students to provide their ideas. Acknowledging the challenges in power budgeting and distribution, the current thesis presents the conception, design and numerical evaluation of a passive, self-­pressurized pro­pellant storage system for use with the in­-house microthrusters. Target components for which the storage must be suitable are the Vaporizing Liquid Microthruster (VLM) and the INKX0511400AA5 VHS Solenoid Lee Valve, an off-­the­shelf component already at the dis­posal of the faculty. Starting from the notion of passive pressurization, an extensive review of literature is used to decide on exploring the idea of compliant mechanisms as a pressuriz­ing method. The scientific output of this work aims to extract productive conclusions on the design and performance level achievable by this concept and open a new design avenue for propellant storage modules. Expanding upon the definition of compliant mechanisms, a considerable amount of design concepts were evaluated under the premise of a two­-stage trade­-off strategy, aiming to balance creativity and practicality. Proclamation of the explored pressurizing mechanism is followed by individual trade­-off procedures for material, shape and configuration of the entire module, leading to a complete preliminary design concept to be evaluated. Traditional and unconventional analytic models are implemented to materialize the design concept, measuring its static and dynamic response in both idle and thrust conditions. They delve into the fields of structural and fluid dynamics and are validated against more advanced and accurate Finite Element (FE) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models. Both outputs are compared with the mission, system and subsystem requirements to fully assess the performance levels obtained. Regulated for pressure drops of 500 Pa and 50 Pa from tank to valve, the former is capable of concluding a self-­actuated expulsion within 25 ms in both cases, failing to achieve target values for thrust duration. The conservative design approach has led to a 27.4 gr wet tank mass, with a 2.9 gr propellant capacity. As a first implementation of compliance-based pressurization in propellant storage, the results highlight its viability and the field should be further explored.","micro-propulsion; Compliant Mechanisms; tank storage; PocketQube","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Peters, Dirk Jan (graduation committee); 't Hart, Marcel (mentor); Eigenraam, Peter (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","Although the concept of a submerged floating tunnel (SFT) originates from the early 1900s, the cross-section is always assumed to be circular or rectangular. In this research, it is investigated whether this assumption is valid. In order to find the optimal cross-section, the optimization process is split into two targets. The first targets aims for an optimization of material use considering the large hydrostatic water pressure. The second target guarantees a tensile force in the tethers that support the SFT, while keeping the buoyancy weight ratio (BWR) as close to 1.0 as possible. This is beneficial for both the tunnel tube and the tether system. The optimal cross-section considering the optimization of material use is an 'egg-shape' or an oval which deviates slightly from a circle. This is modelled by the form-finding process as executed in the Grasshopper software. This is due to the relative pressure difference between SFT-top and SFT-bottom. The ovalization decreases for increasing depth. The second target results in an ellipsoidal shape, with a flat bottom and convexly shaped top (in case the SFT is anchored to the seabed). This shape reduces the drag and turbulence on the SFT, while a lift force is generated contributing to the tensile force in the tethers. An analogy with an aeroplane wing is made. The magnitude of the lift and drag force is evaluated by solving for the Panel Method in Python. A significant reduction in drag and turbulence becomes visible. Moreover, some significant lift forces are generated by the encountering flow. The wave load must be compensated by the BWR to assure a tensile force in the tethers. All together, two types of solutions are presented. The ideal solution would be an inner (concrete) tube which absorbs the water pressure with a steel exoskeleton to reduce the drag and generate a lift force. The exoskeleton has a flat bottom and a convexly shaped top (when anchored to the seabed) A compromise between the targets is also possible and presented within the research. This compromise also has a flatter bottom and a more convexly shaped top, but still has some appearances of a circle.","Submerged floating tunnel; tunnel; archimedes bridge; form finding; coastal crossing; submerged","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","",""

The experimental investigations involved a series of wind tunnel tests with a 4.6% scale half model, conducted in the TU Delft OJF low speed wind tunnel. Balance measurements allowed significant interference effects between the wing and engine to be identified. A nacelle mounted total pressure rake enabled the measurement of engine inlet total pressure, both in through-flow nacelle and powered conditions. At landing and take-off velocity (20m/s), an interference drag penalty is observed over the full range of positive incidence angles above 5 degrees, with a maximum of 60 counts (16.5% of isolated wing drag) at an incidence angle of 10 degrees. At incidence angles lower than 5∘ engine operation is somewhat beneficial, with a maximum contribution to thrust due to interference of approximately 20 counts. Engine inflow is shown to be distorted by the presence of the wing, which could contribute to the observed interference drag. Distortion DC(60) values higher than 0.2 are measured in off design conditions, while measurements at cruise condition show a DC(60) value of 0.08. However, distinguishing between loss of engine thrust and increase in airframe drag is not possible with the used setup. Increased suction around the engine intake contributes to added lift and nose down pitching moment at high thrust setpoints and incidence angles between 5 degrees and 12.5 degrees. An increase in nose up pitching moment is observed from 12.5 degrees to 22.5 degrees. To put the measured interference in perspective, the direct effects of the quantified interference on trimmed flight conditions are demonstrated. An increased power requirement of up to +8% is observed in trimmed flight conditions between 22m/s and 31m/s, while a maximum reduction of -11% in power requirement is predicted for velocities higher than 32m/s. The change in required control surface deflection for trim due to engine interference is evaluated to be less than +/ − 2.5 degrees for trimmed level flight. A trimmable flight envelope is demonstrated for maximum climb, level flight and optimum glide with control surface deflections in the range of −10 to 10 degrees.","Flying V; Engine; Interference; Wind Tunnel Experiment; Flight characteristics; flying wing; Stability Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","The goal of this research was to perform a 3D end-to-end test on a MR-linac to check the whole workflow using a clinical treatment plan. Dosimetric gel was used to obtain 3D spatial information, with the phantom in the same position for irradiation and scanning. In order to achieve this, fundamental elements of gel dosimetry needed to be investigated. In the MR-linac, irradiation is delivered in the presence of a permanent magnetic field. Therefore, the dosimetric response within a 1.5 T magnetic field should be validated. It is also important to investigate the time-dependence of the gel. It is preferable to read-out the gels within approximately one hour, so that the phantom does not have to be moved. Ideally, scanning and irradiation would be done at the same time, to see the dynamical dose delivery. The VIPAR gel was used for this research. The experiments demonstrated that R2 values for doses irradiated with magnetic field were the same as R2 values for the same dose irradiated without magnetic field. R2 values are still proportional to the dose. It was also shown that it is possible to scan the phantom within 20 minutes after irradiation. Sensitivity is at its highest after approximately 8 hours and stays stable afterwards, so scanning after 8 hours will improve the read-out accuracy. It was also possible to make a fit for the R2 versus time plots, which makes it possible to correct for change over time. The fit can be divided in two linear parts if time is plotted on a logarithmic scale, one fit for the time points before 7 hours, one for the time points after 7 hours. The partial doses acquired by the gel during radiation delivery were estimated. The equivalent R2 values then agreed with the extrapolated fit to within 4%. This is a good indication that dynamic gel (4D) dosimetry may be achievable. A protocol for a relative end-to-end test was also developed. From the preliminary results, it appeared that a relative end-to-end test can be performed with the read-out of gel within 1 hour. A new MR sequence needs to be developed. For this end-to-end test, the sequence needs to scan a larger volume with a higher resolution, therefore, the scan time will increase and real-time dosimetry will not be possible. Changing the MR sequence might also change the optimal irradiation-scanning interval and the R2 versus time curve. To perform absolute dosimetry, an extra calibration would be required.","gel dosimetry; MR-linac; magnetic field","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-10-31","","","","","",""

First, we review the extremes of different sequences which have different values of $\theta$. We have found significant differences between the extremes. Then, 2 different types of estimators are introduced which both use different ways to divide the data, using disjoint blocks and using sliding blocks. The optimal block lengths are simulated for all those estimators. Using those block lengths, $\theta$ is simulated with all the estimators. From the simulations we conclude that the estimators using sliding blocks perform better. The best-performed estimator that we found from the simulations is used to estimate $\theta$ on data from the KNMI, comparing wind gusts and precipitation at weather stations De Bilt and Vlissingen.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

In pre-war neighbourhoods there is a dilemma between adding housing stock and simultaneously improving the existing stock in terms of sustainability. In the contemporary society these neighbourhoods are distinguished as troubled areas with unilateral demographical social class, poverty, below-average health issues and poor quality of public space. Gentrification aims on one hand to introduce a new diversity in these neighbourhoods and on the other improve the quality of the public space. Without municipal interference, repression and displacement of current inhabitants becomes inevitable and the opposite of diversification occurs. Consequently, municipalities recognizes the phenomena and introduce new regulation to cope with the issue and prevent the displacement of inhabitants. By replacing the old stock of building they set the condition that social housing can’t be reduced and by densifying the already existing social housing should be rebuild. These visions result in a new social cohesion wherein different contradictory groups co-exist in the neighbourhood with more contrasts in society. Public buildings have to deal with tensions and contrasts of the site-specific condition in order to guide the process of gentrification and should offer an act of interchangeability in which groups can benefit from each other socially, culturally and personally. The negative connotation of gentrification can turned around with public building to function as precursor that emphasizes a new rich layer of exchange between all present groups. An interchangeability that is able, within the converging multiple purposes of the building, to lift contrast between the ‘gentrified’ and the ‘gentrifier’ and emphasise the notion of generic properties of human behaviour and stressing the interaction of cultural activities of exchange and equality.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2020","In this research, the flood damage caused by heavy rain and plastic blockage in the neighbourhood of Atonsu, Kumasi is quantified. Rapid urbanisation and poor waste management result in floods with an increasing impact in Kumasi, the fastest growing city of Ghana. This rapid growth of the city results in uncontrolled urbanisation of the floodplains and induces damage to homes during a flood event. Furthermore, due to a poor waste management system around thirty percent of the waste produced in Kumasi gets dumped in the streets and forms blockage of the water flow in the river. Moreover, the river is used as a dump not only by citizens but also by factories, which results in contaminated river water. As this research aims to give a first insight into the actual flood damage in Kumasi, simplified methods are applied, as they do not require a lot of data. To quantify the tangible damage, expressed in monetary values, depth-damage curves are constructed for different types of land use in the study area, to show the relation between the inundation depth or inundated area and the monetary damage. Besides that the intangible damage is quantified in the form of the number of lives lost and people exposed to waterborne diseases, both depending on the total number of people affected. The damage is quantified for floods induced by four different rain events, all with different peak precipitation, duration and frequency. The results indicate that the larger the rain event, the more damage it causes. It is furthermore estimated that plastic blockage of the flow of the river results in an increase of monetary damage of up to 5.7 percent and the number of people that are affected by the flood increases with up to 17.4 percent. Finally, the results of this research show the magnitude of flood damage in Kumasi and could be used to show the urge of measures that need to be taken to reduce the flood damage.","Quantitative analysis; Flood damage; Tangible damage; Intangible damage","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","TWIGA","6.666582, -1.593632"
