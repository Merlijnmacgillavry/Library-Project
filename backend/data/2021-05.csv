(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","We have developed, from scratch, a 3D radiative transfer code based on the Monte Carlo method, that fully takes into account the spherical shape of a planetary atmosphere, multiple scattering, and the polarized nature of light. Accounting for the sphericity of an atmosphere is important for the analysis of observations near the planetary limb and the twilight zone, i.e. the regions on a planet where the parent star and/or the observer are low or even below the local horizon. In such regions, the widely used radiative transfer models that are based on the locally plane-parallel atmosphere approximation can lead to significant errors, especially for planets that have extended atmospheres. With our code, we simulate total flux and polarization signals of light that is reflected by spatially resolved and spatially unresolved planets with extended atmospheres. We discuss the effects due to the atmosphere’s sphericity and compare against computations with a locally plane-parallel code. Our results are relevant both for the interpretation of observations of various Solar System planets and moons (with atmospheres) and for the investigation of total flux and polarization signals of exoplanets at all phase angles, including during transits. Especially hot Jupiters are likely to have extended atmospheres and to be detected in edge-on orbits with transits. During a transit, an extended atmosphere can strongly increase the amount of starlight that is measured, thus leading to a smaller derived planet size. We also specifically simulate the polarimetric signal of Titan, Saturn’s largest moon that is known to have an extended atmosphere. We find that at small phase angles, as observed from Earth, Titan’s limb is strongly affected by the sphericity of its atmosphere and that at large phase angles, as observed by a spacecraft like Cassini, Titan’s brightness increases strongly due to forward scattered light.","Exoplanets; Titan; Radiative Transfer; Atmospheres; Extended Atmospheres; Polarization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-05-31","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Meeting the ever-increasing energy demands in our planet where conventional sources of energy are finite and fast depleting, controlling adverse phenomena like climate change, soil erosion, greenhouse gas emission, ozone layer thinning and pollution will remain profound challenges until widespread adoption of sustainable sources of energy is achieved. The shift to a sustainable energy system cannot be complete without the contribution of biomass energy. Within the ecosystem of biomass energy, gasification is a thermochemical conversion process undertaken to obtain a high-quality product gas by increasing the low energy density of solid biomass. The product gas can be used in power applications or be converted to liquid fuels for transportation. Gasification is carried out at high temperatures (700-1500°C) by using a gaseous agent under sub stoichiometric conditions (R.A. Kersten &amp; De Jong, 2015). The main non-condensable permanent gases obtained from gasification are CO, H2, CO2 and CH4. Use of allothermal gasifiers, whose working is based on the separation of combustion and gasification chambers within the gasifier, with heat supply for carrying out endothermic reactions, established via heat carrier or heat exchanger, have shown many advantages compared to the conventional gasifiers (Hofbauer &amp; Materazzi, 2019). The mix-up of product gas and flue gas is avoided in this type of gasification. Secondly, while using air for biomass combustion, the nitrogen present in air reduces the quality of the end product by not participating in gasification, thus resulting in a diluted product gas. A high-quality product gas can be obtained from allothermal gasifiers without the need for establishing an expensive air separation unit, as required in case of conventional gasifiers. The 50 kWth Indirectly Heated Bubbling Fluidized Bed Steam Reformer (IHBFBSR) at Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) represents a new concept of allothermal gasification technology where heat required for the endothermic gasification reactions is provided by two radiant tube burners placed vertically inside the reactor, one at the top and one at the bottom. The aim of this research is to optimize and validate the kinetic model developed for the IHBFBSR by a former student, Maarten Kwakkenbos in Aspen Plus®. The optimization is carried out with the help of the several steps, described in the report. The optimized model is then validated by using the results of the gasification tests performed under various operational conditions by PhD Candidates Mara del Grosso and Christos Tsekos. The optimized model predicts the gas composition obtained from the IHBFBSR quite well. In addition to the yield of permanent gases, N2, H2O and tars concentration in the product gas, along with various gas ratios (CO/H2, CH4/H2, CO/CO2) from the model are compared with the experimental values and found to be in reasonable agreement. Moreover, key performance indicators such as carbon conversion (CC), cold gas efficiency (CGE) and overall efficiency (OE) are also evaluated from both model and experiments and compared. The error ranges for most of the parameters lie within the reported deviations observed in various gasifier models in literature. After the validation of the model, the possibility of recycling a fraction of the product gas to feed the burners in order to make the set up more sustainable is evaluated. Sensitivity analyses is performed by varying steam to biomass ratios (SB*), primary and secondary air flowrate to evaluate the best process conditions under which product gas obtained from the gasifier, after subsequent cleaning, can be used for methanol production based on the H2/CO ratio. The results indicate that a higher SB* and a higher secondary air flowrate can result in a H2/CO ratio closer to the desired value required for optimum methanol production. From the heat analysis performed for the model, a possibility of increasing the overall efficiency of the process by adding a bypass line in the gasifier setup is suggested to be explored. The master thesis concludes by answering the research questions and recommendations to improve the detailing and accuracy of the model.","Optimization; Validation; IHBFBSR; Recycle; Model; Aspen Plus; Sensitivity Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-05-31","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The global climate agreement signed in Paris in 2015 sets the goal of limiting global warming, which is essential of saving the planet for future generations. The energy transition from a fossil-fuel living to a sustainable society depends on the technological development of using the renewable energy sources on earth. Wind and solar are common energy sources, but more sustainable energy sources need to be used to achieve this fossil-free living. Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) uses the temperature gradient of the ocean for the generation of electricity to accelerate the energy transition. The OTEC cycle contains plate heat exchangers (PHEs) which are made from titanium for high heat transfer performance and to cope with corrosive fluids, like ammonia and seawater. However, titanium is expensive and replacement is needed to reduce costs and environmental impact [114]. Polymers, on the other hand, are cheaper and are corrosion-resistant, but heat transfer is poor. Heat transfer and pressure drop indicate the performance of PHEs and increasing heat transfer and lowering pressure drop will increase the efficiency of the entire system, thereby lowering the overall cost of energy produced. The performance of composite polymer plates in heat transfer applications is still unknown. The thermal conductivity is lower compared to metal plates, which has a significant effect on heat transfer [37]. In this thesis, a small 100WOTEC plant, constructed at the TU Delft, is used as experimental setup. The test section of the setup is the condenser of the OTEC cycle, which is a gasketed plate heat exchanger (GPHE). In the first part of this thesis, two types of composite polymers are investigated to determine the design requirements of polymer plates in PHEs. Sealing of the GPHE seems to be an issue due to the low ductility and compression strength of the composite polymers. The plates are not able to withstand the compressive force needed for sealing. Three types of seals are tested in this research: conventional rubber gasket, epoxy and rubber orings. Unfortunately, none of the seals achieved sealing. A new plate and gasket design has been proposed to be able to prevent plate failure and achieve sealing for the testing of composite polymer plates in a GPHE for future research. The second part of this research focuses on the validation of heat transfer and pressure drop correlations in a 2-channel stainless steel GPHE, with ammonia (NH3) as working fluid, developed by Tao [96]. The correlations are based on 20-80 kg/m2s mass flux range, which is the mass flow per flow passage area. The experimental research is conducted with two adjustments compared to the research by Tao: ammonia-water (NH3/H2O) as working fluid and 4-channels. Experiments are conducted at mass fluxes of 15, 20 and 30 kg/m2s with changing vapour qualities. The data is analysed and heat transfer coefficients (HTCs) and pressure drops are calculated using a data analysis model. HTCs and pressure drop results are compared with the correlations developed by Tao for validation. HTC results are low compared to the expected values based on previous work. This is likely due to the presence of fouling on the stainless steel plates, the presence of a non-condensable gas in the system and a maldistribution of the flow at the inlet of the GPHE, which causes an uneven distribution of liquid and vapour across the channels. As a consequence, the applicability of the heat transfer correlation by Tao for multi-channel NH3/H2O mixture at low mass fluxes is inconclusive. The pressure drop results seem to be less effected by the factors negatively influencing the HTCs. The pressure drop correlation by Tao underpredicts the obtained pressure drop results, which is possibly due to the change of working fluid: NH3/H2O mixture. However, the applicability of the frictional pressure drop correlation by Tao is inconclusive due to the maldistribution of the flow at the inlet of the GPHE. This concludes that the knowledge of the distribution of vapour and liquid across the channels in the GPHE is important during performance testing of a GPHE.","OTEC; Plate Heat Exchanger; Polymer; Heat Transfer Coefficient; Pressure drop; Gasket","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Database entity type recognition is the practice of recognizing conceptual entity types for which given data sets contain data. In big data or data lake settings, it is not always known which conceptual entity types are represented in each data set, making it difficult to extract value from the data. Depending on the logical schemas, each conceptual entity type can also be represented in the data instances in multiple different ways. This phenomenon, called semantic heterogeneity, poses a challenge when attempting database entity type recognition. Narrowing down the problem space to a specific organization makes it easier to cope with such problems. Organizations know which entity types are used in the organization and require only those to be recognized. And while there is heterogeneity in representation, there is likely a common set of rules each logical schema adheres to which can be exploited to recognize semantic heterogeneity. Furthermore, experts at an organization can provide example data instances for each conceptual entity type of interest, which provide ground truth for the proposed database entity type recognition solution. The proposed solution makes data profiles of the example data instances, and then attempts to recognize entity types in previously unseen data instances using a rule-based approach. Rules are used to maximize the ease of explainability of results, as is often desired at a bank, and can easily be added to or removed from the solution to maximize adaptability. Experiments using the proposed solution show promising results, with up to 90 percent of entity types correctly recognized over a total of 170,000 entities.","Entity Type Recognition; Data Management; Database Reverse Engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Data Science and Technology","",""

(graduation committee); Verma, H. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Visually impaired people should enjoy the same rights to acquire information as people with normal sight. Since visual contents become more and more pervasive in our daily life, image description becomes increasingly important to help visually impaired people to get equal access to the information contained in visual contents. However, how to produce image descriptions in a scalable and reliable way is still an unsolved problem. Therefore, researches on the requirements of image description from the perspective of visually impaired people are essential to approaching this problem. Based on a review of existing study results on this topic, this thesis investigates the possibilities of utilizing interactive image description as an approach to collect visually impaired people’s requirements on image description and the benefits of integrating interactive image description to the current image description production system. The existing one-shot statistical description requires descriptors to evaluate the importance of the image, make choices on what should be described, and organize the content so that necessary information can be effectively conveyed. Through literature review, it is found that the requirements of image description are highly context-dependent and influenced by plentiful factors. Therefore, existing guidelines are usually vague and require the describer to rely on experience and intuition while making a lot of subjective judgments, which increases the threshold for generating high-quality image descriptions. On the other hand, through field research and literature research it is found that VIPs hope to have more control over the presentation of image description (both its presence and content). Early explorations of interactive image description showed the possibility of this affordance. Since users are allowed to decide the description content actively, it is argued that the user's preference for image description can be collected through interactive image description. A design goal is proposed accordingly. A prototype is developed to verify this proposal. Through a comparative experiment, the systems’ function to collect user preferences and gradually improve the content of image description is confirmed. In addition, the qualitative research results also reveal the mental activities when users interacting with image description and the impact of interactive image description in this procedure, which is summarized as an image perception model. It is also argued that structured description and progressive description provide new perspectives to reduce the workload of describing images. A final design was developed as the demonstrator for the research findings and proposals.","Visually impaired people; Image description; Crowdsourcing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Caffe Inc. is currently taking the first steps in creating value from spent coffee grounds. They wish to grow as a company and to build the largest biorefinery for processing spent coffee grounds into colourants and oil. With the biorefinery they want to stimulate the circular economy and show to everyone what the possibilities for repurposing are, and to prove that waste does not have to exist. The need for the circular economy is high, due to our current linear economy valuable resources end up on the landfill, the climate is changing and resources are getting exhausted. In addition, the consumer awareness on sustainability is growing and they are pressuring companies into becoming more sustainable and transparent. Additionally, companies also start to care more about the impact they make. The products of Caffe Inc. can be a solution to these companies, providing a circular and sustainable alternative.<br/><br/>The products that Caffe Inc. create offer many possible applications. The oil can be used for personal care products and the colourants to dye clothes. However, Caffe Inc. still needed to establish in market(s) their products are of value and how they should position themselves and their products there. To provide a relevant advice and strategy to Caffe Inc. the following research question was established: How and where should Caffe Inc. position their products in the market?<br/><br/>The answer to the research question is found through extensive market and context research, an analysis of the company, the product and the competitors, interviews with circular start-ups and a consumer questionnaire. The final solution is presented as a go-to-market strategy covering the steps that need to be followed when entering the target markets. It explains which markets to enter and how to successfully enter them. <br/><br/>The research found that the clients buy the coffee oil because it is a circular alternative to their regular materials, and there are not any other circular and local alternatives on the Dutch market.<br/>However, the interviews revealed that circularity is not something to position your products on, the added value is of most importance. This is also confirmed by the consumer questionnaire, Consumers buy products based on quality and price. They are open to the idea of buying products created from spent coffee grounds. The target consumer, who would buy the products created from spent coffee grounds cares about sustainability but more than that, it wants the product to be of good quality and to be fun. They believe all products created from spent coffee grounds deserve an equal chance as long as their quality is equal to that of its alternative. If Caffe Inc. explands their business to other European countries, Germany offers the most opportunities for Caffe Inc..<br/><br/>With this information the go-to-market strategy is created. The go-to-market strategy can be divided into three horizons. The goal of the first horizon, let it sprout!, is to build the biorefinery and sell the oil in bulk on the Dutch market and achieve a proof of concept. The goal of the second horizon, let it grow!, is to expand the product portfolio by introducing a consumer good and expand to foreign markets. The goal of the third horizon, let it flourish!, is to add the knowledge programs to the product portfolio, build biorefineries in foreign countries and start the giving back program.<br","Go to market strategy; Circular economy; Market Entry Strategy; Roadmap","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Based on measurements from the Arnhem grid, a case-study on the implementation of such systems is simulated. Results show that for this grid, implementing storage only for the reduction of transmission losses is not beneficial. However, when the recuperation of braking energy is considered, a significant energy reduction can be achieved (up to 17% for some specific sections in the grid).

To do so, an uncertainty quantification infrastructure based on the V&amp;V20 validation standard was developed. To determine whether a model error was present, the different sources of uncertainty were combined and then compared to the error between the SU2 simulations and the experiments. A variety of paradigmatic test cases were proposed which, together, would constitute a robust validation of the SU2 flow solver. Two paradigmatic unit test cases were analyzed; namely, a supersonic inviscid flow and a Mach 2.0 flow over a 2.5 degree wedge. The operating conditions of the experiments were as follows: an inlet total temperature and pressure of T_0=252°C and P_0=18.4 bara, and a back pressure of P_out=2.1 bara, for the first case, and T_0=180°C, P_0=3.5 bara and P_out=1.0 bara, for the second. The solver is able to predict the shock wave angle accurately. This step towards the validation was successful because the calculated total expanded uncertainty of 1.79% is higher the comparison error of 0.57%.In the second part of the thesis, the uncertainty quantification infrastructure was adapted to a test case constituted by more complicated flow features; namely, a supersonic flow through a 5-channel blade row. The computed uncertainties were on the same order of magnitude as in the supersonic inviscid flow test case. The simulations were verified with state-of-the-art CFD software for the quantities pressure and the Mach number. The positive result of the validation represents a step forward in the validation of the flow solver for non-ideal turbomachinery cases. The adaptation of the infrastructure to the cascade blade row paves the way for complex cases and for system response quantities of interest in industrial applications of CFD software, such as efficiency, to be assessed.","SU2; NICFD; Validation; Uncertainty Quantification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-05-01","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The resin pocket geometry and orientation of the surrounding plies influence the out-of-plane direct tensile stress within these plies whenever either the aspect ratio of the resin pocket or the in-plane stiffness of these plies is increased. The orientation of the terminated ply proved to be of influence as well, where higher in-plane shrinkage and thermal contraction of this ply increases the out-of-plane stress around the drop-off region. Implementing multiple drop-off regions introduce stress interactions caused by the different ply orientations used. These regions influence the local out-of-plane stress levels around the drop-off regions, where the stagger distance between these drop-offs generally lowers this effect.

This scheme requires each user to send a number of ciphertexts linear in the size of the aggregation function's domain. Furthermore, that scheme is not collusion-resistant. In this thesis, we design a multi-functional privacy-preserving data aggregation scheme with malicious user detection. In contrast to existing schemes in literature, the amount of messages is independent of the size of the aggregation function's domain, it does not rely on a trusted authority and it is collusion-resistant as long as at least two users are honest-but-curious.","Multi-functional; Privacy-preserving; Aggregation; Malicious user detection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Cyber Security","",""

For modeling the data, we consider four data-driven decomposition methods: ICA and three sDL variants. The methods decompose the data into better interpretable spatial maps and time courses. Every decomposition is further examined by training L1-regularized prediction models that optimize for sparsity. The goal is to predict the presented stimulus based on the decomposed data. Furthermore, the potential of group lasso regularization in prediction models is illustrated. The decompositions extract spatial maps anatomically linked to the visual cortex, superior colliculus and the hippocampus. All decompositions achieve considerable performance in the position prediction but have low success in the size and shape prediction. ICA outperformed the three sDL variants in all prediction tasks.

The steering sensitivity, defined as the amount of vehicle response to the driver's steering wheel input, remains fixed with changing road environments. Research has shown that driving comfort and safety can be improved when the vehicle's steering sensitivity is adapted to the road curvature profile. Current vehicle models can adapt the vehicle's steering sensitivity based on vehicle's speed and driver's steering wheel angle (i.e variable gear-ratio systems), or on individual selection of driving mode (i.e sport, comfort). It is hypothesised that adaptation of the steering sensitivity based on frequency measures of individual drivers' steering behaviour could improve driving comfort and safety. In a fixed-base driving simulator experiment involving 24 participants, real-time adaptation of steering wheel sensitivity based on individual drivers' steering behaviour was compared to three different fixed steering sensitivity settings on a road with changing road curvature. Here I show that intermittent switching frequency in drivers' steering movements can be used to adapt the vehicle's steering response to a varying road curvature. Significant differences in intermittent switching were found between different road curvature sections and between different steering sensitivity settings.

Though studies have shown that these steering systems affect the steering performance positively, the effect on driving behavior and driver acceptance is not taken into account. Moreover, the effect of machine-initiated and driver-initiated steering systems on the driver has yet to be investigated. The aim of this driving simulator study was to examine the effects of machine-initiated and driver-initiated steering systems on driving behavior and driver acceptance. During the experiment, the machine switched between a slow and fast steering response on predetermined locations based on the traffic conditions and road curvature, and the driver could switch the steering response by pressing a mouse-button which was attached to the steering wheel. The expectation was that the preferred steering response would be dependent on the steering task, and that between machine- and driver-initiated steering there would be a trade-off between effort and acceptance. Twenty-four participants drove with a constant velocity on a two-lane road with three sections i.e. overtaking traffic vehicles, driving on a straight road and driving on a curved road. Four conditions were completed in a counter-balanced order i.e. passive slow steering response (PS), passive fast steering response (PF), machine-initiated steering (MI) and driver-initiated steering (DI). A post-experiment questionnaire showed that the participants had a preferred steering response for each of the three sections: between slow and fast for overtaking, slow on the straight road, and fast on the curved road. Furthermore, a lower effort and higher acceptance was achieved with the active steering systems compared to the passive steering systems, where there were no significant differences between MI and DI.

With climate change, the already harsh ocean environment may become more severe. It is expected that future wave conditions can compromise the structural integrity of the lighthouses with their violent impact. The hydrodynamic processes of wave transition before, at, and after the point of impact are complex, highly non-linear, and turbulent. There is no exact description of these processes. Therefore, there is a need to further study them in order to better understand the broken wave load and its effect on the structural integrity of lighthouses. From the very beginning, wave breaking processes are complex. For instance, prior to impact with shoal-mounted cylindrical structures, waves undergo a rapid transition from deep to shallow water. During this transition the waves shoal, start to break, and once broken they hit the cylindrical structure of the lighthouse. It is therefore necessary to approximate the hydrodynamics. Since, it is difficult to measure the processes using only physical models. Consequently, this research focuses on broken wave load analysis using a process-based numerical model. An approach widely used for analysing wave forces on slender cylindrical structures is calibrated for breaking wave loads. Critical factors for determining these loads are the curling factor and slamming coefficient. However, there is still no scientific consensus regarding the exact values for these parameters. Further research, like this study, can help in determining these values. The main goal of this thesis is to assess the pressure distribution on the structure and quantify the values for the curling factor and slamming coefficient for a shoal-mounted slender cylindrical structure. The STORMLAMP (STructural behaviour Of Rock Mounted Lighthouses At the Mercy of imPulsive waves) project's experimental data of Dassanayake et al. (2019) is used as a benchmark case to validate the proposed computational framework. In addition, the performance of two different Volume of Fluid methods, isoAdvector and MULES, are assessed. This study demonstrates that the curling factor and slamming coefficient are significantly different for the broken wave load compared to the breaking wave load. The curling factor is found to be twice as large in the case of a broken wave load. On the other hand, the peak slamming coefficient is five times smaller. Moreover, the isoAdvector solver in comparison to the MULES solver produces results that better resemble the benchmark case results. Although the two solvers do not produce the same peak impact forces, they do both produce similar values for the aforementioned critical parameters. Also, it was found that the isoAdvector solver is faster and more efficient than the MULES solver in the case of a 3D simulation. From the results it can be concluded that the chosen numerical framework represents the benchmark case well, and that the methodology used for breaking wave loads can be applied for broken wave loads with adjustment of the curling factor and slamming coefficient.","OpenFOAM; STORMLAMP; broken wave load; isoAdvector; MULES","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","",""

(mentor); Fenu, Michele (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Articular cartilage is an avascular tissue type with very limited self-repair capacity, making it prone to degenerative diseases such as osteoarthritis (OA). The current therapeutic strategy for OA patients is predominantly directed towards pain relief rather than preventing degeneration and promoting the regeneration of cartilage tissue. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been proposed as a potential cell source for articular cartilage tissue engineering purposes. MSCs are mechanosensitive cells capable of sensing, transmitting, and responding to mechanical cues from their microenvironment through a process known as mechanotransduction. Utilizing the mechanotransductive behaviour of MSCs, cell differentiation can be directed towards a specific phenotype, in our case a chondrogenic cell. Considerable effort has been put into the identification of mechanotransductional regulators for chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs. However, due to the interdependency of the material properties by the crosslinking density, the effect of isolated material properties on cells remains unknown, and limits researchers to develop smart biomaterials for tissue engineering purposes through the concept of mechanobiology. This thesis will examine how material properties such as substrate stiffness and mesh size affect the chondrogenic differentiation potential of MSCs. A Unique approach based on the tunability of hydrogels to uncouple gel stiffness and mesh from each other will be used to assess the effect of isolated material properties. A hyaluronan based hydrogel with tyramine as a crosslinker (Ha-Tyr) enzymatically crosslinked with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) will be used within this study. As tunable parameters for the Ha- Tyr hydrogel, the polymer and H2O2 concentration were altered independently from each other. The evidence from this study confirmed that the gel stiffness of Ha-Tyr based hydrogels is polymer concentration and H2O2 concentration dependent. The tunability of these two parameters independently from each other enabled the production of different gel conditions having matching bulk stiffness. Unfortunately, the mesh size determination was not precise enough for complete uncoupling of the gel stiffness and mesh size from each other. Despite its limitations, the findings indicate that the mesh size shows a trend towards larger mesh size with increasing polymer concentration and lower H2O2 concentration. Thereby, indicating that difference in crosslinking density may have been the driving force for the observed trend. Translation of the effect of material properties on the chondrogenic potential of MSCs indicated towards reduced cartilage-like matrix deposition with increasing crosslinking density. These findings suggest that in general the matrix deposition of cartilage-like tissue is driven by the crosslinking density rather than gel stiffness. Furthermore, gene expression levels for ECM remodelling genes like MMP1 and MMP3 showed increased expression patterns with higher crosslinking density, which hints towards the fact that these MMPs may have played a pivotal role in the observed matrix deposition. The information obtained helps to identify mechanotransductional regulators that could be used for the development of smart biomaterials for tissue engineering purposes. Ultimately, it brings us a step closer to the development of functional cartilage tissue that could be used as a possible therapeutic strategy for OA patients.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-01-01","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The purpose of this research is to find an alternative to the natural gas-fueled heating systems of dwellings for the neighborhood of Westenholte. Reasons for replacing this system include the high GHG emissions, resulting from the combustion product of natural gas (CO2), in addition to its greenhouse effect. As a solution to replace the GHG-intensive heating of dwellings, a district heating (DH) network is proposed. This heating system does not involve the vast amount of natural gas needed by the traditional system, leading to the desired reduction in CO2 emissions. However, constructing and using a DH network is considered a large investment, which might be higher in total cost in comparison to the traditional, CO2 emission intensive, heating system. Both the cost and CO2 emission of a new DH should be minimalized. Therefore, the following KPIs are selected for comparison of the DH network: CAPEX, OPEX, and LCOE to indicate the cost, as well as CO2 emission to indicate the difference in GHG emissions. The KPIs of the DH of Westenholte are then compared to a reference solution: a decentralized all-electric solution, which also stands largely independent of natural gas. These KPI of the DH of Westenholte are to be compared to a reference solution: a decentralized all-electric solution, which is also largely independent of natural gas. Two temperature regimes of the distribution temperature of the DH are calculated and optimized for the neighborhood of Westenholte. By using a lower temperature (50/30 °C) in comparison to the more conventional temperature (70/40 ° C), the KPIs could be improved. Lowering the distribution temperature could make the heat pumps more efficient, subsequently reducing the overall cost. Additionally, the DH can probably reduce the GHG emission and, at the same time, is cheaper by using multiple renewable heat sources. As the heat profile over time differs for all heat sources, using a combination of the energy sources is estimated to create a better match with the heat demand profile. This would reduce the required heat production, storage, and associated CO2 emission and cost. In this study, a DH network is divided into the different submodules – heat demand, supply, and coupling of demand and supply – and then modeled in Python. The heat demand submodule models the heat demand of the dwellings, including the domestic hot water (DHW). In the heat supply submodule, all the available thermal energy sources used are modeled: wastewater (TEWW), surface water (TESW), solar, and industrial waste (IWH). The coupling module then matches the demand and supply geographically, by modeling the distribution grid, and, in time, also by modeling the thermal energy storage. For the DH of Westenholte, the lowest LCOE of 0.15 € /kWh was found for a 70/40 °C DH combination of 25 percent IWH, 60 percent TEWW, and 15 percent TESW in addition to a peak supply, however, generating 34.67 ton/year CO2 emission. A DH network of 50/30 °C would provide the lowest CO2 emission, which would use 25 percent IWH and 75 percent solar thermal energy inducing a CO2 emission of 2.76 ton/year, nonetheless, requiring an LCOE of 0.40 e /kWh. In contrast to the all-electric reference scenario with an LCOE of 0.22 € /kWh and a CO2 emission of 49 ton/year, the LCOE-optimized scenario proved both cheaper and dissipating lower CO2 emissions.","District heating; Thermal energy storage; renewable heat sources; LCOE","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-05-28","","","","","",""

In order to validate these biomaterials, better in vitro techniques are required that could mimic this inflammatory response immediately after implantation in more detail.

It was found that the use of a co-culture did not have a positive effect on OB differentiation.

Furthermore the effect of a dynamic flow, initiated 2 days after seeding, on osteogenic differentiation of OB and CO12 was investigated. After 7 days of dynamic culture, Runx2 levels of the mono-cultures were significantly higher than the static cultures. OBs were positively affected by forming dense cell layers throughout the entire microfluidic channel. For dynamic co-cultures, no to little cells were present inside the channel after 7 days.

(graduation committee); Schreppers, Gerd Jan (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","There are multiple numerical methods for analysing the stability of slopes. Commonly used methods for assessing the slope stability are the slip surface method, strength reduction methods or methods based on load increments. What those methods have in common is that the stability of a slope is assessed by a factor of safety or critical stability number. These dimensionless factors give an indication of the global stability of a slope. A critical stability number is computed through load increments while a factor of safety is based on the strength parameters of the soil. A relatively new XFEM-based method for analysing slope stability is being implemented in the finite element software of Diana FEA. Unique with respect to the other methods is that this method detects onset of localisation and captures the propagation of the slip surface. Therefore, this method is referred to as the propagation method in this work. The propagation method consist of three main procedure steps. First, onset of localisation is detected during incremental loading of the model and the direction of the localisation plain is obtained. In step two, enrichment elements are implemented at the location of localisation, which are able to reproduce a jump in the displacement field. This is followed by a search algorithm for detection of localisation in adjacent elements. From here on, the implementation of the enrichment elements continues till a fully developed slip surface is present, resulting in global failure of the slope. Those procedure steps need to be tested and verified. The objective of this thesis is to verify onset of localisation on element level and to provide a method for verification of the point of global failure in analyses with the propagation method. Onset of localisation is verified with analytical expressions and with numerical results. A critical stability number is used to assess the slope stability in analyses with the propagation method. A relation between the critical stability number and the factor of safety is needed, to be able to compute a factor of safety with the propagation method which is similar to a factor of safety of the slip surface method and a strength reduction method. This relation is obtained through the definitions of those factors. This creates possibilities to asses the stability of a slope with the propagation method by a factor of safety and this factor of safety can be verified with the results of a strength reduction method and a slip surface method. In addition, benchmarks are generated with the aforementioned slope stability analysis methods, which can be used for verification of the factor of safety of the propagation method. The benchmarks are the result of parameter and convergence studies. In the parameter studies, the effect of the Poisson ratio and the dilatancy angle on the factor of safety is studied. This is done by computing the maximum vertical displacements during stability analyses with various values of the Poisson ratio and the dilatancy angle. Those displacements are plotted versus the corresponding factor of safety. The resulting plots provide characteristic information which can be used for verification of the propagation method. The convergence studies are performed in order to obtain reliable factors of safety that can serve as a benchmark. The factors of safety are computed for various mesh sizes and different convergence criteria. From the results, a reliable factor of safety is obtained that can be used as a benchmark for the corresponding finite element model. In the end, a development version of the propagation method is tested and the results are verified with a benchmark which is generated with a finite element model containing interface elements.","XFEM; localisation; slope instability; verification; factor of safety; stability number","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although this has been the gold standard for treatment for years, it also comes with disadvantages. These are the weight, not being water-resistant and a lack of ventilation, leading to skin problems, itching and compromised hygiene. Furthermore, plaster has no possibility for visual inspection of the skin, while up to 30% of all treatments with plaster casting lead to, mainly skin related, problems. With 3D printing, a lightweight, waterproof, open latticed and personalized cast can be created to overcome the issues with plaster casting. Multiple start-ups, researchers and other individuals already created these 3D printed casts, however, there is no consensus about the materials and design that should be used. Also, implementation of these 3D printed wrist casts into clinical practice stays out. The main research goal is to investigate the feasibility of in-house design, production and implementation of 3D printed wrist casts for the treatment of distal radius fractures. METHODS To answer the main research question, multiple sub studies were performed. First, design requirements were formulated in consultation with clinicians. Then, material tests were performed, followed by creating a design workflow. Subsequently, the optimal design pattern and validation of the stabilization requirements were investigated during a mechanical phantom study. Also, to affirm adequate ease of use and comfort, a comfort study was carried out. The final step was a pilot study, in which the necessary alterations in the workflow were investigated, as well as clinical outcomes and patient experiences. RESULTS The material tests showed that color resin, printed with an SLA printer is most suitable for the production of 3D printed wrist casts. A semi-automated design workflow was created in which a 3D printed wrist cast can be produced within 24 hours. A 3D printed cast with a Voronoi design pattern is most successful for adequate wrist immobilization, achieving similar stabilization abilities as a plaster cast. Furthermore, the comfort study showed that the 3D printed wrist casts ensure adequate comfort, with a mean score of 8.1 out of 10.0 and sufficient ease of use. During the pilot study, two children with greenstick or buckle/torus fractures were successfully treated with the wrist casts. To implement the treatment of distal radius fractures with 3D printed wrist casts into the current workflow, a workflow as used for traditional treatment during the evenings and weekends is required.<br/>CONCLUSIONA customized, lightweight, water-resistant and ventilated wrist cast can successfully be designed, with adequate stabilization abilities. This cast can be produced within 24 hours, with the use of a semi-automated design algorithm that creates a wrist cast with ventilation holes based on a Voronoi pattern. The 3D printing should be performed with an SLA printer, with the use of color resin. The produced wrist casts ensure adequate comfort and ease of use and can be implemented clinically for successful treatment of children with greenstick and buckle/torus fractures. Only small alterations are necessary in the current workflow to allow for the production of the 3D printed wrist casts. No extra hospital visits are required and the new workflow is comparable to the weekend workflow. Further research is necessary to tackle the unfavorable cost-effectiveness and the adaption of the casts to swelling. For the future, treatment with 3D printed casts should be extrapolated to unstable fractures, other body parts and the field of orthotics.","3D Printing; Distal radius fracture; Fracture management; Personalized medicine; Wrist cast","en","master thesis","","","","","","Joint degree of Master of Science in Technical Medicine Leiden University ; Delft University of Technology ; Erasmus University Rotterdam","","","","","","Technical Medicine | Imaging and Intervention","",""

However, sea-level-rise and an increase in single extreme events due to climate change, threaten the coastal areas and their inhabitants. Governmental organizations, coastal managers and various private parties thrive for better insights into long-term shoreline behavior for sustainable decision-making. Currently, these insights are gathered by process-driven models that are often time expensive, require local input and calibration, and are often limited by equations. However, satellite imagery proved to be a promising data source to derive historic shoreline behavior on a global scale. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are suggested to create an extra in-depth understanding of these satellite images. The increase in the availability of both satellite data and ML algorithms opens possibilities for shoreline forecasting on a global scale. This research aims to improve forecasting of shorelines by creating a global model in which cross-time series information can be used. To encourage a meaningful exchange of time series information, a clustering forecasting approach is proposed.This research builds upon the yearly SDS data behind the Shoreline Monitor of Deltares. The SDS dataset captures shoreline evolution and behavior on a global scale by quantifying it in time series. The SDS dataset consists of transects every 500 m along the global coast and contains 33 years (1984-2016) of shoreline evolution. First, in order to cluster transects, the features for clustering were defined. Here, clustering features were divided into time series features and hydraulic and geomorphic features. Whether transect clustering could improve shoreline forecasting, based on these time series and hydraulic and geomorphic features, was explored. For this thesis, it was decided to focus on time series features for further clustering usage. Eventually, a shape-based transect representation was chosen as feature for input of the clustering algorithm. Around 350,000 globally distributed sandy transects were assigned to nine different main clusters, with a semi-unsupervised clustering approach. These nine clusters captured global sandy shoreline behavior ranging from extreme erosion to extreme accretion and proved to be a practical tool to quantify the (distribution of) shoreline behavior on different spatial scales. Subsequently, a second supervised step was developed to create sub-clusters to gain more insights into the trends of the nine clusters. With this supervised sub-clustering step, three sub-clusters were generated for each of the five largest clusters, allowing for the distinction between accelerating and decelerating behavior in the last decade of time series per cluster. Global, country-level and local case studies showed the potential of these sub-cluster refinements. Hereafter, the nine main clusters were separately used as input for four different forecasting algorithms. This resulted in predictions per cluster with a more reliable and more accurate seven-year forecast for &gt;95 % of the transects, sometimes improving accuracy up to factor 15, compared to recently published work. Furthermore, a multi-method approach was created to determine the most reliable forecast, on a local scale by combining overall accuracy and information gained during clustering. Time series clustering enhances the forecasting of transects based on overall accuracy and local reliability. The multi-method approach for selecting the appropriate prediction on a local level, could be a practical tool for governments to apply. Besides, a vulnerability assessment explores the possible application of the predictions and underlines the need for global databases regarding the coastal zone. However, further research should consider incorporating hydraulic and geomorphic features to strengthen the clustering of transects. Hence, shoreline forecasting based on historical data should be considered as a valuable tool for sustainable decision-making regarding coastal zones.","Planetary-scale; Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Classification; Clustering; Forecasting; Long-term; Satellite Imagery; Python; shoreline variation; Shoreline change modelling; Coastal management; coastal safety assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-01-01","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","",""

A force grip has to compensate for the low friction coefficient between the gripper’s jaws and tissue surface. This study focuses on the development of a suction gripper as an alternative for the well-known tissue gripper. Suction technology applies only normal forces to grip the tissue without the need to enclose it. Inspiration is taken from biological suction discs. These are able to attach to a wide variety of substrates, varying from slimy surfaces to rough rocks subjected to chaotic streams. The designed suction gripper is divided into two parts; the suction chamber inside the handle where vacuum pressure is generated, and the suction tip that makes contact with the target tissue. The suction tip fits trough a 10 mm diameter trocar, and unfolds in a larger suction surface when being retracted from the trocar. The suction tip is built in a layered manner. Each layer focuses on a specific function to allow for safe and effective tissue handling: 1) Foldability, 2) Air Tightness, and 3) Slide ability. The footprint of the tip focuses on its adaptability to different substrates. Experimental validation of the suction tip’s attachment performance on slippery and flexible phantom tissue showed a maximal attachment force of 3.27±0.15 N. The occurrence of leakage appeared to be the main reason that larger attachment forces are not reached. The proposed prototype of the suction tip provides a base for further research to develop a reliable and effective tissue gripper actuated by suction.","Suction disc; biologically inspired design; Suction gripper; Minimal Invasive Surgery; Soft Robotics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-05-29","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

It takes the user to wait 2-5 weeks to receive the prosthetic socket. In addition, most of the conventional sockets have fixed volumes that do not consider the volume fluctuations that the user experience daily because of muscle activities and comorbid medical conditions. 3D printing has shown promising results in producing lower limb sockets; however, upper limb sockets are overlooked. The goal of this master thesis is to design and fabricate a volume-adjustable, affordable, 3D printable transradial, prosthetic socket. In this research, the V3D (Volume-adjustable, 3D printable) socket has been developed with a material cost of only €30. The socket provides a volume-adjustable closure system around the residual limb, easiness of donning and doffing without skin shearing, full elbow extension, high range of flexion, low weight, and breathability. The socket was designed to be able to withstand a load of 50N that can be applied axially or transversely at the tip of the socket without breakage. The designed socket was 3D printed using the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) printing technique, from tough Polylactic Acid (tough PLA). Mechanical and human assessments have been conducted to evaluate the strength, function, and comfort of the developed socket. Results have shown that the socket managed to withstand a load up to 100N that was applied axially and transversely, respectively, without showing any signs of damage. During testing the socket with 5 participants for evaluating its comfort and function, the socket has succeeded to achieve full contact with the residual limbs, while offering volume-adjustability that accommodated the differences in size and properties of the residual limbs among participants. Not only that, but also, the socket succeeded to allow full elbow extension, a range of flexion up to 95°, and donning and doffing in less than 10 seconds without applying any shear forces on the skin. The developed V3D socket has proven the possibility to 3D print reliable sockets using the FDM printing technique with a total labor time of 4 hours per socket, and a total fabrication time of 5 days with a material cost of only €30. In addition, the socket has proved that it can be fitted using a caliper in case 3D scanners are not available. That advantage makes producing the V3D socket feasible in communities that do not have access to 3D scanners. Furthermore, the socket can be parameterized such that users with similar geometry and comparable sizes of residual limbs can fit the same socket, which would make the fabrication process less labor-intensive and less time-consuming as it was aimed for.","transradial; prosthetic socket; 3d printing; Volume-adjustable; Adaptable; Affordable","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

Applications for inertial-based orientation estimation can already be found in the field of computer vision, aerospace engineering, robotics, navigation, biomechanics, health monitoring and sports. In order to enable non-intrusive, long-term tracking, this study addresses the problem of orientation estimation using a loosely attached IMU. To this end, a hybrid model is proposed combining<br/>classical orientation methods with machine learning (ML) techniques. Previous works have focused only on parts of this task, which is why to date, there are little to no solutions to this problem. In this study, a model is designed containing three steps that are shown to be beneficial for reducing the estimation error. With the first step, the model becomes robust to a misaligned mounting of the loosely attached IMU and it allows to identify which part of the error can be contributed to the average misalignment. For the second step, two<br/>algorithms are presented which make the model invariant to the absolute heading direction of the recorded data. In the third step, the data is prepared such that the size of the search space is reduced by a factor 2. Therefore, less data is required for learning the problem or, with an equal amount of data, a bigger part of the process can be discovered. Besides these steps, it is shown that the use of physics-based knowledge in the form of orientation estimates,<br/>as opposed to raw inertial data as input features for the ML method, is beneficial.","IMU; machine learning; Recurrent Neural Network; Wearable; Physics-based and data-driven; Loosely attached; Orientation estimation; EKF; Preprocessing unit quaternions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

This product is developed by 510, the data and digitalization imitative of the Netherlands Red Cross. Through 121, a person affected (PA) by a humanitarian disaster, can receive Cash Based Aid (CBA) and Information as Aid (IAA). CBA is new form of aid, where the PA receives digital money instead of traditional in-kind aid such as food or water. There are several benefits of CBA over in-kind aid. First, it can be delivered faster as the PA does not have to travel to a certain location to receive the aid, but can receive it on their digital device. Furthermore, it can be safer for PA and Aid Workers (AW) as no cash money needs to be handled. Also, it creates more autonomy for the PA on how to use the aid. And last, for AW the process is more efficient because of the digitalization. 121 is a promising product that could be used in many different humanitarian contexts. Ideally, the product can be used autonomously. Meaning that the PA can register, receive the aid, and use the digital money without additional support. However, research by 510 showed that often people cannot use the product autonomously and need additional support. This support be for example an aid worker assisting with the registration, or providing internet access for people who have no access to internet. This graduation assignment was focused on finding out, what support system functionalities might be needed, for the product 121 to function optimally. Also, the goal of the project was to show the need and relevance of this support system to external stakeholders and internal stakeholders of 510, so that the development of a support system becomes an integral part in the development of 121. A case study on undocumented migrants has been conducted, to find out what support system functionalities might be needed for that specific context. This humanitarian context was chosen, because a 121 pilot program ran from November 2020 until May 2021. During this pilot program, insights of the product in context could be gathered. Also, through an ethnographic study, insights from the end users, the undocumented migrants and aid workers have been gathered. With the insights from the case study, design requirements could be formulated, for the design of a tool to design the support system for a certain context, and to show the need and relevance for this support system. The final concept is a support system design approach consisting of four steps. The approach is accompanied with templates and a support system design canvas. This canvas has been specifically designed to facilitate problem finding and solution generation for support system functionalities. Through a creative session with 510’s team members and external stakeholders, the canvas can be filled in and the support system functionalities defined. The last step is implementing these functionalities in the further design of 121.

These complaints are often diagnosed as overuse syndrome, where physical changes are not apparent and of which the etiology is not yet understood. Mechanical overload might be part of the equation. Only limited research has been done to evaluate whether the biomechanics of violin playing differ between violinists with and without overuse syndrome. Muscle activity has been reported to differ between violinists with and without pain, but findings were often inconsistent. This study aims to evaluate the biomechanics of the musculoskeletal system in the neck and left shoulder region in violin players with and without pain complaints while playing different musical excerpts.<br/><br/>Method:<br/>Twenty violinists, 10 with and 10 without pain complaints, were playing three musical pieces containing different wrist and bow motions. These were measured using motion capture and chin-violin force measurements. An upper body model was created by combining a neck model with a shoulder model in OpenSim, which was then used to calculate joint angles and moments of the neck and left shoulder. Differences in the kinematics and kinetics of violin playing were assessed by investigating mean values as well as the variability around these average values. The mean values of the joint angles and joint moments were compared over time during selections of bowing cycles and cycles of wrist movement. The kinematic variability was assessed with the standard deviations of the mean in each playing condition.<br/><br/>Findings:<br/>Kinematic and kinetic differences were found between symptomatic and pain-free violinists during fast bowing motions. The axial rotation of the glenohumeral joint was significantly more external in violinists with overuse syndrome compared to controls. Additionally, joint moments in several degrees of freedom of the scapulothoracic and glenohumeral joints were larger in the symptomatic group compared to the asymptomatic group. Lastly, the kinematic variability of symptomatic violinists was lower than that of asymptomatic violinists.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/>These found kinematic and kinetic differences could mean that violinists with overuse syndrome play the violin with less optimal motor control, resulting in larger loads on the joints and surrounding tissues. The lower variability of kinematics in violinists with pain may indicate an increase in stiffness. Overall, these findings suggest that biomechanical differences exist between violinists with and without overuse syndrome.","Biomechanical Model; Violin Playing; Inverse Dynamics; Neck; Shoulder; Overuse Syndrome","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Chandra Mouli, G.R. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Electric vehicles (EVs) are going to take over the conventional cars industry like a wave in the foreseeable future. The exponential increase in sales of EVs is seen and market study has predicted that EV sales will increase by 15%–20% of total new vehicle sales by the year 2035. Despite being superior to fuel-driven vehicles, the increase in the number of EVs will have its challenges. For example, EVs are heavy uncontrolled charging loads that can lead to power surges in the grid which would then lessen the grid reliability. It is important to address the important question on how to maintain EV charging and use it in such a way that it will not pose a threat to the grid rather become its helping hand? The focus of this thesis will be to answer the aforementioned question. The main objective of the thesis is to minimize the cost of energy for charging EVs by developing and implementing a smart charging algorithm with V2G services considering the effects of battery degradation. The said objective is achieved by first formulating a mathematical model for the minimization optimization problem. Several assumptions were made to mimic real-life situations. Then an algorithm is developed and case studies on four sensitivity parameter are done. The parameters selected are the cost of penalty, cost of PV generation, cost of selling energy, and grid import power limitations. The case study is done to verify the sanity of the code and it has been observed that the algorithm developed prioritizes PV utilization, minimizes the overall cost of the node as well as EV charging cost. The algorithm incorporates the V2G application of EVs to support renewable (here, PV) sources. It has been observed that EVs that perform V2G generate financial benefit by exporting power to the grid and reduce the grid involvement by charging other EVs through V2G. V2G has adverse effects on the battery lifetime. Frequent charging and discharging can degrade the battery much quicker. The thesis tackles this problem by incorporating a battery degradation model in the developed algorithm for V2G. Two degradation model are used and compared to check the effectiveness and control while performing V2G. The first model is a simplified one and calculates the cost of battery degradation using energy exported from the battery. The second models the degradation considering one of the stress factors of cyclic aging which is C-rate. The newly developed model is observed to be more effective as the model is dependent on charging and discharging current rates. The EVs are seen charging just to their requested energy demand with relatively less power as compared to when the simplified degradation model is implemented. The V2G functionality is also observed to be reduced and utilized to reduce the grid involvement and reducing the overall cost of energy. Finally, the algorithm is compared with the uncontrolled charging algorithm. The developed smart charging algorithm is observed to reduce the charging cost of EVs significantly when the PV generation is sufficient. The smart charging algorithm utilizes the PV generation in supplying the energy demands of the local loads and EVs. This reduces the involvement of the grid. The grid is only observed to be involved when the cost of buying energy from the grid is lower to reduce any possible penalty for unfinished scenarios or when the PV generation is insufficient.","Smart Charging; V2G; battery degradation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","OSCD",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Since 2006, the Delft University of Technology has been working on the development of bacterial self-healing concrete (BSHC). The self-healing ability of this concrete is based on a biological mechanism, in which mineral producing bacteria are added to repair cracks autonomously. This not only improves the durability of concrete structures, but could also reduce the need for crack-limiting reinforcement. So far, bacterial self-healing technology has been used in variety of applications, especially watertight structures, but always only as an additional safety measure. Hence, the full crack-sealing capacity, related to the reinforcement reduction potential, could not be proven. This will have to be resolved in a dedicated full-scale demonstrator project. For this demonstrator project, a rectangular water reservoir has to be designed, which will essentially serve as a test case for the newly developed bacterial self-healing technology. This thesis aims to devise the concrete mixture and reinforcement layout for the side walls of this reservoir in such a way that imposed deformations induce a given degree of cracking at an early-age, which allows to demonstrate the crack-sealing capacity and reinforcement reduction potential of BSHC. The design of a concrete mixture intended for the side walls of the reservoir led to four different mixtures, all of which have a cement content of 418 kg/m³ (26% of CEM I 52.5 R and 74% CEM III/B 42.5 N), but vary in the addition of filler in the form of limestone powder and healing agent; a mixture of bacteria and calcium lactate encapsulated in PLA strings. The mixtures with healing agent, which represent BSHC, are meant for side wall A, whereas the mixtures without healing agent representing ordinary concrete can be used for side wall B, so it can serve as a reference. To investigate the effect of these additions, as well as to verify the designs and quantify the relevant physical and mechanical properties of the concrete mixtures, several tests were conducted. These revealed that the mixtures with filler exhibit a higher consistency, improved cohesiveness and more prosperous strength development compared to the mixtures without filler. Both the fresh properties and strength development were not affected by the addition of healing agent. Furthermore, it was found that the addition of filler causes autogenous shrinkage to increase by about 15%, whereas the addition of healing agent causes autogenous shrinkage to decrease by about 20%. From the cracking calculations it is concluded that it is very likely that the early-age cracking of the side walls of the reservoir occurs as a consequence of imposed deformations. Cement hydration causes a large temperature rise, resulting in significant thermal shrinkage due to the subsequent temperature drop. The imposed deformations are restrained by the floor of the reservoir, as well as the foundation material underneath. This results in a maximum probability of cracking of 65% and 93% according to two different methods. In order to demonstrate the true crack-sealing capacity of BSHC, if is preferred to obtain various crack widths along the length of the side walls and the reinforcement layout must be configured to allow this to happen. Therefore, several methods that deal with the prediction of crack widths are implemented in this case. Based on the average of all prediction methods it is found that the following crack widths occur given the longitudinal reinforcement distribution in brackets: 0.09 (Ø20-100), 0.20 (Ø20-160), 0.31 (Ø20-210) and 0.43 mm (Ø20-250).

The problem is defined as a constrained optimization problem in which the predicted error covariance is minimized subject to resource budget constraints. By applying Lagrangian Relaxation (LR) the problem is decoupled into multiple sub-optimization problems. The problem is modeled according to a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). Using a stochastic optimization framework called policy rollout, the POMDP is solved non-myopically by looking ahead into the expected future. Two novel implementations, namely a centralized and distributed implementation are presented as viable approaches for solving this problem for a multi-sensor case. The centralized implementation, defined as the approximately optimal solution, utilizes a global policy per task. As such, the policy rollout for a single target needs to explore the actions of multiple sensors. The distributed implementation is considered as a practical alternative to improve on the computational complexity of the policy rollout of the centralized implementation. Now per sensor and per task a policy rollout is computed. To maintain a similar performance as the centralized implementation, at the beginning of each policy rollout the last known actions of the other sensors are shared. An additional third independent implementation is considered. The independent implementation uses no communication during the optimization process and is considered to be the implementation with the lowest performance with respect to the cost. All implementations have been applied to multiple two-dimensional simulated radar tracking scenarios. A comparison is made between the centralized, distributed and independent implementation based on the average cost and runtime. Results indicate that both the centralized and distributed implementation outperform the independent implementation with respect to the cost by a factor two. Subsequently, the distributed solution converges to similar results as the centralized implementation while requiring significantly less computational resources.","Radar Resource Management; Distributed Sensor Network; Constrained Optimization; POMDP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","","","","Electrical Engineering | Microelectronics","",""

Most of this energy is produced by fossil fuels, which raises the importance of energy production in a more sustainable way. In order to do this on the level of residential heating applications, the Dutch government aims to make its residential neighborhoods natural gas-free. An often considered solution is making residential areas all-electric. However, when considering the heating of these households based on electricity, high peaks may occur in the electricity grid due to simultaneous heating at times of high demand. This could cause problems regarding the capacity of the electricity grid. Subsequently, the generation of electricity is nowadays associated with relatively high CO2 emissions, raising the awareness for alternative methods of heating. One of these methods is district heating coupled to (more) sustainable energy sources. A problem occurring with this combination is a possible discrepancy between the supply and demand of energy. Therefore, it could be beneficial to implement thermal energy storage in district heating. This research assesses the feasibility of different configurations of thermal energy storage integrated into district heating. For this research, a case study is conducted in which district heating for a residential area coupled with thermal energy storage is modeled. The model is based on the thermodynamic equilibrium of the network and is able to compute the required characteristics and key performance indicators of the district heating network. For the case study, multiple scenarios have been created which assess different distribution characteristics and heat sources. For reference, an all-electric scenario has been designed as well. The results of the case study show that the implementation of thermal energy storage in district heating is able to lower peak loads on the heat source by two-thirds. This implementation goes paired with an increase in levelized cost of energy of 10-16% and 8-73% higher CO2 emissions, compared to district heating without storage and depending on the characteristics of the district heating net and its heat source. However, for certain heat sources, the advantages of thermal energy storage outweigh the drawbacks or thermal energy storage might even be considered to be inevitable. This is especially the case for renewable heat sources, of which its share in the future energy market is considered to be substantial. Also, the results show that every scenario considering district heating performs better on levelized cost of energy and CO2 emissions than the all-electric scenario. When designing new DH projects, it is key that different available heat sources will be considered and that an accurate trade-off is made between the advantages and drawbacks of thermal energy storage. This research is based on the comparison of various scenarios for a case study. Therefore, it does not focus on finding the optimal parameters for either district heating or thermal energy storage. For finding these optimal parameters, future research must be conducted.","District Heating Network; Thermal Energy Storage; Feasibility assessment; LCOE","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

A promising therapy is targeted radionuclide therapy, where the radionuclide is brought to the tumor by a targeting specific<br/>vector. Bringing the radionuclide directly to the tumor, should reduce the dose to the healthy tissue. For targeted radionuclide therapy, a radionuclide with a high specific activity is required. Some radionuclides,<br/>with promising half-lives and decay energies, are currently not produced with the required specific activity. This problem occurs mainly for radionuclides that are produced via (n,γ) reactions in nuclear reactors. For radionuclides that are produced via this reaction, it is nearly impossible to do a chemical separation between the target material and the produced radionuclide, because these are of the same element. This is why new production routes have to be investigated. In this thesis a feasibility study has been done for a new production method, which should increase the specific activity of radionuclides that are produced via a (n,γ) reaction. For this production method, the target material is labeled with a chelator. Due to the Szilard-Chalmers effect the bond with the chelator will be broken, when the target material is activated by a neutron. This enables the separation of the produced radionuclide from the target complex and therefore, the extraction of the radionuclide. The production method will be loop-based, in order to enable continuous activation of the target material and extraction of the radionuclide. Furthermore, the loop-based design should minimize the effect of radiolysis and relabeling. The loop will be placed close to the reactor core. In this thesis, the elements holmium and lutetium have been used. It has been determined which chelator is most suitable to label with holmium and lutetium. Furthermore, the stability of this complex has been investigated for: higher temperatures, time and the effect of the γ-radiation. The effect of the γ-radiation was determined because this results in radiolysis. The extraction of the radionuclide has also been investigated. These parameters have been used in the calculation of the possible achievable specific activity of 166Ho and 177Lu, when using this loop-based production method. Labeling was possible with the chelator DOTA, which resulted in a stable complex, even for higher temperatures. Labeling happened fast, which also results in fast relabeling. The effect of radiolysis, due to the γ-radiation, was determined by fitting the experimental data. The fit gave negative values for short irradiation times, which is not possible. Therefore, two possible fits were made, which did not give negative results. The first fit was shifted over the y-axis and for the second fit the negative values were assigned to be zero....","hot; atom; Szilard-Chalmers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","",""

Current clinical practice consists of treating IH once it has occurred, by medical or surgical interventions. This is later than desired, as secondary injury has already been initiated. A pre-emptive approach may be preferable, and seems possible since many physiological variables that may aggravate IH are known and can be managed clinically. The aim of this research is to develop a machine learning method that is able to predict whether or not a patient will develop IH in the near future during ICU stay. Methods A cohort of 114 patients with TBI admitted to the ICU of Erasmus MC was selected. Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models were trained and evaluated with 26 clinical variables to predict IH. The effect of the length of the minimal IH period, the length of the prediction window and the number of included variables was evaluated. Primary outcome measures were the model loss, accuracy, and Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC). Results We achieved a mean AUC of 0,83 [95% CI: 0,68-0,98] with a model predicting periods of ICP≥20mmHg lasting at least 15 minutes, using a prediction window of 30 minutes and using only the ICP and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP).

RFI can introduce errors in the position and time calculations or if the interference is very severe, can lead to a total loss of GNSS reception. This vulnerability of GNSS can have large implications on critical infrastructure such as power plants, telephony, aviation or search and rescue operations. RFI is a real threat to GNSS as many interfering incidents are reported every day. A common type of RFI is chirp interference, which is a sweep over a wide range of frequencies that overlap with the frequencies used by GNSS. This is often emitted by cheap Personal Privacy Devices that can be bought online. The question in this thesis was how well such interference can be modelled and if modelling could help mitigation against it. This thesis consists of two main parts. In the first part a novel estimator is proposed that assumes a mathematical model of a chirp and estimates its parameters from recordings of chirps. The estimator has shown to work well in simulations for chirps with an SNR of −9 dB or more. On real recordings the estimates were accurate for 66.7 % of the signals. In the second part the estimator was used to derive a filter. The filter is based on the subtraction of a replica of the chirp interference from the received signal. It uses the proposed estimator to create the replica. In simulations, the filter is able to improve correlation strength by up to 7 dB. On real recordings the performance was worse as for only 46 % of the recordings the GNSS correlation was increased. Both the estimator and filter have many ways in which they could be improved. The estimator can be improved to allow for more complex chirps, which would in turn improve the filter. Both can also be made more computationally efficient. Furthermore, in order to get a better understanding of Personal Privacy Devices, one such device has been tested. It was found that the signal from the device was very unstable and changed much over time, it was also highly dependent on ambient temperature.","gnss; interference; jamming; chirp; gps","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although offshore wind power is to play a leading part in the future Dutch power system, long-term energy storage and hard-to-electrify energy consumers are in need of other energy carriers as well. Hydrogen gas is able to provide this system essential. For the production of green hydrogen gas, offshore wind is a promising option because it has a high capacity factor, relative to other sustainable energy technologies. Vice versa, hydrogen production can strengthen the business case of offshore wind as the average power price will decreases as a result of increasing power grid penetration from renewable energy power generators. Furthermore, the expansion of offshore wind in the Netherlands may lead to high cable costs with increasing distances to shore and onshore grid congestion. Hydrogen production can circumvent these problems while continuing the decarbonisation of the Dutch energy system. This study aims to determine the most profitable offshore hydrogen wind hub configuration for 2030 and 2040. To determine the optimal configuration, this thesis evaluates two main considerations. First, whether onshore or offshore electrolysis is more profitable. Second, whether a bidirectional or unidirectional grid connection may increase the profitability of respectively the onshore or offshore electrolysis configuration. For this evaluation, six configurations are examined that aim to represent the spectrum of possibilities on how a 12 GW hydrogen wind hub could be integrated in the energy system. These configurations vary in their positioning of the electrolyser (onshore/offshore), electrolyser capacity (11.5/9.5/5.6 GW) and grid connection capacities (0/2/6 GW). To compare the profitability of each configuration, this thesis evaluates their cost and revenues. The cost analysis is conducted through a literature study. The revenue analysis is performed by modeling the hydrogen production of each configuration for a given weather year in order to establish the hydrogen production cost. Additionally, for the grid-connect configurations, the power revenues are estimated using the Plexos power market model. This evaluation reveals whether the grid connection configurations can profit from both volatile power prices (sell \&amp; buy) and a stable hydrogen price. All analyses use a screenshot approach on the year 2030 and 2040. Thus, annual cost and annual revenues are expressed for these years. In the cost analysis, cost variations are taken into account for the HVDC-components, offshore installation factor and WACC. Also, different distances to shore of the wind hub are taken into account (i.e. 88, 209 \&amp; 330 km). For the power revenue analysis, the power system state data on 2030 and 2040 are used from the 'Ten-year network development plan' of ENTSOG/ENTSO-E, which span over more than ten years. From this data, the 'Global ambition' scenario and the weather year 1982 are used. This 'Global ambition' scenario represents a pathway of centralised innovation. In order to establish future power prices, the Plexos power market modelling tool is used to solve an hourly Unit Commitment Economic Dispatch problem by Mixed Integer Linear Programming. This nodal model consist of 59 EU- and surrounding non-EU countries. Additionally, a hydrogen market price is established in which the feedstock sector is assumed to be price-setter as an international hydrogen market is non-existent for now. In 2030, onshore electrolysis is more economical than offshore electrolysis as the electrolyser investment cost and accompanying offshore installation cost are high. The dedicated hydrogen configurations and the grid connection configurations have equal hydrogen production cost; 3.10 €/kg. In 2040, onshore and offshore electrolysis are equally economical up to about 200 km from shore. At larger distances, offshore electrolysis is more economical. Uncertainty in the system cost and differences in system cost between onshore and offshore electrolysis and per distance to shore are found to mainly result from uncertainty in the offshore installation factor, the cost of HVDC component and the WACC. The bidirectional 2 GW grid connection of onshore electrolysis and the unidirectional 2 GW grid connection of offshore electrolysis both result in the same hydrogen production cost as the dedicated hydrogen configuration; 2.50 €/kg. Overall, considering the operation of a hydrogen wind hub through 2030 and 2040 within one life cycle, there is no significant advantage of grid connection as the break-even prices of the 2 GW grid connected configurations and the dedicated hydrogen configurations are similar. Nevertheless, a 2 GW grid connection might provide risk spreading for the investor and a lower total hydrogen subsidy amount to achieve a profitable configuration. The larger grid connection of 6 GW is definitely less profitable operating through 2030 and 2040. When assuming the future technological maturity of turbines with DC output, efficient electronic power converters (DC-DC) and electrochemical compression combined with optimistic cost reduction of the electrolyser, the hydrogen production cost decrease to 2.65 €/kg in 2030 and 2.30 €/kg in 2040. Given these production cost, the 2 GW grid connected configuration and dedicated hydrogen configuration become competitive with grey hydrogen production in 2040 based on natural gas price of 7.31 €/GJ and 80 €/tCO\textsubscript{2}. An important note is that the current CO\textsubscript{2} price already surpassed the price trajectory for 2030 as used in this study. Variations in turbine cost will affect the production cost as well. However, in this thesis the emphasis is more on the comparison of the configurations than on the absolute level of the production cost. For different turbine cost, the comparison remains similar as the turbine capacity is equal for all configurations. Therefore, a fixed cost reduction is used for the wind turbines. Future techno-economic development of in-turbine electrolysis will determine whether decentralised electrolysis becomes beneficial over centralised electrolysis. It is recommended that the North Sea offshore wind infrastructural planning must take into account the broader potential of 60 GW Dutch North sea wind in 2050 (+ 450 GW onshore in Europe) and the forthcoming power grid challenges in all North sea countries. For specifically offshore wind-based hydrogen production, electrolyser capacity planning towards and beyond 2050 should be considered as the economies of scale of hydrogen pipelines might favour offshore electrolysis as the overall cost might be lower. Future onshore electrolysis provides possible symbiosis with solar PV, nuclear \&amp; natural gas power generation and industry thereby limiting grid congestion and increasing the electrolyser load factor. Future modelling efforts that aim to value the benefits of combined hydrogen and power production should focus on different demand-side-response and power-to-gas capacities as both affect the volatility of the power prices. Also, alternative trajectories of the CO\textsubscript{2} price and energy system scenarios should be incorporated in the power price modelling. Furthermore, the power market model can be improved by including the recovery of long run marginal cost, strategic bidding behaviour and sector coupling of power and heat.","hydrogen; Power System Modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The main research question of this project is: How does the performance of the main engine of a deep-sea cargo vessel fuelled with diesel-ammonia compare to one fuelled by diesel only? The TU Delft engine B model is chosen to model the behaviour of an engine of an ocean going cargo vessel. The model has been adapted to simulate the behaviour of diesel-ammonia engines. The adapted model is used to compare the performance of a diesel only engine with a diesel-ammonia engine. The main conclusion from this study is that diesel-ammonia engine compared to diesel only engines have a higher specific fuel consumption because of the lower heating value of ammonia. Newly designed diesel-ammonia engines can potentially be more power dense because of stoichiometric air-fuel ratio of ammonia. However, the combustion efficiency could be a limiting factor. The diesel-ammonia engine emits significantly less CO2 and SOx emissions. However, ammonia emissions, caused by incomplete combustion, and an increase in NOx emissions, caused by the nitrogen in ammonia, are a concern. Furthermore, diesel-ammonia engines operate at lower maximum pressures and temperatures, therefore the mechanical limits of the engine are not exceeded. Lastly, diesel-ammonia engines do not require a different turbo charger system.","ammonia; two-stroke engine; marine engine; modelling; alternative fuels; dual fuel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Marine Engineering","",""

In a highly globalised world, it is expected to become more important over the years. Inter-urban freight transport has a major role when it comes to resource consumption, pollution and climate change. Thus, its decarbonisation is one of the biggest challenges to be tackled nowadays. One way of achieving decarbonisation is a modal shift from more polluting modes to less polluting ones. In this research, we investigate Brazil as a case study due to its rapid growth in transportation demand, the need for new transportation infrastructure and its uneven modal split. The high-level objective of this research is to explore potential policies that promote a modal shift towards decarbonisation of freight transportation in Brazil. Policies include fiscal and regulatory measures, vehicle technology innovation, in addition to the infrastructural investments made in highways, railways and waterways. We investigated impacts on modal split, demand per mode and CO2 emission. The findings show that the process of modal shift is slow, which is in line with what observed in practice. However, implementing a combination of stricter policy measures early on and changes in investments strategies accelerate the process and create robust measures capable of promoting modal shift and decarbonising the system under different scenarios. Experiments highlighted how the system tends to adjust to the measures and how they tend to lose efficiency over time, slowing the decarbonisation's rhythm. Moreover, findings also display how modal shift policies alone might not be sufficient to achieve the reduction in CO2 emission desired by policy-makers. Addressing the problem with this approach helps decision-makers to develop more efficient policies strategies. The research sheds light on modal shift dynamics over the next 30 years in Brazil and whether a System Dynamics approach can assist in the policy-making decision for modal shift towards decarbonisation of freight transportation.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

The Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) is investigating additive manufacturing of solid propellants. As part of this investigation, TNO developed a new polymer binder mix for solid propellants. The thermomechanical behavior of the solid propellants is not well understood yet. Therefore, TNO is interested in developing computational modelling schemes for characterizing their behavior. Computational schemes based on the finite element method (FEM) are developed in this thesis. They are calibrated with matrix-only and solid propellant uniaxial tension experiments provided by TNO. The developed schemes are compared with the experiments to better understand the materials behavior and improve the computational models.<br/><br/>The macro-structural behavior of solid propellants is significantly affected by the behavior of the micro-structure. It is computationally unfeasible to directly consider the micro-structure in macro-structural FEM. Therefore, computational homogenization (CH) is employed for idealizing the micro-structure with representative volume elements (RVEs) at a finite number of macroscopic locations. Micro-structural behavior consists of numerous nonlinear thermomechanical processes. This thesis focuses in characterizing micro-structural matrix viscoelasticity, continuum matrix damage, and debonding. The brittle and rate dependent behavior of the matrix and the solid propellants is described with these thermomechanical processes. Other relevant processes such as temperature effects, nonlinear elasticity, anisotropy, and large strains are not considered.<br/><br/>The experiments exhibit a clear rate dependence throughout the entire loading process, and viscoelasticity is hypothesized to play a major role in this dependence. The experimental samples experience a brittle failure that is believed to be caused by matrix micro-crack damage. Particle debonding is observed in the failure planes of the solid propellants and is hypothesized to significantly affect their behavior. <br/><br/>Matrix-only and solid propellant computational results confirm that viscoelasticity is a major source of rate dependence and that (continuum) matrix micro-crack damage causes brittle failure. They also suggest that continuum matrix damage is a significant source of rate dependence in the post-damage regime, and matrix-only experiments agree. Comparing the results for perfectly bonded solid propellants to the results for solid propellants with debonding and to the solid propellant experiments, it is clear that debonding indeed has a large effect in reducing the ultimate strength of the material. The full CH damage-debonding-viscoelastic scheme shows promise as a first step towards full characterization. Future work can improve the scheme by addressing the issue of free surface propagation and can build on it by including relevant thermomechanical processes that are not yet implemented. Recommendations on how to achieve this are given in the final chapter.<br","multiscale modeling; Computational Mechanics; Viscoelasticity; Damage Mechanics; Cohesive Zone Modeling; Homogenization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","MSc Thesis",""

The climate crisis is being paid more attention owing to its notable effects on the environment globally. For the sake of facing the challenge, the European Union (EU) has developed different strategies. One of which is the “2030 Climate Target Plan” published by the European Commission in Brussel in September 2020. It attempts to achieve a greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) reduction target by at least 55% by 2030. Based on the plan, a list of ideas and definitions centered around integrated energy systems has been proposed. To assess energy system integration strategy in a Dutch context, a generic model of the energy system is necessary. To this end, a detailed representative Dutch electricity distribution network model integrating renewable energy and the heat distribution network model are developed. The simulation of this integrated energy system model is computationally expensive due to the inter-dependencies between various energy sectors, dynamic operation of components within individual energy domain, etc. To overcome the computational burden of detailed models, different machine/deep learning-based surrogate models are established for the electrical network and heating network of the energy system, respectively. They include linear regression model, linear regression with chain model, linear support vector with chain model, decision tree model, random forest model, k-nearest neighbour model, multilayer perceptron model as well as long short-term memory model. Their performances are compared by speed-up factor (SUF) and root mean square error (RMSE), and the best model is selected. The results show linear regression model and long short-term memory model have the best performances in the respective electrical network and heating network of the established energy system.","Surrogate Modeling; Multi-carrier Energy System; Renewable Energy; Machine Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-05-26","","","","Electrical Engineering | Electrical Power Engineering","",""

Previously, a new design principle called closed form pressure balancing was introduced, which uses an incompressible fluid as the main compliant element in the joint. Although it showed great potential in terms of stiffness performance, theoretically not much is known about this design principle. This thesis analyses the fundamental working principle of closed form pressure balancing and introduces a design model to analyse the characteristic behaviour and to provide a practical design tool. This design model has been validated with a finite element method model, which shows a quantitative agreement. Additionally, a solution for the limited shear stiffness characteristic for pressure balanced joints is proposed. The potential of this solution is shown with the use of a case study on the design of compliant piston-slipper mechanisms, for which a prototype has been designed, built and tested.","Closed form pressure balancing; Compliant Joint; Rotational hinge; Piston-slipper mechanism; Compressive stiffness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-05-26","","","","","",""

Therefore, ideal electrodes should have a small size and the ability to record and stimulate at a single cell resolution with low noise. Materials used for fabrication should be flexible and stable for a long period in the biological media. However, conventional recording and stimulation techniques do not have sufficient spatiotemporal resolution for neuroscience research. Combining electrical and optical modalities into one device helps overcome the resolution limits and record more detailed information. For this application, transparent conductive materials are needed. Graphene is a potential solution due to its advantageous combination of properties, such as high conductivity, transparency, and flexibility. However, important characteristics of recording and stimulation electrodes, such as the impedance and charge injection capacity of graphene electrodes, do not reach the levels of conventional materials. The electrical characteristics of graphene could be improved further with surface modification, chemical doping, or stacking. Each method has been shown to improve the conductivity of graphene, although some affect the transparency of the layer. In this work, three methods were used to improve the electrical characteristics of multilayer graphene neural electrode without losing transparency or flexibility. These methods include growing a thicker layer of graphene, adding metal nanoparticles to the surface of the electrode, and nitric acid doping of graphene. For that purpose, graphene electrodes were fabricated on a silicon wafer. The electrical characteristics of these electrodes were assessed with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and 4-point probe measurements. Furthermore, the optical transmittance was measured. The improvement methods were then tested on these electrodes, and the performance was evaluated. Adding metal nanoparticles to the surface of the electrode showed the most promising results. With gold nanoparticles, the impedance at 1 kHz was lowered 82%, and charge storage capacity increased 529%. However, at the same time, 30% of the optical transmittance was lost. With lower nanoparticle density, 6% of transmittance was lost, and 7% of impedance gained. Nitric acid doping did not improve the impedance, but the charge storage capacity was increased up to 66%. Thicker layers of graphene displayed a lower sheet resistance. However, impedance or charge storage capacity were not improved.","graphene; electrode; characterization; nanoparticles; nitric acid doping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-05-26","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

It is one of many widely used unit operations for the separation and purification of chemicals industrially. Despite its far-reaching application in fine chemicals and active pharmaceutical ingredients production, the stochastic nature of nucleation makes it difficult to obtain crystals with reproducible properties like size, structure, purity, and polymorphic form. The accidental discovery of Non-Photochemical Laser-Induced Nucleation (NPLIN) in 1996 emerged as a novel technique to tame the crystallization process. Since the laser provided better spatiotemporal control over crystal properties in a solution, NPLIN gained abundant traction over the past decades in the vial and microfluidic scaled experiments. <br/>On the contrary, this research studies the NPLIN effect in potassium chloride (KCl) solution on a liter scale. A batch cooling crystallizer coupled with an irradiation source in the form of the laser beam is investigated here as proof of the concept study. NPLIN experiments were conducted in batch crystallizer and were compared with the control experiments. Interestingly, the laser source reduced the induction time of nucleation compared to control experiments. This phenomenon showed that nucleation kinetics can be controlled using laser properties. Furthermore, it was observed experimentally that the nuclei generated by laser in an undersaturated solution can be grown to a detectable size provided the supersaturation is increased. It was also observed that the crystal number density was more with the multiple pulses as compared to a single pulse owing to the large exposed volume by irradiation of multiple pulses in agitated bulk solution. Finally, the offline particle size distribution (PSD) comparison was done. The dominant size of crystals was 100-200 microns for the control experiment whereas, it was 300-500 microns for the NPLIN experiment. It revealed a clear shift in the peak of the dominant size of crystals indicating a growth dominant event in NPLIN experiments. Appealingly, the nature of PSD generated by laser irradiation was found similar in all repetitions. It is hypothesized that the laser generates the seeds which grow in the metastable region. <br/>This research study provides the basis for the NPLIN study in the system resembling industrial conditions. This, in turn, will aid in the understanding of the nucleation process and, ultimately, the optimization of industrial crystallization. The results obtained can also be used to develop mathematical models for particle size distribution.","crystallization; batch cooling; NPLIN","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-05-31","","","","Chemical Engineering","",""

This 2.5 kN class engine is propelled by the storable propellants 90% hydrogen peroxide and kerosene and used in the application of a (sub)orbital spaceplane. In this study, a preliminary design for the thrust chamber of the AM engine is proposed, which is realized from the superalloy Inconel 718. To avoid the chamber wall from melting under the extreme thermal loads which originate from the ongoing combustion reaction, both regenerative cooling and film cooling with hydrogen peroxide are considered. The proposed designs are based on a custom-developed 2-D numerical analysis code, which considers non-linear steady-state heat transfer and linear elastic structural deformation. The results of this code are validated against hot-fire tests of both regenerative cooled and film cooled thrust chambers, propelled by 90% hydrogen peroxide and kerosene. Moreover, an immersion screening test campaign is conducted to validate the chemical compatibility of AM Inconel 718 with 90% hydrogen peroxide. This thesis compares the proposed AM chamber designs to the current bimetallic chamber design that is already developed and hot-fired by Dawn Aerospace. The bimetallic design comprises a coated copper-alloy liner and relies mostly on non-AM production techniques. The coating is introduced to improve the chemical compatibility with hydrogen peroxide. Simulations show that the total available delta-v of the spaceplane is reduced from 3.46 km/s to 3.38 km/s when the bimetallic design is replaced by an AM Inconel 718 design, relying on regenerative cooling and film cooling. On the contrary, the AM design may offer a thrust chamber dry mass reduction of more than 75%, whereas the total number of sealing interfaces can be reduced by more than 50%. In addition, the inspection-heavy coating, which is plated onto the copper alloy liner of the current bimetallic engine design, can be removed in the AM design.","Liquid rocket engine; Additive manufacturing; Regenerative cooling; Film cooling; Hydrogen peroxide; Spaceplane; Space Engineering; Space","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-05-26","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The axial compression experienced during launch can consequently be a sizing load case, so it is important to understand the axial buckling behavior of these shells. Experimental testing is an essential part of studying this phenomenon because manufacturing imperfections can cause large discrepancies between theory and reality. In addition, conical shells have been researched less frequently than cylindrical shells, such that their behavior is less well understood. Experimental testing of launch vehicle structures is difficult and expensive due to their large size, hence it is preferred to test reduced-scale shells, representative of the full-scale ones. In this thesis, a scaling methodology is developed which allows designing representative reduced-scale conical shells for full-scale composite conical shells buckling in axial compression. The conical shells are assumed to have a symmetric, balanced layup with negligible flexural anisotropy. The scaling methodology is developed using the nondimensional governing equations, obtained through Nemeth's procedure, which allows to directly use the coefficients of the equations as scaling parameters. It also provides a framework to not only compare the buckling load of the shells of different sizes, but also the displacement upon buckling, the deformation shape, and the radial displacement. The methodology is set up such that the reduced-scale design parameters are determined sequentially. The buckling behavior of the two shells is compared using a semi-analytical approach, linear eigenvalue, and implicit dynamic finite element analyses. The eigenmode imperfection sensitivity is also evaluated. The methodology is successfully applied to isotropic, cross-ply, quasi-isotropic, and sandwich conical shells. The prediction accuracy is mainly affected by not being able to simultaneously satisfy all scaling parameters, by non-negligible flexural anisotropy and transverse shear, and by differences in imperfection sensitivity between the full-scale and reduced-scale shells. In any case, accurate results are obtained for the considered shells. The radial displacement is most difficult to predict, which is attributed to the membrane prebuckling assumption and neglecting the presence of imperfections. Finally, it is observed that larger eigenmode imperfections affect the accuracy, but they do not cause the methodology to fail. For future work, it is recommended to validate the methodology through experimental testing.","Scaling methodology; Conical shells; Buckling; Axial compression; Composite; Nondimensional","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Structures and Materials","",""

Following the success of electrification in the automotive industry, the potential of hybrid electric propulsion (HEP) has been the subject of many scientific projects. The energy and power of the electric systems that support the aircraft propulsion system are typically applied during the energy-intensive take-off and climb phases of the flight. This results in a considerable mass penalty for the remainder of the mission. An all-electric unmanned aerial vehicle, which decouples from the main aircraft at the cruise altitude and returns the electric propulsive system to the departure airport, could thus allow to limit the environmental footprint of a particular flight. The present study has quantified the potential fuel, energy and emission reductions of an Airbus A320neo assisted by such an auxiliary aircraft. This potential is also compared to a parallel-hybrid A320neo entering into service in 2035. The required modelling and mission evaluations have been performed with the MATLAB-based integrated simulation framework ‘Mission, Aircraft and System Simulation’ (MASS). The mission, aircraft and engine models of this tool, developed at the Royal Netherlands Aerospace Centre (NLR) throughout multiple HEP studies, have been modified. Besides, constraints for engine temperatures and shaft speeds have been applied. For the 3,500 nautical miles (6,482 kilometres) design mission, fuel and energy reductions of about four and two and a half per cent are found respectively. For the 850 nautical miles (1,574.2 kilometres) standard mission, a fuel reduction of about five per cent can be achieved. The overall energy demand increases slightly in comparison with the reference Airbus A320neo. No feasible parallel hybrid-electric design point was identified for these two mission profiles. In order to account for the uncertainty inherent to a preliminary design stage, the impact of multiple model parameter variations is assessed in a design study. In the vast majority of the investigated scenarios, single digit fuel and emissions savings can still be realised with this innovative aircraft architecture. A more detailed aerodynamic analysis and further refinement of the propulsive system model are recommended subjects for subsequent research.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Shallow clouds over the global oceans show different spatial patterns and organizations that may be influenced by climate change. Besides, the frequency of these patterns can change the climate feedback of marine clouds in the subtropics. Experts in atmospheric sciences have proposed different kinds of organization metrics. In a recent paper (Janssens et al., 2021), 21 cloud organization metrics were collected and computed over 5000 satellite scenes of shallow clouds located near the east of Barbados. Almost all of the existing metrics of cloud organization are bulk parameters of the cloud field. Accordingly, over the same data as Janssens et al. (2021), this project aims to define a metric that originated from the mutual arrangements of the individual clouds in the field. To this end, network theory as a mathematical tool is employed to define new cloud organization metrics to explore how cloud objects interact with and coordinate concerning each other. It should be noted that this research is the first in which cumulus cloud fields are considered as complex spatial networks. In this regard, an important question is whether a new network metric can distinctly explain a variability which has not been captured by previously defined metrics in cloud organization. To address the research question, we utilize a multivariate regression model to understand whether a linear combination of principal components of the existing metrics can encapsulate a variation in newly proposed network metrics. We found that degree standard deviation and mean of clustering coefficient are two network metrics that can distinctly capture a variability that has not been encapsulated by the existing metrics in cumulus cloud organizations. Degree standard deviation simultaneously measures the homogeneity of the cloud size distribution and the distance between nearest neighboring clouds distribution. A large value of the average clustering coefficient indicates that the network field consists of either large clouds located on corners of triangles or relatively small clouds closely coagulated. Additionally, two sensitivity analyses were performed to understand how the main results are influenced by either center-spacing or edge-spacing distance between clouds and the nodes (clouds) located close to the boundaries of the field. Finally, one should note that all of the results of network theory-based approaches are comprehensively affected by how the network is defined. Defining a network that combines both geometric and physical interaction between cloud objects will be the future work of this research.","Shallow Clouds; Cloud Organization; Network Theory; Complex Networks; Clustering Coefficient; Cumulus Clouds","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","Geoscience and Remote Sensing",""

They are able to render two­ and three­dimensional images of the body without exposure to harmful radiation. MRI systems are, however, costly to build and maintain. This adversely impacts access to these scanners in developing regions. In an effort to combat this problem, a low­field MRI scanner is being developed. Conventional MRI scanners utilize a superconducting solenoid to generate the main magnetic field. The low­field scanner, on the other hand, induces the main magnetic field through a Hallbach array of permanent neodymium magnets. While beneficial for production and maintenance costs, as well as portability, the Hallbach array is not able to generate a perfectly homogeneous magnetic field. The inhomogeneities present in the main magnetic field result in distortion of the images when reconstructed using conventional fast Fourier transform (FFT) methods. To counteract this, a reconstruction method that utilizes field information needs to be employed. In this thesis, existing methods to determine and utilize the field information to correct image distortion are explored. From this analysis, it is evident that model­based (MB) methods are most suitable for reconstruction of data from the low­field scanner. Current MB methods are only implemented for two­dimensional reconstruction. The goal of this thesis is to expand these methods to three­dimensional reconstruction. A novel MB method for three­dimensional reconstruction is presented. This new method is able to circumvent memory constraints that arise from reconstruction of large data sets. Though the new method requires several hours to reconstruct a 128 × 128 × 30 data set, visual inspection indicates that an accurate result is achieved.","MRI; Low-Field; Inhomogeneities; Image; Correction; Model-Based; 3D; Reconstruction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","Low-Field MRI",""

To calculate these parameters, accurate determination of gait events (i. e. initial contact (IC) and foot off (FO)) is essential. Previous research on the performance of kinematic gait event detection algorithms on different walking patterns led to recommendations, which have not been verified on clinical populations.  Research questions: 1) Which current kinematic approach is best capable of determining IC and FO for diverse gait patterns? 2) Does the use of automated kinematic algorithms affect clinical interpretation of STP compared to current clinical event detection (force-plate, visual identification)? <b>Methods:</b> 3D kinematic and kinetic data was retrospectively collected from 90 children with CP. Participants were classified in 3 categories – groups A (fore-foot IC), B (flat foot IC) and C (heel IC). Five kinematic algorithms (one modified) were implemented for two different foot marker configurations for both IC and FO and compared with clinical (visual and force-plate) identification using Bland-Altman analysis. The best-performing algorithm-marker configuration was used to compute STP, which were compared with those obtained clinically. <b>Results:</b> In agreement with previous studies, sagittal velocity of the heel (Group C) or toe markers (Group A and B) was the most reliable indicator of IC, and the speed-dependent sagittal velocity coupled with the hallux marker worked best for FO across the entire dataset. A comparison of kinematic and clinical showed &gt;1.78% differences in spatial parameters, and &gt;6.3% differences in temporal parameters. <b>Significance</b>: Outcomes showed that the choice of the best-performing algorithm was dependent on a combination of algorithm and marker choice. However, observing the high differences between clinical and kinematically calculated spatio-temporal parameters, clinicians need to be aware that the differences could likely affect clinical interpretation of gait analysis results.

They can be used to increase the amount of participants in research studies or to assist in rehabilitation. The main goal of this master thesis is to design a functioning prosthesis simulator, which can be used with commonly used terminal devices. A second goal is that the design needs to be accessible for multiple research groups and rehabilitation centers. The last goal is that the design needs to solve the problems that currently exist with prosthesis simulators: sub-optimal position of terminal device and lack of restriction of degrees of freedom of intact arm. Methods: The design requirements were based on the goals and a function analysis which included the state of the art of prosthesis simulators. Based on these design requirements the final design of The Delft Pro Simulator was developed. The design method that was used was a combination of the basic design cycle and the Fishtrap model. Results: The Delft Pro Simulator is a novel 3D-printable design that is accessible for multiple users. The design consists of only 14 parts and weighs 356 grams. The design is minimal-assembly and the material cost is low. The simulator is able to constrain pro- and supination of the intact arm. It can be worn on the left or the right arm. The socket can be used with all terminal devices with the American standard bolt (1/2""-20) and the European standard bolt (M12x1.5). A user tested the functional performance of the design with two standardized tests, the Box and Blocks Test and the Nine Hole Peg Test. Discussion and conclusion: This report presents a novel prosthesis simulator design. The goals have all been achieved. The design can be used with all commonly used terminal devices. Use with a myoelectric device has not been tested, but should be possible with minor adaptations. Most parts of the simulator can be 3D-printed except for some parts which are very accessible. The design can be used with two possible orientations of the terminal device with respect to the intact hand (dorsal and palmar). The simulator is able to accurately simulate transradial limb absence by constraining pro- and supination of the intact arm, while leaving flexion and extension free.</b","Prosthesis simulator; Design; Upper limb; Transradial amputation; 3D-printer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-05-25","","","","","",""

Biopsies are performed from suspicious tissue spots during the colonoscopic procedure to find cancerous polyps in an early stage of the disease. However, taking multiple biopsies is rather time-consuming and requires many repetitious actions from the gastroenterologist. The current state of the art instruments either do not solve this issue or do not meet the user requirements. The goal of this study was, therefore, to design a new endoscopic instrument to store multiple biopsies during a colonoscopy. Methods: The input from different gastroenterologists, together with risk analyses, has resulted in the lists of requirements for the device. These requirements have defined the design space for the development of the instrument. The tip functionalities were subdivided into five design challenges: integrate, transport, remove, store and secure. The solutions for these challenges were combined to generate concept directions. Within these directions, concepts have been created and analysed, which resulted in the final design, 'the Biopsy Containuer'. Different prototypes have been made from this design to evaluate the functionalities of the instrument and receive the opinion of potential users. Results: The evaluation showed that the developed prototype is able to remove a biopsy from the biopsy forceps and store five biopsies without loss or change of order inside the container of the instrument. Besides, potential failure movements were investigated, and they did not result in breakage or malfunctions. The participating gastroenterologists in the user assessment were, in general, pleasantly surprised about the potential of this instrument. Performing six biopsies using the Biopsy Containuer results in a time reduction of 44 %. Discussion and conclusion: When taking the learning effect found during the user assessment analysis into account, the time to perform six biopsies is reduced by 57 %. More research is required to evaluate the influence of bowel tissue on the instrument functionalities and the most suitable handle design. The next prototype iteration can include the use of one single polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tube and laser cutting to create the tip structures. The Biopsy Containuer is able to store multiple biopsies during a colonoscopy, and the potential purpose in endoscopic procedures besides colonoscopy could be useful.","Colonoscopy; Endoscopic instrument; Biopsy; Medical device design; CRC; Gastroenterology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-05-25","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

The task at hand is to determine the most cost-effective infrastructure, consisting of spare batteries, and battery chargers for electric aircraft, and spare hydrogen canisters and fueling points for hydrogen aircraft. Previously developed models are expanded upon in this study by introducing the possibility of slot allocation, where flights that are not yet in possession of landing and take-off rights are assigned to them in such a way that requires the smallest extra infrastructure to be acquired. We derive several (mixed) integer linear programming formulations to solve this problem and develop heuristics which are able to approximate the optimal solution using only open-source resources. These are expanded upon by the introduction of instances where more than one battery type is allowed, electricity pricing becomes dependent on the time-of-use, and storage of electricity at the airport is allowed such that the peak demand can be as low as possible. Finally, we incorporate a distinction between the long-, medium-, and short-term decisions which have to be made by the airport operator into the model analysis. This allows the user to determine the most cost-effective infrastructure combination which can meet a required level of service. When testing these methods, we found that exact solutions can be found within reasonable time for cases with up to 200 batteries. Furthermore, a first-in-first-out policy heuristic has shown to be capable of generating promising results while being applicable to larger instances. The models have been illustrated in a case study at the airports Schiphol (Amsterdam) and Zestienhoven (Rotterdam - The Hague), where they have proven to be able to solve all daily instances to optimality.","Electric aircraft; Hydrogen Aircraft; airport operation optimization; Slot Allocation; Battery swaps; Timetabling; mathematical optimisation; Airport; Operations Research","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, it is crucial to adapt project management to cope with the emerging complexity. Flexibility options are explored to deal with the increasing complexity. To grasp complexity, a selection of the Technical, Organisational and External framework was used. Eleven flexibility enablers are studied to operationalise them and make them applicable for project managers. In this explanatory research, a case study has been done to explain the possibilities for flexibility enablers to cope with the found complexities. The results of the individual case study and the cross-case study provided input for a proposal on how flexibility enablers facilitate the management of project complexity. A selection of related complexity elements and flexibility enablers have been used to develop a flexible project management tool. The tool provides insights into the selected complexities, creates awareness on flexibility perspectives from the project team, allows to choose the operationalised flexibility enablers, and reflects on the changes made to keep improving. The tool is meant to be used throughout the project and supports incorporating flexibility to be a dynamic process. Concluding, the awareness of complexity and flexibility helps to cope with complex infrastructure projects. The developed tool for project management will help apply specific flexibility enablers to cope with relevant complexity elements. Future research into other construction organisations is needed to generalise the findings of the operationalisation of the selected flexibility enablers.

(mentor); Leeuwenburgh, O. (mentor); Donselaar, Rick (mentor); Joosten, Gerard (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The Netherlands has set the ambitious goal to be CO2 neutral by 2050 and signed the Paris Treaty in 2015. The contribution of geothermal energy to reaching this goal are outlined in the Masterplan in 2018 which attempts to reduce CO2 emissions. It is imperative to enhance geothermal participation in renewable energy resources, so this thesis proposes a consideration of large scale geothermal field development in order to meet these requirements. For these large scale projects, large scale geological heterogeneities must be taken into account in order to propose a development strategy that honours subsurface variability in properties like porosity or permeability of an aquifer. Furthermore, the nature of the large scale operations, inherently requires the consideration and application of well patterns typically used in oil and gas developments. Operating in these extensive domains, carries a lot of uncertainty in the final economical output of the project, so modelling the process could indicate the optimal conditions that would deliver the best possible operational outcome. Conceptual 2D model approaches were adopted to demonstrate the main ideas behind large-scale geothermal well pattern optimisation. The main objective of this project is to model, evaluate and optimise the performance of large scale geothermal field development. The proposed strategy is based on the use of well patterns as are frequently used in the oil industry. The heterogeneity in geological properties that may be expected to be encountered at larger spatial scales is addressed by the concept of a flexible well density function. This density function allows the well patterns to be resized (or ultimately, reshaped) and adapt to spatial variations in geological characteristics. The flexible well pattern is fed to an objective function created with embedded simulator. The output of the function is the net present value (NPV) of the project. Four test cases are created, starting with a homogeneous static model and building up more heterogeneous aquifer models, aiming to test the performance of the flexible well density function. The aquifer property models are representative of the West Netherlands Basin and specifically the Delft Sandstone Member. Per each aquifer model, line drive and 5-spot development strategies are assessed. Each development scenario is modeled in an objective function and optimised. The optimisation algorithm chosen is the Simplicial Homology Global Optimisation, suitable for black-box functions that show multiple local optimum solution and among them, a global optimum pattern size is found. The NPV of each project realisation is calculated based on the energy recovered and an economic model under Dutch fiscal conditions. The results suggest that, the flexible well placement is successfully aligning with the different aquifer geological properties. Pattern size is inversely correlated to porosity which corresponds to higher volume of pore fluid from which heat can be recovered. The optimisation algorithm managed to identify the global optimum solution of pattern size that delivers the highest possible positive NPV. The most efficient in terms of profitable strategy, is suggested to be the 5-spot pattern. The optimal pattern size ranges between 500 - 2160m depending on the aquifer model. The sweep efficiency, in terms of energy recovery, is also assessed per aquifer model and development strategy. The most efficient is the 5-spot pattern. The performance of the adopted optimisation algorithm, on the fully homogeneous aquifer, is tested with an exhaustive response curve of NPV. It is confirmed that the algorithm manages to identify the global optimum. The character of the NPV as a function of well pattern size/density proved the complexity of the system with respect to the amount and well types introduced. Different sensitivity analyses in the context of the uncertainty of the aquifer thickness, thermal conductivity, thermal heat capacity and full economic model are conducted in order to show the impact on the optimal patter size. The performance of the optimisation algorithm is assessed as well, indicating that further investigation on the tuning meta-parameters could potentially lead to better global optimum solutions in more heterogeneous aquifer models.","Flexible Well Pattern; Global Optimisation; Large Scale Geothermal Development; Objective Function; Well Density Function","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Petroleum Engineering and Geo-sciences","",""

Most modern IDEs offer a number of automated refactorings as editor services. The Rename refactoring is the most-commonly applied refactoring and is used to change the identifier of a program entity such as a variable, a function, or a type. Correctly implementing refactorings is notoriously complex and these state-of-the-art implementations are known to be faulty and too restrictive. When developing a new programming language, it is both difficult and time-consuming to implement sound and complete automated refactoring transformations. Language-parametric definitions of refactorings that can be reused by instantiation with the syntax and semantics of a language, allow the development effort of refactorings to be amortized across language implementations. In this thesis, we developed a language-parametric Rename refactoring algorithm that works on an abstract model of a program's name binding structure. We implemented the algorithm in the Spoofax language workbench, building on the language-parametric representation of name binding with scope graphs and using generic traversals in the Stratego transformation language. We evaluated the algorithm with five different languages implemented in Spoofax, which uses both NaBL2 and Statix to declare their static semantics and name binding rules. As a result, Spoofax now provides an automated Rename refactoring that works for any language developed with the language workbench using NaBL2/Statix.","refactoring; renaming; spoofax; statix; stratego; language-parametric","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

The properties of those powders (e.g. density or particle size) after spray drying operations depend severely on the dynamics of droplet collisions inside the spray. Currently, costly and wasteful production­trials are used in the spray drying industry. The use of computer models can potentially reduce those costs significantly. However, present­day models lack a complete physical foundation to supersede these trial­and­error tests. This study aims to further develop implementation of the relevant physical processes in these models by incorporating the combined effect of rheology and surface tension. In this thesis, we quantify the effect of Particle Interaction Forces (PIF) on the surface tension and investigate the possibility to further calibrate the PIF induced surface tension to match the desired surface tension. Important here is that we do not change the PIF induced rheology. We make use of the numerical method Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and use the Continuum Surface Force (CSF) method to further tune the surface tension. We demonstrate the tuning properties of CSF in a static and a dynamic setting. Because the constitutive equation of the PIF induced rheology is unknown, we are limited in the possible dynamic tests in which we assess the relation between the rheology and surface tension. The dynamic tests that we could perform in this thesis are characterized by the surface tension being dominant with respect to the viscosity and elasticity of the droplet. In the static case, we found that we can estimate the magnitude of the PIF induced surface tension and increase the surface tension with CSF to the desired value. Furthermore, for the static case, when both CSF and PIF are used, the total surface tension is simply the sum of the separate forces, i.e. CSF and PIF are decoupled forces. Additionally, preliminary results suggest that we can also lower the PIF induced surface tension to a certain extent, by adding CSF with a negative coefficient. However, the dynamic test results are not straightforwardly interpreted, probably due to not satisfying the assumption that the surface tension is the dominant contribution. Therefore, these tests are inconclusive and thus require further research.","Smooothed particle hydrodynamics; Surface tension; Rheology; Oscillations; Particle Interaction Forces; Multiphase","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

Additionally, realisations of stochastic processes are elements of the path space which is infinite-dimensional and non-locally compact. Given these observations, we find that model selection methods from classical statistics, such as distribution metrics, are inadequate. <br/>In this thesis a signature-based model recognition method is proposed. The goal of this model is to select the most suitable stochastic process to describe an observed financial time series. Signatures are transformations from a path to an infinite-length sequence of properties of that path, which makes signatures a highly interesting approach to construct input features which can be used by a machine learning model. In our evaluation, we use the aforementioned methodology to distinguishing between various classification settings of Arithmetic Brownian Motion, Geometric Brownian Motion and the exponential jump diffusion process, both in a binary and multi-class classification setting. This evaluation shows that the proposed method can adequately distinguish between the same model with different parameters, models with and without jumps and models with different jump sizes and jump intensities.","signatures; finance; stochastic processes; model recognition; machine learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

In 2020, the European Commission presented their Offshore Renewable Energy Strategy which includes 300 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2050 (European Commission, 2020). This research focusses on the steel mass development of OWT structural support components like the tower, substructure and foundation considering a trend of higher power turbines and exploitation at increasing water depth. The research follows an initial design approach, to estimate initial dimensions of monopile and jacket support structures for 5 reference offshore wind turbines. For simplicity, initial dimensions are based on design rules-of-thumb hence no ultimate, serviceable or fatigue limit states are considered. Reference turbines of 5, 8, 10, 15 and 20 MW rated power are included in the model, as these can be expected to be commercially available up to 2050. A water depth range of 20-80 meters is taken into account. Considering available development zones and environmental conditions, the study focusses on the North Sea region. For monopiles, the location of the natural frequency is used as a design driver to determine the tower and monopile diameter and plate thickness. For jacket structures, member slenderness and constant bay geometry are used as design drivers to determine member length, diameter and plate thickness. Overall, jacket structures show to be less steel intensive than monopile support structures considering their upfront steel requirements and have a higher steel recovery potential at end-of-life. Considering the climate change potential of OWT support structures, GHG emissions that emerge during steelmaking and recycling are taken into account. A GHG emission indicator of 1.22 tCO2-eq/t steel is derived with the aim to reflect European steel production processes. GHG emissions that emerge during transport, manufacturing and assembly or during the making of other materials than steel are not assessed in this research. A GHG emission payback time indicator is developed to provide insight into how the GHG emissions invested in support structure steelmaking compare to the GHG emissions avoided through the generation of renewable electricity. It is found that, depending on the combination of turbine rated power and water depth, for monopiles the emission payback time lies in a range of 4-9 months. For jackets this is 2-10 months.<br/>In order to reduce the emission intensity of the offshore wind industry, this research recommends commissioners and designers to favour jacket over monopile support structures due to (i) reduced steel intensity for initial support structure manufacturing, and (ii) a higher recovery potential of support structure steel and its rare alloying elements at end-of-life. For 5 MW OWTs it is found that the application of jacket structures reduces an OWT’s total climate change potential with 15-20% compared to monopile structures. This research provides insight into to the contribution of bottom-founded support structures to the climate change potential of OWTs and shows that the combination of turbine rated power, water depth and support structure typology significantly influence the steel and GHG emission intensity of an offshore wind turbine.","Wind Turbine; Support structure; Steel construction; Offshore Wind; Climate change impact; Resource management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

The other is an adaptive LCA that provides personalized lane change reference trajectories through trial-by-trial adaptation to lane change duration of previously driven lane changes. The effects of these systems with respect to mental workload, lateral control performance and user acceptance are investigated. This is observed in an experiment with three different driving sessions for each participant. A manual driving session, a driving session in which the generalized LCA is active and a driving session in which the adaptive LCA is active. The experiments are conducted on a 6 DoF motion-based simulator with 34 participants, driving in a three-lane highway simulation environment with a scripted traffic scenario. To measure mental workload, an auditory cognitive secondary N-back task is introduced. The results show that the introduction of a generalized LCA or adaptive LCA does not have significant influence on mental workload compared to the manual driving session. When the adaptive LCA is introduced, lateral control performance is enhanced compared to the generalized LCA and manual driving.

A collision rate model is adapted to conflicts between flows of aircraft, and its validity is empirically confirmed. Conflicts are divided into between-flow conflicts and within-flow conflicts. Applicability to a terminal airspace without strictly adhered-to procedural routes is investigated by clustering logged mode S-surveillance data into flows using a self-tuning spectral clustering method. This clustering method can effectively partition flight tracks into clusters, but is sensitive to the stop conditions, and unclusterable flight tracks make up a small but significant proportion of conflicts. The predictions of the conflict rate model correlate with observed conflict rates in a replay simulation, but are initially biased towards underpredicting the conflict rates. Altering the timing, intensity and separation requirements for the replay greatly reduces this bias for converging flows, but leads to an overprediction of other conflict types, and altered replay results should be interpreted with care. Analytical predictions for between-flow conflicts can be made, but applicability to within-flow conflicts is limited due to the different types of interactions. The resulting conflict rate model explicitly defines the relation between separation requirements, relative velocities, and flow intensities.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-05-21","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This could eventually lead to scour holes in the bed, which may affect the structural integrity of the quay wall. This thesis is about a numerical simulation of a bowthruster jet which is deflected by a quay wall and the focus of this study will be on the resulting bottom velocities. In 2019, field measurements were executed with an inland vessel and the measured bottom velocities were low compared to the design guidelines. The goal of this study is to simulate the field measurements in a numerical model to gather more knowledge about the flow field induced by bowthrusters next to quay walls. The obtained numerical results are compared to the field measurement and to the design guidelines of PIANC. As it turns out, the velocity sensors probably did not measure the maximum bottom velocity during the field measurements, since they are located slightly above the highest velocities at the bottom, as predicted by the numerical simulations. The maximum bottom velocities from the numerical simulation are similar to the expected near-bed bottom velocities by PIANC. However, there is room for improvement in these design guidelines, e.g., adjusting the efflux velocity for tunnel thrusters to account for the variation in cross-sectional area between propeller and tunnel exit.","CFD; Propeller jet; Bow Thruster; Scour; Quay walls","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

The previous transport mechanism design had no mechanism to transfer tissue into the lumen to be transported. To create the grasper, the wire ropes were plastically deformed to bend outward, creating the open shape of the grasper. A sheath consisting of magnets, springs, and a shrink tube can be slid over the plastically deformed section, straightening the wire ropes. This closed the grasp to constrain tissue. Operation was done by four finger handles, two on the main device and two clamped on the slidable sheath with magnets. Springs were used to make the passively hold the grasper in closed position, making it voluntary opening. To maintain the shape of the grasper, wire ropes were soldered together at the grasper tip, constrained in the sliders of the transport mechanism and wire rope guides were placed to the side of the magnets. After constraining the tissue, transfer into the lumen was done by actuating the transport mechanism. Gelatin phantom tissue samples were used to test the functionality the of the grasper. Results show successful constraining of 3mm, 4mm, 5mm spheres as well as a cylinder of 4mm with a length of 6.5mm. The spherical samples were all successfully transferred into the transport mechanism. The cylindrical sample was successfully transferred when inserted in axial orientation, but three out of six samples failed when insertion was perpendicular to the transport mechanism. Tissue samples were successfully grasped from a surface in three different orientations and the grasper was tested with the transport mechanism in a bend to test if no original functionality was lost. This grasper allows for a step towards a new surgical instrument.","Grasper; Compliant; Mechanism; Transport; Friction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-05-20","","","","Mechanical Engineering","","52.000551, 4.371459"

In order to fight it, the strategy of urban densification is introduced and building upward extensions is one of the methods. However, investigating the feasibility of placing an extension on top requires a significant amount of time and effort from structural engineers. Therefore, this research aims to explore computational tools that would simplify the initial exploration process and make the option of extension more appealing. Theoretical background part of the thesis analyses conditions and limitations for building reuse, upward extension and use of timber. The main impediments that could prevent realisation of such project are found. The practical part of the research aims to explore parametric modelling and machine learning (ML) in order to produce a proof of concept ML tool which predicts how much an existing building can be extended based on its parameters. In order to have a sufficient amount of data, parametric modelling is used. For the first step, information is collected about seven realised upward extension projects in the Netherlands. This data defines the object for the parametric model which is built using Rhino plug-in Grasshopper. One part of the model analyses the existing structures with the goal to establish structural reserve while another part examines extensions. Six parameters defining existing buildings are chosen for iteration, by changing these parameters, a database of 8 652 fictional projects is generated. For the ML, the data is analysed and used for supervised learning where regression task is performed. Multiple linear regression (MLR) and nonlinear regression (NLR) algorithms are applied to make predictions which are validated using 5-fold cross validation (CV) and evaluated by calculating errors. Finally, the research presents a possibility and an example of using ML for extension exploration. The use of ML model during the initial stage of upward extension projects seems very appealing due to the quick feedback with limited information provided. A useful database of realised projects with a selection of structural parameters together with the incorporation of non-structural ones and a customised ML model should provide accurate predictions. However, the current problem of lack of data about realised extension projects needs to be solved.","building reuse; upward extension; timber; parametric modelling; machine learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

(mentor); Polyportis, A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","An essential step on the way to a circular economy is utilizing recycled materials for new products. Even though the use of recycled plastic has been increasing for the past decades, electronic products have been largely overlooked in this context. Currently, there are no design strategies on how to use recycled plastic in electronic products. Therefore, this master thesis aims at investigating consumers’ perception of recycled plastic, and based on the findings, create recommendations for designers on how to implement the material in their products. According to the aim, the following research question was developed: How can a designer stimulate a consumer to opt for an electronic device made from recycled plastic? In a first step, the available literature on sustainable behaviour, the factors influencing the behaviour-intention gap as well as existing findings on the overall perception of recycled plastic were reviewed. Additionally, consumers of Generation Z, who have been deemed to have strong, pre-existing environmental values, were determined as the focus group of this study. An analysis of e-products on the market provided information on how the share of recycled plastic is currently communicated. These different communication strategies were subsequently investigated through qualitative interviews. Seven participants were interviewed as to how different product aesthetics and communication strategies influence their perception of the product in question. Insights from these interviews yielded four clusters: aesthetics, trust, sustainability, and quality. Together with the findings from literature, these research outcomes provided 20 insights into the consumer perception of recycled plastic in electronic products, thus concluding the research phase of this project. The ideation phase commenced with brainstorming sessions on the detected insights. Eight design students participated and generated over 300 as to how the underlying research insights could be applied in practice. The majority regarded the product directly, but other ideas were related to a product’s “surrounding”, such as promotion of the product, its price or place of purchase. In an iterative process, these ideas were transformed into 10 product-related design recommendations and 8 additional, price-, place-, promotion-related recommendations. The total framework of insights generated throughout the research process can support designers in creating well-perceived e-products from recycled plastic. The three distinct types of information are relevant in different phases of the design process: • The 20 key insights may be seen as an enriching source of background information for designers, who are getting started on a project and are yet to build their knowledge on the overall topic. • The 10 recommendations provided may be used in the case, where a designer needs concrete tips and action points for developing a product’s design. • The 8 additional recommendations can be valuable when the design of a device is already finalized, yet it should still be enhanced in terms of consumer perception. To transfer this study’s research findings and make them readily available for product designers, a website was deemed to be most suitable means of presentation. This format allows for a structured displaying of the previously mentioned findings and recommendation categories.","recycled plastics; electronic products; Sustainability; Consumer behaviour; Recommendation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

One of the most imminent is the way we handle and take care of our planets natural resources. More people means more needs. How do are we going provide for all these people? Over the past decades, we have reached a general consensus that our planet is a closed system: what you take, is taken forever. In other words, limitless growth without treating earths resources accordingly, is a myth. Our current economic system in place does not coincide with this consensus. This economy encourages a linear, take-make-waste, approach which thrives on the depletion of earths resource supplies. Looking ahead, at the world of 10 billion people, its not hard to understand that the linear economy is no longer tenable. We need to make the transition towards the circular economy, an economic paradigm which respects the boundaries of our planet. The circular economy adopts a take-make-use-reuse approach, which aims to decouple economic growth from the consumption of finite resources. This circular paradigm came about several decades ago and sounds hopefull. Nevertheless, it has been far from being mainstream as the transition towards this circular paradigm is surrounded by barriers, challenges, and complexities. In other words, this transition is halted due to a so-called linear lock-in. This graduation project aims to circumvent this linear lock-in for the purpose of mainstreaming circular economy principles. It does this by adopting the Design Thinking methodology, thé design approach to tackle untenable social, environmental and political problems for which no unambiguous solutions can be found (Dorst, 2015). This project focusses on the consumer appliances segment, praised by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (2013) as the ‘sweet-spot’ segment for circularity, and the European Commission has made the sector an important point on their agenda, as its one of the fastest growing waste streams in the EU (EC, 2020). An iterative research and design approach led to a platform concept solution which delivers value to the consumers, product brands and integrates circular economy strategies. At the core of this opportunity is digital product-to-user registration. The design is communicated via manifesting its features and a service design blueprint. The thesis is concluded with a roadmap for implementation and recommendations for further development.","circular economy; circular business model; CBM; circular economy transition; linear economy; linear lock-in; design thinking; product registration; digital platform solution; twings","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(graduation committee); Jonkers, H.M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The climate is changing and industries world-wide need to transform to assure a liveable earth for future generations. Within the construction sector, this requires a different approach and perspective on the life-cycle of civil engineering assets since the construction industry and its build environment is the world’s largest consumer of raw materials and responsible for 25-40% of the CO2 emissions. To make the transit to a more sustainable system, an increasingly discussed approach is a shift from the current linear lifecycles to a circular orientated economy. This latter means the preservation of used materials rather than dispose. In this way, the lifecycle loop of the materials is closed and the energy demand and the scarcity of raw resources is reduced. This more circular way of constructing entails the integration of the assets’ end-of-life phase and its’ circular solutions into the design. The reuse of assets, flexibility and adaptability in its’ function, modular based structures and a material database are all possible ways in dealing with assets after their lifetime in a circular manner. The shift towards a circular economy provides the possibilities for reducing the use of primary materials, protection of material resources and reduce the carbon footprint. This enhances a more sustainable practise of the construction industry though asks for major changes in its current operation. Clients play a substantial part in the transition towards a circular construction industry due to their responsibility in the formulation of the scope, project ambitions and requirements in the initiation phase of a project. Rijkswaterstaat, the biggest public client in the Netherlands, has the ambition to tender all the projects climate neutral and circular together with enhancing the sustainable living environment by 2030 and be fully circular by 2050. Circular pilot projects and programs are developed to promote the use of circular principles in the initiation phase, although circularity is currently often seen as an additional feature instead of an integral design principle. This results in a late consideration of the aspect and therefore a low level of circularity. To enhance circularity in projects there is a need for a clear and integral design process that includes circularity and an increase in knowledge among all team members of a project on circularity and the possibilities for the design. The aim of this research is to unite the circularity principles with the design process of hydraulic infrastructure projects and enable circularity to become common practice and a way of thinking. This is accomplished with a framework for implementing circularity in the design process based on state-of-the-art literature and results in a flowchart that aims to guide a project team to consider circularity and its opportunities during the integral design process of an asset. The flowchart visualizes the important development steps needed for the implementation of circularity, together with a circular way of approaching de design of an asset that includes the circular design principles. Thereafter, the public clients’ current design process and practice on implementing circularity is researched in an empirical quantitative study. These findings are reflected against the approach based on literature and show the points of attention for the public client on implementing circularity in the design process. The flowchart is verified with a case study on the project Weir Grave concerning the reconditioning of a historical weir in the river Meuse in the province of North-Brabant. This case study showed that the flowchart is valuable for the implementation of circularity and includes the significant aspects to consider. Although, the flowchart is not yet an applicable chart for design teams due to the high amount of information, layout and English language. A workable version with instructions is realized to improve this. Various barriers accompany the implementation of circularity in the construction sector with the most substantial being the necessary integral character of the industry and design process along with the timing of including the aspect in this process. An integral design method benefits circularity because numerous aspects and lifecycle phases of an asset influence the level of circularity. The integral character also assist the required early consideration of circularity, which is now often considered too late in the design process. Currently, the circular guidelines for the public client are focused on their role as an acquisition party and not on their part in the design. Therefore the design steps for circular assets are not part of the clients’ procedure, although this procedure does influence the possibilities for circularity. Therefore, the public client needs to take circularity into account prior to the tender procedure, in the initiation- and design phase, as relevant decision that influence the possibilities for circularity are made in these phases. This also influences the collaboration with the market party and requires a clear and uniform ambition towards them. Additionally, support, knowledge and an organization wide approach on circularity are of significance when implementing circularity in the design process. This reduces the current risk avoidance culture on circular design and supports the decisions made. One of the most practical measures to enhance circularity in a project is the implementation of the aspect as a requirement from the start in the clients’ internal project assignment and in the tender towards the market to create a responsibility for considering the aspect.","Circular ambitions; Public Construction Projects; Circular Design Strategies; circular economy transition; Infrastructural assets; Infrastructural innovation; Rijkswaterstaat; design principles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

The fabrication of IBC silicon-based solar cells provided by poly-Si passivating contacts is investigated in this thesis. The passivating poly-Si contacts structure used in this work is based on an ultra-thin layer of t-SiOX with optimized poly-Si thicknesses of 250 nm and the implantation parameters of Phosphorous and Boron doping with 6e15 and 5e15 ions/cm2 respectively, at a fixed implantation energy of 20 keV. The influence of the post-implantation annealing conditions is discussed with experimental results, obtained on symmetrical test structures with thermal SiOx/doped poly-Si on each side. The bestobtained passivation result for n+ -poly-Si contact was 728 mV at annealing conditions of 1050°C for 1 minute, while for the p+ poly-Si contact at the same annealing conditions 699 mV is obtained. To enhance the passivation, PECVD deposited SiNX capping layer and annealing in forming gas as hydrogenation processes are carried out. Then, FBC solar cells are fabricated to evaluate the electrical performances, in terms of passivation and carrier transport, of the poly-Si contacts structures, which are prepared with different annealing conditions, in terms of temperature and time. The results obtained from the FBC cells show that increasing the annealing temperature leads to an increase in the passivation thus the VOC. The best-obtained VOC was 706mV for the wafer annealed at 1050°C for 1 minute. To enhance the optical properties of the IBC cells, the surface is textured and the influence of doping dose on passivation of the front surface field (FSF) is evaluated. Four different passivation stack layers SiNX, AlOX/SiNX, a-Si/SiNX, and double SiNy /SiNX are evaluated for FSF implanted with dose of 1e14 ions/cm2. The best-obtained passivation result is from FSF sample passivated with a-Si/SiNX. It shows excellent passivation property with iVOC of 714 mV and a J0 of 7.5 fA/cm2. while the other stacks show lower passivation of iVOC 708 mV for the AlOX/SiNX sample and iVoc=686 mV for the SiNy /SiNX sample. The influence of FGA on the FSF passivation quality is also evaluated. The results show that the sample passivated with a-Si/SiNX experienced a sharp decrease of 35 mV in the iVOC after FGA due to the low thermal stability of the a-Si:H. On the other hand, other FSF samples with passivation stacks of SiNX, AlOX/SiNX, and SiNX /SiNX show a positive influence upon the FGA on their passivation quality as a result of the extra hydrogen diffusion during the FGA which saturates more defects on the c-Si surface. The implantation of the optimized thermal SiOx/ doped poly-Si structure and FSF with a-Si/SiNX passivating layer into the IBC solar cells leads to high-efficiency IBC solar cells. The record cell has a conversion efficiency of 21.04% and 22.15% after the post metallization annealing, VOC of 681 mV, and FF of 78,9 with Jsc of 37.5 mA/cm2","Passivting contacts; IBC solar cell; poly-SiOx carrier selective contacts","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This main research question for this design project asks to what extent can FDM 3D printing be applied to assist Kenyan occupational therapists in the provision of therapy to individuals with hand dexterity and strength challenges. This self-initiated graduation project is being completed in collaboration with Kijenzi (www.kijenzi.com) - a design and manufacturing company based in Kenya. Kijenzi is using additive manufacturing technology to produce products locally using low-cost FDM 3D printers. Research into the context of occupational therapy, additive manufacturing, and the context of Kenya revealed the following key insights: Professionals in Kenya do not have access to suitable tools because of their high associated cost and the challenges involved in importing the products and distributing them into rural locations. Traditional hand exercisers can have drawbacks that hinder patient recoveries. 3D printing is a laborious process and partially digitizing the process could lower production costs. Occupational therapists require products in a large range of sizes and strengths to suit the individual needs of their patients. This could be achieved in a product customising system. The synthesis of the insights gained in the research activity created an envisioned scenario which involved a product/service/system scope. In this scenario, patients can exercise their hands safely in a purposeful way with a meaningful outcome. Healthcare professionals would be empowered to order customised products from the manufacturing company by means of an online product customiser. The manufacturer would then be able to produce these customised goods in a way that minimises the cost of doing so. A list of requirements, design drivers, and design challenges were prepared as support to design activity. The HandBand product, service, system (PSS) concept is a holistic structure which affords the provision of patient-specific hand therapy. Through the use of the 3D-printed therapy device, an online configurator, and a production system, the concept’s full design articulation is achieved in a low-cost and feasible manner. The three-part proposition aims to provide impact for key stakeholders in both the Kenyan healthcare picture and the Kijenzi context. Six levels of the European Space Agency’s Technology Readiness Level were followed to embody these design proposals. The ultimate validation in this involved a test of the 3D-printed product in a clinical setting in Kenya. The outcome of this evaluation for the product was clear and decisive: the occupational therapist confirmed that the HandBand had made a significant contribution to the recoveries of multiple patients. The hand exerciser was a marked improvement to the current equipment and tools available in the hospital. Conclusions were derived from the feedback in the final chapter. Finally, recommendations were prepared for the development of the design proposal in future.","3D Printing; Product Design; therapy; Frugal innovation; additive manufacturing; healthcare; LMI","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","","-0.091702, 34.767956"

Unfortunately, this often leads to thermoacoustic instabilities. These instabilities can lead to failure of system components, flame blow-off or flashback and a reduction in efficiency. Especially the high frequency transverse thermoacoustic instabilities can lead to big problems in the successful operation of gas turbines. These instabilities can be reduced by adding damping devices or mitigating the excitation mechanisms. In this work, Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is used to identify the thermoacoustic instability which tends to occur in a specific heavy duty gas turbine combustor design. In order to successfully counteract this instability, identification of the acoustic mode affecting the burner is required. Results from the LES are compared with experiments to test the predictability of LES and research mitigation techniques. The oscillation amplitudes do not match due to numerical damping, but the frequency of the oscillation in LES is within 1% of the experimental value. Furthermore, a coherence between the heat release and pressure oscillations of 80% is achieved and the phase of the oscillations are within 90° of each other. This confirms that the Rayleigh criteria is satisfied and the instability in the simulation is indeed a self-excited thermoacoustic instability. After identifying the mode, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the pressure data at the combustor walls is used to visualize and locate the mode. Its location suggests that fuel supply oscillations could be a possible driving mechanism. However, the frequency of the oscillations in the fuel supply did not match that of the thermoacoustic instability so this hypothesis was rejected. After identifying the mode, the effect of different simulation and operation parameters is researched. First a model coefficient which influences the flame length is changed. Shortening the flame results in a higher amplitude instability, due to the location of maximum heat release moving closer to the location of the source of the instability. Next, the fuel distribution is changed in order to break flame symmetry and reduce the instability amplitude. This is done successfully, as the amplitude of the instability at the peak frequency is reduced to the same level as the surrounding noise frequencies. Finally, the effect of adding Helmholtz resonators specifically designed for the instability of interest is researched. A transfer function is defined to measure the response of the resonators to a pressure fluctuation in front of them. The result is compared to an analytical solution to determine the effectiveness of the resonators. Like the fuel biasing, also the resonators performed well and resulted in a decrease of the instability amplitude.","CFD; LES; Gas Turbines; Combustion Instability; Thermo-acoustics; Lean Premixed Combustion; Fuel Staging; Helmholtz resonator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-05-21","","","","","",""

(mentor); Alderliesten, R.C. (graduation committee); Villegas, I.F. (graduation committee); Sinke, J. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The IsoTruss is an interesting continuous fibre reinforced polymer composite design which is closely related to open lattice composite structures, although it is currently aimed mostly at civil applications. While it currently lacks applicability to the aerospace sector, its production process is easier to automate (or change the shape input parameters on the fly) than open lattice structures, which rely on a fixed mandrel. Although automated compaction of these structures is a challenging problem, the structure can be optimised for any (static) load case if their production process could be automated, providing a range of applications where aerodynamic contour is not a requirement. To bridge the gap between the IsoTruss and other composite lattice structures, a conceptual design for an IsoTruss derivative, termed the ""iso-truss"", was envisioned. This raised the following research question: Can composite continuous fibre reinforced iso-truss structures be produced using a scalable and cost-effective automated manufacturing method? Through this thesis project, an affirmative answer to this question was sought. The focus of this thesis was on the investigation of all the aspects necessary for a production of this iso-truss structure, focusing on a process suited for later automation. Initial concepts using thermoset composites like the original IsoTruss could not solve the issue of automated compaction, as these would always rely on vacuum bagging to minimise the void content within the composite members. Automated vacuum bagging of the finished iso-truss structure was considered to be an infeasible solution due to the product's complexity. Through the use of thermoplastic composite materials however, the process steps could be split up and compaction could be moved to the very beginning of the process in the form of pultrusions. The shape of the resulting iso-truss was designed to make use of this process, providing a parameterised structure which could easily be optimised. The structure would make use of straight pultrusion rods, acting as the longitudinal members in the truss, and curved pultrusion rods, which would act as helical members. The iso-truss structure would be created by joining these members together at intersections by means of thermoplastic welding, forming a continuously produced open lattice tubular structure. With this, conceptual production of an iso-truss was based on three key steps: pultrusion, forming, and intersection welding. The pultrusion process was outsourced to an outside company, vDijk Pultrusion Products (DPP), due to its high required equipment cost. It was not the aim of this thesis to re-invent this process, as it has already reached a sufficient state of maturity. Nevertheless, the process has not yet been optimised for thermoplastic based composites, leaving room for improvement in this area. Materials for the concept were based on availability. Elium resin (a PMMA based thermoplastic polymer developed by Arkema) was chosen for its similarity to existing process materials and its direct availability from DPP. As reinforcement, a Toray T700SC type carbon fibre was used. By taking pultrusion out of the research scope, forming and welding were left as processes to demonstrate. A separate welding test was isolated to provide a way to perform standardisable tests. Simultaneously, a forming process demonstrator was designed, as well as a welding jig to demonstrate assembly of the iso-truss. For the execution of the welding and forming experiments, a single batch of material was ordered from DPP. The batch was the result of a first successful attempt to make rods of this diameter with this combination of materials. Upon arrival of the samples, several tests including SEM, TGA and DSC were performed to estimate important composite material parameters. From these tests, the fibre volume fraction could be estimated to be around 70%, while the onset of T_g was estimated to be 95degC by definition of maximum loss modulus. Additionally, several interesting phenomena were observed at elevated temperatures in the form of fibre kinking when bent and circumferential decompaction when twisted, indicative of a weak fibre-matrix interface. More indications of this limited fibre-matrix interface were obtained from SEM images, some of which showed small voids around fibres. DMA tests showed a steady decline of the material's (shear) stiffness over a large temperature range, including before the onset of glass transition. This could likely be attributed to the amorphous nature of the polymer. For the execution of joining experiments, a standard intersection layout was established, after which several joining techniques were considered to create these intersections. From these techniques, heated mould welding was selected as the best currently feasible option. After performing numerous experiments to fine-tune the method of heated mould welding, a standard setup could be designed around this technique. This setup addressed methods for heating, alignment of members to be welded, a compaction mechanism, physical test preparation and physical testing. Simultaneously, a detailed design of a helical winder demonstrator was made, which was prepared for production by DEMO. The design focused on the demonstration of the mechanical aspect, leaving heating as a secondary concern. Similarly, a more detailed concept of an assembly demonstrator was discussed and designed, although a production-ready design did not prove feasible within the time frame of this project. The main goal of the intersection welding experiments was to optimise the joint strength by optimising the processing conditions. Due to the limited resin volume content, PMMA foil and epoxy adhesive were used to locally increase resin volume, greatly improving the bond strength compared to initial samples. Using mould temperatures in between 180 to 200degC, a large degree of deformation could be achieved to maximise the joint area, creating mostly consistent intersection samples. Physical tests proved that the PMMA-based joints were very fragile, while epoxy based joints performed significantly better. Estimated shear strengths for the samples varied from 3MPa for some of the lower performing PMMA-based intersections which were believed to have sustained prior damage, to as high as 13MPa for the epoxy based intersections. For the buckling tests, maximum loads in between 2.1 to 3.2kN were observed. In the final buckling test setup, diagonal members did not increase the buckling load by forcing higher-mode buckling. Instead, they offered some support in post-buckling by resisting out-of-plane deformation. Failure modes in both shear and buckling tests were within the adherend, occurring as a combination of fibre break-out, member kinking and member splitting, more indications of a poor fibre-matrix interface. In summary, the experiments proved that the investigated welding method is feasible if the base material can be improved. As of writing, such improvements have already been reported by DPP through increased process stability and (likely) better fibre sizing. For the helical winding experiments, the main goal was to demonstrate the production process of heated forming of initially straight pultrusion samples into helices. The physical test setup was designed to offer continuous support of the members over their full length, realise a gradual increase in radius of curvature and allow torsional and axial forces to be introduced independently. For the resulting setup, heating of the central cylinder and introduction of heat through both contact and a heated air chamber proved most feasible within the time frame of this project. It did not prove feasible to produce carbon-Elium composite helices due to the current material limitations, that is the fibre kinking observed in previous tests. Instead, the process was demonstrated using pure PMMA rods at forming temperatures of around 90degC, which proved highly effective. The process showed the potential to create constant curvature helices with controllable helical angle, although more testing should be performed to achieve accurate and repeatable results. It is concluded that it is theoretically possible to produce continuous fibre reinforced iso-truss structures using a scalable and cost-effective automated manufacturing method. The process would rely on existing production capabilities which can easily be scaled up or down, without greatly affecting the cost of equipment. The pultrusion, helical shaping and intersection welding processes can all be easily automated using existing techniques to be able to produce an iso-truss tube of indefinite length. The only limitation of this manufacturing method would be the variation of process parameters within the same iso-truss sample. While it is theoretically possible to vary the radius of curvature of pultrusion dies during the pultrusion process, enabling the possibility of varying the outer diameter and the intersection node-to-node distance along the length of a tube, the current state-of-the-art does not accommodate such a design. While it would also be possible to vary the cross-sectional area of each member along their length, it is considered undesirable as it would negatively affect the fibre volume content for a pultrusion-based process. Instead, it is recommended to construct an iso-truss structure in stages, being connected by a structure that is to be envisioned and produced in future research.","Continuous fibre-reinforced thermoplastics; Open lattice structures; Manufacturing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The vast majority, 4474, are built on monopile foundations. It is expected that all these foundations eventually need to be decommissioned. For the decommissioning of these monopiles there are two options: entire removal or partial removal. Most permits require partial removal during the decommissioning phase, but is this really the best method? This study endeavours to find the most competitive, safe, and environmentally friendly method to remove entire monopile foundations. For defining the scope, the existing monopile foundations are analysed and categorized in an easy, normal, and difficult case scenario. After that, the extraction loads of the three scenarios are calculated for the situations with and without soil friction reduction. Using these load cases, potential extraction principles are assessed on their technical feasibility. The extraction principles are split in three categories: lift connection, lifting techniques and technical aids. Next, the most competitive, safe, and environmentally friendly combination of principles is selected with a Multi Criteria Analysis that is based on the perspective of marine contractor. The highest scoring solution is verified with calculations. The final step is to validate and verify the selected solution. The result of this study is a bottom founded tool that uses axial cyclic loading and a beam-hole connection to extract monopile foundations. After the hole cutting and installation of the circular lifting beam, hydraulic jacks are used for cyclic loading and extracting the monopile foundation. For the easy case scenario, three to four lift-cycles are needed for the extraction process. A crane is used to position and retrieve the tool. In addition, the crane ensures a safe lifting operation. The removal tool is powered and controlled from the crane vessel. In the end, the method proposed in this study is the most competitive, safe, and environmentally friendly for entire monopile foundation removal when considering the boundary conditions of this study. Even when it is compared with partial removal, it scores better. It is noted that the selection process has a high sensitivity to different criteria and scoring. Especially when all HSE-risks are considered mitigated, other concepts may score better than the one proposed. It is advised to do further research on the soil friction loads and beam-cutting techniques.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Moreover, a shift from organizing each project individually to a more program-oriented approach has been observed in renovating infrastructure, whereby synergy a prominent feature is. In addition, it is becoming increasingly apparent that non-functional goals that focus on adding value (secondary goals) are outlined for construction programs besides functional goals. However, minor studies have been conducted to examine how achieving diverse program goals can be controlled and how a synergy can be optimally utilized in infrastructure renovation programs (IRP). The method used to improve utilizing this full potential is twofold, it consists of a literature study followed by empirical research, which consists of conducting three case studies and their synthesis. The proposed solution to gain control over both the primary and secondary goals of IRP is to shift the focus of control on performance this in turn would take control of the process. Regarding obtaining interpretable information, careful and constant attention to the connection between which content is essential and how this is acquired is critical. Considering the program organization, firstly, stimulating a collaborative working environment when executing tasks and creating awareness of the beneficial collective program management approach is essential. Secondly, implementing a change management procedure has been suggested. Lastly, the program management team should prioritize what needs to be coordinated on program level and what should be organized for all projects individually. The empirical research performed has generated in new synergy benefits that have not been described in scientific literature previously. Those new synergies found are the opportunity of empowering political urgency, removing obstacles that are in the way of performing research, decision-making based upon broad knowledge and a comprehensive overview of risks. To utilize all forms of synergy, the equilibrium between making the program manageable and utilizing synergy should be found by a combination of working in departments on tasks and practicing an integral way of working. To utilize the advantages of conducting research collectively, the focus should be directed upon the developments of the application-oriented innovation by associating the innovation directly to the program goals and involve knowledge institutions in the process. In order to utilize the program’s potential, it is recommended to program managers to notice and understand the forms of synergy accessible. Also, it is recommended for program managers to be aware of the tension between project and program management. Besides, a recommendation to program managers is to focus on the attitude of the program team towards the collective program approach. Furthermore, it is recommended that program managers reflect on their program to find out what barriers occur in their problem. Hence, the program manager can use this research to concretize actions on how to achieve improvements of their program. In addition, enabling the power of the iterative process is recommended.

Since the container shipping network is part of a larger network, it is favourable for the continuation of the supply chain to maintain this schedule. Although the importance of the continuation is recognised, the industry is not known for a high degree of schedule reliability. This is due to the presence of regular and irregular uncertainties in the network. It is found that more than 90% of these uncertainties find their origin in the port area. By deploying the LSS methodology, the causes and effects of port uncertainties are further analysed. It is found that the port uncertainties lead to transportation waste at sea in the form of fuel costs and emissions. The shipping sector is held accountable for approximately 3% of the global carbon dioxide emissions. A Dynamic Arrival Time (DAT) design is proposed to recover a schedule after a delay takes place to avoid waiting times and arrive JIT in the port. This differentiates from the current state where a First Come First Serve policy is maintained. An Agent-Based Discrete Event Simulation model in Anylogic is proposed to test the effects of a DAT implementation in a Short Sea Shipping (SSS) network that is subject to regular and irregular port uncertainties. It is found that a fuel and emissions reduction of up to 6.1% is achieved when a DAT is implemented under irregular uncertainties in the network. If the DAT incorporation is tested for regular uncertainties, the effect is equal to a 0.5% reduction in fuel and emissions. Furthermore, it is found that the design leads to a decrease in the port turnaround time due to improved arrival predictability. This improved predictability enables the shipping line (or agent) to recover the schedule and avoid drastic fuel increase during the departure transit. This study's findings are important for the policy-making for shipping companies due to the substantial energy savings that are measured. Furthermore, this study contributes to the MEPC.323(74) resolution, where voluntary cooperation between the port and shipping sectors is encouraged to reduce the GHG emissions from the shipping industry.","Maritime industry; Shipping network planning; GHG reduction policies; Lean Six Sigma; Dynamic Arrival Times","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design, Production and Operations","",""

Consequently, an enormous rise in greenhouse gas emissions has been observed, where the major contribution to global warming comes from the rising concentration of CO2. Therefore, the concept of capturing CO2 directly from the air (DAC) has gained world wide attention as it can reduce the carbon footprint of men kind.<br/>Zero Emission Fuels (ZEF), an inspiring start-up based in Delft, aims to develop a micro plant that utilizes the DAC concept to produce methanol as a fuel, using only the sun as its energy source. CO2 and H2O is captured directly from the atmosphere by the DAC unit which operates continuously with the help of an amine sorbent that flows through an absorption and stripping column. Previous research shows pure tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) having great potential as a CO2 capturing sorbent. However, it has some limitations regarding slow absorption and desorption kinetics due to a high sorbent viscosity, that prevent ZEF from reaching their goal of capturing 825 grams of CO2 per DAC unit in<br/>eight hours of operation. The focus of this research is on the sorbent selection process of ZEF’s DAC system. Research has shown that adding a diluent to TEPA could potentially improve the performance of the ZEF DAC unit. Therefore, a total of nine diluents, DEG, PEG-200, PEG-400, PEG-600, selexol-250, selexol-500, glycerol, 1,4-butanediol, sulfolane, mixed in different ratio’s with TEPA, have been put to the test through the developed framework of sorbent selection.<br/>In the framework of sorbent selection all the sorbents are tested through four different experiments, keeping efficiency and costs in consideration. The Airfarm experiments are used to evaluate absorption capacity and viscosity of the sorbent at specific ambient conditions. The Vapor-Liquid-Equilibrium (VLE) experiments are utilized to evaluate the desorption characteristics of the sorbent from where the regeneration energy demand can be calculated with the help of a mathematical model. The re-pumping experiments are used to evaluate the absorption kinetics of the sorbent and lastly, the degradation experiments<br/>are used to evaluate the sorbent life time performance. After the experimental procedure the sorbents can be judged on the key performance indicators regarding the ZEF DAC unit operated in a specific climate. It was concluded through the literature research and proved by an extensive experimental research<br/>that selexol, glycerol and sulfolane did not improve the characteristics of the sorbent. However, adding DEG, PEG or 1,4-butanediol to TEPA did have a profound positive effect on the overall performance of the DAC unit. Since the diluents reduce the sorbent viscosity, and therefore, increase the absorption<br/>and desorption kinetics. Based on the experimental results and the design specifications set by ZEF, PEG-200 proved the most promising out of all diluents in the mixing ratio TEPA:PEG-200 2:5. This sorbent has been tested for two different climates; the dry Sahara climate and the more humid Mediterranean climate to see how the sorbent would have to be changed for different climates. It was concluded, for a more humid climate, it requires less diluent for the sorbent to stay within the 2 푃푎 ⋅ 푠 viscosity limit. The experimental results were included in a full DAC model to design the DAC unit utilizing the optimized sorbent for the two different climates considering the design specifications set by ZEF. Following<br/>a sensitivity analysis an optimized conceptual DAC design was obtained for both climates. Where it was concluded that the optimized sorbent resulted in reduction in energy requirement for regeneration of the sorbent, where 1554 푘푊ℎ/푡표푛 of CO2 is needed for the Sahara climate and 1636 푘푊ℎ/푡표푛 of CO2 for the Mediterranean climate. Finally, a cost analysis has been performed regarding the operational and capital costs of the newly designed conceptual DAC units for both climates.","Direct air capture; zero emission fuels","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-05-20","","","","","","52.0126341, 4.3555860"

Much research is conducted on robotic applications within such environments; one of these applications concerns deploying an autonomous mobile manipulator to assist humans in retail stores. Such a robot requires the ability to cope with unexpected environmental changes, like encountering obstructions in retail store aisles. Generally, the first step in the pipeline of an autonomous mobile robot is focused on gathering and processing environmental information using perception sensors like cameras and LiDARs. Subsequently, this information is used to plan the mobile robot's path, which is typically done without allowing interaction with the environment. For object detection techniques, objects are first localized, after which they are classified towards their object type category. Another approach is to classify objects towards their functional categories, which are commonly referred to as affordances. Research in the field of affordance classification mostly focuses on kitchen, garden and working tools due to the availability of affordance datasets for these objects. However, no work on affordances in retail store environments has been conducted to this date. More specifically, there is no dataset publicly available that allows mobile manipulators to identify how to interact with retail store related objects in such environments. This work has investigated the adaptation of an instance segmentation network to localize and classify objects on floors of retail stores into affordance classes. These affordance classes relate to the functional capabilities of mobile manipulators, like graspable or pushable. To achieve this, an affordance dataset consisting of retail store related objects is essential. To overcome the scarcity in this data, a novel dataset consisting of 3237 images with pixel-level affordance annotations was successfully created using an automated data generation approach. This work has shown that such an approach can be used to minimize human labour in terms of acquiring annotated data drastically. A state-of-the-art instance segmentation network was trained using this synthetically generated data and was tested on both synthetic and real image data. The evaluation revealed that the use of synthetic data for training allows for inference on real image data, yet this may compromise the localization and especially the classification performance. Further, the observation of objects that are assigned to both affordance classes has introduced the aspect of the subjectivity of affordances.","Affordances; Mobile Manipulation; Robotics; Dataset; instance segmentation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

There have been some researches on this specific topic. Nevertheless, the existing algorithms are either not fully compatible with parallel acceleration or have a narrow application scope (can only handle the far-field problem). This thesis's goal is to design a method that can have a fast approximation of the inverse reflector problem and handle different application scenarios.

I first give the definition of the inverse reflector problem and explain why I choose simulated annealing in the proposed method by analysing the related works and various optimisation algorithms.

Moreover, to solve the issues and improve performance, I propose additional strategies, such as Phong tessellation, randomisation strategy, multi-level strategy, history-decision strategy and penalising strategy. I also discuss the system design based on the proposed method and how to accelerate the optimisation process in this system. I evaluate and validate the proposed method by running test cases in different scenarios and compare the results with other algorithms. The results show that the method, as a general optimisation algorithm, can achieve good results in different application scenarios. The compatibility, speed and accuracy are the main advantages.

A key task for an autonomous vehicle is the recognition of drivable area and, in an extension of this, detecting the road boundaries. State-of-the-art techniques often use camera and/or LIDAR sensors to perform this task. However, these sensors can be expensive and not suitable in low visibility situations such as during nighttime or in bad weather. Radar sensors are a viable alternative. The aims of this study are twofold: to introduce a technique of radar-based road boundary estimation (RBE) using radar sensors and to develop a suitable benchmark to compare different radar-based RBE techniques. The RBE algorithm proposed in this study, Clustering-based Urban Road Boundary Estimation (CURBE), clusters the radar detections and incorporates domain knowledge to determine which of the clusters describe road boundaries (so-called boundary clusters). Additionally, we propose a novel benchmark to compare radar RBE algorithms. The benchmark makes use of the nuScenes data set. Each radar reflection in the data set is given a ground truth label. The radar reflection is given the label of boundary point or non-boundary point based on several sources such as the measured radial velocity, object annotations, and a detailed road map. To quantify the performance of an RBE algorithm, the estimated labels outputted by the RBE algorithm are compared to the ground truth labels using the metrics precision, recall, and F1-score. CURBE is evaluated on the benchmark where it achieves an F1-score of 30.4%. We conclude that with the current version of CURBE and with the current method of measuring performance there are not enough grounds to consider this method as a reliable way of RBE. However, the approach shows promise. The method has the potential to significantly improve performance by using a clustering method that is designed for radar data or implementing a different way of selecting boundary clusters. Since the proposed benchmark uses the radar reflections in the data set as ground truth the performance measurement is less accurate in recordings with limited radar coverage, but overall it is concluded that the benchmark provides a fast and consistent way to measure and compare the performance of different RBE algorithms.","radar; road boundary estimation; benchmark","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The operating principle of these formjackers, or card skimmers on the web, is typically simple, yet effective: when making a payment on webshop that has been infected with a formjacker, the submitted payment information is not just transmitted to the webshop, but also silently to the involved malicious actor. Incidents in the past few years with large numbers of potentially affected customers, in the order of hundreds of thousands to millions, and high fines, in the order of tens of millions, have shown the urgency of addressing the issue of card skimming on the web. Currently, the state of the art in detecting formjackers is that of the cybersecurity industry, whose proprietary detection strategies appear to heavily rely on classical, static-analysis techniques. A drawback of these techniques is that they are less suited to detect new or unknown strands of formjackers. To advance the state of the art and enable a comprehensive, large-scale study of formjackers on the web, we wish to go beyond the traditional `Indicators of Compromise' approach. Instead of building on relatively shallow indicators, such as what formjacker typically look like, or which domains are commonly associated with formjacking campaigns, we propose to look at the underlying, more rudimentary behavior of formjackers, such as accessing data entered into the page. To this end, we introduce and study a detection strategy that ties into these more fundamental behavioral patterns of formjackers by applying dynamic analysis of client-side JavaScript. As an important prerequisite in dynamic analysis, we identify which conditions must be satisfied to elicit malicious behavior in formjackers. We implement two types of dynamic analysis, showing how these conditions can be met in practice. Finally, by crawling various collections of URLs we study the extent to which the proposed detection solution is suited to detect formjackers.","formjacking; magecart; cybercrime; e-commerce; JavaScript; dynamic analysis; taint analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Cyber Security","",""

Investors and project owners need sound rationale for their returns on investment made into sustainability – in financial, environmental and social benefits achieved. Promoting sustainable building methods and the use of sustainable products and materials demands a tool that can justify the investment into them. This thesis addresses this challenge and provides a decision making tool that can evaluate and compare the true lifecycle values of construction projects, in order to allow investors and project owners to compare between design options and select the most optimum choice based on their preferences. Thus the model gives a direct relation between the investment and total returns, and acts as a guide for investors on the selection of design and material choices for the needed level of sustainability in their projects. Termed as the “Total Value for Society” model, it uses Multi-criteria Decision Analysis methodology to pick the construction project with the most “true lifecycle value” out of multiple options of the same functional equivalence. The tool is applied to a test case provided by Heijmans. The results of this model are verified and validated through stakeholder interviews. A sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of the model. An expert review performed using stakeholder interviews validates the usefulness of the model and its impact on the design selection process. The validation shows that the model’s usefulness to owners/investors, contractors and designers indeed matches with their expected uses of the model and fulfills its needs as established by the same stakeholders earlier. Finally, the report concludes by answering to the main development statement - The Total Value for Society Model, by comparing design options based on their lifecycle performances on financial, environmental and social sustainability aspects, and showing the most optimum option for the given preferences on the relative weights of criteria, can enable investors to evaluate and compare the true lifecycle values of construction projects, and doing so, guide their investment decisions. The thesis however is just one step towards rationalising investment decisions regarding sustainable construction, and it further provides new avenues for future research and developments.","Sustainability; Circularity; Circular Economy; Lifecycle Assessment; True Lifecycle Value; Value for Society; LCA; LCCA; SLCA; Multicriteria Decision Analysis; MCA; MCDA; Social Impact; Social Impact Analysis; Preference Function Modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Stam, D.M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Over the last five decades, thermal modelling of airless minor planetary bodies such as asteroids have experienced significant improvements. However, at lower wavelengths of the mid-infrared range, thermal models such as the widely used Near-Earth Asteroid Model (NEATM) are still considered unreliable since reflected light starts contributing significantly towards the observed flux density. Through a controversy related to the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mission, which was an infrared survey telescope with four observational bands found at 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 microns, Nathan Myhrvold suggested that the thermal modelling carried out did not properly account for reflected light and that the results, especially derived from the first two observation bands, were compromised since Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation was violated. To date, the WISE mission is considered the highest yielding mission with more than 158,000 asteroids detected, however Myhrvold's findings state that the result derived for about half of those detections are compromised. This controversy motivated this master thesis project to create a numerical code, which properly combines thermal and reflected light modelling, to further investigate the influence of the latter at the four WISE observational bands. The initial aim of this master thesis was the create an advanced thermal model, but due to the time scope of this master thesis, an intermediate thermal model named the Asteroid Thermal and Reflected light Model (ATRM) was achieved. On top of being able to model simple spherical and ellipsoidal shapes, the ATRM can model irregularly-shaped asteroids with precise orbital and rotational properties taken into account as do advanced thermal models, but assumes instantaneous thermal equilibrium as do simple thermal models such as the NEATM. Furthermore, the ATRM caters to mostly convex-shaped asteroids due to the simple shadowing algorithm implemented, and not taking into account multiple scattering. However, the ATRM is able to vary the surface albedo distribution pattern of an asteroid through an octant method, which is typically not the case for simple and advanced thermal models which all assume a homogeneous surface albedo. With the aforementioned capabilities of the ATRM, the percentage of reflected light in the total flux density at the four wavelength bands of WISE were estimated for different albedo values covering the majority of asteroids falling under the three broad Bus-DeMeo taxonomic classification system (C-, S-, X-types). Furthermore, the influence of the heliocentric distance, emissivity, and shape of the asteroid on the contribution of reflected light were investigated. Ultimately, this project is another step-wise progress in the field of physical characterisation of airless planetary bodies, especially asteroids, and has far-reaching consequences in terms of planetary formation, in-situ resource utilisation (ISRU), commercial asteroid mining, and planetary defence.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-08-31","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This meant that municipalities became responsible for the organisation of all youth care. First evaluations of the youth act show that a lack of collaboration and coherence in the youth care has resulted in complaints from youth and parents concerning long waiting times, complexity in finding their way in the care, and issues in the continuity of the care (ZonMw, 2018). This project is executed in collaboration with the municipality of Renkum. Like most municipalities in the country, the municipality of Renkum has been struggling with the transitions enforced by the decentralisation. A lack of overview of, and a lack of collaboration and coherence between, the network partners in the system, prohibits the deployment of light and fitting care and instead has lead to an increased amount of referrals into expensive and heavy specialized care. In this thesis, I address the lack of collaboration and coherency between the network partners within the jeugdhulp system in Renkum and design a strategy to support the transition of the system to become more collaborative and able to offer fitting and coherent care. To embrace the complexity of the jeugdhulp and find how stakeholders- as well as the factors hindering them from collaborating- are connected, during this research I have adopted a systemic design approach. Building on insights gained through interviews with the network partners, I created a map visualizing the network partners in the jeugdhulp in Renkum and the connections between them. Drawing on living networks theory and the frame innovation method I concluded that the jeugdhulp in Renkum is currently in a state of isolation- a lot of parties are working towards the same goal, but only do so from their own island. This isolation has resulted in fragmentation of knowledge and a culture of endless referrals for the families. Although most parties in the jeugdhulp system see the value of collaboration, they seem to miss an overview of their network partners and structures for connection and collaboration lack. Currently, the municipality is working to connect the network partners, but there seems to be a lack of trust in their leadership which leads to hesitance of the network partners to commit to the collaboration. Using the frame innovation method I have explored interventions that would support the jeugdhulp transition out of a state of isolation, to a future where the network partners actively work together, share knowledge, create novelty and have the ability to grow together. The final result is a framework for the organisation of a series of events. These events- to be organised by the social team in collaboration with their network partners- are designed to support the transition towards a collaborative system by creating change on three levels: Supporting the municipality to take a facilitating leadership role Supporting network partners take ownership of the relations in the system Creating room for experimentation and innovation","jeugdhulp; Systemic Design; youth care; Frame innovation; Living Networks; Collaboration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In previous research, the necessity of non-rigid body simulators was stated to be a requirement for long, slender bodies. However, it remains unclear for which vehicle design parameters non-rigid body effects become destabilising. A set of 2+N linearly independent equations of motions can be combined in a single matrix to determine the motion of a flexible launch vehicle with N slosh masses. The flexibility of the vehicle is modelled using the method of assumed modes. The sloshing motion is modelled by assuming that the slosh mass behaves like a pendulum. To couple the different motions, a constraint matrix is used. The model is developed in Matlab Simulink. Using non-quiescent starting conditions with no external forces acting on the vehicle except gravity, it was found that the energy of the system remained constant. The flight data from the Stratos III launch vehicle was obtained and compared to the simulated non-rigid body model data. It was found that slosh motion can result in destabilisation when this vehicle experiences a sudden decrease in acceleration. The destabilisation that occurred could not be observed when rigid body equations of motion were used. Based on a sensitivity analysis over a range of vehicle parameters, it is recommended for length over diameter (L/D) ratios above 20 to consider the use of non-rigid body models. From this ratio, the maximum and total flexibility strongly increase. For L/D ratios below 20, flexibility is negligible and sloshing becomes the main perturbing factor. It was found that a PID controller that is designed using a rigid body model is still able to stabilise the non-rigid body during flight. Oscillations occurred in both the rigid and non-rigid body model when a single set of gains was used. For both models, the oscillations were removed by introducing gain scheduling.","Non-rigid; Small-satellites; Launch Vehicle; GNC; Aeroelasticity; Sloshing; Stratos III; Flexibility; Simulink","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","52.344618459920895, 4.843695720198038"

This includes deriving the energy potential of open-field PV and wind technologies in the region. Apart from the electricity demand of the power sector, the hydrogen demand of the steel, ammonia and road&amp;rail transport sectors is also considered, as well as the export of hydrogen in the liquid form. Different scenarios are considered for a better understanding of the operation of the system. Li-ion batteries and gaseous hydrogen vessels are employed to balance production and demand, while reconversion technologies are also part of the system together with powerlines and hydrogen pipelines. The study shows that the potential of onshore wind and solar energy is way greater than total energy demand, while offshore wind potential is of a comparable size to total energy demand. On average, solar energy is the cheapest source of electricity at 2.9 €c/kWh, followed by onshore wind at 4.9 €c/kWh and offshore wind at 9.9 €c/kWh. However, the minimum cost registered by solar and onshore wind technologies is almost the same at around 2.2 €c/kWh, while offshore turbines do not fall below 5.0 €c/kWh. In a cooperation scenario considering local electricity and hydrogen demand, total annual costs are equal to 130 €bln/year, 21% less than a similar scenario where countries are isolated from each other. Twice as much electricity is produced through wind turbines than PV farms under the cooperation scheme, whereas solar energy slightly dominates the electricity mix in the isolation scenario. Besides, the system relies more on curtailment and battery storage than reconversion. The coupling of the power and hydrogen sectors leads to a total costs reduction of 7%. The LCOE found for the system is of 6.1 €c/kWh, which is around 20% more than the current LCOE of modern gas turbines in the region. The LCOH of gaseous and liquid hydrogen at the port is of 2.5 and 3.0 €/kg respectively, which is 2-3 times more expensive than crude oil and several times more expensive than LNG based on current breakeven costs in the region.","Energy System Model; Renewable energy; Green hydrogen; Land eligibility analysis; GIS; LCOE; LCOH","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This graduation project contributes to the development of mycelium based materials by looking beyond the realm of these growing requirements. In this research the effect and potential of acoustic environments on the growth of mycelium is explored according to the Material Driven Design Method by Karana et al. (2015). The goal of this project is to provide first insight into the relation between the acoustic environments and mycelial growth. First by looking into physiology of mycelium and the required growing conditions needed for effective growth of the material. Additionally the physics of sound is explored to get an understanding of the factors that define an acoustic environment. A setup was created to host the required environmental conditions needed by designing three modular incubators. These incubators provide a multifunctional growing chamber where different stimuli systems can be placed precisely within while maintaining the required growing conditions for the mycelium and dampen external sounds. Three different conditions were created for this research, a silence chamber, a mono speaker and a stereo setup to see the response of the mycelium to the different types of stimuli. The response was captured by doing a grayscale analysis to quantitatively analyse the change in growth. In this research the key findings of the research provided first insights into the negative correlation between this acoustic environment and mycelial growth regarding the growth rate and textural qualities at higher volumes. In addition it provided that this type of sonic stimuli has no effect on the textural qualities and spatial distribution of mycelium.","Mycelium; Growing Design; Acoustic environment; Material Driven Design; Emerging Materials; Living Materials; Material Experience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The Dutch government is aiming for a CO2 neutral energy supply by 2050 and vast cost reductions have turned (offshore) wind energy into a worthy competitor for other (green) energy sources. Most of the planned wind farms in the Dutch North Sea are located in areas where the seabed is covered with sand waves. In the North Sea these sand waves have lengths of 100-1000 m, heights of 1-8 m and they migrate with rates of up to 10 m/year (Morelissen et al., 2003). Sand wave migration and changes in shape, may cause a significant rise or drop in local bed level. This bed level variation over time could decrease the stability of foundations or bed protections or cause exposure of cables and pipelines.<br/>Various offshore infrastructural projects, like offshore wind farms, thus require long term (30-50 years) predictions of the seabed dynamics. Currently data-driven methods are used to determine the range of expected bed levels. However, the uncertainty in these predictions is significant, with sand waves being the largest source of uncertainty. Furthermore, no real understanding of the systems at hand forms the base of these predictions. Not many attempts have been made to accurately model sand wave dynamics in real-life situations using a process based model. Since sand waves often have steep slopes in migration direction, a need for small numerical grid sizes arises. On the other hand oceanic hydrodynamics are affected by large scale bed forms. To include (the influence of) these bed forms, large model domains are required. This makes numerical modelling of sand wave fields rather difficult due to the balance between grid sizes and computation time. The newly developed Delft3D Flexible Mesh (FM) model may be able to overcome some of these problems.<br/>Through the use of unstructured grids, the desired level of detail can be reached in certain sand wave areas. In combination with the possibility to run simulations in parallel, on multiple cores, computation times can be reduced significantly. However, the Delft3D FM model has not yet been used for the prediction of sand wave dynamics. The aim of this research is to find the opportunities and challenges of the Delft3D FM model for quantitative modelling of sand wave dynamics in the North Sea.<br/><br/>Through two case studies various opportunities and challenges for predicting sand wave dynamics using Delft3D FM are discovered. The Delft3D FM model showed a significant reduction of computation times for a 2DV case using a single core compared to Delft3D-4. For parallel simulations, using multiple cores, an approximately linear further reduction of computation time is observed in a 2DV setting. Furthermore, the possibility of unstructured grids presents a solution for the small grid sizes needed in sand wave areas. Other computational<br/>gains are realized through a morphological scale factor (which is also <br/> ncorporated in Delft3D-4), optimized time-step management and a new type of boundary conditions. This new boundary condition imposes both water level and flow velocity over depth in both horizontal directions. In this way the local flow conditions are accurately represented and the influence of bed forms outside the model domain can easily be incorporated. This potentially eliminates the need for buffer zones.<br/>Challenges for the application of Delft3D FM on sand wave cases are found in amongst others the availability of data. When less data on local hydrodynamics is available the accurate representation of processes driving sand wave dynamics becomes more difficult. Furthermore the inclusion of sub-grid processes, like the growth and migration of megaripples, could be problematic. In the model case studies no calibration was carried out. This calibration could potentially increase the effort needed to apply Delft3D FM to real life sand wave cases.<br/>Furthermore, the Delft3D FM model is still in development and significant differences between the results of different versions of Delft3D FM were observed. Care should be taken when applying a new version of Delft3D<br/>FM. The model is however being developed in collaboration with users which ensures quick feedback and thus stimulates improvement of the results between versions.<br/>Recommended research includes extended exploration of the 3D effects influencing sand wave dynamics. Furthermore, improvement of morphological results and optimization of the model set-up will increase the applicability<br/>of Delft3D FM in an engineering setting. A model run forced by two Riemann boundaries showed improved morphological results, although the hydrodynamics were not well represented. These results might indicate<br/>where differences with reality originate. Examples of such differences are overestimation of peak velocities, exclusion of wind-driven currents and exclusion of processes like suspended sediment transport, free surface waves<br/>and grain size sorting. Further exploration of these factors could enhance the predictive capacities of Delft3D FM. Applying the model at other locations in the North Sea will help determine the overall applicability of the model.<br/>Through this extended research the full potential of the Delft3D FM model can be discovered and prepared for future engineering applications. Insights gained into the processes influencing sand waves dynamics, through the use of Delft3D FM, could pave the way for more nature based solutions, thus reducing the need for dredging. In this way Delft3D FM could contribute to reducing risks, costs and environmental impact of offshore construction projects in sand wave areas.","Sand waves; wind farm; morphology; North Sea; Delft3D; Flexible Mesh; unstructured grid; 3D model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Twoconcepts are then created and theoretically compared. A concept is selected that is based on theadsorption of water into a solid desiccant.As the concept solution is to operate in a closed system, regeneration of the desiccant needs to befaster than its utilization.

From this it can be concluded that thegas can be dried adequately, and that regeneration can be done thoroughly.A model is made to verify the experiment’s workings, based on models from literature. This modelis then validated using literature, and then fitted to experimental data.

Maak expressed an interest in offering services to independent music artists. The objective of this thesis is to show stakeholders how value can be reinterpreted and distributed to balance value streams in the music industry. This goal is achieved by developing a thought provoking concept. The process involved two main research phases and a design phase. In the first research phase the music industry was mapped out. Subsequently the decision was made to focus on the streaming industry, especially on Spotify. To form the basis of the design phase, all the insights from the previous two research phases were assembled and distilled to create the following four design principles: Artist empowerment; lower barriers to entry for independent artists User involvement; Collectivism, collaboration and co–operation to be reflected in design, critical listeners to become part of the creative process Stimulate independent artists Playlist improvement; Restore the importance of the user-generated playlist; currently playlists are generally either impersonal or biased - or both: Algorithmic playlists; no human involved Editorial playlists; More and more people dependent on a small group of editors DSP’s push their own playlists; User-generated playlists are becoming devalued as they are becoming harder to find. Research question: How can we redesign the music industry to balance value streams? Answer: Make music streaming more social. Why: Direct Streaming Platforms constrict the relationship between creators and their audience. Goal: Make streaming more social for independent/DIY creators. Create direct, intimate interactions and foster those connections. The design phase consisted of ideation and concept development of three concepts. After which, one concept was chosen to focus on. In turn this concept was named “Lister”. Lister is a music community platform which allows users to discover, and exchange ideas about, music based on similar taste, in a social way. Lister was validated in various ways and has been through several iterations as a result. It is well-supported by music industry professionals that were involved in the process. It shows signs of having potential and there could be justification for further research to better define the concept, to establish different needs and values amongst stakeholders and a launch strategy.","Systemic design; music; music industry; streaming, DSP; Spotify","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The platooning of trucks provides significant benefits in the existing transportation systems regarding social, economic and environmental aspects. Due to the platoon's high dependence on sensors, it is critically important to have fault-tolerant countermeasures that deal efficiently with failures by achieving minimal risk condition. This thesis tackles designing an emergency escape manoeuvre for a faulty truck that has lost its ability to monitor the driving environment while moving in a platoon formation on a highway. A fallback strategy is proposed that leads the faulty truck to park on the shoulder of the road and allows the rest of the platoon participants to continue their journey. To solve this problem, first, a functional platooning system should be designed. Therefore, a nonlinear bicycle dynamic model is employed, while a new Bidirectional (BD) Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) system is utilized for control purposes. The emergency escape manoeuvre has to be pre-computed and ready to be triggered when the failure occurs, as concerning defined specifications, limitations and constraints. It is generated using a quintic splines methodology, while a new optimization approach regarding the minimization of jerk peaks is adopted, enhancing the efficiency of the design procedure. Furthermore, a gap-closing controller is employed and tuned accordingly to reform the platoon after the faulty truck abandons the formation. Moreover, a suitable decision logic is defined to achieve smooth transition among regular performance and fallback state at both platoon and inter-vehicle level. The functionality of each component is firstly evaluated individually, based on specific performance metrics. Finally, all the mentioned components are put together and the fallback strategy that executes emergency escape manoeuvre in platoon context is derived. Several simulation tests illustrate proof of principle for the proposed framework. It is shown that the proposed strategy indeed achieves minimal risk condition for the faulty truck achieving minimal tracking errors. A global applied strategy is adopted for the gap-closing controller by making healthy follower(s) travel with the maximum possible acceleration. At the same time, the leading truck of the formation maintains a constant speed until the time gap between them becomes $0.8s$, before the switch back to the CACC, to complete this action as fast as possible and safety issues in the driving performance. Additionally, the CACC system is evaluated to ensure that the string stability criterion is satisfied in the mode of operation. Moreover, a virtual leader mechanism is introduced to fill in faulty truck's blind spot in the road that arise from the sensor failure. It is shown that it can provide a sufficient window of movement for the platoon before switching to the fallback strategy.","platooning; Emergency planning; Trajectory generation; intelligent transportation systems; CACC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

In this research we explored how the code review process is used at Greenchoice, a Dutch energy supplier. Subsequently, we created a code review checklist which was used by the developers in order to improve the process. In the first step of the exploration we used a questionnaire to retrieve Greenchoice's motivation for the code review process. In the results we show that ensuring quality is the main motivation followed by knowledge sharing and functionality check. Secondly, we held 13 semi-structured interviews, performed a data analysis on the metadata of 8458 pull requests and performed a data analysis of 5400 code review comments to explore Greenchoice's code review process further. In the results of the interviews we show that the reviewers tend to focus on understanding the change and finding obvious mistakes. They also mentioned code reviews could be performed stricter improving the maintainability and evolvability aspects. However, it can be hard to know where to check on for these aspects. In the results of the metadata analysis we show that the code reviews are performed quick, frequent and small changes are made, similar to the modern code reviews processes described in the literature. In the results of the code review comments analysis we show that most comments are related to explaining or understanding the change. Next, we created together with a scrum team a code review checklist which was was used by three scrum teams for two periods of two weeks. In order to measure the effectiveness of the code review checklist we used a pre questionnaire to gauge the current situation and the expectations of the usage. A post questionnaire was used to gauge the new situation and whether the expectations were met. After comparing the results we show in the results that the checklist is less appropriate to guide the reviewer step by step in a code review. Furthermore, we show that the items in the checklists should be applicable to the different changes in the pull requests. The strength of the checklist lies in addressing the items which are often forgotten in the development process and the code reviews.","Code Reviews; Code Review Checklist; Mining Software Repositories; Pull Requests; Software Engineering; Questionnaire; Interviews","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

The purpose of this research is to develop a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model that optimally matches the available VTOL (Vertical Take-off and Landing) vehicle fleet with customer trip requests, subject to (UAM-specific) constraints, and which subsequently provides a vehicle’s routing. The model, in particular, addresses the constraint of limited ground infrastructure capacity. A case study is performed where multiple demand distribution scenarios, resembling different use cases, are applied to the model. Results show that wider time windows do not have a clear beneficial effect on the profit and that customer demand distribution has an impact on the efficiency of the operation. Additionally, the results enable the identification of various key input parameters for infrastructure, fleet size and vehicle technology that can improve the overall operation.","Urban Air Mobility; Ride-sharing; vertical takeoff and landing; Vehicle Routing Problem","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

We aim to create a system for home or small-business use where the user is in control. We use WEKA for the machine learning models and feature selection. The UGR’16 dataset is used to train and test the models. We create three different models for each method where the model is trained on one day and tested on another. We find that supervised models perform better than unsupervised ones. Random Forest has the highest F1-score (0.9165) of the supervised models. However, Random Forest is statistically similar to 6 out of 8 different classifiers according to the Friedman and Nemenyi tests. One challenge with supervised methods is that there is a need for a third party to make sure the models are updated for new attacks. However, it seems feasible to create a system for network monitoring for home usage. Finally, we argue that the approach to research in machine learning should, in some cases, take a different direction. Instead of chasing the highest accuracy, we should look at which factors allow a user to work with a system. A set of rules is much easier to interpret than complex models. Especially if these models are statistically similar we could look at factors other than a single metric. After these results, we look at presenting warning messages to end-users. We want to motivate users to take action after they read a message. For this, we first create a theoretical framework based on behaviour, motivation and uncertainties. We want to find out if we can use uncertainties to group users, which allows us to create a semi-personal approach. Based on this theoretical framework, we create different versions of a warning message that focus on different uncertainties. Through 22 interviews, we asked the participants to rank the different versions and asked them questions about their stance on network security and preferences for warning messages. We found that uncertainties can not be used to group users but that they do influence them. Including a solution and which steps to take offers users peace of mind, even if they are not able to complete the steps. The results indicate that a more personal approach is necessary where every person has the choice to customize the message to fit their preference.","NetFlow; Machine Learning; Science Communication; Interviews; Anomaly Detection; Computer Science; Monitoring system; Uncertainties; Behaviour; Motivation","en","master thesis","","","","","","degree of Master of Science in Computer Science & Science Communication","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

(graduation committee); Visscher, Michiel (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Buildings influence the environment due to the emission of greenhouse gases, energy use, water consumption, and waste generation. The load-bearing structures of buildings also have a significant share in these emissions. Currently, European and national regulations oblige to focus on sustainability in designs as well. In this research, it is therefore investigated how the environmental impact of a specific case study can be reduced (the Base design). This is a distribution centre’s load-bearing structure and is a sway steel structure with one mezzanine floor made from concrete and steel. In the first part of this research, the design choices to reduce the yearly environmental impact of a distribution centre’s load-bearing structure are investigated. This is done by following three circular economy strategies to improve the Base design. The first strategy focuses on the building’s initial material use, where it is aimed to reduce the current impact of these materials as much as possible. This strategy is applied in a non-sway steel structure and a non-sway timber structure. The second strategy focuses on the afterlife of a building. This led to a steel sway structure where Design for Deconstruction is applied, which means that extra attention is given to the connections to ensure reuse is possible at the end of life. The third strategy focuses on extending the use stage, meaning that the design is optimised for multiple functions. This is implemented in two designs where the principle of Design for Adaptability is applied. In the second part of the research, several environmental impact calculation methods to measure the environmental impact are investigated. It is decided to consider the current product impact (Stages A1-A3 of a Life Cycle Assessment) and the final stage (Stage D), where benefits and loads beyond the system boundary are calculated. As a result, the yearly environmental impact is calculated for the different design alternatives and is given in a shadow price (in euros) per year. This is done separately for the main load-bearing structure and the mezzanine floor load-bearing structure. From the environmental impact calculation of the design alternatives, it can be concluded that there are several ways to reduce the environmental impact of a distribution centre. Though, the following design aspects influence this most significantly. Firstly, it is concluded that environmentally friendly material should always be chosen over other materials to reduce the environmental impact of a building. More specifically, it is recommended to design a timber sway structure (Alternative B) if the reference service life of the building is unknown or if a long reference service life is expected. For a short reference service life, it is recommended to focus on the afterlife of a building. This strategy is most effective if this is combined with a reduction in initial material use. For the main load-bearing structure, Alternative A with an end of life scenario with a high chance of reuse results in the lowest yearly environmental impact. For the mezzanine floor, the demountable floor design with a high chance of reuse of Alternative C leads to the lowest yearly environmental impact. Besides, using the building for a longer time is also an effective measure to reduce the yearly environmental impact. The reference service life may extend if a building is designed for multiple functions. This can be assessed by asking the client about their expectations of the use of the building. By assessing this issue in the design phase, it can be decided to include some overcapacity to ensure a longer reference service life.","Environmental impact; Structural design; Distribution centre; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Circular economy; Design for Adaptability; Design for Deconstruction; Timber; Steel; Concrete; Service life extension; Demountable; End of life","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

After the completion of the Volkerakdam, Philipsdam and Oesterdam as part of the Delta Works, this estuary was cut of from the Oosterschelde and a fresh water lake was formed in a sea water environment. This new lake became the Volkerak-Zoommeer: a lake that acts as a fresh water supply for the regional water systems of the water boards Hollandse Delta, Scheldestromen and Brabantse Delta as well as providing a tidal free shipping connection between Antwerp and the Rhine. The operational water manager of the lake is Rijkswaterstaat. They manage the water level and water quality by letting fresh water in from the Hollandsch Diep at the Volkeraksluizen and release it at Bath into the Westerschelde. This mechanism enables Rijkswaterstaat to flush the system and adhere to the target levels, as well as managing a maximum chloride concentration of 450 mg Cl/L during the growing season. In 2018, the Netherlands experienced one of the most severe droughts since the beginning of weather measurements started. Low discharges at the Rhine resulted in a decreasing water supply and more salinization in the Rhine Meuse Delta. When the discharge of the Rhine at Lobith reach below 800 m3/s, it is no longer allowed to let in fresh water through the Volkeraksluizen. This could lead to problems in the fresh water supply to the regional system of the water users of the Volkerak-Zoommeer. The question came up whether creating a fresh water buffer by temporarily heightening of the water level could be used to overcome a period with no fresh water supply from the Hollandsch Diep. In autumn 2020, the dynamics of the system were researched during a practical trial. The water level was heightened up to +0.15 m NAP. Next, the inlet was closed and it was measured how long it would take until the water level reached -0.10m NAP with normal flushing operations at Bath. During a second trial, the outlet at Bath was closed too. Based on the insights of these trials, a prototype for a Decision Support System was created. This system is able to give insights in the development of the water level at the Volkerak-Zoommeer according to operational water management decisions. This Decision Support System was used to evaluate the impact of delta and climate scenarios in 2050 and 2085 on the water level of the Volkerak-Zoommeer. The maximum possible duration for a period without a fresh water supply was researched per scenario within the target levels of -0.10 m NAP and + 0.15m NAP. Different flushing regimes at Bath were evaluated. For normal flushing operations, this duration is 5 till 7 days. For flushing every second low tide, this period could be lengthened to 8 to 13 days. When the outlet at Bath is closed, the maximum duration is 20 till 60 days. From the trials, it was found that the chloride concentration will gradually increase in this period. Unfortunately, sufficient insights in the dynamics of the chloride concentration lack at the moment to sufficiently incorporate the chloride concentration in the prototype. From historical data, the maximum duration of a period with discharges lower than 800 m3/s measured at Lobith was 16 days during the growing season and 82 days for all year data. Within the current target levels, this duration cannot be reached. It was therefore researched what initial water level theoretically could be achieved based on historical data. This turned out to be +0.50 m NAP. Here, the Volkerak-Zoommeer was considered as a closed system, neglecting the open connections with the Dintel and the Vliet. With an initial water level of +0.50 m NAP, the duration without fresh water supply could be significantly lengthened. With normal flushing operations, the period can take between 12 and 19 days. For flushing operations every second low tide, this period takes 20 till 34 days. When the outlet at Bath is closed, a period up to 120 days could be bridged.","Volkerak-Zoommeer; Climate change; Decision Support System; fresh water supply; water level buffering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","","51.49829, 4.22018"

Aiming to be informed by the unique set of circumstances we face today, in the hope to design better digital solutions for our future. The project has the goal of assisting students in a remote study situation to be able to build and nourish their networks and personal relationships.

In order to design for sustained well-being, the project follows the multi-stage framework for sustained wellbeing promoted by technology proposed by Wiese, Pohlmeyer &amp; Hekkert,(2020).In order to understand the target group’s experiences, we have looked into their routines during the lockdown and collected their recollections of their previous university experiences. With the insights from the research, a problem statement was formed, leading to a design direction.The design direction was focused on stimulating and facilitating the engagement with positive activities related to the nurturing of personal relationships (Wiese, Pohlmeyer &amp; Hekkert, 2020), exploring how to reinstate the drivers of behaviour necessary for the engagement with such activities in a virtual scenario.The ideation phase explored 10 different ways of virtual social interactions, which were later exposed to the target group for feedback and combined into one final concept: Atrium, a close-knit environment to feel connected and interact with your peers in digital university life.Atrium is a well-being informed digital platform. Designed to lower the friction in initiating social interactions between university peers. It creates an environment that conveys belonging and keeps you connected to the community, motivating students in their daily work and enabling moments for spontaneous and more natural online social interactions.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Crystallization is one of the most widely used purification and separation processes. Nevertheless, the initial step of the crystallization process, nucleation, is still poorly understood and highly stochastic. As a result, most crystallization processes lack fine control over the produced crystal properties. Non­ photochemical Laser Induced Nucleation is seen as a promising technique to optimize crystallization processes, by decreasing the induction time and potentially offering more control over crystal size, amount and morphology. However, as its underlying mechanism has not yet been unveiled its appli­ cation is still limited. Further study of the phenomenon is thus essential, yet limited by the stochastic nature of the process. Past research has been laborious and time­consuming, due to the substantial number of samples needed to attain statistical significance of the results. Microfluidics could offer a solution to this issue, since it allows for the study of copious amounts of independent samples in short time frames, whilst using less resources. In this study, a microfluidic system previously designed and validated within Eral Lab was further improved. Once improved, the system was used to study the effects of common NPLIN parameters such as supersaturation, laser intensity and laser wavelength on the nucleation probability in thousands of independent micro droplets. The experiments were performed using KCl solutions of both 1.05 and 1.10 supersaturation index and irradiated with light of three different wavelengths and four different laser intensities. Control cooling experiments were conducted to serve as a reference and measure the effectiveness of irradiation. Results indicated that, increasing the supersaturation increases the nucleation probability. However, small differences between both supersaturations were observed, potentially indicating a supersatura­ tion dependent laser intensity threshold. A threshold possibly explained by the Nanoparticle Heating model used to describe Non­photochemical Laser Induced Nucleation. Laser irradiation of 1.05 su­ persaturated solutions was seen to be effective with light of all colours at higher laser intensities (≥ 50 MW/cm2). In contrast, for 1.10 supersaturated solutions irradiation was, in most cases, already effective at lower laser intensities (≥ 25 MW/cm2). No significant wavelength effect was observed, besides irradiation with 355 nm light at higher laser intensities (≥ 50 MW/cm2) to be more effective on 1.10 supersaturated solutions. Further analysis of the data was done by investigating the ability of common nucleation models, such as the Classical Nucleation Theory and the Dielectric Polarization model, to describe the behaviour. Results of the Classical Nucleation Theory were highly uncertain due to a limited amount of data points at varying supersaturations. Yet, indicated a heterogeneous influence on the nucleation probability in both the control cooling and laser irradiation experiments. The Dielectric Polarization model was not able to properly describe the nucleation events observed in the experiments, as lability parameters calculated for the experiments were inconsistent with literature and suffered from significant errors.","Non­Photochemical laser induced nucleation; NPLIN; Laser; nucleation; Crystallization; Process intensification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-05-18","","","","Chemical Engineering","LightX: Light induced seed generation for industrial crystallization",""

In 2016, the Absorb GT1 (Abbott, USA) was approved by the FDA as the first bioresorbable stent (BRS), which further stimulated the research on degradable polymeric biomaterials. Polymeric BRS showed comparable characteristics as the most often used, drug-eluting stents (DES), with the added advantage of being fully biodegradable within two years. However, as several hurdles still need to be tackled, research to obtain the perfect BRS continues. A limited range of geometries and sizes influences the adaptation of the scaffold in a patient’s vessel, which subsequently affects the therapeutic outcome.

It presents novel information on Stereolithography (SLA) usability for the 3D printing of BRS and highlights the effects of structural and mechanical limitations, which are all inherent to the materials selection. Development and progress on specific capabilities have revealed and emphasized shortcomings in other domains. Fine-tuning the SLA printer settings and limitations, we were able to 3D print a 3 mm stent with promising morphological and mechanical characteristics. Future research and development should encompass all aspects of stent application, from manufacturing to deliverability, from functionality to solvability.","cardiovascular stent; stereolithography; layer thickness; 3D Printing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-05-18","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Biomaterials and Tissue Biomechanics","",""

They have been used in the field of cavity optomechanics for example in ground-state cooling, and in sensing applications, such as atomic resolution mass sensors. Their great sensitivity is due to their high Q-factor, which is a metric that shows how fast a system loses its energy. In ultra-high Q nanomechanical resonators, energy loss is limited to intrinsic and radiation losses, the latter is due to energy dissipation from the resonator into the substrate. Experiments have shown that the Q-factor of resonators with thin substrates are limited by radiation loss. However, the precise role of the substrate remains a topic that has not received much attention, but has significant implications for how we design nanomechanical microchips. Here we show that the resonator mode can couple to nearby substrate modes, which reduces the Q-factor. We found that the strength of this mode-coupling depends on the mode-shape of the substrate, with stronger coupling at anti-nodes of the mode-shape and hardly any coupling at the nodes. Furthermore, we show that clamping down the substrate with double-sided tape reduces the Q-factor of the resonators, this is explained by a reduction in Q of substrate modes due to the tape. Lastly, we found that in thin substrates, which have a higher density of modes, the Q-factor can be limited due to mode-coupling with the substrate. Our results demonstrate that the substrate choice, as it can strongly affect the Q-factor of resonators, should become an integral part of the resonator design phase. These results can likely be used by all types of nanomechanical resonators limited by radiation loss. We can use this knowledge to design chips with resonators that have an even higher Q-factor.","Mode-coupling; resonators; Substrate; Q-factor; nanomechanical","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-05-18","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Dynamics of Micro and Nano Systems","",""

The company is looking for new market opportunities and perceives the Corona outbreak as a potential trigger for behaviour change towards mobility and e-bikes. To find a relevant design direction for Bayck, information is gathered in four steps; First, the pre-pandemic mobility is discussed, then how it is affected by the pandemic. E-bike users are interviewed to understand the new use needs. Finally, future visions from different perspectives are discussed to find a relevant context in which Bayck can design a new product. From the analysis, it is concluded that the new Bayck product needs to be personal, enable multi-usage and invite the user to relax while going from A to B. The conclusions of the analysis are put together in a design brief. An ideation is performed to come up with a design direction fitting the design brief. To conclude the ideation phase, it is decided to design an e-bike that operates on a removable battery(-ies), also usable as a personal power-bank. A storyboard is drawn to depict the ideal use situation. The current Bayck model is taken apart to understand how an e-bike works and what should be integrated in the new design. The concept is toned down to a level of feasibility: Two batteries of 18V are required to enable the user to charge its devices, but also use the 36V e-bike motor. The challenge is made to simplify the e-bike as much as possible and separate the electronics as much as possible from the frame. The whole electronic system will be moved to the front of the bike to be as close as possible to the motor. This also enables the design to be mounted on the bike without modifying the frame. The concept is taken from idea to materialized product through a fish trap process. During the materialisation, a functional prototype is build to test the set up with two 18V batteries and the working of a new lock system. The fish trap process results in a material concept, in which the different components and their assembly are established.","E-bike; Concept Design; Mobility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

However, when states are locally entangled and then separated, errors arise during transportation of the qubits. This results in a lower amount of entanglement between the states. Thus, we need protocols that apply local operations on the qubits of the two separate parties to achieve higher entanglement. This is called entanglement concentration. We analyze two protocols that classically can be used for the extraction of randomness and apply it to the concentration of entanglement: Von Neumann’s protocol and Elias’s protocol. These protocols are well-described in the literature. We analyze the performance of the protocols on quantum computers with varying error rates. We find that Von Neumann’s protocol extracts entanglement similar to the theory on the best 5-qubit processor (Athens): there is an average percentage change in the concurrence when the protocol succeeds of 49.0%, which is close to the theoretical value of 52.5%. Elias’s protocol requires many more qubits than Von Neumann’s protocol. The only quantum computer large enough to run the protocol (Melbourne) has high error rates. Also, Elias’s protocol requires more operations. This results in higher errors when we execute the protocol on Melbourne. We execute the protocol with 2 initial states and find an average percentage decrease of the concurrence when the protocol succeeds of 72.6%. Thus, we find that Elias’s protocol is not suited to use in practice and the Von Neumann protocol can be used to extract entanglement with the best quantum processors used in this work.","Quantum Information; Entanglement; Quantum computation","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics | Quantum Technology","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The integration of Variable Renewable Energy Sources (VRES) creates challenges for meeting load demand. The lack of on-demand power generation of these VRES effectively threatens energy security. Therefore, storage facilities, especially hydrogen, have been broadly researched for potential implementation in our energy system, enabling on-demand power ""generation"". This thesis adds to this research by providing a framework on how VRES and long-term storage technologies can be most optimally utilized to ensure weekly or monthly energy security. This framework is explicitly applied to the Netherlands and reviews the opportunities of a VRES dominated future energy system. The framework consists of a VRES generation model and load model and identifies the optimal load coverage using single- and multi-objective genetic algorithms. The VRES generation model is designed for a weekly and monthly timeframe by using 31 years of available weather data (1988-2018), specifically average wind speeds and solar irradiance, for a number of locations in the Netherlands. Using the available weather data, power generation per MW of onshore wind, offshore wind, and solar PV are calculated. Subsequently, this calculated VRES power generation is compared to available real-world VRES power generation data and a correction factor is determined. Applying the correction factor to the more extensive weather data set allows to effectively create a VRES power generation model, based on the weather circumstances as in these 31 years. Additionally, a weekly and monthly 31-year load profile is determined, using available data for load demand in the Netherlands. Thereafter, both a single and multi-objective algorithm is tasked to provide load coverage in two main scenarios at minimum cost. First, load coverage is achieved exclusively utilizing VRES capacity. Secondly, a variety of long-term storage facilities are introduced in combination with VRES capacity to acquire energy security. Furthermore, these two methods for achieving energy security are restricted in a number of sub-scenarios, which represent the societal preference restrictions regarding VRES installations. <br/>Generally, energy security is most cost-effectively achieved utilizing long-term hydrogen storage facilities, as compared to an exclusive VRES approach. Specifically, alkaline electrolysis and hydrogen combined cycle gas turbines seem to be the most promising technologies to be applied for the hydrogen storage facility electrolysis and reconversion sub-steps respectively. Furthermore, societal preference has a significant effect on the total costs, increasing it considerably when offshore wind capacity is forcefully introduced in the VRES capacity mixture. Lastly, the timeframe considered for achieving energy security, either weekly or monthly, has a substantial effect on the total cost. The smaller weekly timeframe results in additional costs, as the long-term hydrogen storage facility, is utilized more broadly to meet load demand, increasing the capacity requirements for charging, discharging, and storage. Overall costs range between 139 and 211 billion Euros to achieve energy security using the more cost-effective long-term hydrogen storage approach, depending on the timeframe and societal constraints applied. <br/><br","Renewable Energy Sources; Netherlands; Long-Term Storage; Hydrogen; Optimization Problem","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

To gain more insight in this disease, obtaining more information about the shape, size and location of lacunes is essential. However, manual segmentation (the voxel-wise labeling of lacunes in a scan) can be very time-consuming. In this thesis, we optimize convolutional neural networks using different loss functions to automate the process of segmenting lacunes in full brain MRI scans. A set of 111 scans was used for development and a separate test set of 111 scans was used for evaluation. As lacunes are small, they generally occupy less than 0.02% of an MRI scan. This leads to an extreme data imbalance between lacune voxels and background voxels, which complicates the optimization process. We trained networks with the binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss, the weighted binary cross-entropy (WBCE) loss and the Dice loss. Additionally, we trained networks with two proposed adaptations of the Dice loss: Dice-ReLU loss and constrained Dice-ReLU (CDR) loss. Our experiments show that all losses except the BCE loss are able to cope with the data imbalance and learn to segment lacunes. The Dice-ReLU loss performs best on detection with a sensitivity of 0.79, but produces an excessive amount of false positives (FPs) with on average 26 per image. Adding a size constraint (the constrained Dice-ReLU loss) improves the number of FPs considerably to 11.52 FPs per image with a sensitivity of 0.70. The Dice loss has just 1.93 FPs per image, but reaches a detection sensitivity of only 0.43. However, the Dice loss obtains the best segmentation performance of the true positive (TP) elements with a Dice similarity coefficient score of 0.47. Compared to the Dice loss, the WBCE loss performs slightly less on FPs per image and TP-element-wise segmentation, but slightly better on sensitivity. We developed methods that were able to learn to segment lacunes. However, the data imbalance still influences the optimization process considerably, leading to methods that either focus too much on the foreground or too much on the background. Further work on developing a loss function that can cope better with this data imbalance could greatly improve lacune segmentation performance.","Lacunes of presumed vascular origin; Segmentation; Convolutional Neural Networks; Data imbalance; U-Net; Cerebral small vessel disease","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

These surgery methods have proven to greatly decrease bleeding, scar tissue, hospital time, and cost. The procedures involve the navigation of flexible instruments through tortuous anatomical pathways. To reduce chances of tissue damage it is desired to reduce the interaction with anatomical structures during the trajectory. To realize this aspect a so-called Follow-the-Leader (FTL) motion has been adapted as a design feature for medical devices. This motion allows for the shaft of the instrument to conform to the shape taken by its end-effector without relying on anatomical reaction forces. One strategy to achieve FTL motion is the so-called alternating advancement where two shafts subsequently switch from flexible to stiff in order to conserve the configuration of the shaft. These devices have been shown to possess relatively many degrees of freedom for a small number of actuators which can greatly reduce the cost of the device. A state-of-the-art analysis has shown that, despite the kinetic advantages, there are no alternating FTL devices that use pneumatically actuated shape locks to constrain the flexibility of the shaft. In this work an alternating FLT medical device with pneumatically actuated shape locks was designed, produced, and tested. The device has a diameter of 40 mm and nine degrees of freedom. The total bending angle is 90 degrees with a bending radius of 85 mm. The device leaves room for improvement but does show that two concentric shafts can be shape locked pneumatically to perform an alternating FTL motion.","Follow-the-leader; medical device; Pneumatic Actuator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

This project started with a literature study on shape memory polymers and 3D-printing. The material properties, different types of shape memory and different actuation methods were investigated, as well as different 3D-printing techniques and using shape memory polymers in 3D-printing. Existing applications and concepts using shape memory polymers, as well as recent studies in applying these materials were also investigated. In parallel to the literature study, testing was done on the influence of different parameters on the shape memory behaviour of one of the most common FDM 3D-printing materials: PLA. Through an iterative process, a test sample was designed which was used to test parameters related to material (different types of PLA), manufacturing (printing settings), and design (geometry and orientation of models). Knowledge gained through the literature research and testing was combined to create design guidelines for manufacturing shape memory objects using 3D-printing. To demonstrate how the shape memory capabilities of 3D-printed PLA could be applied in product design, A product concept was developed. With a vision as a starting point, ideation and concept development was started by first having a brainstorm session with different people to learn how people not involved with the project envisioned shape memory in product design. Moving on from this, useful results from this session were taken into an ideation phase, where a multitude of different ideas were thought up. From these ideas, four were chosen to be developed into concepts, of which one was chosen to be further developed into a physical prototype. The chosen concept was a wake-up light which uses the heat of the lightbulb inside the lamp to heat the shape memory material and initiate shape recovery, which resulted in the lamp gradually giving off more light. This would wake up the user in a natural way. The concept, which was given the name ‘’DAWN’’, was developed into a physical demonstrator, and the shape memory parts were printed based on the established guidelines. This also served as a test for the guidelines to see how they could be applied in the design process. After testing several printed prototype parts, a final design for the demonstrator was created and produced. At the end of the project, the process and results were evaluated and recommendations were given for further research into 3D-printing shape memory objects.","Shape Memory Polymer; 3D Printing; Guidelines; Wake-up light","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

A part of this field concerns the shape-shifting of sheets from flat configuration into a double curved configuration, requiring nonuniform strain among the sheet. This functionality can be used for various purposes, in different application fields. For example, shape-changing properties are increasingly used in tangible user interfaces. For activating these sheets, shape memory alloys (SMAs) lend themselves well. That is why multiple shape-shifting sheets that are activated with SMAs already exist. However, a new design is developed and explored in this thesis, in which SMA springs are used as compressive bendable actuators. This is different from the designs that are found in literature, and the distributed low bending stiffness could potentially lead to smoother shapes. The goal of the project is to create a SMA spring network that can deform out-of-plane into a specific shape and to explore possible applications. The idea is to prescribe this shape by prescribing the related nonuniform strain via controlling the springs individually. Through an iterative prototyping process such a network is developed. Flexures are included to impose the out-of-plane bending direction. Antagonist hoses are included to prevent these flexures from interacting with the springs and to draw the network back in plane upon cooling. In the final prototype, the shape of the network can be adjusted via binary activating the springs with Joule heating. More possible future applications of the network are explored through brainstorm sessions. In addition, a finite element model (FEM) is set-up to calculate the resulting shape upon an activation scheme. The important network parameters are tested and integrated in simple elements. The demonstrator can successfully deform out of plane into different shapes upon different activation schemes, although the shape control is low, and the overall shape not very smooth due to excessive local bending of the network struts. This could be diminished by increasing the bending stiffness of the struts. However, this would lead to less overall deflection as well. The control over the strains or the bending should be improved for enhanced shape control. To evaluate the FEM, the prototype is 3Dscanned and compared with the result of the FEM. There is a significant difference in the amount of deformation, which may be due to inaccuracies in the model or in the prototype. The validity of these should be improved before further evaluating the effectiveness of the simplified model.","Shape Memory Alloy; spring network; shape morphing","en","master thesis","","","","","","Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering and Integrated Product Design","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

However, the CO2 electrolysis in aqueous systems, due to the low solubility of CO2, are severely limited by mass transfer. State of the art review shows that a significant amount of the research is done to improve mass transfer, where a variety of electrolyser designs were studied. Despite the effort, the challenge to enhance mass transfer remains and is the focus of the present work. To improve mass transfer, an innovative concept is proposed - Taylor flow in an electrochemical flow cell. Taylor flow has been extensively studied in the literature, especially in micro channels and monolith reactors. Therefore the characteristics of the Taylor flow are known to a certain extent. But they were never tested in an electrochemical system. For that reason, a numerical investigation is carried out to assess the performance of Taylor flow on the flow cell. A simplified 2D model was formulated using a unit cell strategy and is verified based on experimental data and theoretical concepts. The effect of dissolving bubbles is also modelled using a quasi-steady-state analysis The results of the 2D model show a significant improvement in the performance, i.e. in the current densities of the electrochemical cell compared to a typical flow cell. The maximum calculated current densities increase by an order of magnitude under certain flow conditions. The dissolution studies showed that the current densities deteriorate with time. Nevertheless, the overall performance is still higher than the typical flow cell. Finally, based on the insights from the 2D model, a 1D model is suggested to estimate the current densities and dissolution rates. The present study showed promising results for using Taylor flow in an electrochemical cell. The proposed 2D model can help in aiding future modelling studies while the 1D model can give simple estimates for the experimental work.","Taylor bubble flow; CO2 electrolysis; Sustainabilty; Reactor Modelling; COMSOL Multiphysics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Chemical Engineering","",""

This technology allows for the extraction of energy from the water and soil by means of collectors, i.e. a system of pipes welded to the sheet piles. The fluid flowing through these pipes is directed to a heat pump after which the extracted energy can be used to heat buildings. Moreover, during summer, the system provides the opportunity to be used to cool homes by storing heat in the subsurface. The primary objective of a sheet pile wall is to assure stability of the quay and by giving the sheet pile wall an additional purpose, that of heat sink or source, previously not present thermal loads are applied to the wall. In this thesis the temperature change of the sheet pile wall and soil is investigated after which the deformation of the sheet pile wall is analysed in order to answer the main research question: 'Can the structural safety of a sheet pile quay be guaranteed when the sheet pile is thermally activated?'.<br/><br/>In the town of Zweth, part of the municipality of Rotterdam, an investigation into the performance and consequences of thermally activating a sheet pile wall was conducted in the form of a case study. A sheet pile wall with a width of approximately 7.5 meters and a depth of 15 meters was placed. Two sets of loops were welded on the sheet pile: loops running to the bottom of the wall and loops running to a depth of 3 meters. The influence on the surroundings of these separately investigated loops was monitored by means of thermistor strings. The deformation of the sheet pile was measured with inclinometers. This thesis starts with the analysis of the collected data from the field test. To investigate the long-term behaviour of the sheet pile wall two models are developed in this thesis: a heat conduction model and a geotechnical stability model. The former is a thermal calculation only and aims to model the temperature changes in the subsurface as well as the heat extraction. The latter consists of a time dependent Thermo-Hydro-Mechanical (THM) analysis in PLAXIS and used the sheet pile temperature determined in the heat conduction model as thermal boundary condition on the sheet pile. The resulting temperature change of the sheet pile and subsurface in combination with mechanical loads results in a deformation of the sheet pile. Using the data acquired in the field test, these two models are validated. With the help of the validated geotechnical stability model, the thermal component in the total distortion of the sheet pile is investigated. Finally, a calculation with with a time span of 4 years is performed to see the long-term reaction of the sheet pile wall. Based on this research the main question is answered.<br/><br/>In the Netherlands, soil temperatures below 6 meters of depth stays approximately 12 degrees Celsius all year. Above that, the soil temperature changes with the seasons, yet with a delay. The test ran in the autumn and winter and due to the time of the year, the soil at a few meters depth still had the summer heat stored while the soil close to the surface already started to cool down. The interpretation of the collected data started with recognizing from the thermistor string data that the soil in the quay adjacent to the canal is heavily influenced by the water temperature. Deeper down, the heat extraction is the only external influence. Investigations into heat extraction based on the numbers of loops activated showed that there was no linear relation between the concentration of activated loops and the soil temperature decrease. When twice as many loops were activated on the same sheet pile wall area, the soil temperature decrease was only slightly higher. The maximum deformation of the sheet pile wall oscillated throughout the testing period. No direct correlation between thermal activation and deformation was identified.<br/><br/>The validation of the heat conduction model showed that the the soil temperatures in the model were generally too low in the subsurface below 6 meters in the comparison between the in-situ measured temperatures and the numerically determined soil temperatures. The numerically approached temperatures in the quay adjacent to the canal were strongly influenced by the canal water temperature. So much that the heat extraction was barely visible in the data. This emphasizes the importance of good water temperature data. Moreover, part of the energy extracted is a result of the turbulent flow of the canal water parallel to the sheet pile wall. This is not simulated in the model yet important to add. Despite this, the numerically determined extracted heat and the measured heat showed a reasonably good fit.<br/><br/>The comparison of in-situ measured deformation of the sheet pile wall and the numerically approached deformation was in the same order of magnitude as the measured data. The influence of the thermal component on the distortion of the sheet pile was found to be small. During the calculation, the distortion slightly oscillated in the range of tens of millimetres which falls within the numerical accuracy of the model. The measured oscillation was assumed to be caused by changing water levels and soil saturation as well as measurement errors. To investigate the long-term reaction of a thermally activated sheet pile wall, three THM computations with a time span of 4 years were conducted: one without thermal activation, one with natural soil temperature regeneration during summer and one with forced regeneration by the energy sheet pile wall. All had a sinus-like course with an accumulating deformation over time which was intensified by the amount of influence of the energy sheet pile. The computation with the forced regeneration -- i.e. the most influence -- by the energy sheet pile wall ended with the largest amount of deformation which was 5 millimetres larger than the computation without thermal activation. Extrapolating the results, the maximum deformation was determined to be approximately 6 millimetres after 6 years.<br/><br/>The thermal load on the sheet pile wall is not a design parameter and is generally not investigated in detail. Therefore, it is strongly advised to conduct additional research. However, based on these findings, it is concluded that the deformation resulting from the thermal activation of a sheet pile wall is not excessively large. This means the primary objective of keeping the quay stable won't be compromised. This leads to the conclusion that the technology is safe to be applied on a large scale to decrease the carbon footprint and contribute to a more sustainable society without interfering with the quay's primary function.","Geotechnical Engineering; Sheet pile wall; geothermal heat extraction; Geothermal energy; Energy transition; Energy storage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-05-14","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

This thesis investigates how an elaborated form of formative PA can be implemented in the mathematics class to promote students’ achievement in mathematics. A mixed methods investigation at a third-grade mathematics class was conducted. For this investigation, a teacher’s guide and a student guideline were developed. The teacher’s guide helps the mathematics teacher in implementing PA in the class. The students’ guideline was developed to guide students doing online PA during distance learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Using this student guideline can require more effort for the teacher to monitor students’ participation and more effort for students to do elaborated online PA. Students were trained with the technique “two stars and a wish” for providing peer feedback. With this feedback technique, students could provide their peers with two reinforcing feedback and one suggestive feedback. The feedback has to first be written in their peer’s work and later be elaborated when the work is being returned. As a result of this investigation, implementing PA promoted students to interact and learn from one another during online distance learning. Evidence was found that by implementing PA, students were more involved in their learning process, and students’ achievement increased. PA can be used as an effective learning method for students. However, it is preferably for PA to be implemented during physical class, especially when it is implemented the first time.","Peer assessment; High school mathematics; Peer feedback; Elaborated feedback; Formative assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences | Science Education and Communication","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The objective of this project was to explore the context of gun violence in America using the Vision in Product (ViP) design process to identify and design an intervention that would help reduce gun violence in the United States. I began by investigating the vast nature of this domain to gain a bird’s-eye view and deeper understanding of this complex problem. Through my secondary research, I collected many relevant political, economic, socio-cultural, and technological factors that make up and influence my domain. Through the formation of my worldview, I identified that the root cause of government inaction on gun control is the financial influence of corporations and special interests groups, primarily the NRA, on politicians. I then identified the Progressive Movement, as a vehicle to counteract government inaction on gun reform, both directly and indirectly, and an opportunity for my design intervention to mobilize citizen participation supporting this cause. The Progressive Movement is a segment of the Democratic political party that aims to make the US government more responsive to the needs of the American people through widespread political reform. I formulated my vision statement for my design intervention and brainstormed possible solutions. My final concept is a web-based platform that connects Americans to Progressive volunteer opportunities, as a way to support the Progressive Movement’s efforts in reducing gun violence. I based my concept on five interviews with potential users, where I learned about personal barriers that prevent people from volunteering for political and societal causes. My concept was then validated with five additional users through prototype testing and a simulated volunteer activity to see how people would react to my platform and if they would use it. Through this validation research, my solution was able to successfully activate citizen participation. Too many innocent lives have been lost to gun violence, but US history shows that sometimes change must come from outside the government, from the people. That is why I feel that supporting the Progressive Movement’s efforts of reducing gun violence through grassroots participation is crucial. Through the Good Trouble platform, we have the opportunity to mobilize millions of Americans across the country to become active participants in the fight against gun violence in America. <br","Gun Violence; United States; Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

However, the implementation of NLFEA for the design of reinforced concrete structures is lagging behind as related uncertain- ties have not been quantified adequately yet. Multiple studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of modelling choices, which has led to the RTD1016 Dutch Guideline. This guideline enables a better quantification of the uncertainties related to NLFEA for the proposed solution strategy. In this research, a full probabilistic approach is applied to improve the quantification of uncertainties related to NLFEA, and thereby enhance its application for the design of reinforced concrete structures. In particular, to the ultimate limit state (ULS) of simply supported beams subjected to both ductile and brittle failure modes. To achieve this goal, 48 benchmark beams were selected from literature for calibration purposes. Material induced uncertainties of concrete and reinforcement were incorporated through an optimized Latin hypercube sampling strategy. The beams were modelled in a 2D plane in software program Diana based on a total strain crack model and Von Mises plasticity. A displacement-controlled analysis was performed to determine the numerical ultimate resistance. In total, 1104 analysis were performed of which the model uncertainty was quantified and the failure mode was determined by the ductility index. Based on this, a global reliability method was defined as a function of the failure mode. A comparison with existing reliability methods was made in terms of accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, a standalone multivariate non-parametric Bayesian network (NPBN) was developed that allows for extensive reliability assessment possibilities. The research has shown how a full probabilistic approach with benchmarking can be applied. A reliability method as a function of the failure mode was proposed that showed improved efficiency compared to existing reliability methods (GRF,PRF,ECOV). For a 50 year design lifetime, a mean unity check of 77% was attained for the ductile failure mode and 66% for the brittle failure mode. For specific types of concrete and reinforcement, even higher efficiency can be obtained by reduced coefficients of variation of the material parameters. Furthermore, a NPBN was constructed which describes the NLFEA behaviour of reinforced concrete beams. Additional research is necessary to improve the model application, but it has been demonstrated how such a model can be established and used for reliability assessment of reinforced concrete beams. The findings of this study suggest that the design of reinforced concrete beams by NLFEA can be applied for efficient design, while respecting safety standards. The full probabilistic approach enabled an improved quantification of the design resistance. Thereby, this research contributes to the implementation of NLFEA for the design of reinforced concrete structures.","Non-Linear Finite Element Analysis; Latin Hypercube Sampling; Reinforced concrete beams; Non-Parametric Bayesian network; Ductility index; Reliability Method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

As a result of the genomic instability and selection within this clonal population, additional mutations take place and allow for the differentiation of cell lineages. This tumor heterogeneity can be captured by doing clonality analysis which stratifies distinct tumor cell populations into groups, called subclones. The process of estimating the subclonal composition of a tumor requires intricate algorithmic approaches. Due to the growing popularity of clonality analysis, many tools have been made available for the reconstruction of subclonal architectures. The majority of the tools use next generation sequencing data to infer aspects of the subclonal composition and its dynamics. The vastness of available tools calls for an unbiased comparative method between them. Here a novel framework is presented to satisfy this requirement. By integrating a selection of available tools into this framework and testing their response to different simulated data, some of the tool qualities can be identified. The achieved results show this method is able to compare the PhyloWGS and DPClust tools using in silico generated tumor samples. Next to this, the framework is capable of analyzing real data.

(graduation committee); Taebi, B. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The jobs of the world population are increasingly threatened in a world filled with constant technological improvements, and automation of tasks by machinery and artificial intelligence. Substitution of labour by machines is not only occurring in blue-collar jobs (usually uniformed workers working in eg. manufacturing) but increasingly also in white-collar jobs (usually ‘suit-and-tie’ workers working in offices). The more labour-saving technology is created and deployed, the more jobs are made obsolete, possibly leading to technological unemployment. This problem is likely to be aggravated by research and policies that are concerned with the so-called 'productivity paradox' or 'Solow-paradox', as well as the 'cost disease', and that seek to avoid or remedy both by increasing labour productivity across-the-board, that is, in 'personal services' such as education, health care, research, and the arts as well as in the goods-producing economy. If this were feasible, how could technological unemployment be avoided? Another option, explored in this thesis, is to take a fresh look at these phenomena, by asking whether they really are a 'disease' or 'paradox', or simply a consequence of a (harmless) natural structural change that is taking place in society, namely, the growth of 'personal services' relative to the physical (goods-producing) economy. Inspired by the writings of William Baumol (1993, 2012), this thesis explains that it will be possible to avoid dramatic increases in unemployment, if the productivity gains that are achieved in the technologically progressive sector (that implements labour-saving technologies) are used to fund the creation of new work in the technologically stagnant sector, the sector that tends to have a lower labour productivity growth compared to the technologically progressive sector. According to Baumol (1993, 2012), it is not possible or not desirable to increase labour productivity in the stagnant sector in the same way as this happens in the progressive sector by for example replacing human beings with software, machines, and AI. It may not be possible because of the nature of work in the stagnant sector compared to the progressive sector and it may not be desirable because the quality of services may decrease (Baumol &amp; Wolff 1998). A case study involving the Netherlands and Germany, both of which are shown to suffer from the 'cost disease', was carried out to investigate whether the transfers of funds from the progressive to the stagnant sector is a realistic possibility. If resources are to be transferred from the progressive to the stagnant sector, the question arises how this could be realised. One possibility is investigated, namely, that governments implement profit taxation in the technologically progressive sector to collect the productivity gains in this sector and then use it to fund new work 7 in the technologically stagnant sector, including a public educational system. The conditions under which this solution is feasible was then investigated for the Netherlands and Germany, and concludes that Baumol’s (1993, 2012) solution to the cost disease could be realised if 50-70% of productivity gains in the progressive sector are used to fund work in the stagnant sector, and as long as the average wage rate in the stagnant sector is not consistently higher than the average wage rate in the progressive sector.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

To ensure a sustainable province in terms of both a liveable province as well as economic prosperity policy is set up by means of communicative rationality between all actors (commercial stakeholders, residents, consumers, etc.). In 2060 all our vehicles will run on electricity from sustainable production sources, such as solar and wind. We will travel less and more efficiently in part by improving spatial proximity to (social) functions. To aid this mobility transition, biofuel potentials will be optimized to phase out the existing infrastructural dependencies by 2040. After which a complete build down from all polluting mobility fuels will be put into action. This phase allows different actors to cultivate and experiment with sustainable waste–to– value connections between stakeholders by optimizing biofuel potentials from regional waste. To make this transition succeed, the mobility and fuel transition is brought on through the three pillars: 1. sustainable connections, 2. waste to value and 3. consumer patterns. Allowing for an integrative transition in line with the global move towards a circular economy and a more healthy and liveable environment. As a result of this transition the petroleum–industry leaves waste spaces that require transformation.

On smaller scales of O(10 km) wave-driven coastal inundation can be accurately predicted with advanced models such as XBeach (Roelvink et al., 2009), at already high computational costs. For larger scales, larger number of islands, for scenario modelling, and for implementation in early warning systems, computationally faster methods are needed. Reduced physics models, which neglect some of the processes (e.g. non-hydrostatic pressure gradient term and viscosity), are a potential solution. However, their accuracy and the best method to force them has not been established. In this research we propose a new methodology to model wave-driven flooding on coral reef-lined coasts. A look-up-table (LUT), composed of XBeach model runs, is combined with a reduced-physics model, SFINCS (Leijnse et al., 2021), to achieve high accuracy predictions at limited computational expense. The LUT consists of pre-run 1D XBeach simulations for several reef profiles from Scott et al. (2020), forced with different offshore wave and water level conditions. Wave conditions close to the shore as predicted by the LUT are used to force SFINCS which then simulates the wave runup, overtopping and flooding. These are forced in SFINCS using random wave timeseries from an interpolated parameterized wave spectrum following Athif (2020). The accuracy of the method is investigated for 6 distinctive cross-shore profiles from Scott et al. (2020), for two wave scenarios (gentle swell and stormy conditions). Results of complete XBeach simulations are compared to LUT-SFINCS simulations with different boundary forcing locations. The sensitivity analysis shows that the most optimal boundary location to initialize the SFINCS model is at a water depth of 0.5 m, shore-ward of the reef edge. Interpolation of the forcing conditions at the boundary is investigated with 9 different interpolation methods. Results reveal that the most accurate method to interpolate spectral parameters (the amount of high frequency wave energy, the amount of low frequency wave energy and the frequency peak of high frequency part of the spectrum) and wave setup at the boundary is the Inverse Distance Weighting method with a power of -2. Errors introduced by the interpolated parameterized boundary conditions lead to runup estimation errors of 10-20% on average with the maximal errors up to 60%. Simulating wave runup with XBeach LUT – SFINCS couple leads to about 50-times higher computational speed compared to the XBeach model simulating hydrodynamic processes along the entire reef profile.","Coastal hazards; computational modelling; Coral reefs; Flooding; Waves; XBeach; SFINCS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The goal of this study is to test the relative importance of typical RRI dimensions and their criteria in formal standard development processes, since it is not clear if the concepts of RRI are important to organisations (Stahl et al., 2017). In order to test the relative importance of RRI dimensions, core concepts and their applicability were explored in the context of standardisation through a series of semi-structured interview with NEN professionals. Subsequently, a questionnaire was administered among standardisation professionals at NEN. Respondents were asked to rank the relevant RRI criteria. A BWM analysis was performed to make pairwise comparisons between RRI criteria to calculate their overall weights. Results indicate that the diversity of participation, consensus and the role of information are considered most important, followed by the identification of standards’ impact. This suggests that adoption of standards requires a wide variety of participants relevant to the standards context to enable broad support. This is further supported by the need for consensus and openness to protect participants’ interests and increase trust in the process.

Depending on the latitude and local conditions, mudflats can be vegetated by salt marshes or by mangroves and play an important role in coastal evolution. Vegetated mudflats can create a remarkable sea defense and their high ecosystem value has been proven by various studies worldwide. In this study, the response of a vegetated mudflat under extreme hydrodynamic forcing is analysed using, as case study, a specific part of the Guyana coast at South America. The sediment dynamics of the Guyana coast are dominated by Amazon River plume that shifts northwards and travels along the coast of South America till the Orinoco River delta in Venezuela. Mudflats are quite wide reaching tens of kilometres in width because of the high supply of sediment by Amazon and the formation of mudbanks along the coast travelling northwards and then westwards. The hydrodynamic environment is relatively mild as Guyana is located far from the track of tropical hurricanes; however swell events can occur caused by the North Atlantic cyclones. Despite of its mild hydrodynamic environment, there are often cases of overtopping of the seawall along Guyana coast every year with a severe and characteristic one been held on October 2005. This was the motive for the mangrove restoration project of the study area in 2011 and for the initiation of this study. The purpose of this study is to analyze the response of a vegetated mudflat under extreme swell and storm events and investigate the impact of vegetation on this response. Furthermore, the impact of the extreme hydrodynamic event on probable damage of vegetation is tested presenting the complete interaction between hydrodynamics and vegetation. The study area is the area of Chateau Margot, southern of Georgetown, where a mangrove restoration project took place in 2011 by planting Avicennia Germinans mangroves and field measurements were applied in the end of 2019 by the researcher Üwe Best. Using the 1-D process based model Mflat, based on an open source Matlab code, a 3.5km portion of the mudflat extending offshore is modelled. Vegetation dynamics and its influence on the flow is part of the model, so a full interaction between hydrodynamics, sediment dynamics, vegetation and morphological evolution can be simulated, establishing a complete bio-geomorphological model. Using field measurements and literature data, the model is calibrated for hydrodynamic conditions and for the vegetation parameters giving a profile in equilibrium. A sensitivity analysis is applied to understand the behaviour of the model and the interaction between various hydrodynamic and sediment parameters and morphodynamics. After calibration, two extreme cases are tested in the model: an extreme storm that could be expected in Guyana coast and an extreme swell event based on the real case occured in October 2005. The Mflat model, after calibration, is able to reproduce a stable profile with mangrove vegetation similar to the observations. Vegetation appears to be quite effective in reducing the wave energy and thereby protecting the coast behind it during the extreme events, while in long term results in accretion of the landward part of the mudflat. The impact of the extreme hydrodynamic conditions on vegetation is difficult to be quantified, but for the extreme cases corresponding to the hydrodynamics of Guyana coast, vegetation is expected to be resilient enough having minor damages that could be restored in a short time period. The very mild slope of the coast is a factor that prevents the bed level of being highly dynamic contributing to the stability of the profile.","Mangroves; Mudflats; Guyana; Storm; Vegetation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","6.823356, -58.084983"

Estimated 1.8 billion people drink water from potentially sewage-contaminated sources and also the presence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in sewage has made the improper treatment of wastewater effluent an emerging problem. Iron electrocoagulation (Fe-EC) has shown to be successful in reducing pathogen concentration, although to different extent for types of pathogens. Besides, the water quality was found to be of influence on the effectiveness. This study therefore aimed to determine the removal mechanism for both bacteria and virus as well as assess the effect of wastewater components on the Fe-EC treatment process. EC experiments were conducted in an aerated beaker with a volume of 1L, continuously stirred. pH and current were kept stable at 7.5 and 200mA, respectively. The total charge dosage was 180 C/L. After electrolysis the samples were left to settle. Blank measurements were conducted in a 230 mg/L NaCl solution. Wastewater components were added in concentration of 4.0 mg/L for phosphate, 60 mg/L calcium, and 10 mg/L humic acids. E. coli WR1 and 휙X174 were used as indicator organisms. Contributing disinfection mechanisms for E. coli were inactivation and physical removal. During electrolysis a log removal of 3.8 log units was found, ascribed to inactivation. Further increase in removal to 6.0 log units was observed after settling. In the presence of TEMPOL only 0.3 log units removal were observed during electrolysis, but removal after settling still amounted 5.5 log units. For 휙X174 removal reactive species were not effective. Disinfection after settling equaled 4 log units, when settling was complete. Settling was found to be dependent on mixing conditions, and removal was correlated as well. Extended mixing promoted the formation of larger flocs and thereby enabled sweep flocculation for phage removal. Phosphate decreased attenuation of E. coli either for inactivation, 2.0 log units as for physical removal, 4.7 log units. Phosphate has high affinity for iron and competes with bacteria for iron surface. Calcium as well inhibited abatement of E. coli. Inactivation only amounted for 1.4 log units and removal after settling equaled 2.1 log units. Calcium is expected to complex bacteria surface, increasing repulsive forces between E. coli and iron. The effect of carbonate was only seen during electrolysis, 1.3 log units. The formation of the carbonate radical is suggested as explanation for the decrease in effectiveness. The effect of NOM on E. coli attenuation was unclear. Inactivation was inhibited to only 1.4 log units, but no effect was found on the total removal. Therefore, it can be concluded that NOM does not successfully compete with bacteria for iron surface. 휙X174 attenuation was not effected by addition of phosphate, calcium, or carbonate. On the other hand, the addition of NOM inhibited phage removal, only 0.6 log units in comparison to 4.0 log units for the blank. Adsorption of NOM onto iron surface is expected to negatively change the surface charge, inhibiting association between iron and virus.","Electrocoagulation; Faecal indicator organisms; Wastewater; Disinfection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Governing water motion, suspended sediment transport and bed evolution equations had to be rederived from the underlying balances, where the tidal inlets are prescribed by M2 forcing, and the bedload transport is primarily due to the slope gradient. The equilibrium solutions are determined by an asymptotic expansion in a small parameter and applying a temporal Fourier series up to the leading order term. From this, a solvable system of six partial differential equations is derived. Using finite-difference discretization, this system of partial differential equations is turned into a discrete lexicographically ordered system of nonlinear constraints. The Newton-Rapsons method is used in a newly developed code to be able to produce morphodynamical equilibrium solutions. When the cross-sectional discretization contains only one interior point, the solutions are in accordance with the cross-sectional model. In particular, the more complex bifurcation structure arises after variation of the tidal phase, amplitude and inlet depth. This strengthens the recent findings of complex bifurcation structures. These width-averaged equilibria seem to stay accurate equilibria in the cross-sectional expanded model even for the more complex behaviour. The question of these equilibria are stable cannot be answered as firmly as some unexplained behaviour arose during the analysis of the eigenvalues. However, these results hint that the width-averaged equilibria remain stable until the width of the channel is half its length. Further research is needed to prove this.","Morphodynamic equilibrium; Tidal inlet system","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

They can be divided into two categories; body-powered and externally powered prostheses. The advantage of body-powered prostheses is that they provide feedback to the user. The advantage of externally powered prostheses is the low operating force required to control the prosthesis. To reduce rejection rates of upper limb prostheses control, cosmetics and comfort should be improved. To improve control, a design was proposed integrating proprioceptive force feedback into an externally powered upper limb prosthesis with a haptic interface placed on the scapula. However, the cosmetics and comfort are to be improved. The goal of this study is to design a haptic force feedback system that meets the demands regarding comfort and cosmetics. Method Design requirements and mechanical requirements are set. A conceptual design was made using SolidWorks and a prototype was built. The proposed prototype was tested on a test bench to evaluate the overall system. It was analyzed whether the design met the pre-set requirements and the results were compared to other devices. Results The designed haptic device is made out of an anchoring system, pneumatic artificial muscle (PAM), and a distance sensor. The total weight of the system is 41푔 for the anchoring system and PAM, and 29푔 for the distance sensor. The dimensions are 50푥25푥120푚푚. The maximum pressure for the actuator is 3푏푎푟.

Conclusion This study presents a new design for a haptic interface to provide proprioceptive force feedback for an upper limb prosthesis. It is an improvement in cosmetics and comfort, while still meeting the mechanical requirements.

A case study at the Shell Netherlands Refinery","Schaefer, Wietse (TU Delft Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering)","Vlugt, T.J.H. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The thesis discusses how alternative heat generation for furnaces can be implemented on the Shell Netherlands Refinery to become CO2 neutral by 2050 or sooner. The research analyses the current knowledge, and future alternatives for furnace heat generation and underlines the need for alternative solutions with net-zero emission impact. Furnaces are the equipment that heat process streams before the reactor or distillation column. Hydrogen firing, electrification, biofuel combustion, and heat pumps are the four main topics of alternative technologies that are discussed. The result is a roadmap including all relevant information for the applicability of technologies, developments, value drivers and credible scenarios. Revamping all Pernis’ fired heaters for hydrogen firing is a suitable option and has TRL 6. The ultra-low NOx burners are operational, but hydrogen is not integrated yet as a fuel, and combustion analysers are not field-tested. The blue hydrogen will not be 100% pure, so not all CO2 can be abated. Besides, switching between RFG and hydrogen can cause flame instabilities and a higher thermal NOx emission. The normalised CO2 abatement price against RFG operation, the cost of not emitting a tonne of CO2, is 13 /tCO2. Electrification, such as impedance and immersion heaters, have TRL 7 and are limited to relatively small duties, single-phase, and clean service. Radiant heaters can heat process streams with two-phase and coking services having TRL 2. The concept is proven, but no prototype is tested. Electrical heaters have high efficiencies and might have a yield benefit. However, the showstopper is the plot space availability of the refinery. The normalised CO2 abatement price against RFG operation for electrical heaters is 21 /tCO2. Upgrading biofuel to biomethane allows the gas to be interchangeable with natural gas. Suitable for combustion without any adjustment on the furnace if biomethane is injected into the national natural gas grid. Biomethane combustion, having TRL 7, only impacts the sites emission, and it seems to be an administrative solution, where trading in certificates will be dominating the market. The normalised CO2 abatement price against RFG operation for biomethane is 21 /tCO2. Heat pumps are used in refineries, and they can be used to reduce the furnace load but not to replace the furnace. The potential for replacing fired heaters with TRL 7 heat pumps is low since the maximum operating temperature is 160°C [1]. The development scenarios showing the energy consumption expects that low carbon-intense electricity will expand most, suggesting that electrification is the step forward for SNR. The usage and production of hydrogen tend to increase after 2050, and the amount of biomass is small and will most probably not be an available option for Pernis. Four credible scenarios show that it is possible to abate sufficient CO2. With electrification only, it is impossible to achieve the vision of 2050 due to the plot space constraint. The hydrogen and electrification scenarios are combined in a hybrid scenario, where most CO2 is abated. The net-zero CO2 operation of furnaces requires significant investments and technical developments.","Furnace; Hydrogen; Fired heater; Electrical heater; Biomethane","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-05-11","","","","","",""

(mentor); Wahl, S.A. (graduation committee); Weissbrodt, D.G. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Medium chain length polyhydroxyalkanoate (mcl-PHA) is a form of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) which has properties similar to rubber. However, most of the research on mcl-PHA has been focused on pure cultures with artificial substrates, both of which increase the cost of the production to economically unviable levels. This is especially the case since the biological and the chemical production are very cheap. To reduce the costs, a mixed culture could be used. By investigating which conditions lead to high mcl-PHA production with a mixed culture, a step can be taken towards an economically viable biodegradable rubber replacement. To develop a culture which was able to produce mcl-PHA, an enrichment was first performed in a sequential batch reactor with a feast-famine regime to select for PHA producers. Additional selection pressures like substrate selection, pH, oxygen flow rate and time between carbon source addition and nitrogen source addition were imposed on the culture. After the culture reached pseudo-steady state, an accumulation was done. The substrate was one of the most important selection pressures. Using octanoate as sole carbon and energy source, the microbial community was successfully enriched in a feast-famine regime with the capacity to produce mcl-PHA. The use of octanoate with a pH of 7 and no reduced oxygen flow resulted in mcl-PHA weight percentages of 27 wt% polyhydroxyoctanoate (PHO) and 5 wt% polyhydroxyhexanoate (PHH) during the cycle. This was raised to 30 wt% PHO and 10 wt% PHH during the accumulation. During the second enrichment, the carbon source, and the oxygen flow of the first enrichment were maintained, but the pH was increased to 8. This led to an increase in mcl-PHA production, to 33 wt% PHO and 7 wt% PHH during the cycle and 44 wt% PHO and 9 wt% PHH during the accumulation. Two other condition changes were also investigated: lowered oxygen flow and uncoupling the system. For the lowered oxygen flow, the oxygen flow rate was reduced to 5% of the original flow rate and the increased pH of 8 of the second enrichment was kept. This resulted in similar values as the enrichment with only increased pH. It is therefore unclear whether the lowered oxygen flow rate could be attributed to the high mcl-PHA production or that the culture performed well despite the lowered oxygen flow. The uncoupled system was a system where the nitrogen source was added 2 hours after addition of the carbon source. Based on the oxygen profile and preliminary results of the enrichment, the culture mainly grew after the addition of carbon and little mcl-PHA was produced. However, scl-PHA production was quite high, with a total of 51 wt% PHB. This work proves that high levels of mcl-PHA could be produced from mixed cultures. This is a good step towards producing an economically viable, biodegradable rubber replacement.","mcl-PHA; Rubber; Mixed Culture; Sequential batch reactor; Fed-batch","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Life Science and Technology (LST)","",""

For this model tests have been done in the wave flume of the laboratory of Hydraulic Engineering at Delft University of Technology. This has resulted in a design formula that can be used for a first estimation of the maximum scour depth in front of sloping coastal structures where bed-load transport is dominant. Parameters that are used in determining this depth are the number of waves, the incident significant wave height, the relative water depth and the reflection coefficient of the structure.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","To produce accurate 3D fluvial architecture models, it is important to understand the influence of internally generated autogenic controls versus externally generated allogenic controls. When studying a fluvial system, autogenic controls such as river meandering and avulsions generally dominate over 103-104 years. Allogenic controls such as climate change and tectonics dominate more at time scales of 105-106 years. A dominant control is astronomical climate change that may produce cyclical fluvial sedimentary successions. The resulting alluvial architecture of autogenic and of allogenic forcing is highly different and it is expected to largely influence geothermal flow through fluvial reservoirs. The aim of this research is to depict the impact of allogenic (cyclical) versus autogenic (non-cyclical) fluvial sedimentation on geothermal flow. Process-imitating and stochastic based modelling software Flumy is used to generate fluvial facies models where either hypothetical cyclical forcing or hypothetical non-cyclical forcing was the dominant force. These models are subsequently tested for geothermal flow using DARTS (Delft Advanced Terra Simulator). We find that the Flumy numerical model can be used to produce hypothetical cyclical and hypothetical non-cyclical alluvial architecture. The main difference between the architectures is the shape of the sand bodies. The cyclical model has overall thicker, laterally wider sand bodies. The non-cyclical model has thinner, less wide, but more often connecting sand bodies. Geothermal flow modelling shows that matching N/G in the cyclical and non-cyclical model in the 20-40 % N/G range gives similar pressures at a constant, fixed water rate. This points to the hypothesis that, at comparable N/G, the well connectivity must also be similar. The non-cyclical model breakthrough times in the 20-30 % N/G range are generally equal or slower, compared to the cyclical model. This gives credence to the hypothesis that the cyclical model has overall equal or slower flow paths between the well connections in the geothermal doublet. The difference in flow path hypothesis can be properly tested through visualizing 3D streamlines and is a recommendation for the future.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

To transition to a circular economy, eco-industrial parks (EIPs) are needed. The problem is that developing EIPs is not easy. Many industrial parks aiming to become more sustainable and transform into EIPs have failed. In the Netherlands, industrial symbiosis, which is the most important aspect of EIPs, is not common. However, some EIPs in the country have successfully implemented industrial symbiosis and utility sharing activities. Studying what these successful EIPs have done to implement utility sharing and industrial symbiosis activities is relevant to understand what can be done in other EIP developments to increase their likelihood of success. The literature revealed some gaps that need to be addressed regarding EIPs. There is little literature on EIPs in the Netherlands, and most of the existent literature regarding the success factors and barriers to creating synergies in the Netherlands is old. Besides, there is no literature on some EIPs. This study fills the gaps by updating what is happening at three front-running EIPs in the Netherlands and what are the success factors and barriers that played a role in the implementation of synergies. Therefore, the main research question for this study is: What are the main factors that influence the implementation of industrial symbiosis and utility sharing in front-running eco-industrial parks in the Netherlands?Three successful parks in terms of industrial symbiosis and utility sharing were studied using the framework of Eilering &amp; Vermeulen (2004) to answer this question.

However, most improvements are mainly focused on gait performance. Hereby, other tasks are overlooked. This is also stated by AFO- users. AFO-users want an AFO that can be adjusted to suit dierent tasks. An adjustable AFO should allow adjustments for dierent shoes, and improve performance of tasks such as walking slopes, standing up/sitting down. Furthermore, a small, lightweight and durable solution is desired. Aim: The aim of this study is to design and develop a hinge-mechanism for an ankle-foot orthosis that increases versatility and ease of use among AFO-users. Problem Analysis: By talking to an AFO specialist and an AFO-user, insights are gathered that help establish the functional requirements and design specifications. This led to two main functional requirements. The first one is being able to easily adjust the alignment angle of the AFO. The second requirement is being able to lock and unlock the mechanism. This will allow the user to have more angular freedom in the ankle joint. Conceptual Design: To come to a proper design, an overview was made of mechanisms that could fit in the design of the hinge. Using criteria, each mechanism was evaluated and a final design had been chosen. The push-out gear mechanism was chosen to adjust the alignment. For the locking mechanism the locking pin was chosen. Concept Development: During the design process, the mechanism was iteratively improved. The locking mechanism was replaced by a rotating wedge, and the geometry of the mechanism was adjusted to be able to handle the loads. In the end, the mechanism was fabricated which demanded further changes in the design. The housing was 3D-printed, while other parts where laser-cut or turned on a lathe. Evaluation: The final product was evaluated by the same AFO-user and specialist who gave advice at the beginning of this study. Furthermore the design was experimentally tested on holding torque using a load test. Lastly the design specifications were compared to the actual design. Conclusion: In this study, an AFO hinge mechanism was designed and built that increases versatility and easy of use among AFO-users. This was achieved by two mechanisms. A pull-out gear allows to quickly adjust the alignment angle. This allows easy adjustment for wearing different shoes. A rotating wedge mechanism accommodates the (un)locking of the mechanism. Although there are still some improvements to be made, the prototype worked as expected. Also, the prototype was able to bear the load which was set at the beginning of the research. To see its true potential, the mechanism should be fitted inside an AFO. Although this mechanism looks promising, hands-on experience will really tell the added value of an adjustable hinge mechanism.","ankle-foot; orthosis; AFO; hinge; mechanism; alignment; unlocking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

To achieve this goal, a mix of sustainable sources will have to be utilised, in which wind energy plays a crucial role. Offshore wind has been growing in popularity within this market, as the onshore market is becoming more and more cramped, but remains a relatively expensive energy source partly due to the high monopile installation costs. To obtain the cost reduction associated with the greater sailing speed of floating installation vessel, compared to the currently used jack-up vessels, a simple, versatile concept to stabilise an upending tool relative to the monopile’s tip is presented to be used in conjunction with a motion compensated gripper. The concept utilises four independently controlled tuglines, of which two diagonal, a quick-connector and a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) to stabilise the position of the main block. This setup does not require any major vessel changes, is scalable and does not require complex lifting operations. To support the design, a viability study was conducted in Simscape to model the controller, cable sag, cable elongation and the response of a floating installation vessel for a numerically found irregular wave pattern of the North Sea. Using a displacement limit of 0.5 m, the workability was found to equal 0.78, exceeding that of the motion compensated gripper (0.72).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the surgical accuracy of positioning CTACs in patients receiving either total hip arthroplasty (THA) revision or tumor resection surgery, using a novel 3D analyzing technique. Method This retrospective cohort study included 35 patients (27 tumor and 8 THA revision cases), between February 2017 and March 2021. All patients received a CTAC. The planned and achieved implant position were assessed by means of a developed semi-automatic 3D-CT assessment method. The primary outcomes were the cup angles described as inclination, anteversion and cup rotation, and the translation of center of rotation (COR), pubic flange, ischial flange and ilium flange in three planes. Results The mean deviation, between planned and achieved, in inclination was 0.5° (SD: 3.9°), in anteversion 1.2° (SD: 6.1°) and in cup rotation 0.6° (SD: 3.2°). The mean deviation in COR in the sagittal plane was -0.8 mm (SD: 3.2), in the coronal plane -0.4 mm (SD: 6.3) and in the axial plane 0,6 mm (SD: 6,1).

(graduation committee); Price, R.A. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","For organisations, the capability to exploit data for innovation efforts has already become imperative to their survival in an ever more competitive market. However, many organisations are currently still struggling with how, where and when to use data science for innovative purposes. The consulting industry is a significant driver for the development of such knowledge for organisations. In addition, in the past decades, consultants have adopted design thinking as a practice to support client's innovation efforts. The digital consultant firm (DCF) provides professional services to connect the enterprises' business strategy with implementation across digital fields, including design innovation and data science. Based on initial research, the collaboration between data scientists and designers is found to be an issue. This is problematic, considering the importance of data for their enterprise client's innovation efforts. Is the DCF able to achieve synergy between data science and its current design innovation approach, or is polarity simple to large? This thesis aims to explore and design practical support for digital consulting firms to integrate data science in their current design innovation approach. This is done by answering two research questions: (1) how can digital consulting firms integrate data science in design innovation? (2) how can this data-design integration be facilitated in digital consulting firms? To answer these questions, a design science research approach in the information systems is taken. Based on empirical research, including two collaborative workshops between the DCF's data scientist and designers, two significant findings are drafted. First, data-informed design is a viable opportunity for the DCF to use data science in design innovation client projects. However, a lack of cross-functional learning and a lack of cross-functional decision-making constrain the DCF from exploiting this opportunity. In addition to integrating the two teams, this results in missed revenue and a risk of high overhead costs. The firm is argued to facilitate the data-design integration by using a person-to-person knowledge strategy to tackle this challenge. The firm should institutionalise an internal alignment meeting before proposals are shared with the client. This meeting aims to support the data and design team's decision-makers with drafting viable proposals, increase the number of collaborative projects. In addition, a framework for interdisciplinary decision making is designed to support the person-to-person knowledge transfer to the decision-makers. Using a newly proposed method, job prototyping, a new role in the organisation is iteratively developed together with employees. The final concept is validation during an actual internal alignment meeting with the DCF's data and design decision-makers and a potential job-holder. The firm should create a new position in the organisation, 'the data design lead'. This person serves as a hinge between the two teams and aims to transfer his knowledge by acting as a sparring partner during the internal alignment meeting. In addition, a set of guidelines are designed to increase the impact of this new role on the data-design integration. The research findings provide a strategic and viable direction for digital consulting firms to facilitate data science integration in their design innovation process.","data science; design innovation; consulting; information system","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://www.sketch.com/s/eb60568a-455b-4310-a0f7-3ec85c617509/a/rbGbQ2K/play Clickable app - Data design innovation","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

In order to meet the climate goals set by the IMO, to reduce GHG emissions by 50% in 2050, alternative fuels are being investigated. Methanol is an alternative fuels with great potential. Methanol can be produced completely carbon neutral from biomass or captured CO<sub>2</sub>, contains no sulphur, can be stored in liquid form at atmospheric pressure and temperature and can be used in both fuel cells and combustion engines. There are currently no yachts sailing on methanol but methanol has already been implemented in several other ships. Both yacht builders and owners show interest in the implementation of methanol. Since it is unclear which alternative fuel will become the standard on the long term in the yachting industry, it is of interest to also investigate the impact over a longer period of time or of several pathways. Previous research is limited to emissions and costs related to alternative fuels on a limited range of ship types which do not include yachts. The impact of methanol on the design, emissions and costs is still largely unknown for yachts. In order to determine this impact, the properties of methanol, rules &amp; regulations regarding methanol, design impact of the storage of methanol, environmental impact of using methanol and the impact on costs are investigated. To determine this impact for several yachts, a tool has been developed which can be used from the early design stages. The tool uses the properties of a yacht to determine power and fuel volume requirements for the implementation of methanol. It also determines the available volume in the yacht for methanol storage in a basic tank arrangement. Together these form the properties of the yacht with the implementation of methanol. From these properties, the emissions and costs are determined and then combined in a pathway analysis to determine differences in impact of several future pathways. The results show that using methanol generally has a positive impact on emissions, compared to a diesel yacht. Methanol offers SO<sub>x</sub> free emissions, a reduction of PM emissions and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions equal to that of diesel without the necessity of after treatment. CO<sub>2</sub> emissions slightly increase with fossil methanol but can be net zero with renewable methanol. The impact of methanol on converter and storage costs is considered negligible compared to a diesel yacht. Fuel costs of fossil methanol are slightly higher than fossil diesel, renewable methanol fuel costs are lower than renewable diesel and 5 times higher than fossil methanol. The impact of methanol on the design is relatively large. Compared to diesel, approximately 2.3 times the amount of fuel is required for an equal range. The double bottom is not a feasible location for methanol tanks. A significant amount of interior area is occupied by the fuel tanks and the surrounding cofferdams. Therefore retrofitting existing yachts with methanol is not considered feasible. For new designs, methanol is considered a feasible option.<br","Superyachts; Yacht design; Alternative fuels; Methanol; Zero emissions; Pathways","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Variations in the production process of fiber-reinforced composite (FRC)materials often influence the material properties of the end product more substantially than their metallic counterparts. It can be valuable for the structural performance and reliability to have a better estimation of the properties of the FRC after production. Detecting these material properties is often performed by intrusive or destructive testing, which are not desirable for in-situ applications. Samples are commonly taken from the material for mechanical testing and material characterization in the laboratory. Feasibility of a non-destructive in-situ assessment method based on ultrasonic guided waves for estimation of the material properties of FRCs, e.g. stiffness in different directions, is investigated in this research. A portable and easy-to- apply measurement system is proposed that can also be less sensitive to the environmental conditions. Point-contact transducers containing a piezoelectric material are utilized for measuring guided waves that propagate through the material. The dispersion characteristics, i.e. phase speed and group speed, of these guided waves are dependent on the layup of the fibers, thickness, and ply properties. Information about the group speed from multiple directions are extracted and compared with the group speeds obtained using a semi-analytical method. A genetic algorithm (GA) is implemented to minimize the difference between the measured and modeled group speeds and obtain the ply properties. The methodology was applied to five glass FRC laminates with different layups. In the numerically simulated case, the error in the estimated material properties turned out to be less than 12%. The coefficient of variation in the experimental results of stiffness values was also less than 20%. The results suggest that the proposed combination of point contact transducers, analysis of group speeds, and GA optimization procedure can potentially form a viable approach for in-situ assessment of material properties of FRCs.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Hydromechanics","",""

Smart home solutions used to be for early adopters who like the novel and fun part of this new technology. Currently the smart Home market is moving to mainstream users. Hombli is a smart home brand established in 2019 in the Netherlands. The initial goal of Hombli is to address this mainstream market. They want to make smart home accessible to everyone, by offering a simple and affordable smart home solution. An analysis of the smart home market show that most smart home brands claim to offer a simple solution. Most brands also have another special focus in which they set their brand apart from the rest. The strong competition in the smart home market requires a stronger brand position for Hombli to stand out from the other brands. The new focus on the wellbeing of the user by providing “a carefree live with Hombli” is a promising new direction for Hombli. It is a unique direction in the smart home market and fits the current product portfolio. Users can create this carefree life by automating their Hombli devices using smart scenarios. However, a survey filled in by 149 current Hombli users show that only 23% say that creating scenarios is easy. Of these people 39% do not use scenarios at all. Besides these current Hombli users, also people without experience with smart home devices were analyzed using sensitizing booklets with daily assignments. The participants described their routines and used smart Hombli devices. This experiment showed that it is hard to come up with ideas for smart scenarios and that the process of adding new scenarios is difficult for some people. To make the new mission of Hombli possible, all users should be able to create scenarios that can improve their wellbeing. Therefore, the design goal for this project is to help Hombli users with little technical experience, to feel guided and in control when they add smart scenarios, so they can automate their routines. Three concepts are developed to explore different ways to create scenarios. These concepts are turned into prototypes and evaluated. The results of these user-tests can be summarized in three aspects: - Control: The user should have a clear overview of the scenarios, be able to control important settings in an easy way and scenarios should be visible at the device page. - Comfort: The design of the app should be calm, the user should feel guided through the different steps and should be able to get help when it does not understand something. - Convenience: The app should provide example scenarios which offer clear benefits to the wellbeing can be added conveniently to the app of the user. The final design combines these three requirements in one single experience. User tests of this final design show that people get inspired by the example scenario in the app and start thinking of different ways to automate their smart home devices. With this new app, Hombli can set itself apart as a brand that not just sells connected devices but cares about the wellbeing of their customers. Besides validation with users, the new app is also validated on feasibility for the company. Because developing a brand-new app from scratch requires a big investment, a better strategy is needed. The current app is based on the Tuya platform. Talks with Tuya developers explain the possibilities in changing the current app to create quick first steps in improving the experience in the current app by adding an extra section in the app with example scenarios. In a later stage, device panels can be improved to match the panels of the final design concept. After these short-term steps, Hombli should invest in developing their own services to create added functionalities to adapt to the evolving smart home market. New communication standards are in development that will make it possible to control smart devices from different brands using the same standard. The long-term strategy ensures Hombli will deliver a unique experience to users that value wellbeing by offering a carefree life with smart automations for every connected device at home.","Smart Home; app; Wellbeing; Automation; iot; design; Interaction; strategy; Roadmap","en","master thesis","","","","","","This is a combined graduation project of the masters Strategic Product Design and Design for Interaction","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Essers, T.T.W. (graduation committee); Slingerland, M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Electrochromic materials exhibit a reversible color change that is triggered by an applied voltage. Controlled color change, low voltage operation and the memory effect are three unique material properties defining electrochromic materials. As a result of an electron transfer or redox reaction, the material is able to switch between its bleached (transparent) and colored state. As this color change is a chemical reaction, it only requires an applied voltage to trigger and complete the electron transfer, thus afterwards the applied potential can be removed and the material will stay in its current state; i.e. the memory effect. Electrochromic materials are processed into a sandwich structure of thin layers that enable it to change color when a voltage is applied to it; i.e. an electrochromic device (ECD). An ECD operates through two electrodes that are connected to both the positive and negative of the voltage-source, and the two electrochromic layers. These electrochromic layers are separated by an electrolyte, that allows ion transfer, enabling change of color. Optimizing this layer structure, results into the definition of four stacking sequences, based on their vertical or co-planar stacking sequence (i.e. vertical stacking of the EC layers or merging of both EC layers in the same layer with separated electrodes) combined with the substrate used; conductive and insulating. These four stacking sequences are characterized on their transparency, shape/pattern changing abilities, coloring, design of the images displayed and interaction between the two EC layers; i.e. technical characterization. As result of this material characterization, ‘the puzzle of electrochromism’ is designed. ‘The puzzle of electrochromism is an edge-matching puzzle, with as goal to puzzle four geometric shapes by matching the sides of the adjacent puzzle pieces. Solving this puzzle communicates the goal of the demonstrator (i.e. the technical and experiential characterizations) to the puzzler, while emphasizing the simplicity and possibilities of integrating electrochromic materials in design. The ultimate goal is to inspire the puzzle to make use of electrochromic materials in their product designs, through exiting creativity and curiosity. When a puzzle piece is connected to the framework, a closed loop circuit is created between the voltage source and the coin cell battery, thus the puzzle piece will change its color. When the polarity is reversed (i.e. the puzzle piece is turned 180 degrees within the horizontal plane), it immediately switches from its primary EC layer to its secondary EC layer or vice versa. All primary EC layers will form the first puzzle to be created and all secondary EC layers the secondary puzzle. Meaning, ‘the puzzle of electrochromism’ is not just one puzzle, but includes two different puzzles. Besides the controlled color change, the other unique material properties it demonstrates are: low voltage operation, memory effect, simplicity and transparency. All individual puzzle pieces represent a different stacking sequence, through which the shape/pattern change (i.e. single and double image display), coloring (i.e. immediate and color flow), design of the images displayed (i.e. isolated and linked) and interaction between the two EC layers (i.e. overlap, connection and separation) are demonstrated. In the end, ‘the puzzle of electrochromism’ is a demonstrator making electrochromism easy understood, explainable and approachable for designers to use within their product designs; i.e. the aim of this thesis. On top of this, it is not only a good demonstrator but also a good puzzle according to the ten puzzle principles of Shell (2008).","Electrochromism; Electrochromic materials; Smart materials; Puzzle; Material Driven Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

This is considered less as a way to save energy, but to permit the use of such a drone from a ship not capable of safely retrieving it. One novel component of this idea is to use the wind updraft created by the motion of a ship or natural air currents as the wind source for an on-board turbine generator. The second component is to use the existing drive system as the on-board turbine in a 'hybrid rotor' design to reduce the need for extra parts and complexity. This report analyzes the potential for such a system compared to a more intuitive airborne solar system, and to the combination of both concepts. While indefinite flight time is paramount, the goal is to maximize the ""mission"" time to charge/idle time ratio. The process for determining fitness is a simulation of the aircraft flying on its mission and charging when needed (and if possible) for a full year for varying designs of aircraft and rotor. The results of all the tests show that the main idea is infeasible because not enough energy can be generated from the inefficient propeller and the updrafts are insufficient and inconsistent. The alternatives of solar and combined power systems function better but are still subject to high failure rates. The most promising system is to use a separate turbine and propeller and also include solar panels to achieve the most effectiveness both when in powered flight and while charging. This constitutes a compromise on the 'hybrid rotor' part of the idea. The conclusion of this report is that further improvements to the design and control of the most successful configuration are possible could result in a fully functional system.","Drone; Range Improvement; soaring; static; Solar; Turbine; updraft; Endurance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-04-01","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","Never landing drone",""

Due to the irregular motion of a vessel on the waves the accuracy and efficiency of the rock dumping process is limited. This thesis develops a motion compensation system for a modular Fall-Pipe system developed by Vuyk Engneering. From literature it appears motion compensation on a semi-submerged system is a novel application. Therefore the approach taken in this thesis is to establish a working motion compensation system based on broadly used methods. This results in selection of the Newton-Euler method for modelling the dynamics of the system and the selection of an LQR controller for feedback control. A proof of concept is performed on a 2D representation of the system. This proves the controller type and modelling method are both applicable to the problem and yield satisfactory results. Furthermore a baseline can be established from which to expand and improve. The full system dynamics are then modelled and simulated. Following this simulation it is observed that the performance of the motion compensation system is limited by the first order movement of the vessel, the inertia of the Fall-Pipe and the hydrodynamic forces acting on the system. An improved feedforward controller, which aims to retain the Fall-Pipe tip position, is applied in conjunction with a tuned LQR controller. The final motion compensation system eliminates the second order movement of the vessel and attenuates the first order movement to retain the Fall-Pipe tip position within 0.5 meters of the desired trajectory. This ensures the position of the Fall-Pipe at all times, therefore the material cost and time required to ensure a proper rock bed is decreased.","Fall-Pipe; Motion Compensation; LQR; Newton-Euler","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Specifically, Voronoi cellular structures with different randomness are adopted and used as cellular structure of the LCCCs. the mechanical properties of the developed LCCCs are investigated by experimental and numerical methods. With the help of 3D printing technique, LCCCs are prepared with two mixtures: a reference mortar, denoted as REF and mortar incorporating microencapsulated phase change materials (mPCMs), denoted as PCM14. Mechanical properties of developed structures are first investigated. The compressive behaviour of the LCCCs is investigated at the age of 28 days. In general, the LCCCs show anisotropic compressive behaviour in two loading directions: the compressive strength and stiffness of the LCCCs in the out-of-plane direction is substantially higher than that of the in-plane direction. Comparing to conventional foam concrete with the same density, the out-of-plane compressive strength of the LCCCs is higher than commonly reported cases in literature. Due to the high porosity of the cellular structures, the compressive strength of the LCCCs is significantly reduced comparing to the corresponding constituent materials, as expected. In addition, this strength reduction of the LCCCs made with PCM14 is substantially lower than the that of the REF samples. Interestingly, the relative stiffness (measured stiffness of the LCCCs normalized by their porosity) of the mPCMs incorporated LCCCs is even higher than the constituent material E-modulus. Furthermore, the critical role of air voids on the compressive behaviour of the LCCCs is identified. The thermal conductivity of the LCCCs is investigated by numerical models using commercial software Abaqus and ANSYS. It is found that the thermal conductivity of the LCCCs is comparable with the conventional foam concrete of the same density. The geometry heterogeneity of the LCCCs has a minor effect on determining the thermal conductivity of the LCCCs. Moreover, increasing porosity or reducing thermal bridge on the heat transfer direction can dramatically improve the thermal insulation performance of the LCCCs. It is found that the natural convection of the air within the cellular pores and the radiation has less notable effect on the thermal conductivity of specimen. Comparing to the REF, PCM14 has enhanced thermal insulation performance. In the end, using extrusion-based 3D concrete printing technique, the LCCCs with mPCMs has been successfully printed as an implement of manufacturing LCCCs as a construction-scale brick. In general, the developed LCCCs have high porosity gives good insulation properties as well as good compressive strength. This gives them great potential to be used as novel lightweight thermal insulation materials for construction.","cementitious materials; architected cellular materials; 3D printing; phase change materials","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

A wellknown example of this are hydrazine and its derivatives which are toxic, corrosive, and carcinogenic. These disadvantages have led to a search for less hazardous storable liquid propellants, often referred to as green propellants. A green propellant is safer to use and handle and will therefore bring down the costs related to production, storage and handling. The main reason for the use of hydrazine is its hypergolicity with common oxidizers like NTO and nitric acid. Hypergolicity is the property that a fuel and oxidizer ignite spontaneously when brought in contact without the need for an external source. This property is beneficial since it eliminates the need for an ignition system, thereby making the propulsion system more simple, reliable, and cheaper. It is therefore desired that a replacement propellant also shows this property with common oxidizers.<br/>During this thesis two methods are explored with the goal of creating a green hypergolic propellant combination. One based on catalytically enhanced ethanol and high concentration hydrogen peroxide. The other based on a pyrophoric liquid that is added to ethanol. There have already been efforts made before by adding catalyst particles or a strong reducer to a hydrocarbon fuel like kerosene or ethanol. The problem with using catalyst or strong reducer particles is the difficulty of creating a homogeneous mixture. Due to the liquid nature of the parent fuel, the particles will start to separate from the fuel and sink to the bottom of the container. To overcome this problem an organic gelling agent is added to the fuel to increase its viscosity, thereby increasing the sedimentation time. This will not only increase the shelf life of the fuel but also decrease the vapor pressure, making it less flammable and safer to work with, and reduce storage problems like propellant sloshing and spilling. Increasing the viscosity also makes it more difficult to transfer the fuel through the feed system and achieve proper atomization. However, by applying shear force on the fuel it shows shear thinning behavior, decreasing the viscosity close to that of the parent properties making it easy to use in existing propulsion systems designed for liquids. A second effect of the organic gelling agent is that due to its energetic nature it participates in the combustion. Therefore, the amount of catalyst needed can be reduced to a negligible amount while still achieving good performance properties like ignition delay time. This is verified by means of a drop test.<br/>As a second approach, instead of adding solid catalyst particles a pyrophoric liquid is added to ethanol. A liquid allows for easier mixing and creating of a homogeneous mixture resulting in a longer shelf life compared to using catalyst particles. The pyrophoric liquid also fully participates in combustion resulting in increased performance compared to catalyst particles that do not combust. Due to the reactive nature of the pyrophoric liquid this propellant formulation is expected to be able to achieve hypergolicity with multiple common oxidizers. This results in a versatile system which can be used in current propulsion systems without extensive modification required. By eliminating the need for an ignition system, the propulsion system is simplified and its reliability is increased.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-04","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The Linear Boltzmann Transport Equation is specifically adjusted for proton transport and forms the Fokker-Planck approximation. The Fokker-Planck approximation models proton transport. Only the continuous slowing down operator, the straggling operator and a source are considered in the approximation. Numerical analysis is performed to solve the Fokker-Planck approximation. The discretization of the energy domain is done with the Discontinuous Galerkin method, and ray-tracing of beams in the spatial domain is done with the Crank-Nicolson method. A minimum least squares objective function is introduced to find the optimal selection of beam angles. The gradient descent method is applied to find a local minimum of the objective function. The gradient is calculated by performing adjoint transport of protons. Adjoint transport is based on an adjoint source, which is changing every iteration based on the dose deposition. The dose deposition is computed using forward transport of protons and uses the newest optimization variables. This way, several iterations can be performed.","Radiotherapy; Adjoint transport; Beam angle selection; Fokker-Planck Approximation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","",""

FWAVs that are capable of controllable flight are reported in literature, though a theoretical background of the aerodynamic performance of different attitude control mechanisms is absent in literature and the robustness of attitude control mechanisms with respect to body motions is oftentimes omitted. The aim of this thesis is to develop a theoretical framework for the aerodynamic response of flapping wings that includes variation of attitude control parameters and motion of the vehicle body. This framework can be used to assist in research into new attitude control mechanisms for FWAVs that are not yet capable of attitude control, such as the compliant Atalanta FWAV. Analytical aerodynamic and kinematic descriptions are combined to analyze the aerodynamic performance of two suggested attitude control mechanisms: stroke amplitude variations and control of the angle of attack by means of pitching stiffness variations. It is shown in this research that both mechanisms have a significant influence on the lift production of a flapping wing, though this influence changes significantly when body motions are introduced. It is found that variations of the stroke amplitude provide the most predictable variations in lift for all cases of body motion that were considered, provided that the wing’s pitching hinge stiffness is high enough to ensure stable flapping kinematics under the influence of body motion.","Flapping-Wing Air Vehicles; Flapping-Wing Aerodynamics; Attitude Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | High-Tech Engineering","",""

(mentor); Timmermans, Jos (graduation committee); de Vries, Annick (graduation committee); Hulscher, Suzanne (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In 2011, Adaptive Delta Management (ADM) was introduced in the Dutch Delta Program as a policy development method to incorporate uncertainty in decision making transparently. Currently, little is known over the functioning of ADM in practice, while this is determining its success. The study explores the application of ADM in Dutch practice. Starting from the scientific foundation of ADM is being researched how ADM is shaped in practice using interviews with actors on the strategy level and the implementation level. The results are analyzed to explore what they mean for the adaptiveness of coping with sea-level rise by Dutch delta management. The research shows that the application of the greater part of the instruments of Adaptive Delta Management (ADM) is not coherent with how they should be applied according to theory. The first difference observed is that adaptation pathway maps in practice are far simpler than prescribed in theory; they only contain the preferential strategy instead of multiple strategies, and no signposts and transfer stations are defined. Secondly, adaptation tipping points are more flexible in practice than is prescribed in theory. The final difference observed is that evaluating strategies in practice has a fixed rhythm, while according to theory, continuous evaluation and recalibration should occur whenever new information comes available. The main implication of these differences is that ADM in practice provides less guidance to policymakers on when and which adjustments of strategies are needed than in theory. Based on the analysis of the similarities and differences between theory and practice, the research found that currently, the governance of ADM in practice in the Netherlands does not enhance adaptation to sea-level rise. The study stresses the importance of taking action to keep the Netherlands safe from sea-level rise now and in the future. Therefore, several recommendations inspired by the theoretical foundation of ADM are proposed to ensure adaptation to sea-level rise is enhanced. The first recommendation aims to ensure that policymakers get insight into the solution space to cope with sea-level rise and understand what measures need to be taken today to keep the long-term solutions open. Furthermore, actors involved in the implementation of strategies (such as regional water authorities, municipalities and water utility companies) should obtain insight into the possible consequences of sea-level rise for their area and know how to incorporate this in decision making.","Adaptive Delta Management; adaptive policies; instruments; institutions; adaptation pathways; multi-level governance; sea-level rise","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

(mentor); Czechowski, A.T. (graduation committee); Jonker, C.M. (graduation committee); Wang, M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Optimization of traffic signal control has been widely investigated by means of model-based strategies. In 2012 a new model-based controller was published, named Schedule-driven Intersection Control (SCHIC). This controller uses a job-scheduling algorithm to minimize the cumulative delay for all observed vehicles. The algorithms of SCHIC are at the basis of the commercially deployed controller SURTRAC. This means that SCHIC is partly used in real-world traffic situations and its algorithms are well documented. Therefore, it was possible to reproduce this controller in this thesis. Previous literature often evaluated SCHIC in simplified scenarios with (1) unrealistically large look-ahead times for vehicle detection. Secondly, (2) in most scenarios all approaching vehicles were restricted to request a single turning-movement at the intersection thereby removing inter-phase uncertainty (as explained directly below). Inter-phase uncertainty occurs when the chosen entry-lane of a vehicle determines the green phase that it requires from the traffic light controller. So, inter-phase uncertainty occurs under the following two conditions. Condition 1 – an approaching vehicle must eventually choose between different entry-lanes, with each entry-lane being associated to a different turning-movement at the intersection. Condition 2 – each of these individual entry-lanes is serviced during a different and competing green phase. For example, inter-phase uncertainty occurs when two competing green phases service either the straight-ahead or the left-turning entry-lane. The aim of this thesis is to evaluate SCHIC with both (1) realistic look-ahead times and (2) inter-phase uncertainty, since these two uncertainties are often not found in previous literature, however, they are commonly found in reality. Thus, it is not directly clear how the reported results would translate to more realistic settings, which include these two common uncertainties. In this study SCHIC is re-implemented and evaluated on a typical Dutch urban intersection located in The Hague. The lane dimensions of this intersection determine the look-ahead times as used in this thesis. For this study, a new method is introduced to reduce inter-phase uncertainty which is inspired by lane change prediction modules for automated driving. This method, Lane Change Prediction (LCP), makes use of e.g. radar-equipment in order to observe: (1) the driving style of each approaching vehicle and (2) the upcoming traffic state on each reachable entry-lane. Based on these two observations a classification model, i.e. a Random Forest, predicts the desired entry-lane before the vehicle actually enters it. This thesis researches whether the potentially higher accuracy of LCP will improve SCHICs performance as compared to its simpler statistical baselines, fixed-label and split-vehicles, which could have a lower accuracy. All traffic scenarios are simulated with Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO). Two popular driver-models are evaluated which determine the dynamic behaviour of the vehicles in simulation, i.e. the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) and Krauss driver-model. The results showed that despite its higher accuracy, LCP does not significantly improve SCHICs performance over its baseline methods fixed-label and split-vehicles. Furthermore, the maximum theoretical performance gain of using LCP is evaluated with perfect predictions (Oracle). When applying perfect predictions, the average speed of all vehicles increased by 0.65% and 0.51% for the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) and Krauss driver-model, respectively. The average number of stops per vehicle was reduced by 1.53% and 1.12% for the IDM and Krauss driver-model, respectively. Overall, it is concluded that the performance potential of all methods, i.e. the {Oracle, split-vehicles, fixed-label and LCP}, is quite comparable on SCHICs traffic flow. These methods show some performance potential, however, their confidence intervals are relatively wide which draws them closer to each other. In our scenario, the intersection in The Hague, another method might increase SCHICs traffic flow more significantly.","lane change manoeuvre; lane change prediction; intersection control; schedule-driven intersection control; lane change; traffic light control; traffic light","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","","52.104056, 4.317254"
