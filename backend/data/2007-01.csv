(mentor)","2007","The fuel composition of the Generation IV 600 MWth 'efficient' Gas Cooled Fast Reactor (GCFR) that realizes zero breeding gain without using fertile blankets is determined. The analysis includes all the stages of the nuclear fuel cycle, including irradiation, reprocessing and fuel fabrication. The time-dependent multiplication factor, reactor safety parameters, and decay heat production for different fuel compositions are simulated using the deterministic SCALE 4.4 code. The depletion equation and the 1-D transport equation are solved for multiple timesteps during reactor irradiation. It is seen that adding a small percentage of minor actinides (MA) to a mixture of uranium- and plutonium carbide favors the creation of a closed fuel cycle with zero breeding gain. Furthermore, addition of MA increases the burnup potential of the fuel, extending its feasible irradiation time from 40 to 90 MWd / kg, due to the transmutation of Np-237 to fissionable Pu-238 and Am-241 to fissionable Am-242. Mixing MA negatively affects safety parameters by decreasing the delayed neutron fraction, decreasing the negative Doppler feedback and increasing the positive reactivity introduced when the reactor is depressurized. However, the magnitude of the delayed neutron fraction is comparable to existing fast reactors. Worths of individual isotopes are introduced as a value of their contribution to the core reactivity. Throughout the fuel cycle, the time-dependence of the isotopic and total worth of the fuel is determined. Zero breeding gain is achieved when the initial total worth of the fuel stays constant for multiple cycle burnup. The effect of different reprocessing strategies on the closed fuel cycle is shown. Research confirms that when there are no reprocessing losses, depleted uranium can be used during the recycling step to replace fission products and obtain a new critical fuel composition.","gas cooled fast reactor; generation iv; nuclear reactor; minor actinides; decay heat production","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Applied Sciences, Geo-Database Management Center","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Radiation, Science and Technology","","","",""

(mentor)","2007","Progressive collapse is a collapse where local failure leads to a disproportionate collapse. Due to a focus on ease of erection in the construction process and more and more optimisation of design through advanced analysis techniques buildings are believed to have become more vulnerable to loads outside the design envelope over the past decades and are thus more vulnerable to progressive collapse. When a building is subjected to local failure the load resisting behaviour is quite different than the behaviour considered in conventional linear elastic design. To design a building resistant to progressive collapse in a cost efficient and aesthetically attractive way consideration of these non-linear effects is required. The purpose of this research is to investigate structural non-linear behaviour of building structures and develop design rules or strategies to economically design building structures resistant to progressive collapse. Focus is on RC structures in static loading conditions. In order to do this first the progressive collapse phenomenon itself was considered. Three design approaches were distinguished: the event control approach aimed at improving the level of protection of a building, the specific local resistance approach aimed at increasing the hardness of a building and the alternate load path approach which aims at improving the robustness of building. The latter approach has been elaborated. Alternate load paths can be developed roughly in four manners. By arch action, suspension action, Vierendeel action and catenary action. Ductility of the structure and its connections is important to enable these alternate load paths. For arch and catenary action special detailing of structural ties is needed, especially catenary action depends highly on the elongation capacity of these ties. When Vierendeel action occurs, redistribution of internal moments is an important effect. This effect relies highly on the ductility of the RC structure. To assess the effect of non-linear effects numerical determination of limit loads was performed for a case study. Three non-linear effects creating an overcapacity compared to linear assessment were distinguished in the case study: strain hardening of the reinforcement steel, moment redistribution and occurrence of torsional moments in hollow core slabs.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","","",""

(mentor); Hummels, C.C.M. (mentor)","2007","This master thesis shows the design process of LINKX, a language toy for children with a disorder in the spectrum of autism. Children with autism have an inborn brain disorder and therefore play and learn differently than children with 'typical' development. Language and speech of children with autism develops slowly or not at all. These children's 'different being' indicates a need for different toys. Main goal of this project was to design a toy that stimulates language development in a playful way. Insight in how autistic children play and learn was mainly gained by high involvement throughout the whole process of autistic children, their parents, and their pedagogues. These children: Beer, Robbert and Jakob, played a leading role in this process. I observed them at home, at school, and at speech therapy, and interviewed their parents and pedagogues. Exploration resulted in a design framework for autistic children in which control, direct feedback, rewards, repetition, and memory, are important elements. After this exploration I realized that already within these three children there was much variation in needs. For example, the language development stage, in which children differed. A found similarity was that all children have trouble with giving meaning to words. Therefore they should learn to word objects in their environment. With this framework in mind, ideas were generated. The idea with most potential regarding interaction was chosen and evaluated with parents. Their opinions contributed in further concept development and eventually led to LINKX, the final design of this project. This design aims for a connection on three levels: motor, cognitive, and emotional. On motor level children literally link play-elements together and thereby receive a visual and audio reward. On cognitive level, the children are triggered to link an object with a word. On emotional level LINKX aims to connect parent and child by providing a way to play together. LINKX is elaborated into an experiential prototype and tested in several play-sessions with the participating children. Parents took on the role of co-researcher, because they are expert on their child's behaviour and feelings. The child's play served as reference for evaluation, both for me as for the parents. In general the children enjoyed playing with LINKX. They laughed and repeatedly linked elements to hear the sound and let it move. The characteristics described in the framework seemed to be true. Especially when the prototype did not function as expected, the importance of 'giving sense of control' was evident. For the future I hope that my framework can inform and inspire other designers to develop more toys that facilitate the learning process of children with autism. With growing technological possibilities, technique can help these children learn more, and thereby let them be more able to cope with life.","design; autism; language; toy; children","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Industrial Design Engineering, Design for Interaction","","","","","","","","Industrial Design Engineering","","","","",""

Calo, Residual-based multiscale turbulence modeling, PhD thesis, Stanford University, 2004] devised the so-called residual-based variational multiscale (RB-VMS) formulation for large-eddy simulation, that uses both the scale separation and the coupling terms in the variational multiscale equations. Using arguments from traditional stabilized methods, an approximation for the unresolved part of the solution was constructed and substituted into the resolved-scale coupling terms to obtain a closed system of equations. The resulting formulation was implemented within a ?nite-volume method, and showed promising results. In order to understand if the basic RBVMS formulation and Calo’s approximation for the unresolved scales was transferable to other discretization techniques, an incompressible RBVMS method has been implemented. The method gives results which are at least as good as the more conventional large-eddy simulation methods with which it was compared. However, the unresolved-scale approximation, which constitutes a signi?cant part of the computational work, was seen to produce no better results than those obtained with traditional residual scaling. It was concluded that unresolved-scale approximation still has shortcomings, but that the residual-based approach is a promising method for the future.","Multiscale methods; Large eddy simulation; Stabilized finite elements","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-01-17","Aerospace Engineering","Engineering Mechanics","","","",""

Nearly 40% of the fuel consumption of a truck is due to aerodynamic drag, this means that aerodynamic improvements are certainly useful. A large aerodynamic drag component of a truck is due to suction at the base. Already in 1933 K. Frey did experiments to reduce the base drag of bluff bodies by the use of so called guiding vanes. He obtained drag reductions of nearly 50% by two dimensional experiments. In this projects it has been investigated by computational fluid dynamics and wind tunnel testing if it is possible to gain base drag reduction by guiding vanes on a three dimensional truck like wind tunnel model. A simplified and integrated tractor-trailer geometry has been used to examine the base drag mechanism and to implement the guiding vanes. Around this geometry a hybrid grid is created and the Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations are used solve the ow pattern. They are most cost effective for this engineering research and practical to use.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""

(mentor)","2007","In the southeast of the city of New Orleans, in St. Bernard Parish lies a coastal defensive area, which is formed by a primary dike, a secondary dike and a transitory wetland area in the middle. During Hurricane Katrina on the 29th of August 2005, a huge storm surge from the east overtopped and destroyed large sections of the primary dike. The surge continued through the wetland overtopping the secondary dikes and flooded large parts of St. Bernard Parish. The flooding killed over a hundred people and made many homeless. The coastal defensive system at St. Bernard Parish is very well comparable with the concept of ComCoast COMbined functions in coastal defence zones. This is a European project, which develops and demonstrates alternative solutions for flood protection in coastal areas. One of its main solutions is to use a wide coastal defence zone, containing a transitional area between an overtopping resistant primary dike and a lower protective secondary dike. The transitional zone will be a buffer for the storm surge and will be an area suitable for multipurpose use, with great opportunities for both man and nature. This Master Thesis analyses the failure of the St. Bernard Parish coastal defence system. Subsequently, it develops spatial integrated solutions for the coastal defence zone, using the coastal defensive strategies, which follow from the ComCoast-concept. Additionally, the effects of wetlands on a storm surge are investigated by means of an analytical analysis and a numerical model. It was concluded that catastrophic failure of the coastal defence system could have been prevented if the primary dike was not partly constructed of poorly non cohesive materials. Some basic constructional calculations and a quick study on environmental impacts made clear that the ComCoast alternatives; Overtopping resistant dike and Foreshore recharge, offer the most suitable solutions for the St. Bernard Parish area. The study on the effect of wetlands on a storm surge showed that it can both lead to a decrease, as an increase of the eventual storm surge height at the dike. The analytical and numerical approach has increased the understanding of the hydraulic behaviour of the system.","","en","master thesis","TU Delft; Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, section Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor)","2007","In order to protect the area inside the coastal flood defend system, the height of a sea dike should be sufficient. Huge sea dikes with revetment protection which are made from traditional hard material such as block concretes or big rock has given good results. However they are quite costly to implement and materials are not always available. In order to reduce total cost, the traditional revetment could be replaced by cheaper materials. A combination between hard and soft materials is a good alternative solution. In a number of tropical countries Vetiver grass (Vetiveria zizanioides) is well-known as bioengineering species in stabilizing inner slopes, reducing run-off and controlling soil loss. Recently, it has been planted on outer slope as sea dike protection. However the understanding of the processes and properties between waves and Vetiver grasses are still limited. In this research Vetiver grass is investigated as outer slope protection in order to reduce wave overtopping discharges. In consequence sea dike crest can be reduced. Beside it, this research also focuses on addressing the hydraulic effects of flow and Vetiver hedges. Physical model is conducted full-scale of Vetiver grass and wave parameters in front of the hedge. Mature Vetiver grasses are used for testing and wave is simulated by dam-break method. Experimental results have shown that resistance between flow and Vetiver hedge depends on grass density. In this research, Mannings coefficient is used to describe the resistance; it varies with the changing of flow depth. One interested characteristic of Vetiver grasses showed in this experiment is that its ability to withstand flow of backwater which reaches depths up to nearly 0.4m. The reduction of wave overtopping of more than 60% is measured. The roughness coefficient of Vetiver grass that depends on grass density is found to be varying between 0.33 and 0.41. An example with the use of Vetiver grass on a sea dike in Vietnam is worked out, by use of the results from the physical model. This example shows that a reduction of 0.5m of the crest height is feasible for upgrading the present sea dike in Nam Dinh, Vietnam. It corresponds with a reduction of 12,6% of the costs in case of two Vetiver hedges are planted on the outer slope. This case shows that Vetiver grass is a good solution for sea dike in order to reduce wave run-up on the outer slop and decreases the cost for upgrading sea dike.","","en","master thesis","TU Delft; Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, section Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

The development of concrete armour units in time led to various individual types and forms with specific individual characteristics. One of the latest developments of concrete armour layer units is the Xbloc® unit by Delta Marine Consultants (DMC). The primary objective of this thesis is to investigate and validate the study of the placement of the Xbloc unit specifically on a curved section of the breakwater using a large scale model test. Xbloc unit are placed on a breakwater slope row by row starting from bottom. Then the placement will be continued to another new row above until the units are completely covering the whole slope of the breakwater. Placement of the Xbloc unit on a straight section is quite straight forward with a constant relation between the surrounding units. The relations are based on the horizontal distances to the other unit in the same row and the distance to the unit upslope on the next row above. With a correct placement distances a required packing density and the interlocking effect between the units can be achieved. However, the relations of the distances are not applicable for a curved section of a breakwater. A curved section of a breakwater has a difference in radius length further upslope. The differences in radius lengths create improper placement distances between the units in the higher upslope. The horizontal distance between the two units becoming smaller and very close to each other. Eventually one unit has to be left out. The calculation of the packing density are also differs from the method used to calculate for the unit on a straight section. Hence, a new method was used to calculate the packing density for the breakwater curved section. The relations of the unit placement distances on a breakwater curve have been studied by ten Oever in his MSc thesis in 2006. A theoretically study are made and was validated by a placement tests on a model of a breakwater straight section. From the study, a computer model was developed to generate an optimal design grid position to place the Xbloc unit on a breakwater slope. ten Oever suggested a new unit are place off centre with an angle when the horizontal distances on the row below are becoming closer and closer. The off centre distance will be based on the horizontal distances between the two units. The maximum off centre distance are 0.4D and the unit will be left out. The angle is called the unit adjust angle and to be 450 from the horizontal line. Hence, this thesis focuses on validating the design placement grid generated by the computer model. Two placement tests have been performed using a model of a quarter of a breakwater head. The first test was performed following the generated design grid from the computer model. The output result of the final Xbloc position from the first placement tests was generally can be achieved according to the design grid with some distortion. The distortions of the units are mostly on the upper part of the breakwater slope especially in the row above where there is a left out unit. Furthermore, the packing density was 3% lower than the required theoretical packing density. In accordance to the first placement test, the second placement test was made to further improve the placement of the Xbloc unit. The second test is performed by correcting the design grid by using a coherent judgement before placing a new unit. Judgments are made by visually looking to the overview of the units in surrounding to ensure the new unit are placed in a suitable position for better fit between the two base units. The packing density resulted in higher values. Most of the units after the row where there is a left out unit are placed with a lower upslope distances than the design grid. The gap resulted from the left out unit are also being reduced when the unit a placed with a lower upslope distances. In conclusion, the placement quality can be improved by lowering the upslope distances in the computer algorithm for generating the optimal design grid. This could possibly be done by changing the parameters of maximal off centre distance to 0.3D and unit adjust angle in the order of 300 to 400. A comparison of the placement made in the laboratory and the placement of the prototype unit from the breakwater project in Port Oriel are made. Although a direct comparison could not be made in accordance to the relations between the placement grids, nevertheless there are several conclusions that can be drawn from the placement made in Port Oriel. The placement of the units in the Port Oriel was denser than the placement of the model units in the laboratory. This is mainly due to the larger forces on the edges of the units and due to the use of the excavator which actively pushed the units into a tight placement pattern. This is not done in the laboratory as the placements made are based on the use of a crane. Denser placement is acceptable for the stability of the armour layer but it leads to higher concrete use on the breakwater head.","concrete armour; placement test; scale model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""
