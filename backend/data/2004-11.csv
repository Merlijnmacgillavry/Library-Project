(mentor); Molenaar, W. (mentor); van Baars, S. (mentor); Galjaard, J.C. (mentor)","2004","Voor de geplande uitbreiding van de Rotterdamse haven, de Tweede Maasvlakte, wordt in totaal 1000 hectare haventerrein en tien kilometer kademuur gerealiseerd. Naar verwachting omvat de eerste realisatiefase de aanleg van twee kilometer kademuur die geschikt moet zijn voor het aan- en afmeren van Ultra Large Container Ships (ULCS) met een capaciteit van 12.500 TEU. Dergelijke schepen vereisen kademuren met een kerende hoogte van circa 28 m. De ontwerplevensduur van de kademuren is gesteld op 50 jaar. Van Hattum en Blankevoort, een dochteronderneming van bouwconcern Volker Wessels, stelt zich ten doel deze kademuren te realiseren op basis van een qua aanleg- en onderhoudskosten optimaal kademuur-ontwerp. Een parameteranalyse is uitgevoerd om inzicht te krijgen hoe de constructie-, omgevings-, en uitvoeringsparameters het ontwerp beloeden. Vier kademuurconcepten zijn geanalyseerd, de: - Prefab L-wand, - Ontlastvloerconstructie, - Elementenwand, - Verankerde diepwand De hoek van inwendige wrijving van het zand, de wandwrijvingshoek, de terreinbelastingen en het verval over de constructie zijn belangrijke parameters met betrekking tot de dimensies van kademuren. Ten aanzien van het draagvermogen van de L-wand en de elementenwand wordt geconcludeerd dat de hellingfactor in de formule ""Brinch Hansen"" niet eenduiding is gedefinieerd. De hellingfactor speelt een belangrijke rol in de stabiliteitsberekeningen van constructies, zoals kademuren, waarvan de horizontale belasting beduidend groter is dan de verticale belasting. Onderzoek naar de rekenmethode Brinch Hansen is gewenst. Wandwrijving leidt tot een afname van de horizontale belasting op de voorwand van de L-wand en de elementenwand. Voor de voorwandafmetingen is dat gunstig. Voor de voetplaatafmetingen is wandwrijving ongunstig, omdat de verschildruk over de constructie toeneemt door de afname van de verticale belasting. De lengte en de diepteligging van de ontlastvloer is bepalend voor de mate van belastingreductie op de combiwand. Hoe langer de ontlastvloer is en hoe dieper deze is gelegen, des te lager zijn de gronddrukken op de wand. Voor de verankerde diepwandconstructie geldt dat de wandwrijvingshoek een bepalende variabele is voor enerzijds de constructiediepten en anderzijds het minimaal benodigde aantal trekankers. De wandwrijvingshoek is afhankelijk van het uitvoeringsproces (filtercake, tijdsduur dat de sleuf in tact blijft). Het is niet mogelijk de wandwrijving nauwkeurig vast te stellen. Aanbevolen wordt onderzoek te verrichten naar het verschijnsel wandwrijving. De verankerde diepwand is het meest gunstig qua aanleg- en onderhoudskosten.","kademuren; Maasvlakte; l-wand; ontlastvloerconstructie; elementenwand","nl","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

The city has two main incomes, namely industry and tourism. In summer, beaches of this Atlantic Ocean faced destination are packed with typical Argentine beach tents, which can be rented, and people from all over Argentina come to Mar del Plata. The 600.000 inhabitants are outnumbered 3 to 1 since almost 2 million people visit the town during the months December-February. The crowded beaches in the centre of the town cause the popularity of the more quiet and more expensive beaches south of the town. The surroundings of the beaches around Punta Mogotes, make it a good place to spend the summer. The beaches around Punta Mogotes however, are not in possession of the local or provincial government. Playas del Faro, which mean beaches of the lighthouse, is the last remaining coastline in Argentina which is private. It’s common in Argentina to give concessions for a part of the beach, so this can be exploited by the concessionaire. This concept is applied for Playas del Faro. In the south of these beaches, big erosion problems are present. The most southern concession is called Los Acantilados (‘the cliffs’), named after the cliffs and the neighbourhood which is located a few hundred of meters land inward on top of the cliffs. Once economy flourished here, but with the total disappearance of the dune and beach system in front of the cliffs prospects are bad. With the provincial road and houses some hundred meters away, safety is not an issue. The biggest problem therefore is the lack of beach, which needs to be solved. The erosion is caused by a few reasons. The most important one is the lack of sand input from the south. The wave climate causes an average long shore current over the year from the south to the north. The city of Miramar, located 15 km south of Mar del Plata has had erosion problems since the early years of the previous century and has been constructing counter measures ever since. Further north of Miramar more groyne systems, the one more effective then the other, can be found. The most northern groyne is a rather large groyne of over two hundred meters situated in front of the house of the president. From this point to the research area of Los Acantilados no beaches, except some small pocket beaches, but only high cliffs can be found. Another reason for the erosion is the presence of heavy storms. Local experts say that in a year with more storms then usual, erosion is even worse. This problem is related with the problem above, as well as with the presence of human interference in the dune system. With no input of sand into the system, the sediment, which is placed on the fore shore by a storm, is immediately picked up by the long shore current instead of being transported back on the beaches by the waves of a milder wave climate. Three main solutions are possible for this problem: periodical nourishment, detached breakwaters and a groyne scheme. Nourishment itself is a nice solution with little negative effects. However it is expensive when compared with the construction of groins. The local quarry is situated less then 12 km from Los Acantilados. Constructing a groyne from shore is therefore six times less expensive then building a detached breakwater with the use of floating equipment. Besides the financial factor the groyne scheme has the advantage of being a more ‘permanent’ solution although having negative erosion effects downstream. After thorough consideration it was decided to design a groyne scheme.","Argentina; beach erosion; coastal zone management","en","student report","TU Delft - Section Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

Probably the best-known formula that is used to determine the stability of granular bed material is the design criterion by Shields (1936). However, this criterion is only valid for uniform flows. Little is known about the influence of turbulence on the stability of stones. In this thesis the influence of turbulence structures on the stability of stones in the top layer of a granular filter in one type of nonuniform flow that is often encountered near hydraulic structures, namely backward-facing step (BFS) flow, was investigated.","turbulence; stone; stability; step flow; structure","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

Bij deze techniek wordt het afvalwater in een reactor belucht en vermengd met een geconcentreerde suspensie bacteriën. De bacteriën, die in vlokken leven, zorgen voor de biologische afbraak van organische en andere verontreinigingen in het water. Aan het eind van het proces worden de vlokken van het water gescheiden door middel van bezinking en vervolgens teruggevoerd naar de reactor. Een innovatie binnen het actiefslib-proces is de membraanbioreactor (MBR). Bij het MBR-proces vindt de scheiding tussen slib en water niet plaats door middel van bezinking, maar met behulp van een membraanstap. Kwalitatief beter effluent en ruimtebesparing zijn hiervan de voornaamste voordelen. Het nadeel is dat de techniek relatief duur is vanwege de dure membranen, het hogere energieverbruik en de reinigingsmaatregelen die nodig zijn als gevolg van de membraanvervuiling die bij het proces ontstaat. Toch komt MBR-technologie de laatste jaren steeds meer in beeld als zuiveringstechniek voor huishoudelijk afvalwater. Drijfveer hierachter is de daling van de meerkosten die door intensief onderzoek bewerkstelligd is.

(mentor)","2004","The construction of a new metro line in the city centre of Amsterdam, the so-called Noord/Zuidlijn, is a challenging job as many buildings along the route are sensitive to settlement and angular distortion. To prevent damage, settlement criteria are very strict and mitigating measures are necessary at several locations to meet the criteria. One of the measures that will be taken is the use of Fracture Grouting. A full-scale Compensation Grouting Trial showed that Fracture Grouting in sand underneath pile foundations can be used to control the vertical movement of wooden pile foundations. Nevertheless, the grouting efficiency fluctuated considerably during the trial. It can be concluded that hydraulic fracture initiation and fracture propagation in sand are theoretically not well understood. Consequently, the hydraulic fracture dimensions in sand are not actively controlled. For this reason the grouting efficiency of Fracture Grouting in sand is suboptimal. Objective of this study was to find methods that can be used in order to actively control fracture growth. To enlarge the understanding of hydraulic fracture initiation and propagation, a literature study has been performed. The results were used to study fracture initiation and to develop an analytical model of fracture propagation in sand. The fracture propagation model has consequently been used to study the effect of changing input parameters, like variation of the grout properties. Additionally, several laboratory experiments were done to find realistic values for several input parameters of the model. Conclusion Fracture Grouting in Theory It can be concluded that three constituent processes affect the fracture process: 1. The friction of propagating grout (related to rheological parameters and resulting shear stress) 2. Dehydration of injected grout (related to permeability) and accompanying development of a dehydrated layer at the outer ring of the fracture. 3. The response of surrounding soil Considering these processes it seems possible to influence the output of the fracture propagation process in order to increase grouting efficiency. Grouting efficiency is increased whenever injected grout can be retained under the foundation of a building. It is favourable to limit the fracture length and to maximise the fracture thickness. There are two theoretical methods to influence the output of the fracture process and to increase grouting efficiency: Reducing the Water Solids Factor (WSF) or increasing the amount of angular aggregate material in the fracture grout, increases the shear stress. This results in decreasing fracture length and increasing thickness. By changing the amount of bentonite in the fracture grout, the moment of propagation stagnation can be affected. The grouting efficiency can be affected indirectly when taking the foundation configuration into account. Stimulating propagation stagnation reduces the fracture length. Injected grout will be concentrated under the foundation piles. Consequently, more of the injected grout contributes to the objective of fracture grouting: creation of heave of a building. In other words, the amount of bentonite can theoretically be used to tune the fracture length to the foundation configuration. Results of this research are used to continue the research on Fracture Grouting in sand. The TU Delft and COB (Netherlands Center for Underground Construction) are preparing several laboratorial experiments in which it will be tried to actively control the hydraulic fracture dimensions in sand.","fracture; grouting; sand; vertical movement","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering,","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""
