Within these coastal systems new elements are often implemented to add value to the design without compromising on the function of the design of the nourishment. One of these possible purposes is the creation of an artificial lagoon. However, to be effectively applied a deeper understanding of the behaviour of these lagoons is required. In 2015 the Hondsbosse Dunes (HD) were realized at the Dutch coast at the former “Hondsbosse en Pettermer Zeewering” near Camperduin, and an artificial lagoon was created for nature and recreation purposes within this design. The lagoon provides a boost for both the beach itself as well as the surrounding region. However, the lagoon’s inlet is not stable and continuous maintenance is needed. The objective of this study is to explore the behaviour and longevity of this artificial lagoon, considering the frequency and moments of closure of the lagoon’s inlet. This is achieved by assessing and studying offshore hydrodynamic conditions, satellite imagery, geographical measurements, dredging activity, and water level measurements inside the lagoon. Whether the lagoon is stable or not depends on the inlet stability. Key factors that affect the inlet stability are the tidal prism and the annual littoral drift. The lagoon at the HD can be characterized as an intermittently closed estuary, which is a water body that become isolated from the open coast for a period of time. This system can be divided in a perched or a non-perched system. A perched system has a high berm that closes of the system, where a non-perched system does not necessarily have a berm but has a lack of channel surface area. To get a better understanding on how local hydrodynamic conditions can cause the lagoon’s closure, the hydrodynamic conditions and available data were analysed. The significant wave height for storm events and the total water level at the shore, which includes the tide, the surge and the runup, are considered for the hydrodynamic conditions. Geographical measurements, satellite imagery and dredging moments are used to achieve a better insight of the system. The lagoon surface area is examined above 2.03 m NAP, to establish the behaviour of the lagoon basin and its inlet in time. The result of the data analysis performed in this thesis suggest that the lagoon surface area does not move spatially in time. However, due to the lack of bathymetric measurements the lagoon could not be studied in further detail. Closure of the system occurs due to its highly dynamic channel, which is supported by an analysis of the cross-sections of the channel area in combinations with satellite imagery. A detailed view on the water level inside the lagoon and the exchange between the open coast resulted in four stages that were indicated visually: 1.Closed stage, resulting in a closed channel. The water level can only increase when the water level at the open coast overflows the berm. It leads to a stepwise increasement of the water level, referred to as a perched system. .Open stage. The channel is open and water exchange is possible with the open coast. The effect of the tide can be observed clearly in the water level of the lagoon. 3.Dredging stage. The water level decreases rapidly from a level above high tide at the open coast, to a value near or below high tide level. Afterwards water exchange with the open coast may occur, but this is not always the case. 4.Episodic event. The water level fluctuates, for which the cause cannot be stated beforehand. It depends among others on the type of system, hydrodynamic conditions and on the shape of the channel. The system is called non-perched when a high-water level overwashes the berm in the channel. It seems that the system is open, but water exchange does not occur and the water level in the lagoon increases Analysis of these stages indicates that the system is closed almost 70% of the time. The system is most often closed between October and April, when the channel is dredged again leading to an open system. An open system occurs after dredging in spring, where the results shows that the water level inside the lagoon follows the tide. The data indicate that the system is open for 10-17% of the time. Storm events highly influence closure of the channel. Although storm events on the North Sea are indicated by a significant wave height larger than 400 cm, the results demonstrate that storm events with a significant wave height of 300 cm provoke closure of the channel. This is the result of the small catchment of the lagoon. These storm events increase in winter periods, whereas summer storms appear two to three times a year. The impression that storm events lead to closure of the channel is therefore confirmed. The results show that the lagoon remains the same over a timespan of three years, which suggests that the frequency of closure and opening is not time dependent. This leads to different dredging strategies that are possible for the near future. To create an open lagoon all year round, dredging frequency needs to increase, as it is implied that storm events lead to closure. This increases the dredging costs. If the preference lies in low dredging costs, the system will be closed during certain periods of the year. Since the lagoon is created for recreation purposes closure during the winter season and dredging during the recreation season is proposed as a strategy. These findings correspond to the currently considered strategy for the HD. The data suggest that artificial lagoons, like the investigated case at the Hondsbosse Dunes, never stay open or open without human intervention. This indicates that active management is needed to keep these lagoons open.","Artificial Lagoon; Hondsbossche dunes; Tidal inlet system; Intermittenly closed estuayr; Hydrodynamics; Geographical measurements; Satellite Imagery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","52.721378, 4.638966"

Storing ‘green’ gas (e.g. methane) is a new concept building on well-established fundamentals. Using renewable energy, through electrochemical processes (i.e. electrolysis), hydrogen is first created. Carbon dioxide and hydrogen are then combined to generate ‘green’ methane. Green methane allows storage of clean energy in large scale quantities (i.e. TWh). While subsurface geological formations offer huge capacity to store green methane, several challenges are involved in this storage project, both in the technical and societal realm. With recent subsidence problems in the north of the Netherlands, along with induced seismicity, feasibility study of any operation deep in subsurface formations requires a thorough study of potential stress dynamics and e.g. amount of subsidence. To study the range of subsidence, geomechanical parameters need to be characterized and properly honored in reservoir simulators. Along with the imposed boundary conditions, they determine the rate of subsidence during production and storage. Despite their significant impacts, these parameters are often difficult to measure. In fact the sampling methods provide quite sparse understanding of the heterogeneous distribution of the rock properties spread over the three-dimensional space. Measuring subsidence however can be done in real life via surface sensing methods (e.g. satellite data). Data assimilation methods can then be used to predict relevant geomechanical parameters, with geo-models subject with surface subsidence measurements. For this study, preforming sensitivity analyses to find out the most important layers impacting the overall geomechanical behavior of the integrated reservoir-earth system is crucial. After a through review of the ongoing 4 Dutch gas storage projects, here in this work, to propose a practical approach, we present an out-of-the-box strategy, based on a Design Of Experiment (DOE). DOE is performed on the 4 ongoing Dutch gas storage projects to reveal insights into the sensitivity of the system. Both CMG-GEM commercial and academic DARSim research simulators have been used to estimate the subsidence. Specially this study also reveals that, for a safe storage, one has to characterize the subsurface formation layers as well as the over-, side- and under-burden layers. Once it is determined which properties are relevant, finally, the Kalman filter is employed as a prediction method. This work establishes the first thorough study of the ongoing Dutch gas storage projects, the uncertainty with respect to characterization of the geomechanical parameters associated with them, and finally the sensitivity analyses with respect to the uncertain parameters. Further research is expected to build on top of this work, to exploit new hosts for storage of green methane.","UGS; Green gas; Energy storage; gas storage; CMG; Subsidence; Kalman filter; Design of Experiments","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this regard, there are some alternatives proposed in the literature from which the dataBox stands out. This concept, developed by Mortier and colleagues for the smart-household, is repurposed in the Thesis to the context of scientific research. The dataBox can become the data subject’s portal for the future research data platform from TU Delft, currently being developed by several researchers from the University. This interface enables data subjects to support data-driven research by giving their informed consent to the researcher’s data requests. The thesis addresses the question of how to design the user experience of such dataBox transparently and trustworthily, equipping the University population with the control and knowledge needed to share their data in the degree they feel comfortable with. The research conducted demonstrates the adequacy of the dataBox concept to satisfy the data subject’s concerns and expectations about the data collections conducted by researchers from the University. Furthermore, it stresses the need for an onboarding phase previous to the negotiation and follow-up phases proposed by Mortier. The onboarding has been demonstrated necessary to enable data subject’s informed consent when facing participation requests since without it are likely to misinterpret the risks entangled.

The Sleep &amp; Respiratory Care business of Philips creates these products and needs to reach the same general sustainability targets related to circular revenue. The masks and headgear are medical consumables and are replaced on a regularly basis according to the insurance’s reimbursement cycle. The products are not always broken when they are replaced and the current headgear design can not be recycled. Next to this, the products are provided to the patient through multiple stakeholders whereby Philips has low control over the material flow. Therefore, in this project the products are redesigned to become ‘circular ready’ and a roadmap for the implementation of new circular propositions have been created. A Life Cycle Assessment tool is created to assess the life cycle of the current product system and compare this to new designs and scenarios in an iterative way. The propositions are based on the three different circular strategies: Slowing resource loops, Closing resource loops and material efficiency. The new design has been optimized for a longer lifetime and easier cleaning ritual, as a first short term circular strategy. The new headgear will be made with a knitting production technique and two arms that slide in this piece. This design is based on the just released headgear with arms design of Philips. This ensures comfort and more stability for the user. It is recyclable and is material efficiently produced. The business model is redesigned in combination with a new procurement scenario that can be included in the already existing DreamMapper app. This is done to link the replacement to the performance of the products and stimulate a longer product life. Furthermore, a recycling and future reverse logistic scenario has been created. The silicone of the mask can be taken back and sold for recycling. The user can sent the products through the normal mail with the help of information from the app. The headgear can be recycled through the municipal textile recycling stream that should be widely implemented in Europe by 2025. All the proposition parts are designed with the eye on the future and technology trends. The future in CPAP supplies are custom made products, supported by digital production techniques and the 3d face scan software. This can enable super local production. From the final life cycle assessment of the different proposition parts can be concluded that these lower the kg CO2 emissions. The project results are expected to be highly feasible as already existing resources and infrastructures are used for the new proposition. The holistic design approach and solution, including the clear steps and advantages for the 4 key ingredients have inspired the business.

(mentor); Houben, Lambert (mentor); Šavija, Branko (graduation committee); Romero Rodriguez, Claudia (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","The service life of concrete structures depend largely on the durability of concrete. The durability of concrete is influenced by mass transport mechanisms that can have severe deteriorating effects. Transport of water in concrete is of paramount importance as water can act as a carrier of ions such as chlorides which can corrode the reinforcement and reduce the service life of concrete structures. The main objective of this thesis is to study moisture transport through capillary absorption in concrete. Numerical simulation of moisture transport is performed through lattice elements with an irregular mesh configuration. New computational tools are developed and compared with the existing tools in terms of effectiveness to simulate moisture transport in homogeneous uncracked concrete. The existing numerical model uses approximate volume of transport elements to determine the volumetric capacity of elements. During discretization of the governing equation, the variation of diffusivity of the elements is approximated as a uniform mean distribution and an explicit time stepping scheme is implemented which has consequences on the flow equilibrium at each time step. In the proposed numerical model, exact volume of transport elements is considered and during the discretization of governing equations, exponential variation of diffusivity is considered along with an implicit time stepping scheme. Moisture transport is accurately simulated in uncracked homogeneous concrete even by using the existing model as validated through experimental results. Both the models are compared through error analysis by varying mesh size and time step. Moisture flow through different diffusivity coefficients is simulated using both the models and it is observed that the existing model suffers from oscillations in the saturation level during initial stages of flow due to inability of the existing model to maintain flow equilibrium at each time step. The proposed model on the other hand shows no such oscillations due to the flow equilibrium being maintained at each time step. Mesh size, magnitude of time step and diffusivity coefficient are shown to be the parameters limiting the effectiveness of either of the models. A single discrete crack is considered within the domain and its influence on moisture transport is observed. The nature of the crack is considered through two approaches. In the first approach, crack is considered as an additional porous phase in cement matrix and the entire volume occupied by the crack is considered to be a void. In the second approach, in addition to considering the porous nature of crack, moisture surface interaction between the water surface and crack walls is also considered. Horizontal moisture distribution around a planar crack is simulated using both the approaches which show similar results as in the experiment. The vertical moisture distribution is simulated within a wedge shaped crack and the results are compared with experimental observations. The first approach shows a slower rate of saturation of the crack as compared to the experiment. The second approach shows the vertical saturation of the crack similar to the experiment. A comparison between the Delaunay and Voronoi modelling techniques of moisture simulation in cracked domain is discussed. It is shown that the presence of a crack accelerates the moisture transport in concrete as it exposes additional surface of concrete from where water can penetrate in the material and also increases the diffusivity of the concrete material lying in the vicinity of the crack. Moisture transport is simulated in concrete considering its multi-phase nature. Concrete is considered to be composed of three phases i.e. cement paste, aggregates and ITZ around aggregates. Aggregates are considered to be impervious which do not allow the flow of moisture through them which slows down the flow in concrete. The ITZ around the aggregates have higher transport properties and accelerate the flow. A numerical framework is formulated in which spherical aggregates are projected on lattice elements which are assigned transport properties pertaining to the phase of concrete they represent. Moisture transport is simulated and compared with experimental results where an increase of volume fraction of aggregates leads to a decrease of cumulative saturation level. The influence of ITZ is observed on a local and global scale by varying the ITZ diffusivity coefficient. The moisture simulation is also modelled on a finer mesh to see the effect of mesh refinement. Finally, moisture transport is simulated in a numerical model that combines a planar crack along with heterogeneities and flow is observed at different time stages.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Innovative technologies like reverse osmosis and more strict drinking water standards are expected to be applied to provide better water quality to customers. In Oasen drinking water company, reverse osmosis has been applied in Lekkerkerk drinking water treatment station since 2016 to prepare for the future challenges, while potential transition effects like biofilms detachment and resuspension of loose deposits in the drinking water distribution systems might occur under irregular changes caused by supply water switch. A setup named Smart Water Meter was developed and used with integrated functions, such as seizing particles inside distribution networks and monitoring several parameters, to investigate this phenomenon. Although slight and temporary transition effects were captured with the help of this device, the amount of retained materials were not sufficient for transition effects study. According to the company, new treatment stations are being planned where background information is required to be collected and still potential transition effects might occur. The main objective of this research was to optimize the Smart Water Meter for future transition effects study by re-selecting the pore size of the filter bag to make it more sensitive and install the upgraded setups in four different locations under different water quality to have a better understanding on its performance and characteristics. Before being applied into the fields, a stagnation (water retained inside the setup for a long time) test was conducted as well to figure out the feasibility of experiments simplification where water is kept flowing through the setup instead of intermittent mode and possible deterioration of the water quality. 10 microns filter bag is selected in this research after three stages tests. Results reveal that the optimized filter bag with new pore size is able to intercept more particles without arousing sudden pressure drop under normal conditions. However, if this setup could set an early alarm, like a sudden pressure drop, when serious transition effects occur remains to be checked in the future. According to the stagnation test, chemical elements concentration and biological activity increased inside the filter bag, meaning that the water quality was indeed deteriorated when it was stagnated inside the filter bag for 23 hours while the quality could go back to normal after opening both influent and effluent valves on the setup for a while. This also indicates that the simplification of experiments is acceptable. Pore size of the filter bag may require to be reconsidered when the influent pressure in households is not sufficient, otherwise great pressure loss is inevitable. For different water quality in four locations provided by three drinking water companies, the performance of the setup is relatively reliable with a stable 100% removal rate of the particles larger than 29 microns inside the water while for the five elements, little relationship could be found. Besides, the filter bag could remove part of the living cells inside it when water keeps flowing through it. Observation of the filter bag inner surface could provide a general idea of the filtrates composition and by making chemical and biological analysis of them, possible origins of the distribution network harbored materials are conjectured. In this research, most of the distribution network harbored materials might come from detached biofilms as calcium is crucial for biofilm formation while part of the retained materials may also originate from loose deposits due to As and Aeromonas existence in some locations. With the optimized setups and a deeper understanding of its performance under different water quality, the setup could be better applied in the future study of transition effects and early warning systems.","drinking water distribution system; Smart Water Meter; Transition effects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","Oasen West",""

Researches, however, suggest that adding extra complexities to the project could create synergies and therefore new solutions. An increase in project complexity could increase the level of support and appreciation by the project participants and external stakeholders and thereby improve the level of project success. An explanatory case study, with four cases, was used to determine if and how project organisations adapted their project management approach, after the inclusion of a new objective and thereby increasing the number of involved interest groups. In comparison with the results from an individual and cross-case analysis, the needed adaptations for a successful response to the increase in number of involved interest groups could be determined. The changes to the project management approaches as a consequence of this extra objective, were in three of the four projects small to none. Only in one of the projects, considerable changes in the approach were determined. An expert session illustrated that most project management professionals are willing to change their project management approach, when the project is substantially changed, due to for example, a significant change in the project complexity. Nevertheless, the results of the session and the case study do also illustrate that this measure does not happen very often. As a consequence, no conclusion could be drawn on the needed adaptations, because the project organisations showed limited flexibility by only including an extra objective in which the effect on the project were neglectable. This conclusion does however illustrate that project organisations could include and extra objective to their project and thereby increase the number of involved interest groups, without any needed adaptation to the project management approach, provided that the following five conditions are met: [1] the extra objective is small of scale, [2] the project organisation acts a facilitator for the execution of the extra objective, [3] the objective is included to the project in the design phase, [4] complexity dimension “social complexity” is present on the project and [5] the extra objective is properly analyses and a supporter for the objective is appointed.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","This thesis elaborates on a theoretical, epistemological and design research framework for the possibility of an operative synthesis of, on the one hand, climate-related risk management (primarily, flood exposure from multiple source, i.e. sea level rise and coastal/tidal flooding, fluvial flooding and pluvial flooding) and, on the other, the planning and design of operational landscapes of material production, as a means for sustainable ecological development. Contemporary practices of managing ecological, environmental and climatic risk rely heavily on a ‘mitigation’ approach, where the imperative is the restoration of a previous ‘natural’ order or the spatial planning of the next waves of development and urbanization according to the evaluation of the internal logics of natural processes. However, this line of thinking severely hinders the possibility of a creative and proactive reorganization of human processes of material production precisely because it presupposes a “nature-society rift” (Moore, 2014). Similarly, the negative externalities associated with the extensive and intensive operationalization of vast terrestrial terrains are viewed as singular phenomena to be addressed in situ and not as opportunities to fundamentally reconceptualize contemporary planetary urbanization (Brenner, 2016). The basis upon which this work is built, is that to properly address climate-related risk one has to, also, address unsustainable patterns of material production and the physical and functional organization of urbanization. Following the development of the concepts of ""concentrated"" and ""extended urbanization"" through the construction of gradients of ""agglomeration"" and ""operational landscapes"" (Brenner, 2013; Brenner and Schmid, 2014; Katsikis 2014; Katsikis 2018) and in contrast to the predominant approach of placing the emphasis on the agglomeration side of these gradients, this thesis attempts the opposite: shifting the analytical centrality from agglomerations to the operational landscapes that sustain them, we are able to formulate an urbanization hypothesis that addresses the requirements of the latter not as externalities of the former (thus hindering the capacity of the framework to be adequately socio-ecologically sustainable) but as the fundamental elements of the planning and design of the urban fabric. It is, thus, suggested that an incorporation of biophysical processes and ecosystem functions, which are central to the performance of operational landscapes, within the urbanized landscape would, at the same time, offer climate-related performance. Assuming, therefore, that this act is an act of construction of the urban landscape and, even further, it partakes in its economic activities, this work reformulates Lefebvre’s opening statement in “The Urban Revolution” (2003) as following: 'the urban has been completely operationalized', and attempts to elaborate on the coming-into-being of this reality, ‘the project of the cultivation of the urban’. As such, the objective of this thesis is to develop a framework for a design exercise that could inform a potential urban and territorial project. The design research proposal elaborated here is one that seeks to discuss the possibility that “agglomeration landscapes” become hybridized with “operational landscapes” (Katsikis, 2018). By that I mean that contemporary cities and urban regions renounce their sole correspondence with the secondary and tertiary sectors of economy and, in turn, take on the role of encompassing primary (i.e. material) production as well. In other words, this work assumes that there is a possibility that the various productive hinterlands of the planet be diffused within and throughout the urbanized landscapes that they sustain. By concurring with Moore (2014) that operational landscapes represent, essentially, the way that humanity interacts with nature, I evoke Foster (2000) to propose the possibility of retrofitting material production within the economies of agglomerations and, thus, operationalizing the urban.","cultivation; ecology; operational lanadscape; material production; water management; flood-risk management; landscape ecology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","","51.509865, -0.118092"

First, complete the tracking task based on PF algorithm in centralized manner, a processing center is required to collect the signal from all microphones to carry out the PF processing. The computation complexity and time consumption of the particle filter algorithm are relatively high, mainly because of the large number of particles exploited in the filtering process since the effectiveness and accuracy of the particle filter particularly rely on the sample set size. However, almost all the existing particle filtering algorithms exploit the fixed number of particles, especially in the field of acoustic source tracking. To deal with this matter, Kullback-Leibler distance (KLD) sampling method was utilized as an adaptation technique to adjust the sample size instead of setting fixed number. Two approaches based on particle filter algorithm for tracking speaker in distributed way are proposed. Compared to the centralized scheme, each microphone pair in the distributed network executes the local PF individually and exchanges local weights or posterior parameters among neighboring nodes to efficiently achieve the global estimate of the sound source position. Finally, simulation experiments demonstrate these two methods are feasible to track the speaker in distributed microphone networks with a variable number of particles.","speaker tracking; distributed pairwise microphone networks; particle filter; Kullback-Leibler distance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Circuits and Systems","",""

To overcome this limitation, two or more single junction cells with different bandgaps can be coupled together to achieve higher energy conversion efficiency by optimum spectral utilization. In this work, thin film silicon-based alloys are used to obtain a high potential and a current matched 2-junction solar cell is fabricated. The top cell is a-Si which has high bandgap of 1.8eV and the bottom cell is a-SiGe:H which has a tuneable bandgap between 1.4-1.6eV. This thesis will focus in optimizing the window layer of the top a-Si solar cell and the effects of Hydrogen Plasma Treatment (HPT) at the i/p and p/TCO interface. This top cell is fabricated in a PECVD cluster tool in n-i-p substrate configuration on ASAHI glass substrate. The use of PECVD allows for a better control of the layer properties by changing the gas flow rates and the deposition environment. Initially a reference cell is fabricated which had an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 804 mV, a fill factor (FF) of 0.63, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 12.8 mAcm-2 and an efficiency of 6.56 %. To improve the performance of the solar cell the the effects of HPT on the material properties of the i-layer and the p-layer are studied at varying power, pressure and duration of exposure. The next step is to study the effects of the precursor gas flow rates for the deposition of p-nc-SiOx layer and optimize the thickness of the individual components of the window layer including the TCO. The optimization process involved trading off certain properties in favour of a high Voc and high FF. The final cell had an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 863V, a fill factor (FF) of 0.655, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 12.5 mAcm-2 and an efficiency of 7.06 %. Thus, by only optimizing the non-active window layer an open circuit voltage gain of 60mV is achieved with an improved FF. This single junction cell is then fabricated on top of a-SiGe:H solar cell. With some iteration in the absorber layer properties of both the top and bottom cells, the final tandem cell had a Voc of 1395 mV, a FF of 0.69, the current limiting Jsc of the top cell at 8.34mAcm-2 and an overall efficiency of 7.99%.

Additionally, it has potential for zinc enrichment in the flue dust, as it can quickly vapourise zinc in the feed material and reject it to the flue dust. Increasing the zinc fraction in the flue dust up to 50% would allow for zinc recovery in the zinc smelters. The larger tolerances of the furnace make it possible to include material streams currently mostly land filled. In this thesis, the focus has been on three of these waste streams, goethite, Blast Furnace (BF) dust, and Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) dust. The research focussed on acquiring fundamental knowledge on the behaviour of these waste dusts at high temperatures and various retention times. This will aid their future use as an alternative feed stream material for enriching the HIsarna flue dust with zinc, without compromising the longevity of the furnace or the quality of the steel.<br/>In a literature study, several alternative materials were investigated. Of particular interest are the sludge wastes from the steel industry for their large iron and zinc contents, the sludge waste from the zinc smelters for the same reason, and galvanised steel scrap, possibly in combination with EAF dust. There are a few challenges to overcome, such as the copper concentration in the zinc smelter residues, or the variation in composition and quality of steel scrap. However, these materials were identified as high potential for inclusion in HIsarna.  It was found that zinc can effectively be reduced and vapourised from the waste dusts regardless of its mineral form, in case there is carbon. The carbon acts as a reductant for the iron oxides, including zinc ferrite, and for zinc oxide. Goethite does not contain any carbon, however, mixing with BF sludge will allow the vapourisation of zinc. A model is proposed for estimation of the amount of carbon, and by extension BF dust, that is needed to achieve a full reduction of the iron oxides with native carbon sources. This will aid future mixing of these waste streams, allowing more control over the composition of the feed stream.<br/>A competing mechanism to direct reduction of zinc oxide was identified. Zinc oxide can react with S<sub>2</sub> gas which forms during the thermal shock treatment, forming a zinc sulfide fine particle. At high temperatures, this intermediate species decomposes over time to release the zinc vapour, however, the exact mechanism could not be deduced from the experiments. The mechanism and timescale was verified at various temperatures, and holds up until 1300 ºC. The timescale shortens significantly when increasing the temperature. Therefore, from the work conducted, it was concluded that the zinc can be effectively removed at a relevant timescale for HIsarna and collected in the flue dust.","zinc; HIsarna; goethite; blast furnace sludge; basic oxygen furnace sludge; enrichment; sustainability; thermal shock","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

Most of this data is redundant static information which results in wastage of system memory, computational resources, power and time. Inspired from biological retina, first Neuromorphic-Retina for LIDAR is proposed that is able to extract and encode movement happening at particular distance, particular angle and with particular velocity from raw LIDAR temporal pulses into unique spike sequences so that the information about the dynamic environment can be efficiently classified and processed by event based and low powered Neuromorphic processing unit. The system is designed in such a way that it avoids consumption of large amount of computational resources and system memory. Simulation results show that the Retina is able to filter out redundant static information from the LIDAR data stream thereby reducing data throughput of around 50 - 70 % with 5 - 22 % spatial quality loss (based on scenario) as well as remove noise caused due to luminous reflections.

One of the main problems for treatment of patients with Dravet Syndrome is drug resistance and there are no biomarkers to monitor the efficacy of a particular treatment. The Dravet Syndrome phenotype can be recapitulated in mice by knockout of the Scn1a gene. Previous studies revealed a reduced sodium current in inhibitory GABAergic interneurons in a mouse model of Dravet Syndrome which leads to reduced excitability of inhibitory GABAergic inter-neurons. Inhibition of inhibitory GABAergic interneurons can lead to decreased phase-amplitude coupling between theta (5-10 Hz) and gamma (50-70 Hz) or theta and high gamma (100-140 Hz) oscillations in the brain. To investigate whether impaired phase-amplitude coupling could be a potential biomarker to monitor the efficacy of treatment for Dravet Syndrome, we recorded electrocorticogram signals from the primary visual cortex in two mice models of Dravet Syndrome and wild type mice. We found a decrease in theta-high gamma coupling for mice with Dravet Syndrome in the early epileptic stage and a decrease in theta-gamma and theta-high gamma coupling in mice with Dravet Syndrome in which seizure onset had already started, during rapid-eye-movement sleep. Reduced excitability of inhibitory GABAergic interneurons can also cause hyper-excitability that leads to seizures. These results suggest that phase amplitude coupling could be a potential biomarker to monitor the efficacy of treatment for Dravet Syndrome. Efficient treatment decreases the number of seizures and therefore we expect to see an increase in theta-gamma and theta-high gamma coupling.","phase-amplitude coupling; Dravet Syndrome; epilepsy; brain; modulation index","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-29","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

We measured the room temperature properties of the films using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and ellipsometry. All room temperature properties except the IR refractive index decrease monotonically with increasing substrate temperature. The IR refractive index approaches the refractive index of crystalline silicon (c-Si) when increasing the substrate temperature to 350 °C. We measured the dielectric losses using superconducting coplanar waveguide resonators. Interestingly, we do not see a correlation of the room temperature results with the MW losses. All films have an excellent 120 mK MW loss tangent below 1e−5 at −50 dBm internal resonator power. More research on the loss tangents is recommended, for example using microstrip lines or lumped element parallel plate capacitors. The low dielectric losses make these films promising for application in MW kinetic inductance detectors and on-chip filters.

This research evaluates the contribution of agent-based distributed planning and coordination to the resilience of airport surface movement operations when runway reconfigurations occur. A Multi-Agent System (MAS) model was created based on the layout and airport surface movement operations of Schiphol Airport in the Netherlands.

MAS simulations were run based on eight days of real-world operational data from Schiphol Airport. The MAS results show that the distributed planning and coordination mechanisms were effective in contributing to the resilient behaviour of the airport surface movement operations, closely following the real-world behaviour, and sometimes even surpassing it. In particular, the mechanisms were found to contribute to more resilient behaviour than the real-world when considering the taxi time after runway reconfiguration events.

The compound helicopter is investigated as part of the Future Vertical Lift Program to replace the entire U.S. Army helicopter fleet. The compound helicopter resembles a mix between a fixed-wing aircraft and a conventional helicopter. It features a controllable rotor as well as wings, elevator, ailerons and a push propeller near the tail. Increased agility is achieved by the unique combination of controls and the maximum flying speed is expanded by unloading the rotor lift and redistributing it over the wings. However, manoeuvring at faster speeds comes at a cost. High loads in the rotor hub are expected. </p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Because of this unique helicopter configuration, some of the controls can be seen as redundant. This enables multiple combinations of control inputs to generate a (near) identical helicopter state. Therefore, the redundant controls can be used for a secondary objective next to manoeuvring the rotorcraft. The thesis will investigate the feasibility of using the redundant controls of a compound helicopter to alleviate loads in the rotor hub during an aggressive roll manoeuvre. This cuts down maintenance costs of highly loaded components and increases their reliability. The focus lies on understanding the physical phenomena leading up to alleviating loads.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">A multi-body dynamics model of the compound UH-60A Black Hawk was constructed to simulate manoeuvring flight. The main rotor is represented as a blade element model with a Peters-He inflow model. Aerodynamic coefficients are found from quasi-steady look-up tables. Blades are assumed to be rigid and feature a feather and flap hinge. The fuselage aerodynamics are interpolated from test data. The empennage is modelled using 2D look-up tables to compute the aerodynamic coefficients. The wing and push propeller, unique to the compound helicopter type, are modelled by a non-linear lifting line and a point force acting near the tail respectively. A flight controller was implemented as the fly-to-trim method was used to find the trim condition. The model was validated against FLIGHTLAB for trim and a rolling manoeuvre. The main wing lifting line was separately validated against a vortex lattice method.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">The first experiment varies the control strategy to alleviate loads during the roll doublet. Either a pure lateral cyclic, pure aileron or a 50% cyclic - 50% aileron input are investigated. When a pure later cyclic input is used, the rotor will lead the roll and the fuselage will follow. This effect is reversed as the rotor lags when a pure aileron input is used. The rotor smoothly follows the fuselage’s roll motion when both controls are combined. This is caused by the reversed lateral flapping response switching from a pure cyclic to a pure aileron input. The combined input levels out the flapping response. As the moment measured in the hub is linked to the flap angle, loads are reduced from a factor &gt; 7 for a pure cyclic or aileron input, to a factor ∼ 2 for the combined input.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">A second experiment investigates the effect of different trim settings prior to the roll manoeuvre. The horizontal tail deflection, compound thrust, rotor rpm and constant aileron input at trim are varied separately. This enables the helicopter to offload both the lifting and propulsive function of the main rotor and reduce the power required in cruise. Depending on which controls are used to achieve the trim state, loads in the hub are increased or decreased. Longitudinal hub moment loads are decreased when the required longitudinal cyclic is alleviated using the horizontal tail or compound thrust. The effect on the lateral hub moments scale with the offloading of the main rotor, except when a constant aileron input is applied at trim. A constant aileron input will lower the power required by pushing the lift more outboard over the advancing blade. The required cyclic input to counter this aileron deflection increases the lateral hub moments.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">The final experiment combines the two others by defining a suboptimal trim condition and varying the control strategy during the roll doublet, according to the first experiment. It was confirmed that the 50% lateral cyclic - 50% aileron input reduces lateral blade flapping which lowers the lateral bending moment in the hub. Longitudinal bending loads are alleviated as both the lift and propulsive function of the main rotor are alleviated. This also reduces the power required in cruise. The 50% lateral cyclic - 50% aileron input increases the control power and shows to be beneficial for handling qualities.","Structural Load Alleviation; SLA; Compound Helicopter; Helicopter; Helicopter Model; Rotor; Flapping Dynamics; Blade Flap","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Aircraft sensor bias and test-cell correction factors are expected to also contribute considerably. Engine bleed air and power extraction effects are negligible. The impact of inaccurate or missing throttle, temperature and humidity corrections was eliminated by application of proposed engine-specific customized corrections, which served as a successful proof of concept for improved on-wing monitoring accuracy.","Engine MRO; Test-cell; Engine Health Monitoring; Gas turbine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-11-29","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Poelma, C. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Multi-phase flows are ubiquitous in nature and in everyday life surrounding us, impacting us in almost all possible ways. The presence of particles in a flow can change the flow behaviour in an unpredictable manner. The simplest example of a particle-laden flow, that one can think of, is the settling of a single sphere under gravity in a quiescent fluid. This seemingly simple problem has very high relevance in various practical applications ranging from sedimentation of particles for water treatment, process industries, transport of a dense suspension(slurry) through a pipe and even in land reclamation. The settling/ascension of a single sphere, even after having been subject to extensive study for more than a century, remains far from being understood completely. The path and the wake of a falling/rising sphere in a quiescent fluid may be subject to various instabilities depending upon two dimensionless quantities which are sufficient to characterize the motion. One being the Galileo number (Ga), which is the ratio of the net gravity force to the viscous force and the second one being the mass density ratio, which is the ratio of the density of the solid to the density of the fluid. Depending upon Ga and mass density ratio, the sphere can take up various regimes of motion such as vertical, oblique, zigzagging, helical to name a few. This is mainly due to wake instabilities that trigger such path instabilities. Based on Ga and mass density ratio, various regime maps have been proposed in literature. There have been several disagreements regarding the characterization of such paths taken by the sphere. This is due to the strong solid-fluid coupling and the inherent complexity due to triggering of the instabilities in such cases, which is far from being trivial to model numerically and also to test experimentally. The disagreements between different numerical works and different experimental works make the problem hard pressing and tempting to study. Moreover, the settling behaviour of a single sphere can also aid in understanding the collective effects displayed in the settling of dilute suspensions. The goal of the present study is to shed light on the confusion/disagreements in literature until now and characterize various path instabilities. A detailed experimental investigation is conducted to cover the parameter space (regime map) by employment of over 250 different combinations of Ga and mass density ratio to cover as many regimes of motions as possible within the given time framework. The motion of a sphere is tracked in time using high-speed cameras and corresponding path/regime of motion, higher-order statistics like velocity and physical characteristics such as the Strouhal number/ drag coefficient has been computed. The results validate well for some simple regimes of motion for which results from the previous studies perfectly agree with each other. With the confidence obtained after the validation, the current work attempts to draw points of consensus and disagreements with these earlier works for other more controversial regimes. Some regimes, which had only been observed using numerical simulations, have been observed experimentally for the first time. Also, intriguing bi-stable regimes (coexistence of two regimes) have been observed. Moreover, attempt is also made to characterize the suppression of the high-frequency oscillations with increase in the sphere inertia. An update of the regime maps is proposed with the results obtained from the experiments conducted. The results obtained will also serve as an excellent tool for validation of new numerical models, using which the Ga-mass density ratio parameter space can be covered in great detail. Recommendations for future work are given.","Fluid dynamics; Sedimentation; Particle-laden flow; Multiphase Flow; Path/wake Instabilities","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy and Process Technology","",""

(mentor); Scholten, D.J. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","To comply with the 2020 targets for reducing greenhouse gas GHG emissions, the government of the Netherlands ordered to close the coal-fired power plant at Hemweg 8 by the end of the year 2019 and Vattenfall aims to utilise this valuable location in the harbour of Amsterdam for production of green hydrogen and other renewable alternatives. The objective of this research project was to analyse multiple technical designs, using dynamic simulation, of a wind-powered energy system to produce hydrogen for mobility and industries at the Hemweg 8 location. The technical characteristics of hydrogen production, storage and transport were analysed in the case study of the Hemweg and a general evaluation of the issues that are relevant regarding the introduction of a windpowered energy system was conducted. The wind turbines located near the Hemweg were used as a renewable energy source. The present and future hydrogen demands were evaluated and a growing demand for hydrogen is expected. Thereafter, different demand scenarios were determined for the present time and in 2030. A system comparison was made to verify if a wind-powered hydrogen energy system is indeed a viable option for the Hemweg location. Therefore, 4 different system configurations have been evaluated: a hydrogen-energy system with an Alkaline electrolyser and a polymer electrolyte membrane PEM electrolyser, both at 1 MW and 2 MW. All systems have been evaluated for two moments in time: the present time and the year 2030. For the present time, technologies were used that are readily on the market. For the 2030 scenario, expected advancement in technologies were included. The energy demand is met using wind energy. In case the energy supply is too low, grid electricity is used to provide additional supply. The hydrogen is transported in compressed form and transported at 200 bar to different industries and to fuelling stations for fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV ) and hydrogen-powered ships. The wind-powered hydrogen energy systems were modelled in MATLAB and SIMULINK to calculate the amount of hydrogen each electrolyser can produce and how much electricity of the wind turbine is used. When there is lower demand for hydrogen, the electrolysers do not work at nominal load all the time, leading to a higher efficiency. In order to include the change in efficiency, the Alkaline and the PEM electrolyser were both dynamically modelled in detail for each scenario. An economic analysis of each system-configuration was performed. Important factors that influence the amount of hydrogen output and the levelised cost of the hydrogen are: the running time, partial load performance, output pressure and the share of renewable energy used. The economic analysis and system comparison show that the Alkaline electrolyser with a size of 2 MW produces hydrogen at the lowest levelised cost for the present scenario. For the 2030 scenario, the PEM electrolyser at a 2 MW size is the lowest in levelised cost and is competitive with green hydrogen production prices found on the market. For the present scenario, the hydrogen production cost of the system is 3.8 e/kg and the dispensing price for FCEV is 6.7 e/kg, when working full-time at nominal load. The production cost and the dispensed hydrogen fuel cost price for the future scenario will reduce to 3.2 e/kg and 5.1 e/kg, respectively, which makes the hydrogen a competitive fuel in comparison to the fuel price of gasoline. From the research findings, it was concluded that the WACC and the cost of electricity supplied by the wind turbine have a large impact and the CAPEX of the electrolyser has a minor impact on the levelised cost of hydrogen. A hydrogen energy system at the Hemweg, powered by wind and grid electricity, is accessed as technological feasible and cost competitive.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-12-31","","","","","",""

These are non-volatile devices that store data as a resistance, and are highly compatible with traditional CMOS process. Many research centers and companies are prototyping such architectures. Efficient and high-quality test solutions are required for these architectures, which is the subject of this thesis. This thesis presents a methodology for testing any CIM architecture, focusing on their memory and computation configurations, and applies this methodology to an existing CIM architecture as an example. The configurations are tested in the mentioned order for maximum fault coverage, while minimizing test development complexity. The testing method is structural rather than functional, thereby maximizing and guaranteeing fault coverage. To create accurate tests, device-aware testing is employed to model these defective devices. As a case study, the methodology is applied to scouting logic, a bit-wise logic CIM architecture that performs operations on data stored in memristors. Defects in the memory array as well as in the peripheral circuitry were injected and simulated to obtain realistic faults. The resultant fault analysis shows that there exist faults that are unique to the computation configuration and are not observed in the memory configuration. This implies that testing a CIM architecture only as a memory will lead to test escapes. Hence, the proposed test solution tests both the memory and computation configuration, and detects all faults.","CIM; Memory Testing; Computation in Memory; ReRAM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-07-13","","","","Computer Engineering","",""

This thesis describes the research into the effect of applying the energy equation to update the temperature whilst solving the CRN. The objective is to quantify the effect of the common assumption that the temperature generated by CFD is sufficiently accurate and can be kept fixed to reduce the nonlinearity of the system of equations to be solved in the CRN. This research uses and modifies the computational tool AGNES, that was developed at the Delft University of Technology and is able to automatically cluster, solve and visualise the results of a CRN based on results form CFD. The test cases used are the Sandia Flame D, which is a piloted methane-air jet flame with a Reynolds number of 22400, and the Verissimo et al. test case, which is a flameless combustion burner. The CRN was clustered with the zones and tolerances set by Monaghan et al. The results were validated using experimental data of temperature and species mass fractions and the sensitivity of the clustering method was studied. <br/>The results of CFD-CRN simulations were used to evaluate the effect of updating the temperature using the energy equation. The results show that solving the energy equation leads to a progressive overprediction of temperature in the far field of the computational domain, which consequently results in the overprediction of NO and CO concentrations. A potential cause for the overprediction is identified as the heat transfer in the form of conduction and radiation not being accounted for in the solving of the CRN. Unless the diffusion of heat is accurately modeled, the application of the energy equation is not recommended.","Combustion Simulation; Emission Prediction; Chemical Reactor Network","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This process may occur gradually over tens of kilometers and affects the required quality of the inland water. A bubble screen alongside the locks is one of the available mitigating measures for this undesired phenomenon. However, current numerical simulations on bubble screens to mitigate salt intrusion are relatively scarce, and the validation of such models has not yet been thoroughly checked. The objective of this thesis is to study the performance of bubble screens for mitigating the salt intrusion using an Euler-Euler Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model in Fluent 17.2. The work was conducted at TU Delft in collaboration with Deltares, a hydraulics institute in Delft in The Netherlands. First, a simulation of a gravity current is conducted to study the mixing of fresh and salt water in the absence of a bubble screen. The mass transport equation for the salt concentration, together with a linear approximation of the concentration-density relation, is involved into the governing equations. The results are validated with empirical predictions and experiments at Deltares of gravity currents to study the buoyancy effects of different turbulence submodels. Second, simulations of bubble screens in the fresh-fresh water system are performed and validated with particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements conducted at Deltares to investigate the bubble screen dynamics. Larger flow circulations are generated with increasing air flow rates, while a constant surface current thickness of around 0.3 times the water depth is found for all cases. Lastly, bubble screens simulations for six different Froude air numbers $Fr_{air}$ in the fresh-salt water system are conducted and validated with the dye measurements. The dimensionless number $Fr_{air}$ serves as a ratio of the kinetic energy of the rising bubble plume to the potential energy of the gravity current. The salt transmission factor, defined as a ratio of the salt intrusion with mitigating measures to that without any measures, shows that $Fr_{air}$ in the range of 0.93 - 1.08 is most efficient for mitigating salt intrusion. At a lower $Fr_{air}$, the salt water generally intrudes at the bottom area as a salt tongue, whereas the salt intrudes through the surface current for larger $Fr_{air}$ owing to a higher rate of liquid entrainment into the bubble screen.","Bubble Screens; Salt Intrusion; Numerical Simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Energy and Process Technology","",""

As a microstructure control strategy, different heat treatment approaches are used to analyze the redistribution of different phases and changes in mechanical properties. The deposited layers consisted of two dominant phases, α and β, and a variety of precipitates(κⅠ,κⅡ,κⅢ,κⅣ). The β phase retained due to high cooling rate in the WAAM process is harmful for the performance of the construct. The morphology and distribution of the precipitates can be controlled through a heat treatment process, to reduce its detrimental effect on the mechanical properties. The evolution of the microstructure during WAAM processing of NAB is investigated using optical microscopy, electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction. EDS is used to identify different composition distribution. The Differetial Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) is applied to study the microstructure evolution in AM bronze. This technique reveals the temperature ranges where phase transformations occur. The chemical reaction, the appearance of precipitate phases and the retained β phase can be evaluated by DSC. The techniques allows to determine the appropriate heat treatment temperatures. Microhardness test are used to evaluate its mechanical properties. Fatigue properties of NAB by WAAM are analyzed according to its characteristic microstructure and appropriate heat treatments are also predicted for further improving.

Containers are transported to the hinterland by truck, train, or barge. In the ports of Rotterdam and Antwerp, container barges have high in-port times, of which they spend a lot of time ineffectively. This affects these ports’ connectivity with the hinterland. The goal of this research, therefore, is to identify the main causes for, and most promising measures against, high barge in-port times. These causes and measures were gathered by desk research, using scientific literature, technical reports, and interviews with stakeholders.<br/>To assess the importance of different causes and compare different measures, a simulation model was built, based on Rotterdam. Because there are many deep-sea terminals and barges that each make their own planning, and many aspects of the in-port operations are subject to stochastics, Simio was used to make an agent-based simulation model. Although many factors contributing to high in-port times were found in the literature, the majority of them contribute to two overarching causes: there is insufficient barge handling capacity at deep-sea terminals, and coordination problems result in inefficient utilisation of the available capacity. Therefore, many measures that are suggested in the literature aim to mitigate the negative effects of the two main causes.<br/>The current state of the system was replicated in the model, in order to understand the response of in-port times to various system changes. Experiments evaluated changes to terminals’ barge handling capacity by increasing the capacity, or by changing how current capacity is distributed over time. The number of calls barges make on average was changed. Additionally, the effects of market mechanics on the in-port times of barges with different levels of willingness-to-pay were assessed, by auctioning timeslots or allowing barges to submit priority requests. Finally, increased information sharing and instantaneous reservations were implemented as an experiment.<br/>The findings indicate that increasing handling capacity at terminals can strongly improve barge in-port times. Without increasing capacity the system can also be improved by increasing the information that is exchanged between agents, thereby influencing the way agents interact. Finally, implementing a priority system can reliably reduce in-port time for barges willing to pay for that service, without negatively impacting the average in-port times of the whole system.","Container Transport; Container Barge; Agent-based simulation; Barge in-port times; Hinterland transport","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

The cost associated with this type of maneuvers is one of its major drawbacks, and performing an inclination change in orbit would require a large part of the total mass budget of the mission. Moreover, launching such vehicles or satellites would demand the usage of a larger launcher, further contributing to the increase of the mission cost. An alternative to the fully propulsive maneuver is the aeroassisted maneuver, proposed London (1961), where the vehicle performs one or more passes through the atmosphere of the central body. This allows for the aerodynamic forces to steer and brake the vehicle, reducing its orbital speed and changing the inclination of the orbit with less propellant required. To investigate the impact of the aeroassisted maneuver in the propellant requirements, the following research question was proposed:<br/><br/>What is the impact of using an aeroassisted maneuver in reducing the amount of propellant needed to achieve a certain orbital inclination change?<br/><br/>A simulation environment was developed using the TU Delft Astrodynamics Toolbox, capable of simulating an aeroassisted trajectory from a Geostationary Earth Orbit to a Low Earth Orbit, with an associated inclination change. A simple lateral guidance algorithm, capable of tracking the orbital plane, was also developed, and a node control algorithm was implemented to chose the guidance nodes during each individual trajectory.<br/>The performance of three vehicle configurations, with different lift-to-drag ratios, were investigated in terms of achievable inclination change. The HORUS-2B, a vehicle with a moderate to high lift-to-drag ratio, was the most suitable to perform the maneuver, as it allows for a larger inclination change while reducing the energy dissipation rate in the atmosphere. The simulator was integrated with an optimization algorithm, such that optimal trajectories could be investigated.<br/><br/>The performance of the aeroassisted maneuver is measured in terms of three different objectives: the offset in inclination between the final and the target orbital planes, the velocity impulse applied at atmospheric exit to target the desired apogee and the maximum heat load experienced by the vehicle during any given atmospheric pass. The NSGA-II optimizer is selected to minimize the three objectives, and several parameters are tuned to increase the probability of finding the global optimum, namely the tuning parameters of the optimizer itself, the values of the constraint and the number of guidance nodes. It was found that an orbital plane of 20 degrees could be targeted with an error of only 0.28%, with the total maneuver requiring 87.32% less Delta V needed from thrust impulses. The heat load obtained is 1315.6 kJ/m2, which is well within the allowable range for Thermal Protection Systems currently available, and the total number of atmospheric passes is five. Moreover, it is possible to improve the Delta V performance by 193.2%, if the inclination change is limited to approximately 15 degrees, resulting in a single-pass atmospheric trajectory and an apoapsis targeting impulse of merely 1.692 m/s. <br/><br/>This trajectory would however result in a very high heat load acting on the vehicle, specifically 3098.1 kJ/m2. A single-atmosphere pass is the reason for the high heat stress acting on the vehicle. A four-atmosphere pass trajectory with a maximum heat load of only 1307.6 kJ/m2 was also found, which still achieves an inclination change of around 15 degrees, and provides a performance improvement of 110.5% in terms of propulsive Delta V needed. <br/><br/>Trajectories with more atmospheric passes result in higher achievable inclination changes, but at the cost of higher apoapsis targeting Delta V. If the mission requires smaller inclination changes, and has tighter constraints in the heat maximum heat load, trajectories with many passages are also an option, and part of the Pareto fronts obtained from the optimization. <br","Optimization; Re-entry; Aeroassisted; Astrodynamics; Hypersonic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-11-28","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

As more ultrasound transducer elements are built into such probes to improve image quality and frame rate, it becomes increasingly difficult to accommodate the cables needed to connect these elements to an imaging system. Among several reported cable-count reduction approaches, in-probe digitization of the received echo signals is a promising solution, as it allows digital data-link techniques to be leveraged to minimize cable count. This work takes a previously-developed application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for an IVUS probe as a starting point. This ASIC employs a load-modulation datalink to transmit digitized echo signals of one element via a single micro-coaxial cable at 0.6 Gb/s. This thesis extends this work to multi-bit per-symbol signalling to increase the data rate, allowing the echo signals of multiple elements to be combined into one cable. First, the measured performance of the existing ASIC is compared to simulation results, showing the need for an S-parameter based cable model to faithfully reproduce the measured performance. Based on this simulation model, load modulation with a maximum of three bits per symbol and a maximum symbol rate of 600 MHz is investigated. The trade-off between data-transmission conditions and bit-error rate is investigated and gives a general idea about how fast the data rate can be. An experimental setup is proposed to experimentally validate the performance of multi-bit load-modulation data links. For this, a prototype chip has been designed that includes a multi-bit load-modulation circuit and interfaces with an FPGA that provides test data. The chip has been taped out in a TSMC 0.18 um HV CMOS technology. Post-layout simulation shows that the prototype is able to generate a data rate of 1.6 Gb/s when there are two bits per symbol at the symbol rate of 800 MHz. Compared to the 0.6 Gb/s of the previous design, this is a substantially higher data rate.","miniature ultrasound probes; data rate; one cable","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-11-28","","","","Electrical Engineering | Microelectronics","",""

Not only does this raise animal welfare issues, it also causes significant economic loss from reduced milk yield and fertility. Despite that, prevalence of lameness in dairy farms is high because farmers are unable to dedicate time and labor to identify lame cattle. Many automatic lameness detection solutions have been proposed in literature. Machine vision solutions using cameras are especially attractive because cameras do not require much space and is relatively low cost. However, none of the machine vision solutions so far have been robust enough to be useful to dairy farmers. This thesis attempts to remedy that by applying deep learning methods to the pose estimation of cattle to analyze their gait and detect the presence of lameness. 313 videos of cattle walking were recorded at a dairy farm. Images were randomly extracted from those videos and 17 body parts were manually annotated on the images to fine-tune a deep neural network pretrained on ImageNet. The fine-tuned network is then used to automatically find the trajectories of the 17 body parts in all 313 videos. 84 gait features were extracted from each video based on these trajectories. Each video was also manually given a locomotion score between 1-5 by 2 experts. Due to the small number of locomotion score 5 cows, locomotion score 4 and 5 were merged into one group for analysis. Two experiments were conducted with these gait features and locomotion scores: a) Data analysis to test significant differences between locomotion score groups and b) Automatic locomotion score classification. Data analysis was done using ANOVA followed by Bonferroni correction. Stance time related features were the best at differentiating locomotion score groups, but were unable to differentiate between locomotion score pair 2&lt;&gt;3. Step length related features were also relatively good at differentiating different locomotion score groups, but have trouble differentiating between locomotion score pairs 1&lt;&gt;2 and 2&lt;&gt;3. For the automatic classification, the 84 gait features were first reduced to 3 features using LDA. Then, various classifiers were trained with these 3 features and locomotion score as labels. The linear discriminant classifier achieved the highest classification rate at 85.6%, but this number was heavily skewed by the high classification rate of locomotion score 1 group (95.3%), which also makes up the largest portion of the dataset. To correct this imbalance in the dataset, the prior probabilities were set equal for each locomotion score group and the classifiers were trained again. This resulted in much better classification rates with the linear discriminant classifier for locomotion score 2 and 3 (71% and 84% respectively) at the expense of lowering the classification rate of locomotion score 1 (83.4%).","cattle; Pose estimation; Pattern Recognition; gait analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-17","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

The aortic vessel wall abnormally dilates due to multiple possible causes and may eventually rupture. It is characterized by several factors leading to the extreme dilation due to the degeneration of the vessel wall extracellular matrix (ECM). It is often asymptomatic making it difficult to diagnose before rupture. The etiology of AAA is complex and not yet fully understood. Hallmarks of the disease are; loss of elastin and vascular smooth muscle cells, influx of inflammatory cells which produce proteases, increased stiffness due to higher collagen content, disturbed ECM network organization and an eventual destruction of the ECM leading to the vessel rupture. These changes may be related to environmental factors in combination with a genetic susceptibility, or by major defects in genes involved in the ECM homeostasis. Family history and genetic conditions play an important role in aneurysms. In approximately 20 % of aneurysm patients there is a familial disease or a family history of aneurysms, and in these families a major genetic defect is to be expected. Aneurysm patients show pathogenic variants in less than 5 % of the screened patients however, variants of unknown clinical significance in aneurysm genes occur at a much higher frequency. To determine the effect of these variants in aneurysm genes, functional assays which display a change in the function of the gene product needs to be established. Tissue engineering, in recent years, have become an alternative approach to animal models in developing tissue repair/replacement grafts or disease models. For this study, a cell-derived self-assembly tissue ring culture method was chosen and optimized for the use of patient cells with different pathogenic variants in aneurysm genes. After optimizing the culture conditions, the ring formation and structural ECM characteristics were compared for patient and control cases. The kinetics of ring formation showed differences in behavior and speed for patient and control cell lines. Patient lines took longer to settle into the ring shape and contract to their final thickness. The incidence of ring failure was higher in patient cases. The final patient rings were significantly thinner and non-uniform, additionally they showed a significantly lower area fraction of collagen compared to the controls. The tissue rings could not be mechanically tested due to their fragility. However, it was possible to identify the structural differences between the patient and control cases which were expected due to the pathogenic variants in the aneurysm genes of these patients. With further improvements, this method could be a potential functional assay for revealing the effects of variants of unknown significance in aneurysm genes, waiting to be identified.","Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm; Disease modeling; Tissue engineering; Genetic variations; Self-Assembly","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-28","","","","","",""

Moreover, irrespective of the safety aspect, learning optimal control policies from scratch can be inefficient and therefore time-consuming. In this research, the safe curriculum learning paradigm is proposed to address the problems of learning safety and efficiency simultaneously. Curriculum learning makes the process of learning more tractable, thereby allowing the intelligent agent to learn desired behavior more effectively. This is achieved by presenting the agent with a series of intermediate learning tasks, where the knowledge gained from earlier tasks is used to expedite learning in succeeding tasks of higher complexity. This framework is united with views from safe learning to ensure that safety constraints are adhered to during the learning curriculum. This principle is first investigated in the context of optimal regulation of a generic mass-spring-damper system using neural networks, and is subsequently applied in the context of optimal attitude control of a quadrotor UAV with uncertain dynamics.","flight control; reinforcement learning; adaptive dynamic programming; curriculum learning; safe learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This final thesis explains a 6 degree-of-freedom simulator sickness prediction model based on observer theory including the visual system. The model incorporates state-of-the-art knowledge of human spatial orientation perception and qualitative theories that try to explain motion sickness. Predictions are made regarding the simulator sickness incidence and expected rotary and translational motions for different motion and sensory paradigms. A between-subjects experiment was conducted to verify the model. Furthermore, the effect of adding scaled, but veridical, yaw motion to a simulator on the sickness incidence and severity while driving in urban environments was investigated. Participants were required to indicate a misery scale score every minute and to fill in the simulator sickness questionnaire prior to and after the experiment. Additionally, the perceived motion incongruence was measured together with head movements. Three cases were considered; a no-motion case, a case with a scaled yaw movement and a case with a scaled yaw movement together with pitch and roll motions. A significant relationship has been found between the simulator sickness prediction model outputs and the experimental outputs. Therefore, the model with the implemented visual system could be used to better understand<br/>and predict simulator sickness. A significant relationship has also been found between the measured perceived motion incongruence and the simulator sickness incidence. This perceived motion incongruence can be used to quantify a part of the qualitative sensory rearrangement theory. Furthermore, humans that indicated lower sickness scores, moved their head significantly more along with the direction of the curve. Head movement strategies can be taught to participants of simulator studies to attenuate simulator sickness symptoms. Finally, significantly less participants dropped out in the cases that included simulator motion when driving in urban environments. The findings in this final thesis could assist in attenuating the number of drop-outs during driving simulation testing in urban scenarios.","Simulator Sickness, Human Spatial Orientation Perception, Modeling, Sensory Rearrangement.","en","master thesis","","","","","","Please place this final thesis under embargo for the maximum period.","","2024-11-28","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

While Out of Office Workations primary target is the digital nomad community, this master thesis focuses on identifying different areas of opportunity for a goal-oriented retreat in new potential market segments since their ambition is to become Europe’s customer-centric, innovative and sustainable retreat solution. To achieve this ambition, Out of Office Workations must discover how to fit their offer to new market segments to create a long term sustainable growth with their workation service by stimulating a work-time-balance setting. First, to gain a holistic understanding of what is a workation and what are the factors associated with this service highly exploratory research, website content analysis, semi-structured interviews with workation providers helped clarified the context, the target audience, and the different value propositions behind the offer of workations. Next, interviews with potential clients are executed to find new market segments for Out of Office. I identified three customer profiles in these interviews, two being addressed by the competitors and one remains relatively uncharted: the consulting segment. I have chosen this customer profile as this new market segment is not being forwarded by the competitors representing a valuable opportunity for Out of Office to scale their workation to a new unexplored direction. To properly fit the workation offer to the consulting segment, ten interviews with consultants from a variety of consulting firms were scheduled to understand this customer profile. Once gaining a more detailed and structured view of the consultants’ professional and personal life, the design solution “Out of Office Professional Services” is created to meet their needs, aspirations and frustrations. The presented solution is intentionally transformed as a quotation form to integrate it into the Out of Office website. This quotation form enables consultants to know what value proposition is suitable for their needs and facilitates the construction of their own workation. Once having the answers from the quotation form, Out of Office can create a personal and tailored-made experience for them.

For the former, we use sparsity-regularized inverse problems to select nodes. For the latter, we use tools from Compressed Sensing and Sparse Sensing to select the nodes with the relevant model output. We show that we can select all the relevant nodes in a single shot fashion, hence avoiding reliance on multiple training phases.

To optimize the route planning, it is important that the travel time predictions come close to reality.

To predict the travel time, first a speed has to be assigned to each road in the digital map, after which the shortest path can be calculated. This research proposes a speed prediction model based on neural networks to predict the speed of each road such that the travel time prediction accuracy is improved. The neural network speed prediction model will be compared to the current speed prediction model, which is based on random forest. The speed prediction model first learns from preprocessed GPS data that is obtained from two different companies that operate with trucks. After relationships have been found between the driven speed and road properties (e.g. speed limit, road width, tunnel, etc.), the speed prediction model predicts a speed for each road in the digital map. Subsequently, the shortest path can be calculated from the first to the last GPS point of different routes. Then the predicted travel times from the shortest paths were compared to the real driven travel times. After comparison, it turned out that for both GPS data sets, the neural network speed prediction model did not outperform the travel time prediction accuracy in sMdAPE_TT of the random forest speed prediction model.","Travel Time Prediction Accuracy; GPS Data; Truck; Neural Network","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

However, in terms of concrete recycling, there is insufficient communication of the novel technologies in the construction sector and supply chain systems are not introduced in real-world problems. The current research focuses on a closed-loop approach concerning the production of conventional concrete based on a supply chain design. Specifically, the conventional and closed-loop supply chain of the production of concrete are designed in accordance with the SCOR Model. The main differences are identified and a ‘Concrete-to-concrete Recycling Plant’ is proposed as a solution to the EoL problem. It argues to change completely the conventional supply chain of concrete, and therefore recommendations for its future location in an urban environment are given. Additionally, a calculation tool regarding the recycling plant is developed in order to evaluate the suggested solution. The present study demonstrates that for each category of concrete, either prefabricated or site-cast, a recycling plant should be located next to the prefabricated or mortar industry in order to diminish transportation and inventory costs, as well as take advantage of the operating speeds of the novel technologies that compose the plant. Results indicate that a recycling plant is in accordance with the current market conditions and constitutes an efficient solution to the EoL concrete treatment by making concrete a circular material.

The relative contribution and interaction of the physiological systems that alter or maintain adequate BP is largely unknown. Developing a closed-loop model is necessary to investigate the complex physiological function and interaction and can give a better insight in the factors contributing to OH. The aim of this study is to describe and validate a closed-loop model of the BP regulation system that describes a posture related BP drop and subsequent recovery. Methods: The procedure to validate the face-validity of the closed-loop model consists of: 1) simulating the closed-loop model and 2) subsystems separately, to compare them to equivalent experimental data; 3) evaluate model simulations based on physiological knowledge (predetermined hypotheses); and 4) evaluating which parameters dominate the closed-loop model behavior of the BP signal by performing a sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, model adjustments have been made as a first attempt to improve face-validity, i.e. control adjustments of the time-varying controlled parameters representing the autonomic regulation.<br/>Key results: For subsystem ‘cardiovascular system’ the cross-correlation coefficient and VAF for the signals indicate that the model is able to predict the behavior of the equivalent experimental data. Furthermore, adaptation of the heart rate (HR) to the change of the tilt can be seen. The BP decreases, which is detected by the autonomic nervous system which in turn increases the HR. However, the model does not compensate for the posture related BP drop. Not when systematically changing parameter values, changing parameters to optimal values simultaneously or amplifying the signals of the time-varying controlled parameters representing autonomic regulation. Conclusions: The closed-loop model shows reasonable face-validity with respect to the posture related BP drop in healthy young adults, but poor face-validity with respect to the BP recovery. Indicating that the subsystems modeling the mechanical properties of the cardiovascular system and hydrostatic pressure differences adequately represent physiology, in contrast to the subsystems aiming to actively restore BP. Future research should improve model elements representing the autonomic regulation, i.e. the control of time-varying parameters due to autonomic regulation on posture related BP changes.","Orthostatic hypotension; postural changes; mathematical modelling; closed-loop model; blood pressure regulation; cardiovascular system; heart rate regulation; autonomic regulation; cerebral autoregulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-30","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

The final goal is to determine the strength of the connection. This is done with a calculation method, which may be used outside of this research by designers for an estimation of the design strength of their connection. A simplified design for the connection is set up as a reference design. It is loaded by two load combinations of the use stage of the building, a symmetric and an asymmetric load combination. A behaviour prediction is set up for the reference design under these load combinations. Based on that prediction, additions to the design are studied, which should improve the connection strength. Two adjusted designs are chosen to analyse alongside the reference design: a design with the integrated steel beam supported by additional steel webs at the connection and a design with the integrated steel beam being filled with mortar at the connection. The three designs are numerically modelled and analysed with the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) in DIANA FEA. With the results of the numerical analysis, the design strength of the connection is calculated. The numerical results show that the structural screed and the bottom column are the governing connection parts. The structural screed in the reference model is influenced most by the steel webs of the beam underneath and a limited load transfer area, which leads to higher stresses in the concrete. In the adjusted models this situation is improved, with the model with a mortar filling being the best adjustment, as it provides the maximum load transfer area. The bottom column is most affected by the bending of the steel beam flanges due to the load of the floor, causing a large load to be transferred over a small area at the column edges. The adjusted models do not show a strong improvement here, as the adjustments are limited in the stiffening of the beam flanges. The calculation of the design strength of the connection shows the adjustment of the mortar filling to be the best solution. However, the final design strength is low compared to the design strength of the concrete in the structural screed or the columns. This is the result of the horizontal tension in the structural screed, which reduces the concrete strength. A better result may be obtained by the removal of the structural screed at the connection and the placement of the concrete column directly on top of the steel beam. This adjustment needs a further research. <br/>The conclusion is that the researched design in its current form is not effective enough to be applied in practice, but its drawbacks can be solved with a few adjustments to the design, making it an effective design solution.","THQ; FEM; Connection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

The journey of migration is also a process of transformation, during which people went through the self-deconstruction and reshape on many levels. For those who went across borders to the Netherlands in their early twenties to study or work, building a new life also means making an adjustment to a new reality where new information, values, cultural norms and social relations flooded in. This process may be filled with excitement and freshness for people who are able to respond positively to the adjustments, while the majority of people have a mixed experience of challenging, overwhelming, stressful or even traumatising situations. In the case of young Chinese migrants in the Netherlands, because of the unique cultural identity brought by history and the Chinese social system, their emotional struggles in the western world are relatively particular and obscure. This graduation project focused on developing a new vision towards migration for client NPC(NextPort Chine) and a design based on this vision. This is formulated in the assignment: Designing a product(or service system) based on research outcomes of the emotional needs of Chinese migrants who are deciding to make or have already made a decision to stay in the Netherlands, by 2025. ViP(Vision in Product Design) method was applied to build a future CHN-NL migration context and define the interaction method in this project. This future context was shaped by two overall determining driving forces and seven sub driving forces. Twelve cases in which people struggle personally or socially during the migration journey were finally revealed. After evaluating if the twelve cases were meaningful, in line with company scope, and potential to be developed into a functional product, two of the cases were finally chosen to be targeted design goal: Goal A: To help people restore their inner balance again after the impact of the migration process when people’s inner reality is confronted which can cause a psychological imbalance. <br/>Goal B: To help people make peace with loneliness. After defining the ways of accomplishing the two design goals, two design solutions were then proposed to realise each of the design goals. Generated from Goal A, a mental care mini-program embedded in WeChat Application was designed to help with emotional struggles among young Chinese migrants to the Netherlands. Both peer support and access to professional mental therapy were provided to reduce the psychological imbalance. Generated from Goal B, a toolkit including deconstruction of the feeling of loneliness and a zine of loneliness objects was designed to help people cope with the emotions and rebuild self-esteem.

Recently, researchers have tried to close the gap between natural language description of the system and the actual implementation in code using natural language processing techniques. The techniques from NLP have also proven to be useful at generating code snippets while developers work on source code. This literature survey aims to present an overview of the field of code generation using Natural Language Processing techniques. Method: Google Scholar search engine was used to search for papers regarding code generation using NLP. Results: A total of 428 abstracts were screened to reveal 36 papers suitable for the survey. The found papers were categorized into 6 groups by application type. Conclusion: Source code has similarities to natural language, hence NLP techniques have been successfully used to generate code.

In this paper, a model-free learning algorithm with Reinforcement Learning in the loop, based on Apprenticeship Learning, is therefore proposed. This algorithm uses external measurement to improve on the initial demonstration, finally producing a policy that surpasses the demonstration. Efficiency is further improved by utilising the policies produced during the learning process.

Grabbing and pushing objects without the need to stop our hands at the moment of impact is an example of this. Although humans learn and execute such tasks with relative ease, robots cannot. The difficulty in executing such tasks lies in the complexity of control at the moment of impact. Traditional control approaches avoid contact at non-zero speed by a so called transition phase in which the relative velocity is reduced to zero near contact. Learning from demonstration refers to the process used to transfer new skills to a machine through human demonstrations instead of traditional, time consuming, robotic programming. The goal of this research is to develop a learning strategy that is able to learn and execute tasks in which contact is made at non-zero speed. <br/><br/>The new learning strategy is an adaptation of the state of the art learning from demonstration method, probabilistic movement primitives, combined with the impact-aware robot control strategy, reference spreading. Probabilistic movement primitives translate demonstration data into a trajectory distribution. Reference spreading tackles the problem of having a different time of impact than expected by defining a new error which compares the current state to an extended reference trajectory, switching to the extended trajectory of another mode upon impact. In this work, these methods are combined by extending the demonstration data, to subsequently fit the probabilistic movement primitives resulting in extended trajectory distribution for multiple modes. This trajectory, in conjunction with the reference spreading error can be used for control. The proposed method is numerically validated by simulating two end effectors, dynamically picking up a box to then put it on top of a shelf. The task is successfully learned and executed, showing the effectiveness of the impact-aware learning strategy.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Zero Emission Fuels B.V. (ZEF), a technology start-up based in the Netherlands, is developing a small scale alkaline electrolysis cell (AEC), which is integrated in a methanol producing micro-plant. The challenge of this project is to look into the use of polymers for the encapsulation of the ZEF AEC. The conditions of the ZEF AEC are not to be neglected. The system will run in a 30wt% KOH solution at a temperature of 90 °C and a pressure of 50 bar. Not many polymers will be able to withstand these conditions for a desired lifetime of 20 years. Using CES EduPack, a selection of 30 potentially suitable polymers has been made, from which high density polyethylene (HDPE), 40% glass-reinforced polyphenylene sulfide (PPS-40%gf) and polysulfone (PSU) are further investigated. Based on a literature review and a simple KOH ageing test, HDPE is found unsuitable for application in the ZEF AEC. PPS-40%gf and PSU have been subjected to durability testing for a range of different conditions involving a variety of KOH concentrations (15, 30 and 45wt%), and two oxygen partial pressures (O2 at 5 bar and air with pO2=20%) at different temperatures (90, 120 and 170 °C). The purpose of the ageing experiments is to give a better understanding of the effect of these parameters on the structure and integrity of the polymer; and to eventually be able to acquire a lifetime prediction. Extensive characterisation of the exposed samples has been carried out using different techniques, including weight measurement, tensile testing, DMA, creep-recovery testing, DSC, FTIR, XRD and SEM. After 12 weeks of ageing, it is found that glass-filled polymers are unsuitable for application in a strong alkaline solution at elevated temperatures, due to the dissolution of the glass fibres, which leads to a reduction in mechanical and barrier properties. However, the PPS matrix and PSU are found to be resistant to thermo-oxidative and chemical degradation in the tested ageing conditions. Only subtle changes in mechanical, visco-elastic and thermal behaviour are observed, which can be assigned to the effects of physical ageing. Due to the undesirable brittle nature of PPS, it can be concluded that PSU is the most promising candidate for the long-term application in alkaline electrolysis.","Polymers; Ageing; Lifetime","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-27","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Goessen, Petra (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Dikes constructed of a sand core, clay cover and natural vegetation as (landside) slope protection are common ﬂood defence structures in the Netherlands. The design parameters, such as the crest height of dikes, are determined through risk assessment to reduce the remaining probability of a failure mechanism, such as overﬂow. Little is known about the exact process leading to failure of the typical Dutch dikes in case the failure conditions actually occur. The most notable ﬂoods in the Netherlands have all been caused by dike breaching, where local damage in the dike lead to breach formation. This research describes the process of breach formation due to overﬂow and determines what design parameters affect the resistance of a dike against breaching. The proposed model (BRAM, a Breach Resistance Analysis Model) combines existing methods to determine the time-to-failure of the grass and clay cover with a newly developed process-oriented headcut erosion model. The model assesses the total time-to-failure of a dike through sequential failure of its components. The following process is simulated. Overﬂow over a dike causes a turbulent ﬂow along the landside slope, resulting in local damage to the grass cover on either a prescribed weak spot or slope transition. The clay cover is subsequently eroded and the granular core material becomes exposed to the ﬂow. A key assumption in the applied method lies in the fact that every newly exposed layer is less resistant to erosion than the layer above, resulting in slope steepening. Therefore, a near-vertical cliff, referred to as a headcut, is formed. When the overﬂowing water no longer follows the proﬁle of the steep slope, a cascading ﬂow, resembling a waterfall, forms a scour pit. The turbulent ﬂow in this scour pit also erodes the core material of the dike, allowing horizontal erosion to undercut the slope. The undercutting of the slope causes the headcut to tumble over, moving the headcut and jet impact point to move towards the waterside slope, essentially restarting the scour process. This iterative process continues until the invert height of the dike is lowered to zero and the overﬂow rate is increased further. Model validation shows good agreement with test results on both large and small scale, as long as the assumptions regarding the structure of the dike hold (a dike proﬁle consisting of a granular core under a clay layer and grass cover). When applied to three case studies, the BRAM-model predicts a similar total time-to-failure as the most advanced current model, posed by d’Eliso (2007). The predicted time-to-failure for the grass cover shows a signiﬁcant difference. The BRAM-model predicts the grass cover to fail signiﬁcantly faster than the model by d’Eliso (2007). This difference is offset by a longer predicted time-to-failure of the clay cover. Finally, the proposed model predicts a 50% slower headcut migration rate, as compared to the results by D’Eliso. This is a result of the more advanced description of the headcut erosion process. As the time-to-failure of the headcut migration phase is relatively short compared to the total breach formation process (between 10% and 25%), the total predicted time-to-failure is quite similar between both models. The main advantage of the BRAM-model is its suitability for design testing. The main weakness remains the unpredictable location of headcut initiation, which depends too strongly on spatial variation of the resistance of the dike to be predicted accurately, based on available data. Design parameters to increase the time-to-breaching have been identiﬁed. The most relevant were the steepness of the dike slope and thickness of the clay cover. Sensitivity analysis showed that the steepness and thickness of the clay cover, but also the porosity of the core material can be adapted to increase the time-to-failure of a dike. A breach-resistant dike may be designed for a limited overﬂow duration. Case studies showed three test dikes to sustain an overﬂow rate of 100 l/m/s for various hours by the grass and clay cover. As soon as the core material becomes exposed, the breach formation process accelerates signiﬁcantly. The exact duration depends on the proﬁle and construction material of the dike.","dike breaching; headcut erosion; breach modelling; dike design; flood risk","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

The country significantly depends on the seven nuclear power plants since they account for more than half of the national electricity production (depending on the availability of the reactors). The Belgian TSO Elia has investigated the urgency of adequacy and flexible electricity sources and proposed a Capacity Remuneration Mechanism (CRM), which should encourage investments in generation capacity to maintain the security of supply in Belgium.

Eneco is one of the largest utility companies in the Belgian electricity market for consumers and considers participating in the Belgian capacity auction with EES capacity. The competitiveness of EES is assessed based on the constructed competitiveness evaluation model. The model considers the long-term capacity remuneration, possible costs related to the capacity market, storage costs, and revenue derived in the electricity market. A capacity provider is considered as competitive if the expected costs are smaller than the expected revenue from being in the capacity market.

The storage costs, intraday market income, payback obligation, and FCR income are modelled for the photo years 2020, 2025 and 2030. The Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) will be deployed in the Frequency Containment Reserve (FCR) market and intraday market because of the largest revenue potential. The expected intraday market income is assessed by the software tool Linny-R which applies the optimization technique linear programming based on the rolling horizon approach. BESS operating only in the intraday market is not expected to be competitive because of the relatively high required capacity remuneration above € 100/kW/year. Auction clearing prices in other European CRMs are below € 50/kW/year. BES does not need capacity remuneration from 2025 onwards with today’s average FCR price. However, it is not very likely that the FCR price stays the same in the future. More realistic is 35% capacity price reduction from the average FCR price scenario of € 79.000/MW/year to the minimum FCR price scenario of € 51.000 /MW/year. BES might be competitive in this scenario with a relatively high de-rating factor and no payback obligation of the CRM. In the halved today’s average FCR price scenario, BES will not be competitive in 2025 given the relatively high required capacity remuneration of minimum capacity remuneration of at least € 69/kW/year. The results of this research are not convincing to regard BES as a competitive technology in the upcoming Belgium capacity market. Revenue stacking by combining the FCR and intraday market income would increase the competitiveness of BES and is necessary. Further research should focus on deployment strategies of BESS in different markets and FCR price developments.","BESS; CRM; Capacity Market","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

Renewable power generation by solar and wind is increasing, requiring flexible operation to balance the load on the energy grid with the ability to rapidly adjust the output. Gas turbines with a combustion system for hydrogen operation offers a low carbon solution to support the stability of the energy grid. This provides a solution capturing the needs for energy storage, in the form of hydrogen, and flexible power generation. High flame temperatures in the primary zone facilitates the production of NO<sub>x</sub> which can be reduced by using premixed combustors. But this introduces the risk of flame flashback. Several combustor concepts have been proposed and studied in the past few years to tackle the problem of flame flashback in premixed high hydrogen fuel combustors. This study looks at one of the concepts which uses Aerodynamically Trapped Vortex to stabilize the flame and studies the flow and flame behavior in the combustor. Numerical simulations for the analysis were performed with commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation package AVL FIRE™. The flow field characterization was focused on the investigation of the influence of the inlet velocity and inlet turbulence intensity (u′) on the mean velocity, wall velocity gradient and turbulence intensity in the combustor. To study the flame stabilization mechanism, reactive simulations were performed at two fuel equivalence ratios. The combustion regime of the flame, wall velocity gradient and temperature distribution in the combustor were quantified from the simulation results. A validation study was performed prior to the analysis of the ATV combustor to validate both the turbulence and the reactive models for premixed hydrogen combustion. The models were validated against the experiments performed in a dump stabilized cylindrical combustor at Combustion Research Laboratory, Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), Switzerland. The k-ε and k-ζ-f turbulence models were selected for modelling the turbulence. Simulations of non-reacting flow with k-ε model resulted in a more accurate prediction of the flow field, turbulence levels and recirculation zone than the k-ζ-f model. Combustion is modelled using the FIRE™ detailed chemistry solver with the k-ε turbulence model to resolve turbulence. No additional turbulence-chemistry interaction model is used in the current research. To reduce chemistry computational time, the multi-zone method is employed. A detailed chemistry approach with sufficient mesh resolution for modelling the reaction in 100% premixed hydrogen combustion predicted the flame behavior with acceptable accuracy. The flow analysis in the Aerodynamically Trapped Vortex (ATV) combustor revealed that the inlet velocity or inlet turbulence had no significant effect on the relative turbulence properties in the flame stabilization zone. The proposed design for the Aerodynamically Trapped Vortex (ATV) combustor was able to stabilize a 100% premixed hydrogen flames without flashback for the simulated conditions.","Hydrogen; Premixed flame; Flame flashback; Aerodynamically Trapped Vortex; Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

A shared opinion among counsellors is that as the chat conversation turns more difficult it takes longer and more effort to come up with a response. Supportive technology might resolve this ”writer’s block” by giving inspiration in the form of responses other counsellors gave to similar situations. 113 Suicide Prevention has an extensive chat corpus of previous conversation between help-seekers and counsellors that can be leveraged to find these situations. This thesis focuses on the design, development and experimental evaluation of a support system that aims to solve the problem of writer’s block for counsellors in suicide crisis chats.<br/>METHODS: A context-based retrieval system was build. SIF sentence embedding was used to find similar partial chats using cosine similarity. The chats in the corpus were split up and embedded using a sliding window approach, to retrieve only the relevant parts in the chat and reducing reading time for the counsellor. A within-subject experimental design (n=24) with three conditions (no support, support system, expert advice) was used to measure the system’s usefulness and to test the hypothesis that the system has a noticeable difference on counsellor responses, by using experts to blindly label the responses. Furthermore, another within-subject experimental design was used to test the hypothesis that the counsellors can distinguish be- tween partial chats provided by the retrieval system and partial chats randomly selected from the corpus. For this part of the evaluation, counsellors blindly rated suggestions on how much they related to the context of a given chat.<br/>RESULTS: Counsellors rated the support system with a 71.04 on the SUS questionnaire, cor- responding to a good adjective rating. There was variability between chats for counsellor rating for utility of the information provided by the support system. Experts noticed a significant difference between the support and expert advice conditions. Lastly, the suggestions based on the context positively affected counsellor rating of relatedness to context of the chat. CONCLUSION: Technology using NLP techniques can provide useful information for only chat counsellors to help with writer’s block.

This convection is driven by atmospheric cooling during winter, which brings the surface water into the intermediate and deep layers by uniformizing water mass properties. This homogeneous layer is called Mixed Layer (ML). As a result of this convection, stratification is no longer maintained, and the Mixed Layer Depth (MLD) deepens. During this deepening, an enormous amount of potential energy is converted to kinetic energy, and meso- and sub-mesoscale instabilities develop. After wintertime, the MLD starts to shallow again. Atmospheric-induced convection ceases or decreases significantly and physical components return to stratified conditions. Baroclinic instabilities grown to mesoscale or geostrophic scale play a role in restratifying the ML through the formation of coherent ocean eddies. This chain of processes follows a seasonal cycle that strongly depends on the imbalance between horizontal and vertical buoyancy gradients. A practical way to quantify this imbalance is the use of the Ertel potential vorticity or a derived magnitude as the Richardson angle, which allow to infer the existence of instabilities and to classify them respectively.<br/>This study analyzes the physical processes behind the MLD seasonal variability in the Labrador Sea. To this end, high-resolution model data (1/12° × 1/12°) from a global simulation has been used. An evaluation of spatial and temporal patterns of the MLD and energy conversion is provided, and the dominant types of instabilities are determined. It is hypothesized that these instabilities drive the energy conversion and the growth of coherent mesoscale eddies, which can modify the MLD and restratify the ocean. Finally, the sequential interactions among the processes are investigated to provide better understanding about seasonal MLD variability. This study shows that the density-based MLDs with a threshold of 0.03 kg m^-3 are the most credible values, and the spatial and temporal patterns of energy conversion and gravitational/symmetric instabilities are in phase with the MLD variability. The energy conversion is investigated by means of the available potential energy (APE), kinetic energy (KE) and Energy Ratio (ER) which is introduced in this study, and a large amount of gravitational and/or symmetric instabilities is found within ML, especially in the upper ocean layers. The role of baroclinic instabilities is investigated with the Eady growth rate, while the presence of coherent mesoscale eddies is inferred from the Okubo-Weiss parameter and the Eddy Kinetic Energy, whose size is limited by the internal Rossby radius. This study shows that the MLD variability is the result of changes in the conversion between the available potential energy (APE) and kinetic energy (KE) as well as of the competition between ravitational/symmetric and baroclinic instabilities. The former favoring MLD deepening, and the latter favoring MLD shallowing.","Labrador Sea; Mixed Layer Depth; AMOC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","","61,-56"

Historically, the Huangpu River has reached its highest levels during landfalling typhoon events, which create a combined scenario that involves high sea water levels due to storm surge, and high river water levels consequent not only of the storm surge at the river mouth, but also of the runoff generated by precipitation in the upstream regions. This research project will focus on the later, assessing the impact of torrential rainfall during tropical storms on the water levels along the Huangpu River in Shanghai city. By studying the hydrological regime of the area of interest, three main watershed regions are identified for the Huangpu river basin; the Taihu lake basin situated upstream regulates the yearly discharge on the downstream areas of the river and is controlled by means of a flood gate which remains closed once a certain flood risk is identified, an agricultural area covered in its majority by an interconnected lake system, and the river basin which encompasses the remaining contributing regions to the system. A hydrological model is built for the Huangpu river basin following the rational method, identifying from satellite databases the dominant land cover classes of the region, the hydrological soil group based on the different soil contents, and the average slope around the area based on a digital elevation model. Using the precipitation data from typhoon Fitow, the hydrological model was used to estimate the corresponding discharge time-series from the storm to be used as input on a hydrodynamic model of the Huangpu river. The hydrodynamic model of the river was built using D-Flow Flexible Mesh, it was used to assess different scenarios of the river system configuration, allowing to understand not only the overall contribution of rainfall-runoff to the river discharge but also the effect of each of the catchments on the river system. The performance of this model, as well as of the hydrological model was observed by comparing the predicted values with the site measurements at two hydrological stations, one midstream at Huangpu Park which highlighted the strong influence of the tide on the water levels for the river sections closer to the sea, and one upstream at Mishidu where the influence of the rainfall runoff to the water levels could be observed. The hydrological model was then validated using the precipitation data from typhoon Haikui, taking the corresponding discharge time-series for it to the DFM river model and comparing the estimated water levels to the actual measurements. Finally the river profile with the maximum water levels along it as predicted by the DFM model was compared to the scenario modelled with no rainfall-runoff discharge and the measured embankment height to understand the contribution to flood risk of the torrential rainfall during tropical storms on the water levels along the Huangpu River.","Shanghai; Hydrological modeling; Delft 3D flexible mesh; flood risk","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","Additional thesis",""

Methods: The thesis conducted a participant observation with a total of seven triage-psychologists, organized three focus groups including triage-psychologists, managers, and training personnel with nearly forty participants, and administered an evaluation with thirty participants that included six triage-psychologist and twenty-four counselors regarding a prototype to assist in the training of 113's triage-psychologists. Prototype: The system specification provided a prototype with six personas where triage-psychologists can practice against one or many chatbots, or conversational agents, in different situations that pertain to training for 113. The conversational agents design was based upon the Rose of Leary interpersonal stance and the Beliefs, Desires, and Intentions (BDI) design paradigm. The system focused on how a conversational agent must react to triage-psychologists' inputs with respect to the subtleties in interpersonal communication and negotiation as it pertains to the 113 suicide helpline. Results: Evaluation results indicate that triage-psychologists found the learning environment motivational and the events in the environment as socially realistic.

These technologies process the recordings of surveillance cameras. Such recordings contain depictions of human actions such as ""running"", ""waving"", and ""aggression"". In the field of computer vision, automated detection of human actions in videos is known as action detection. Recently, deep learning models have been proposed for the task of action detection. Deep learning models for this task can be grouped into single-frame models and multi-frame models. Single-frame models detect actions using individual frames of videos whereas multi-frame models detect actions using sequences of frames.<br/>This thesis proposes to use multi-frame models as compared to single-frame models for action detection in surveillance videos. To compare multi-frame and single-frame models, we implement the ACT-detector. The ACT-detector is a deep learning model that takes as input a sequence of K frames and outputs tubelets (labeled sequences of bounding boxes). We train and evaluate ACT for various values of K on the VIRAT dataset. In our comparison, K=1 serves as the single-frame model and K&gt;1 as the multi-frame models. When compared qualitatively, we find that multi-frame models have less missed detections. When compared quantitatively, we find that multi-frame models outperform single-frame models in performance measures such as classification accuracy, MABO, frame-mAP, and video-mAP.<br/>To assess whether the improvements of multi-frame models yield purely from the increased number of frames, or also from the temporal order encoded by those frames, we experiment with training multi-frame models on unordered sequences of frames, i.e., sequences for which the frames are shuffled in time. When compared qualitatively, we find that multi-frame models have less precise localization when trained on unordered sequences. When compared quantitatively, we find that multi-frame models perform worse when trained on unordered sequences, indicating that multi-frame models learn temporal dynamics of actions. Nevertheless, even when trained on unordered sequences, multi-frame models outperform single-frame models for action detection in surveillance videos.","Video processing; Action detection; Deep learning; Surveillance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Its architecture is based on a pair-based ledger system; where pairs of nodes register their transactions on entangled blocks stored in local, immutable and ordered chain.

The second one uses anonymous auditing and localized dissemination to better perform regarding efficiency, at a small expense in terms of transaction duration.

This is a significant undertaking because, from literature, it is understood that wind turbines can affect the local environment. These impacts include, but are not limited to, changes in variables such as wind speed and turbulent kinetic energy. To accurately capture these effects and improve power forecast accuracy, weather prediction models numerically represent the physical effects of a wind farm (i.e., a wind farm's behaviour as a momentum sink and a source of turbulent kinetic energy) by incorporating a wind farm parameterization in the model. This study looked at two simulations (with and without a wind farm parameterization) from HARMONIE-AROME, an operational weather model, and assessed the performance of the wind farm parameterization by using the simulation results for the Belgian wind farm zone in the North Sea, and comparing it with observational data from Sentinel-1 SAR, floating LiDARs, measured power as well as results from a large-eddy simulation. The data was also composited based on wind direction and atmospheric stability and analysed. Most importantly, it was found, after comprehensive analysis, that the wind farm parameterization caused a marked improvement in the results of the model especially in the region downwind of a wind farm where the effects are most severely experienced. Specifically, the simulation with the wind farm parameterization reduced the overall wind bias to -0.028 m/s from 0.602 m/s when compared with observational data for the selected region. The overall power bias was also found to be approximately 1.92\%. Several hypotheses based on existing literature were also tested, and along with the composite analysis, indicated that the simulation with the wind farm parameterization performed well in most stability regimes with the exception of stable conditions. It was recommended that this be further explored to determine the cause. Recommendations for expanding the study to look at wind farm effects on surface fluxes in offshore regions have also been made.","Evaluation; HARMONIE-AROME; LES; Numerical weather forecasting; Wind farm; Wind farm parameterization; meteorology; atmospheric stability; wake effects; turbine wakes; turbulent kinetic energy; NWP models; wake studies; wind speed; Wind energy; wind direction; Sentinel-1; Floating LiDARs","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","",""

This can lead to unconservative predictions of the crack width and total deflection in the SLS (Serviceability Limit State). The large crack widths can cause problems related to durability, aesthetic appeal, maintainability and fluid tightness of the structure. An inspection in 2001 reveals extensive shear cracks in Grondal and Alvik bridges in Sweden. The problem is so severe that the bridges are temporarily closed. Later, the investigations reveal that although the bridges are designed according to Swedish codes, the provided shear reinforcement is insufficient for crack width control under service loads on the bridge. Therefore, it becomes imperative to evaluate the available crack width models and develop robust models for shear crack width prediction. A literature review of the available models for shear crack width is performed to identify the crucial parameters influencing shear crack width. Shear crack width is influenced by several parameters, but the most critical parameters are shear crack spacing, shear stirrup strain, principle strain in the cracked concrete and diagonal compression strut angle. Thereafter, various models available to evaluate these parameters are reviewed to understand their applicability and limitations.<br/>This is followed by a study for the analysis of performance of the models with respect to the experimental observations. Based on the limited experimental dataset, it is found that the Zakaria et al. (2011) shear crack spacing model, and the fib MC 2010 (Model Code 2010) crack spacing model (for members with orthogonal reinforcement) provide a conservative estimate for the shear crack spacing in RC (reinforced concrete) beams. The predictions from the current EC2 crack spacing model are slightly unconservative. All the three crack spacing models take into account the influence of bond transfer length on the stress distribution in concrete and reinforcement. It is also found that the SMCFT (Simplified Modified Compression Field Theory), CFT (Compression Field Theory) and CCC (Compression Chord Capacity) model provide estimates for the shear crack angle with small deviations from the experimentally observed values. However, all these three models predict flatter (smaller) mean shear crack angles as compared to the experimentally observed values. The SMCFT and CFT determine the diagonal compression strut angle with a consideration of deformations of reinforcement (transverse and longitudinal) and diagonally cracked concrete. On the other hand, the CCC model predicts the diagonal shear crack angle based on the assumption that the horizontal projection of the first branch of flexural-shear crack is equal to 0.85d where d is the effective depth to the longitudinal tensile reinforcement. According to comparison with the experimental observations referred in this study, the CCC model provides a conservative estimate for the concrete contribution to shear resistance which is required to evaluate the shear stirrup strains. Using concrete contribution to shear resistance from this model, an engineering strategy to estimate the concrete contribution to shear resistance at service loads is proposed. Thereafter, five different models for mean shear crack width (the first three models with two variants each) and four different models for shear deflection are proposed. The comparison of the predictions from the mean shear crack width models with the experimental data reveals that a conservative estimate for the shear crack width can be made by equating shear crack width as the product of mean principle tensile strain in the cracked concrete and the shear crack spacing (ModelIIIB, Model-IV and Model-V). It is observed that the assumption of zero concrete contribution to shear resistance (shear-force transfer) at service loads (in B variants of Models-I, II and III) result in relatively higher predicted mean shear crack widths (as compared to the corresponding A variants) and therefore, more conservative estimates. Moreover, the assumption of mean shear crack angle equal to 45 degrees also leads to relatively more conservative estimates of mean shear crack width. Model-IV and Model-V seem to outperform other mean shear crack width models considering mean and consistency of the models together as a metric. The mean and SD of the predictions from Model-IV are 0.85 and 0.30 for the original formulation of the model. However, with the assumption of mean shear crack angle equal to 45 degrees, the mean and SD values are observed to be 0.37 and 0.13 respectively. It is found that a conservative estimate for shear deflection can be obtained by assuming a linear shear force versus deflection response for a slender reinforced concrete beam (Model-I). The ratio of the experimentally observed to predict shear deflection for Model-I is 0.85 with a SD (Standard Deviation) of 0.31. The proposed Models-IIIB, IV and V (in their original formulation) and Models- IB, IIA, IIB, IIIA, IIIB and IV (with an assumption of mean shear crack angle equal to 45 degrees) for the shear crack width and Model-I for shear deflection provide a conservative estimate for the range of experimental beam specimen data covered in this MSc thesis. These models (especially Model-IV for mean shear crack width and Model-I for shear deflection) seem to be potentially useful engineering models for use in engineering practice to evaluate mean shear crack width and shear deflection for slender beams with thin webs (for example slender webs of bridge girders). However, the models require further validation with an experimental study to assess and establish suitability for wider application in design practice.","shear crack width; shear deflection; reinforced concrete beams; service loads; cracks; serviceability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, the place of resilience in decision making and design of railway signalling has been investigated. Although resilience is only one of the factors in the decision making and design of ETCS-projects, besides factors such as capacity, safety and interoperability, a quantification of resilience can help to either compare alternatives on all factors including resilience, to compare alternatives on resilience only, or to find the relation between design choices and resilience. Simulation of seven disrupted traffic scenarios has shown that using in-cab signalling with ETCS L2 compared to line-side signalling with NS'54/ATB has saved 10% of the delay in the scenarios on average. By using reduced block sections lengths in combination with in-cab signalling, 20% of the delay has been saved on average. For absolute resilience, short block sections should be placed along the whole track. As this is not realistic from cost perspective, decreased block sections are in each case advised nearby yards and switches.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

Nevertheless, in order for the technology to be established, further technical development is required and economical aspects should be tackled, both in the module and system level. From a commercial point of view, the ultimate goal of a PV system, once installed, is to cost effectively deliver the highest possible energy yield. In reality, the actual energy yield every system delivers is lower than the theoretical rated performance. Location and environmental factors, such as heating of the modules, irradiance, dirt accumulation, angle of incidence, Etc. affect the performance of the systems. Understanding the behavior of this new technology under real operation conditions can provide reliable insights for its further development, help better estimate the energy yield amorphous silicon systems can provide and perhaps, help the technology differentiate itself from the better commercially established crystalline silicone based one. This work investigates the effect of most of the location and environmental factors affecting the performance and the ultimate energy yield of a photovoltaic system comprised of flexible and lightweight amorphous silicon modules. The factors responsible for this performance decrease are individually investigated, and its effects are quantified by addressing in which manner they decrease the performance ratio of the system. A performance monitoring system was built expressly for this purpose, which data acquisition plan was based on the IEC 61724 -1 (2017) standard. A computer model with the capability of simulate the performance of the system after correcting for the evaluated mechanism was also constructed as part of this work using Matlab. This model was based on an experimental characterization of the modules, using live performance data as an input to give a performance ratio, and an assessment of the effect of loss factors. The results allocated the source of the system losses up to a 78% of the total power decrease, considering the rest of the unexplained observed losses as effects of the active material degradation. The performance ratio of the system was reported on a daily bases for the full evaluated period, concluding a strong correlation between a high irradiance and a high performance ratio. The common literature claim of a better behavior of thin film a-Si:H technologies compared to c-Si was verified under this study, and the effects of system operation under low irradiance conditions was identified as the dominant loss mechanism.","PV System; PV Modules; Loss mechanisms; amorphous silicon; thin film solar cells; system losses; photovoltaic model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","Flamingo PV","51.985100, 5.898700"

For the patient, laparoscopic surgery has many beneﬁts. However, for surgeons this is not the case. For example, laparoscopic grasper design exhibit play and hysteresis during surgical tasks such as grasping and palpating. This impedes haptic feedback, resulting in the surgeon being insufﬁciently able to perceive the amount of tissue forces that he or she is exerting. Therefore, a surgeon might misjudge the amount of force is applied on tissue, resulting in tissue damage. A mechanical solution has been developed to mitigate these issues. The conventional grasper tip has been redesigned to a monolithic and compliant grasper. Also, a compliant balancing mechanism was designed, to cancel out undesired elastic grasper tip forces. However, this compliant balancer was not a viable solution, because it was very temperature sensitive in its functionality. In an earlier internship project by the author of this thesis, a different solution was proposed: a magnetic balancing mechanism.<br/>Therefore, the design goal of this thesis is: to design a laparoscopic instrument with a compliant grasper, with the forces generated by the elastic deformation of the compliant grasper and other parts statically balanced by a magnetic balancing mechanism. Starting from this goal, design requirements were stated. Most importantly, the balancing forces should be between 80%-100% of all internal elastic forces for the whole motion range of the grasper tip, to ensure signiﬁcant balancing. Also, the design should be ergonomic. The ultimate prototype design consists of a compliant grasper tip, balanced by an axial magnet conﬁguration for balancing. The handle features a tweezers grip.<br/>The novel instrument validation was twofold: ﬁrst, a technical validation regarding the balancing requirement was performed. This was done by determining the balancing force, using a linear stage with a force sensor. The balancing force was between 80% and 100% for the whole range of motion of the grasper tip. This means that the balancing force requirement is met. Second, the instrument sensitivity was measured. Sensitivity is deﬁned as the lowest force level of a loaded laparoscopic grasper where an increase can be perceived, by using only haptic feedback at the handle. This was measured during a controlled comparison (n=25) between the novel instrument, a low- and a high-quality laparoscopic grasper. It turned out that on average, the novel instrument enables the user to perceive a force difference at a lower force level compared to the low and high quality laparoscopic graspers.<br/>Therefore, it can be concluded that the novel instrument has a higher sensitivity, and a better preservation of haptic feedback. It can be concluded that the design goal and its requirements have been met by the compliant laparoscopic grasper. However, for future prototype versions, improvements should be made to the ergonomics and modularity of the design. Also, validation should be focused more on the clinical context of the instrument.<br","laparoscopic surgery; compliant mechanism; faptic feedback","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-11-25","","","","","",""

This thesis investigates the data minimization in Recommender Systems, which is not well studied in the literature. This thesis extends the data minimization principles advocated in GDPR and studies its effects on recommender systems. Minimizing data not only reduces storage and transmission requirements but also has the potential to improve privacy and increase training and prediction speeds. This thesis investigates the effects of reducing the amount of data used to model a recommender system. It evaluates the accuracy of the Biased Matrix Factorization (BMF) algorithm by varying the training data on the MovieLens 10 million ratings (ML-10M) dataset. In this thesis, four data minimization techniques were used. We reproduced one pervious work and proposed three new data minimization techniques. In the first technique, we confirmed previous work concerning training data analysis, where the data outside the selected temporal window were dropped. The second data minimization technique, user profile truncation, retained the recent N ratings for each of the users while truncating the historical ratings. The third technique improved the user profile truncation by selectively truncating a percentage of user's historical ratings. In the fourth technique, a long user profile was split into smaller pseudo-user profiles. Analysis of the results is conducted. The most interesting results come from the third data minimization technique. Here, we show that truncating a percentage of the least recently active long user-profiles does not damage the performance and may slightly help. 60% of the long users can truncate their profiles to 20 ratings with minimal impact on the performance. Based on the results, we conclude that a substantial amount of data can be dropped without a large impact on performance. The results hold for the ML-10M dataset. It should hold for other datasets. The privacy implications of data minimization warrant future work. The proposed techniques serve as a guide for future research in data minimization of recommender systems.","Recommender Systems; Collaborative Filtering; Data Reduction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Data Science","",""

This is helped by the use of frameworks such as the Business Model, but doesn’t account for the changes in these markets as well as the changes in the firms themselves. This work looks at developing the research into these changes, so called Business Model dynamics, and look specifically at the case of Indonesia. In doing so, it looks at covering two main gaps in the current research: Firstly, the gap in the literature on Business Model dynamics specifically for the case of rural renewable energy; and secondly, the gap in the literature on how renewable energy companies adapt to the rural market in Indonesia. To do so, a literature study provides the backbone of the research in terms of the Business Model’s history, its components, and the dynamics associated with it. It then goes further into defining what these dynamics consist of for the case of renewable energy in particular. This is followed by the development of a conceptual model, representing changes to the Business Model over time in a graphical representation. A case study is then performed on Indonesian companies, whereby the literature study is used as a basis for the interview questions and the conceptual model is then used on the results of this case study. Finally, the conceptual model is improved based on its application in the case studies to arrive at a final framework. The conclusions that can be drawn from this work is that there are various levels of Business Model dynamics and that these can be determined for various different types of markets. In this instance the levels of dynamics that were determined for the case of Indonesia include the list of internal and external components of the Business Model for rural renewable energy projects, their influencing factors that cause them to change, the interrelationships between the Business Model components and finally the overall change to the Business Model over time.","Business Model; business model innovation; indonesia; Renewable Energy; Sustainable Energy; Business Model Dynamics; off-grid; Rural","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

It is capable of producing safe designs consistently since it was developed as an extension of the lower-bound theorem of plasticity theory. However, to aptly address a physical problem of a concrete element, STM often relies heavily on engineering experience and intuition. It is because the current STM has an inability to be transparent in informing the nonlinear consequences of choosing a certain ST model design, which make the method to be troublesome in more complicated design tasks. <br/><br/>In this thesis, a supplementary evaluation technique that employs nonlinear finite element analysis (NLFEA) is proposed as a solution. It is advantageous to incorporate NLFEA because it can provide nonlinear behavior of a structural concrete as objective insights for making a more informed decision in determining a suitable ST model. To incorporate NLFEA to STM, the concept of 'ties-as-extended-rebars' or TER model is introduced. A TER model is a numerical model used to assess the influence of a certain ST model design toward the nonlinear behavior of a concrete element. Through a TER model, an ST model is nonlinearly evaluated as a concrete element with embedded reinforcements. Additionally, to allow the TER model to generate a representative failure, the rebars in the TER model are extended with straight anchorage length. Then, the information generated by the model, i.e. failure mode and ultimate capacity, can be utilized as additional information to find a fitting ST model. <br/><br/>To assess its ability, the proposed technique was implemented on six ST models generated for two complex concrete beam elements. The implementation provided the TER model versions of the ST models. At the same time, the experimental results of the ST models were also validated using NLFEA. The validation attempt generated six numerical validation (NV) results, which were then compared with the TER model results. The result of the comparison indicated that five out of six TER models were able to suggest failure mode and ultimate capacity (RTER) that are comparable with the failure mode and ultimate capacity (RNV) from the NV results. In more detail, RNV to RTER ratio of models with similar failure mode has an average of 1.04 and a coefficient of variation of 11.1%, which suggests that the proposed technique can provide representative ultimate capacity value with relatively low variability.","Strut-and-Tie model; Nonlinear finite element analysis; concrete element; deep beam; dapped beam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

In this report the costs and opportunities of indoor farming are analysed and used as basis for designing more costs effective implementations of climate-cells. Cost effective climate-cells can be achieved by producing more within the same system without compromising accessibility to the crops or making use of expensive automation and transportation solutions. This design project led to the development of such a system. The final concept enables a highly efficient method of producing crops on several layers while minimizing cost and complexity of transport and improving the longevity of expensive parts.

(mentor); Kumar, A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Cyclic grinding maintenance of rails removes surface degradations and damages and restores the original rail profile, which deteriorated during wheel-rail contacts. Thus, cyclic grinding increases the service life of a rail and prevents catastrophic rail failure. Besides the advantages of cyclic grinding, concerns have risen that grinding itself might set favourable conditions for crack initiation during subsequent wheel-rail contacts. In this research, White Etching Layers (WEL) and Brown Etching Layers (BEL) at the running surface and sub-surface of a pearlitic Maximum Head Hardness (MHH) steel grade rail were found to have formed due to heating during grinding. A comprehensive understanding of the formation of these layers during cyclic grinding, their evolution during subsequent wheel-rail contacts and their respective microstructures has been established in this work. Additionally, the initiation and growth of cracks found at the running surface of the rail has been studied in relation to these layers, cyclic grinding and wheel-rail contacts. WEL formed during grinding consists out of martensite, retained austenite and partially dissolved cementite. The formation of this layer increases the hardness at the rail surface from approximately 400 HV to 1000 HV. BEL is occasionally found as a stratified layer underneath the WEL. BEL consists out of martensite, retained austenite and pearlite containing partially dissolved cementite. The hardness of this layer was approximately 800 HV. Formation of the WEL and the BEL occurs due to frictional heating of the material at the rail surface above the A1 temperature during grinding. Grinding additionally increases the roughness of the rail surface and induces residual tensile stresses in the rail material. Heating above the A1 temperature during wheel-rail contacts after grinding is unlikely due to the insufficient amounts of wheel creepage expected at the rail specimen. Additional effects of wheel-rail contacts after grinding are observed. Firstly, the high surface roughness and residual tensile stresses induced by grinding are reduced. Secondly, complete spallation of the WEL induced by grinding occurs at the most severely wheel loaded section of the running surface. Thirdly, large plastic deformation of the material at the rail surface causes the initiation and growth of cracks due to ratcheting. Finally, the initial stages of mechanically induced WEL formation are observed at the most severely wheel loaded section of the running surface. The cementite of the original pearlite dissolves via thinning and fragmentation. It is expected that further wheel loading of this material will lead to a layer of nanostructured ferrite with carbon mainly facilitated at defects sites in the lattice. Cracks initiated at the rail surface initially grow at a constant angle with the running surface, in the direction of the largest stress induced by wheel-rail contact. At a later stage, cracks bend towards the running surface and branch due to a changing stress field at increasing distance from the wheel-rail contact point. Oxide inside the crack indicate that water was present in these cracks during their growth. This water reduces the friction between the crack flanks, increasing the crack growth rate and the probability of branching.","Cyclic grinding maintenance; Rails; WEL; BEL; RCF","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","Materials in Engineering Applications",""

Generally, metamaterials with bistable unit cells need an external application of force to restore, leading to the contemplation of possible structures with self restorable behaviour. Such restorable nature is associated with metastable equilibrium, which is a time-dependent equilibrium state. The objective of the topic is to build a proof of concept for metastability in a pre-curved beam and identify the influence of geometric parameters on metastability. In the course of the thesis, various models of bistable designs are classified. A feasible bistable mechanism was selected, and the metastable nature is introduced through viscoelasticity. In this thesis, an analytical model is formulated by combining an equivalent Pseudo Rigid Body (PRB) model of the pre-curved beam (modelling the beam's compliance) with Standard Linear Solid (SLS) model (modelling the beam’s viscoelasticity). Prototypes are manufactured by using FDM printing of TPU material. Experimental studies are performed for the evaluation of material properties and testing for metastability in pre-curved beams with various shape factors. The results of experimental studies proved the possibility of metastable equilibrium in viscoelastic pre-curved beams.

Naturally occurring hydrate deposits exist under suitable conditions of low temperature and high pressure, typically in shallow marine sediments and in and below the permafrost, and may host large quantities of recoverable natural gas. Besides, the process of exchanging hydrate guest molecules potentially offers the added benefit of storage of carbon dioxide, as \ce{CO2}-hydrates are, under typical conditions, thermodynamically more stable than \ce{CH4}-hydrates. Several short-term field pilots have been undertaken, but the longer term dynamics of natural gas hydrate reservoirs remain unclear. Core-scale experiments performed at the University of Bergen were designed to provide essential data for field-scale numerical simulation of hydrate formation, dissociation and guest molecule exchange processes. Implementation of experimental findings into a simulator for hydrate-bearing formations may lead to a better understanding of the dynamics of hydrate-bearing geologic media and, in turn, to more effective strategies for commercial use of hydrate reservoirs. This thesis describes the development of an extension of the DARTS general-purpose reservoir simulator for hydrate-bearing reservoirs. The complexity of such systems can be effectively captured using the operator-based linearization approach and experimentally observed behaviour of hydrate systems can be implemented and matched with relative ease. This enables the combination of conventional conservation equations with the use of complex physics and empirical models. The existing DARTS-framework has been extended to include a kinetic description of the hydrate formation and dissociation reaction. Ultimately, a non-isothermal model has been tested for 1-D formation and dissociation cases. Comparison of results with literature shows similar behaviour and trends. The effect of water salinity has also been captured by the model, which has to be validated with experimental results. However, further development of the model is required in order for the model to be able to match measured data.","Reservoir simulation; Hydrate; Formation; Dissociation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cubesats have emerged as an alternative for these issues as they provide a low cost and compact solution. After the successful launch of NCLE (Netherlands China Low-Frequency explorer), a radio astronomy payload in the Chang'e 4 mission, efforts are being made to reduce the size of the payload to meet the cubesat standards. This work aims at investigating the design and implementation of a sensitive radio receiver for low-frequency radio astronomy from the lunar orbit with a cubesat platform. The aim is to study the practical aspects involved in realizing the design and improving the sensitivity of the instrument. The science objectives are similar to that of the NCLE payload which includes the frequency band of 80 kHz-80 MHz with high dynamic range and linearity. The thesis is a step further in the project OLFAR which aims to have a swarm of satellites in the lunar orbit to perform long-baseline interferometry at low frequencies.

For the design of the antenna, the antenna length, efficiency, and IXR of three antenna configurations have been presented. As radio frequency interference poses a problem during the design of the amplifier chain, the effects and coupling mechanisms of RFI have also been studied. Limits on all internal and external instruments for radiated emissions have been set for the design to be sky noise limited. The amplifier design takes the science cases into account and is designed to achieve the required sensitivity, using a structured electronic design approach. The implementation of the amplifier chain was done with discrete components at ASTRON (Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy) and measurement results have also been discussed at the end.","Low frequency radio astronomy; Analog design; RF design; Cubesat; OLFAR; Short Antenna; IXR; Conducted Emissions; Radio receiver; Radio astronomy; Radiated Emissions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-12-01","","","","","OLFAR",""

Imagining a future without them would truly be impossible. When a new technology arrives, society needs time to adjust and become aware of the impact products have on people and our ways of behaving.. This always takes time. In the case of smartphones, the last few years have shown a growing amount of literature, media, researchers and most successful people in the world give attention to the negative effects and developments smartphones and social media has had on many people around the world. This thesis did even so, but has as final goal to create awareness, stir debate and provoke reflection within the audience about the subject. To do so we used design as tool. This particular movement is called Critical Design. Through an extensive literature research the present effects and developments in different areas of expertise were identified, such as the cognitive area, psychological, physiological, and social. From a user study empirical data related to the matter was collected, the way people feel, think and experience their own relationships to their phones. Combined, these scientific findings led to five interesting themes that we transformed into a smartphone manifesto, which could then be used as basis for the idea generation. The Social Paradox, The Loss of Solitude, Your Internal Friction, Your Divided Attention, The Addiction. For each theme, one design has been made. The final outcome of this thesis is a collection of five critical designs, from which three have been developed into prototypes. As part of these designs, narratives have been created in the form of commercial like videos, setting the context and adding to the completeness of the design concepts. By combining personal perceptions towards society with scientific evidence and empirical data, a translation from a very scientific background towards a more artistic way of designing was made. There was no prior process similar to the one taken in this thesis, which allowed a very open, new and free way of going through the design process. In a qualitative final evaluation, 8 people were interviewed in order to find out if the critical designs provoked them and created critical reflections towards our own behaviors and relations to smartphones within society.","Critical Design; smartphones; Awareness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

It  has changed the relationship between government and economy, public and private, work and life, shaping a world that promotes unconstrained movements of people, products, consumption and working subjects. The fundamental redefinition of established social, political and economic structures and relations (Ephemera, 2015) resulted in emergent mobile practices, relations and on a language of mobility that strongly influences modernity. In recent studies, researchers are exploring the increasingly deeper connection between specific forms of mobility and distribution of life-chances. Mobility is becoming strictly linked to issues as social inequality, rights and democracy, and therefore intrinsically political (Baerenholdt, 2013). Governments are looking at mobility as a chance for economic growth, social inclusion and development. Making use of the ‘Vision in Product’ explorative approach, this project focuses on providing an innovative framework to be used as a tool to understand and upgrade the future expressions of Social Mobility in the context of Europe 2030. The model proposed aims to help designers, policy makers and public administrations reframe and create solutions for the future, inclusive to the new cultures emerging and defining modernity. The model value is further explained through the service ‘GLEU: the Glocal European Mobility Network’ developed with the use of the model. GLEU proposes a transformation of the format of a long-term civic commitment into a new culture promoting short-term social engagement, channeling the future flow of social mobility. The service promotes the idea that being mobile doesn’t mean leaving social responsibilities behind but will stress out how travelling per se can be a form of contribution to society. It challenges the common preconception that states how what it is good for the individual is bad for the society, and vice-versa. Recognising the mobile citizens as a transnational resource of Europe, a distinct group of people expressing the new culture of social mobility is identified in the Eurovers. The title ‘Eurover’ originates from the words Europe and Rover. A Rover is defined as a person that wanders, not just in the sense of physical movement but also indicating a department further away from civilisation. Challenging the idea that individuals and society have different goals that can’t be aligned, this project proposes a new form of rovers, wanderers of civilisation able to create and exchange value among themselves and within Europe. Looking at mobility beyond individuals geographical movements only, this project explores the social, symbolic, economical and personal dimensions of mobility.

This project answers the question as following: Gemeente Rotterdam can further develop and organise the design intervention Schoonschip Week in IJsselmonde.

They achieve intelligent information exchange with the environment through the onboard sensing and cooperative system. vehicles are possible to have situation awareness and automatically analyze the safety and dangerous state of journeys. Finally vehicles can reach destinations following drivers' willing. The ongoing research on intelligent vehicles is mainly about improving the safety, comfort, efficiency and provide an excellent human-car interface. As a self-organizing system, the traffic system is quite complicated. There are many disturbance factors to lead to various traffic problems. One of the daily occurring problems is congestion on the motorway. In order to reduce congestion, Rijkswaterstaat applies various dynamic traffic management (DTM) measures to guide the traffic. It works well nowadays in conventional traffic. However, automated vehicles entered the market recently and will start to play an essential role in future traffic. The automated vehicles' reaction to DTM measures may be different from conventional vehicles while the traffic problems still exist. Therefore, it is necessary to research the effectiveness of current Dutch traffic management in automated vehicles. This thesis aims to investigate the effectiveness of current Dutch DTM measures with driver assistant and partially automated vehicles. Due to the time limitation, only the ramp metering measure will be researched through a simulation study. Therefore the main research question is 'How partial automated driving influences the performance of current Dutch dynamic traffic management system and how can this be evaluated via simulation?'. Three methods are applied, including literature review, simulation and statistical analysis. The literature part reviews levels of automation, various longitudinal and lateral vehicle motion models, which are chosen and modified in the simulation. Many ramp metering algorithms are also introduced in the literature review. The ramp metering controller in the simulation follows RWS algorithm. Besides, the motorway demand and the penetration rate of level 1 and 2 vehicles are two input of the simulation.<br/>From the simulation results, it is concluded that the level 2 automation consisting of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Lane Change Assistance (LCA) system brings a negative impact on the motorway capacity. The ramp metering measure remains efficient if the penetration rate of level 2 vehicles is low. However, when the capacity reduces to the critical flow set up in the ramp metering controller, Ramp metering loses its efficiency. The parameters in the ramp metering controller therefore, require an update. For further research, it is recommended to simulate the same scenarios with different ramp metering algorithms. Since the functions of the algorithms are different, there might be other robust control algorithms for automated vehicles. Besides, another limitation of this thesis is that the automation system in level 2 vehicles is defined as Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) plus Lane Change Assistance (LCA) system. Other partial automation systems may have a different effect on the performance of ramp metering. This thesis can be expanded by research the ramp metering performance under various types of partial automation systems.","Dynamic Traffic Management; Ramp Metering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","",""

These facilities are only costing money for mining companies. In addition, these tailings storage facilities are prone to failure. To prevent this from happening these facilities have to be reinforced. This research introduces a concept to use geotextile tubes filled with mine tailings as reinforcing construction elements. That way value is assigned to the mine tailings while also making the storage facilities safer. However, pumping mine tailings in geotextile tubes is not an option due to the small particle sizes which will flow through the openings in the geotextile fabric. In addition, the contaminations in the mine tailings will also be mobilised using this method. Therefore, this research investigates potential enhancement of mine tailings to make them suitable to be pumped in geotextile tubes. The potential enhancement is in the form of flocculation and remediation. While flocculation increases the dewatering properties of mine tailings, the remediation will prevent the contaminations from mobilising. Test performed in this research include a series of jar tests, cone tests, two different strength tests and hanging bag tests. The results show that when flocculants are added to the tailings, the dewatering rate increases. The flocculant type which proved the most effective for these specific tailings type is a flocculant with an average molecular weight and average anionic value. Adding coagulant to the tailings further increases the dewatering rate of the tailings. When Ordinary Portland Cement is added, to stabilise and solidify the tailings, the dewatering rate increases even more. In addition, adding Ordinary Portland Cement to the tailings resulted in an increase of shear strength and unconfined compressive strength. After seven days of curing, the highest strength of curing was measured for the mixtures where fifteen mass percentage Ordinary Portland Cement was added. The mixture where the highest strength and the fastest dewatering rate was measured, was the mixture composes of mine tailings, flocculants, coagulants and fifteen mass percentage Ordinary Portland Cement.<br/>With these results, it may be concluded that mine tailings can be used to fill geotextile tubes to form reinforcing construction elements if its dewatering behaviour is enhanced and its contaminants remediated.","Mine Tailings; Geotextile Tubes; Flocculation; Coagulation; Stabilisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-11-25","","","","","",""

Due to the buoyant characteristic of injected gas, the security of underground storage is a major concern. To asses the security of COኼ storage, an accurate prediction of the gas plume behaviour is essential. In this study, a fully physical 2D model is developed to describe gas behaviour in a saline aquifer. In particular, we investigate the effect of gas impurities on injectivity, macroscopic dissolution and resulting plume migration. The model includes an investigation of 4-component buoyancy driven multiphase convective flow with miscible convective mixing. For an accurate description of the phase behaviour, a recently developed thermodynamic model based on a combination of cubic Equation of state with activity model has been implemented. The implemented thermodynamic model includes a specific description for the behaviour of water and an activity model describing component behaviour of the aqueous phase making this model more accurate than conventional cubic EoS. The phase behaviour based on this thermodynamic model and a consistent set of physical properties have been implemented in Delft Advance Research Terra Simulator, a new simulation framework developed at TU Delft. The results show that the presence of the gas impurities (tested here) have a negative effect on the solubility of CO2 which in turn reduces the security of gas storage in saline aquifers and increase the risk of leaking. This is the first time when this accurate physical model is applied for large-scale simulation of CO2 sequestration. Additionally a framework regarding the energy cost of the total CO2 sequestration process, from separation to injection, is implemented.","Thermodynamics; plume migration; impurities; Carbon capture and storage; reservoir simulation; DARTS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Petroleum Engineering and Geo-sciences","",""

The most common foundation type for a wind turbine is a monopile which is currently installed by large hydraulic hammers. This installation method generates a lot of underwater noise which may harm marine life. To solve this problem and its unwanted consequences, GBM aims to implement a new silent installation technique. By applying fluidization, jetting and by inducing vibrations by harmonically exciting the bottom of the pile, both the dynamic tip resistance and the shaft resistance are reduced so that the monopile can penetrate the soil. These techniques are aimed to produce less harmful underwater noise than conventional hammering. Little is known about the penetration performance of a pile which is harmonically excited at the bottom. This thesis aims to provide more insight on the penetration performance when exciting a pile at the tip. A literature study is performed on existing pile penetration models. From this study it is concluded that, currently, there are no available penetration models capable of describing the penetration performance of the pile when exciting the system at the bottom with varying harmonic excitations. Therefore, the aim of this thesis is to develop a new penetration model. The purpose of this model is to describe the penetration performance at different harmonic force parameters. The developed model is based on finite elements by using the FEMAP software. The pile is represented by shell elements. The interaction between the pile and the soil is modeled using multiple spring-damper-slider elements which are spread along the pile surface. The slider elements allow the relative motion between the pile and the surrounding soil. The different soil-structure interaction elements are uncoupled and the sliding resistance is assumed linearly elastic, perfectly plastic. Energy radiation due to elastic waves is captured by simple dashpot elements. <br/>The developed model is used to analyze the effect of certain parameters on the penetration of the pile. This is done by changing the amplitude, the frequency or the direction of the harmonic force for a specific set of soil parameters. For each variation, the model calculates the pile displacement at a certain depth from which the penetration speed is determined. This penetration speed is then compared to the other results to determine the effect of each chosen parameter. Also, the location of excitation is analyzed. The model is used to analyze a pile which is excited from the top or at the bottom. From the results it is concluded that an increase in the amplitude and the frequency of the excitation has a positive effect on the penetration speed. The dependence of the direction of the vibration on the pile penetration is complex. Therefore, a clear correlation between the two could not be obtained within the time framework of this research. This research provides is a first step towards understanding of the Vibro-drill system performance. As this is an investigation which is still in progress there are some recommendations for further research on this topic. One important recommendation is to improve the soil reaction in the model to a coupled system where it is now uncoupled. Furthermore field tests can be performed providing more knowledge on the effects of the soil and to validate the model.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-30","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Despite the large increase in drones, UAV flights are permitted only in secluded areas. In order to be granted access to public areas, it must prove its capacity to sense and safely avoid collisions with other obstacles. Therefore, the need for a secure and reliable CAS is imperative. In this thesis a<br/>low-cost, low computationally demanding, stereo-based, robust CAS solution for small UAVs is designed, assuming flights primarily in an outdoor environment. In order to address this problem, firstly the existing dense stereo open-source algorithms are reviewed based on their suitability for obstacle avoidance and their computational complexity. Based on a semantic evaluation and profiling, the review concludes that BM should be preferred for low-cost obstacle avoidance and SGBM should be used only in highly textureless environments. Subsequently, since the imperfect accuracy of any existing stereo solution is a fact, a machine learning method is introduced in order to predict the uncertainty of the stereo measurements. This so called “uncertainty map” method assigns an uncertainty value to every image pixel. It was shown that it can successfully predict the uncertainties of BM and SGBM stereo algorithms. Furthermore, a low-cost collision avoidance method was proposed which makes use of uncertainty map in sensing filtering, collision detection and path planning. The evaluation showed that the use of uncertainty map improves<br/>both collision detection and path planning, especially when BM is used. Last but not least, the whole CAS was implemented in an embedded system Raspberry Pi 3 model B+. Results show that real-time execution of the propsoed CAS with a runtime frequency of 4-54 Hz is possible when BM is used and 1-16 Hz when SGBM is used.","Stereo; Collision Avoidance; Mapping; Path Planning; Uncertainty Map; Low-cost; Raspberry Pi; Image-space","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-15","","","","Computer Engineering","",""

The goal is to find out if models can be created that are capable of predicting the outcomes of (nonlinear) finite element analyses. These models are created by means of Artificial Neural Networks, which is a powerful method in the domain of machine learning. The focus will be on stiffened steel plated structures that are part of a sea lock gate. The power of a trained neural network is that it is able to compute the output for a given set of input parameters within a fraction of a second. Running a complete finite element analysis on the other hand can take a significant amount of time, especially in case of geometrically and/or physically nonlinear analyses. When relying on nonlinear finite element analyses for performing a structural design optimization, a trained network can therefore save a huge amount of time. It also allows to evaluate many more design options, possibly finding a more optimal design than what would be possible with a manual design optimization. An automated procedure has been created to generate datasets by running FE analyses in batch mode. Parametric models are set up in ANSYS FE software, for which random sets of input parameters are generated. After running the analyses, the output is collected and organised in datasets that can be used for training. The sizes of the datasets and the dimensionality of the design spaces are varied in order to study the influence of these quantities on the accuracies of the predictions produced by the neural networks. Genetic algorithms, which is another machine learning technique, are deployed for the optimization of the \textit{hyperparameters} of the neural networks, which are basically the \textit{settings} of the network which determine the learning behaviour. Three standard interpolation techniques (Kriging and polynomial interpolation) are also fitted to the same datasets in order to compare the performance of the neural networks to these interpolation techniques. The final result is an overview of the accuracies of the predictions made with the neural networks on validation datasets. It was found that the neural networks produced accurate predictions on the maximum deflection of a simply supported, stiffened steel plate loaded by a uniform pressure. Most of the relative errors were within a range of 5\% error for design problems with 4 dimensions. Predictions of the linear buckling load of stiffened steel plates were found to be mostly within the range of 10\% error for design problems with 4 dimensions. When increasing the number of free design variables from 4 to 8, the errors were found to be mostly within the range of 20\% error. The predictions of maximum equivalent stresses in stiffened steel plated sections obtained by geometrically nonlinear FE analyses were found to be in the range of $\pm$ 20\%. These models had 13 free design variables. Improvements were made on the available options of hyperparameters for neural networks. With these improvements, new predictions were made on the maximum equivalent stresses and the accuracies were found to be slightly better, with errors ranging between $\pm$ 15\%. For implementation of the predictive model in a design optimization algorithm, these errors are considered to be too high. It is expected that the dimensionality of this problem (13 design parameters) combined with very irregular results due to the presence of peak stresses and different buckling shapes, resulted in these deviations. Additional datasets are generated with results of FE analyses of simplified, unstiffened steel plates. Both geometrically and physically nonlinear analyses are performed, with uni-directional compression applied to the plate edge directly as a displacement. The number of free design variables was set equal to either 1 or 4 free variables.

However, these marine ecosystems are endangered. Seagrass ecosystems have a key role in coastal bays, but despite their alarming rates of loss, they receive little attention compared to other marine ecosystems. This study aims to provide a better understanding of the role of seagrass ecosystems in coastal bays by assessing their impact on the morphodynamic behavior. In order to achieve this, an existing hydrodynamic model has been extended to include morphodynamics. Two different bays have been investigated: Baie Orientale and Baie de l’Embouchure (St. Martin). These bays represent a partially exposed and fully sheltered bay, respectively. Both regular wave conditions, as well as extreme storm conditions, have been investigated to understand the consequences of seagrass loss on coastal erosion for different environmental climates. The coastal erosion has been found to be more prominent in the exposed region, whereas the more sheltered areas are more resilient. The erosion takes place in shallow waters but remains limited under regular swell conditions. The increased wave energy, during the extreme storm event, increases the erosion rates considerably. However, the regular swell conditions are normative in shaping the morphological development of these coastal bays when longer timescales are considered. The seagrass counters erosion most effectively in the foreshore and much less in deeper regions. Removal of seagrass in the foreshore (between 1-3m) halves the sediment stabilization. In contrast, the sediment stabilization increases if the meadows are able to spread especially towards the shore. In addition, the wave energy and waveform have a significant impact on the sediment stabilization. The stabilization typically decreases for higher and shorter (storm) waves, whereas it increases for smaller and longer (swell) waves. The long-distance interactions between seagrass meadows and coral reefs have led to their mutual coexistence, which is also found to be beneficial for the erosion control of the coastal bays. The dissipation of wave energy on top of the reefs fosters the sediment stabilization by seagrass. Moreover, the impact of the reefs on sediment stabilization also increases in the presence of seagrass meadows due to the additional drag exerted by the seagrass. The seagrass meadows are typically more effective under swell waves, whereas the reefs are more dominant in the dissipation of storm waves. Seagrass meadows and coral reefs form thus a synergy, in which the stabilization of sediments provided by the individual ecosystems is facilitated, reinforced, and complemented by the proximate presence of the other ecosystem. Finally, the role of seagrass on sediment stabilization has been explored under climate change. The coastal erosion increases for the considered sea-level rise scenarios. The impact of the seagrass on sediment stabilization decreases when the bays, seagrass and reef ecosystems are not able to keep up with sea-level rise. The synergy between seagrass and reefs emphasizes that the responses of both ecosystems are of importance for the future of tropical sheltered bays and should therefore not be managed in isolation.","DELFT3D-FM; Biogeomorphic modelling; Biogeomorphology; Morphodynamics; Tropical coastal bays; Caribbean; Seagrass; Coral reefs","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","NWO SCENES","18.086944, -63.021944"

Kinetic parameters were obtained through fitting of the probability of nucleation curves measured for over a hundred microdroplets. Nucleation kinetics was seen to increase with an increase in supersaturation, as expected. At pH 6.0 the kinetics dramatically slows down compared to pH’s 3.6 and 8.6.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","This research focuses on the structural behaviour of an elastic supported reinforced concrete slab. Over the years, there is a tendency to realise industrial floors with large joint-spacings. The downside of a slab on grade with a large joint-spacing is that the risk of (uncontrolled) cracking due to a shrinkage load is higher, which often results in durability issues. In practice, the slabs on grade are generally designed and constructed based on experience by specialised floor companies and often with less than the theoretical minimum required reinforcement. This research aims to close the gap between theory and practice and to gain insight into the structural behaviour. Moreover, reducing the number of damages in slabs on grade. In the first part of this thesis, the stress development and crack risk in a restrained concrete slab on grade exposed to shrinkage is analysed. The restrained shrinkage stress in the concrete member is mainly influenced by the time-dependent properties of concrete and the degree of restraint of the slab. The most relevant degree of restraint for a jointless slab is by soil friction and depends on the slab length, soil properties and the vertical load like self-weight. From the sensitivity analysis in this research, it is shown that the middle section is fully restrained for slab lengths or joint spacings of 40 to 80 meters long for practical ranged values. The relaxation effect in concrete, based on the creep behaviour, reduces the restrained shrinkage stress over time. Stress reductions of 40% to 70% were found for practical values in the analysis after one year of shrinkage loading. The crack risk in indoor slabs on grade is the highest between two and twelve months after casting according to the findings in practice and this thesis. The early-age crack risk is relatively low for an indoor slab on grade compared to a concrete pavement because of the significant less influences of the environment. The crack risk can be reduced by composing a concrete mixture with a low relaxation coefficient, low concrete shrinkage, low Young's modulus, a high concrete cracking stress capacity and by reducing the degree of restraint of the slab. Secondly, the cracking behaviour of a fully restrained concrete tensile member with only reinforcement near the surface is analysed with analytical models and a finite element model. For modelling cracking in a restrained member initiated by an imposed deformation in the finite element model, the random field application is required. The random field application generates the spatial variation of the tensile strength of the concrete material. The random field simulates weak zones in the concrete member where crack localisation will be initiated. The downside of the random field application is that the crack pattern in the model is predetermined. The cracking behaviour is analysed for a shrinkage load, a point load and for both loads combined. In all the analyses, it is found that cracking in a slab on grade always results in a not fully developed crack pattern. A not fully developed crack pattern is characterised by the forming of additional cracks instead of widening of the existing cracks when the load increases. When cracking due to a shrinkage load in fully restrained members occurs, the imposed load decreases, which reduces the tensile force in the uncracked zone. Force reductions up to 73% were calculated after cracking in a five-meter long restrained slab. For an eccentrically top reinforced member, the first crack occurs at the bottom fibre and is uncontrolled. The tensile force in the reinforcement, in combination with the eccentrical position, induces a negative bending moment in the uncracked zone of the slab on grade. In combination with the restrained shrinkage load, this results in an axial tensile force and a negative bending moment in the uncracked zone after cracking. Over time, the shrinkage load increases and a flexural crack can be initiated at the slab surface. A point load induces a positive bending moment at the position of the load and a smaller negative bending moment next to the point load. After cracking due to the point load, an axial compressive force and an increased negative bending moment are present in the uncracked zones next to the point load. The sensitivity analysis on the behaviour by the point load showed that the principal stresses in the slab could be reduced by increasing the subgrade modulus, the slab height or by lowering the concrete stiffness of the slab. The load combination analysis showed that an axial tensile force and a negative bending moment are present in the uncracked zones. It is found that a higher point load only increased the slab deflection and the number of flexural surface cracks and not the crack width. However, a higher shrinkage strain load did slightly increased the maximum crack width but mainly increased the number of cracks. Therefore, it is concluded that the slab on grade remains in the cracking phase for the combined loading situation. Both in this research and the literature, it is stated that crack width calculations of a restrained concrete slab imposed by a shrinkage load results only in indicative values. The analysis of the cracking behaviour showed that cracking at the surface is induced by an axial tensile force in combination with a negative bending moment. Therefore, estimation of the crack width can best be performed with the CUR-65 model based on an enhanced cracking bending moment of the slab on grade. Because accurate crack width calculations are not possible, recommendations are made on how to reduce the crack widths in a jointless slab on grade. A slender slab with a low concrete tensile strength is advised to reduce the internal cracking force and bending moment. Also, it is found that a lower shrinkage load leads to a smaller crack width. Therefore, a shrinkage reducing concrete mixture is advised. Moreover, high bonding properties between the reinforcement and concrete reduce the crack width, which can be realised with reinforcement with a small diameter and mesh-size. Finally, reinforcement is the most effective in controlling surface cracks when placed in the top fibre of the slab. It is concluded that for a slab on grade, replacing the conventional reinforcement with steel fibre reinforcement does not reduce the required amount of reinforcement for controlling surface cracks. <br","jointless; slabs on grade; steel fibre reinforcement; imposed deformation; degree of restraint; NLFEA; concrete relaxation; Crack width; not fully developed crack pattern; structural behaviour","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering - Structural Design","",""

The excessive gas extraction from the subsurface has led to human-induced earthquakes in this region. Liquefaction is a phenomenon that occurs as a result of earthquakes, reducing the soil shear strength to zero and the soil in turn behaving like a liquid. It has been observed in other parts of the world in case of natural and human-induced earthquakes alike. Thus, it is necessary to identify the liquefaction prone regions and taking steps towards creating better designs, equipped to handle earthquake loads along with precautionary measures, to save existing building and infrastructure. In order to do so, it is important to examine the existing the methods, various parameters and factors that influence the liquefaction potential analysis. In this project, the different factors that could influence Liquefaction Potential Analysis are studied based on the existing CPT-based correlations between Fines Content (FC) and Soil Behavior Index(IC). The previously proposed correlation by Boulanger and Idriss (2014) is examined for Groningen Soils to evaluate if it needs any modifications. Depth of the sample, Distance between CPT and borehole, Grain Size Distribution and Geology of the sample are main factors considered for the study. Each of these factors are analysed by collecting laboratory samples of Grain size analysis test from Groningen region. The strength of the correlation between FC and IC is evaluated based on the factors. This study would be beneficial for geo-technical software developers, construction and design engineers who highly depend on correlations and it gives insight of how different the onsite scenario can be from the predicted values using correlations. It contributes to the future research on creating a data base of the all samples in the Netherlands, to indicate high risk regions. It also helps in answering if IC is a good parameter to consider while evaluating liquefaction potential for Groningen Soils.","Fines content; Soil Behaviour Index; CPT-based correlations; Groningen earthquakes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","","53.21917, 6.56667"

The aim of this study was to investigate the regeneration performance by using the gaseous O3 based process and the feasibility of its long-term operation. An initial concentration 200mgL^-1 of ACE was used for the zeolite granules adsorption process. After 120 hours of loading, the gaseous O3 based process was applied to regenerate the ACE loaded zeolite granules. It was found that an ideal ACE degradation rate of 80 -100% was obtained by drying the zeolite granules before the regeneration. While when the drained bed (without drying process) was applied, the ACE degradation rates were below 35% for both the gaseous O3 and the gaseous O3/H2O2 processes. The water content of zeolite granules was the main limiting factor that affected the regeneration performance. A higher ACE degradation rate was obtained with lower water content. It was also found that adding H2O2 to the process enhanced the ACE degradation rate for the zeolite granules with the same water content. Nevertheless, the highest ACE degradation rate was achieved when the water content was 0% without adding H2O2. Regarding the long-term regeneration, three cycles of regeneration were conducted to investigate the feasibility of long-term regeneration by using the gaseous O3 process in dried bed. The effect of ozone on zeolite surface characteristics and the accumulation of intermediates had minor influences on the adsorption capacity restoration. Compared to the fresh zeolite, owing to the incomplete regeneration of the adsorbed ACE in the inner part of zeolite, the used zeolite granules lost 25% of the adsorption capacity in the long-term operation. Therefore, it is feasible to use gaseous O3 process in dried bed to regenerate ACE-loaded zeolite granules from the long-term operation perspectives.","zeolite; regeneration; ozone-based oxidation; organic micropollutant","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","",""

A new coastline model, called ShorelineS, is under development which promises to be applicable for long term simulations on geometric complex coastlines or unstable beach regimes where, for example, spit formation may arise. This new model aims to overcome the gap between existing relatively simple coastline models and more advanced coastal area models. In this thesis the applicability of this new model on spit formation was assessed. A study case in Lobito (Angola), were a natural spit has formed, was used for this purpose. Three research objectives are of interest in this thesis: 1) getting insight in the relevant processes regarding spit formation (in general and for the Lobito spit) 2) validate the longshore sediment transport module of ShorelineS and 3) asses (and improve) the spit formation in ShorelineS. An inventory of existing spit formations around the world and a detailed modelling study (XBeach) on the transport rates around a spit showed that especially the bimodality of the wave climate is an important process influencing the final shape of the spit. Regarding the calculation of the longshore sediment transport it was found that for the modelling of the wave transformation a distinction should be made between the static fixed offshore depth contours and the dynamically changing nearshore depth contours for changing coastline orientations. This distinction is essential to consistently and correctly determine the breaking wave parameters which directly influences the longshore sediment transport calculations. This distinction was implemented in ShorelineS using the concept of a so called ‘dynamic boundary’. The spit formation in ShorelineS was assessed by means of hindcasting the historical spit formation of the Lobito spit using the ShorelineS model. Continuing on the previous finding it was found that the coastal orientation for which the longshore transport is maximum, which reflects the direction in which a spit migrates, should be derived on the actual, spatial and temporal variating, transport curves. This in contrast to the theoretical fixed angle as suggested by Ashton et al. which was previously used in ShorelineS. Both the implementation of the dynamic boundary and the routine to find the actual (variable) angle of maximum transport were needed to be able to correctly hindcast the observed spit formation. With the current, underlying, model assumptions it is not possible to correctly model the local decay of longshore sediment transport along the head of the spit. The width and local shape of the spit is therefore controlled by the so called ‘upwind correction’ routine in ShorelineS. This routine was updated to prevent the grid resolution dependency which originally directly controlled (forced) the resulting spit width. With this updated routine the spit width is based on an average (expected) spit width. This new routine should be considered as a proof-of-concept, further research is required to further develop this routine and find ways to include some kind of feedback mechanism in the model between the forcing, shape and the resulting LST over the head of the spit.","ShorelineS; Coastline model; Spit formation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","",""

The new control architecture consists of Model Predictive Control (MPC) for the outer position control loop and Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (INDI) to control the inner angular accelerations. The attitude itself is controlled with a Proportional-Derivative (PD) controller.

The second method applies a filter to the reference signal before providing it to the controller.

Relatively unexplored are wind farms deployed in hurricane-prone regions. That is exactly the challenge that Mexican government faces as they want to expand their renewable energy resources by developing offshore wind in the Gulf of Mexico. The increased variability in wind resources, due to a combination of a reduced energy-yield design wind speed and increased hurricane structural design wind speed, pushes the overall design challenge of the turbines. Of key importance is the limited knowledge on how hurricane wind affect structures, particularly OWT’s. This study aims to identify how main characteristics of hurricane winds differ from models of regular extreme winds used in engineering simulations, to more accurately quantify hurricane winds loads and response effects on a 10MW turbine and to assess, albeit in a simplified manner, the structural ULS and SLS performance of the turbine under these extreme conditions. The most important distinction found between hurricane winds and regular extreme winds is the turbulence spectrum: Yu [18] found turbulence energy is shifted towards the lower frequencies for hurricanes while Li [16] found that turbulence energy is shifted towards the higher frequencies. Both agreed that, although disagreeing on the turbulence spectra, that these wind parameters are likely storm-dependent and/or location-dependent. In this study, hurricane parameters are incorporated into a wind generation model adopted from Cheynet [2] and altered to incorporate the hurricane spectra. The wind model is limited to the 1D longitudinal case due to limited available information on other wind components for the hurricane winds. To quantify the loads and response effects due to the different spectra, a numerical approach is considered, using a finite-element blade model developed by Pim van der Male [21] applying the DTU’s 10MW reference turbine’s structural and simplified aerodynamic properties. Within the boundaries of the inaccuracies present in the numerical input adn simulations, it was found that both the Yu and Li hurricane spectra show an increased load effect on the turbine blade, the response effect being equally large for both and roughly 20% larger compared to the Kaimal cases. This difference is proven to be predominantly due to the selection of the surface roughness length for hurricane conditions which was found to be larger by both Yu and Li studies [16, 18] for hurricane conditions. The difference due to the spectral change is negligible since the turbulent energy is nearly equal around the natural frequency of the considered 10MW blade thus not giving rise to significant changes in a dynamically amplified response. Selection of accurate hurricane wind parameters such as roughness length are thus equally important as the identified difference in turbulence spectra as they also result in significant changes of about 20% in the final results. Blade orientation has a considerable effect on reducing the response of a single blade if oriented downward. Averaging the thrust forces over all three blades however, effectively negates this advantage. Structural performance was assessed through failure probabilities of the blade given the results of the aforementioned simulations. It was found that the hurricane wind simulations resulted in the largest failure probabilities, showing a non-linear increase in failure probabilities for larger wind speeds. Bending is the governing failure mode of the blade as these failure probabilities are considerably larger compared to the shear failure probabilities for wind speeds exceeding 50 year return period conditions. Verifying the blade model response, it was found that the initially assumed three modeshapes were insufficient to accurately described the blade deformations. The model was therefore also not able to capture the correct internal root shear forces and root bending moments affecting the final results presented.","Hurricane; Turbine Blade; Dynamic response offshore wind turbine; Turbulence Spectra","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-11-21","","","","","",""

The Tour de France implemented in 2015 live tracking data of every cyclist, and uses since 2017 machine learning to make predictions with this data. This amount of data makes this specific race interesting for the design of an information provisioning service for the cycling fans. This project is done in collaboration with the TU Delft Sports Engineering Institute. The TU Delft Sports Engineering Institute is an interdisciplinary research institute that researches how the performances of top-athletes can be improved. One of their research topics is ‘Sports Infrastructure and Facilities’, which includes creating an ultimate viewing experience by augmenting the spectators’ experience by giving the spectator real time information on the athlete’s performance. In six phases, this report describes the design process of the service in VR. The first phase is the orientation where the scope and context of the project and the assignment are described. Then, in the research and analysis phase, four knowledge domains are analysed, resulting in a list of requirements for the service. The Ideation and conceptualisation phase shows several ideas for functions, working the system and interactions and the VE lay-out. This resulted in three concepts of a service, of which one is selected and further detailed. Next, a digital demonstrative prototype of a few features is created using ‘Unity’ and a HTC Vive. This prototype is used in a user test to evaluate the concept and compare the learning effect to the traditional broadcasts. The result of this design project is a service design for watching the Tour de France in VR with informing elements. It is an application that can be used on a VR Head mounted Display (HMD) by the users at home. In the Virtual Environment (VE) of the application the user sees a screen for video footage, a 3D map of the route of the race and several informing elements. The usage of VR will help the users to get a better overview of the race and a better perception of depth about the routes. By providing information that is tailored to individual informational needs, this service can help the users to learn more about the sport in an interactive and entertaining manner.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

However, as studies show, his role has become particularly complex and inefficient since it is observed that the risk management process is not adequately organized, supported and performed. Further, due to risk management practices’ high practical value to the construction industry, one would expect that those that have already been developed are not only state of the art, but also highly effective. Nonetheless, even if a plethora of tools and techniques has been developed for the implementation of risk management throughout the years, their use has most of the times proved insufficient.

Currently, Solitaire is more than 40 years old. Although it has been upgraded multiple times, it has been identified that certain improvement can be achieved by retrofitting just the aft of the vessel. The purpose of the research is to evaluate the feasibility of improving Solitaire by retrofitting it with a new aftship, by exploring the different design possibilities, including the different stinger support configurations. To this end, an analysis of alternatives has been done and the preferred options have been implemented into a concept design. The use of Systems Engineering (SE) has been motivated by the need to establish a clear structure to guide the design due to the complexity of the problem. This methodology allows to keep a good overview of the requirements and constraints involved in the design. An operational analysis was carried out to identify the operational deficiencies of the design. This lead to four main areas of improvement. i.e, Longitudinal strength, Stinger and Stinger handling system (SHS), Resistance and Deck space. By addressing these operational deficiencies, the operational time of the vessel can be improved. Either by reducing the theoretical peak cycle time, decreasing the downtime or a combination of both. Based on the operational analysis a set of requirements has been compiled and a functional definition of the design has been made. With all the insight obtained through the operational analysis, the design requirements and the functional definition; an analysis of alternatives has been carried out. For each of the operational deficiencies, multiple alternatives are analysed. Local optima are found for each of the deficiencies although, if each of these local optima is implemented in the design, the global performance of the vessel is compromised. Therefore, a holistic design is proposed to integrate all the solutions into one preferred concept design. Overall, the findings of the research suggest that the retrofit of the aft is technically and economically feasible. Nevertheless, a design validation needs to be carried out to better quantify the total improvement of the new design.","Feasibility study; Systems Engineering; Retrofit; ship design; Pipelaying vessel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-20","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Over the past decades, the technological improvements in computing power, software and projection systems enabled driving simulators to become a cost-effective tool to perform research activities and train novel drivers. Today, driving simulators are widely used for studying the interaction of driver and vehicle system, developing new vehicles and for human factors research. They offer advantages over naturalistic and instrumented vehicles studies including versatility to configure virtual scenarios that exactly match the particular investigation requirements, controllability of the testing environment and ease of data collection. However, driving simulators have known disadvantages too with the main challenge being its experimental validity. Low-fidelity driving simulators may evoke unrealistic driving behaviour and therefore bring to invalid research outcomes. In the last years, simulators designers strived to reproduce high quality visuals, realistic kinaesthetic and auditory cues in order to emulate the real driving experience and stimulate the entire range of human's sensory modalities. <br/>Nevertheless, little attention has been paid so far to create more realistic hand-wheel haptics in such technology. An extensive review of literature of the subject, highlighted the importance of the steering feedback response in driving simulators. Realistic steering feel is one of the key elements in order to achieve a good immersion on a driving simulator in general, and to replicate on-centre vehicle handling in particular. <br/>The aim in this thesis is to enhance the hand-wheel realism in driving simulators and investigate the factors with highest influence on steering feedback fidelity in such technology. <br/>The first requirement for achieving the research objective is to have a high fidelity steering system simulation model which is able to replicate real characteristics of steering wheel angle versus steering wheel torque. Therefore, in this dissertation a five degrees of freedom axle parallel Electric Power Steering system is modelled in simulation environment. Part of model's mechanical parameters are retrieved from technical drawings while the remaining are identified by post-processing the experimental data acquired in Steering In the Loop bench tests. Once the mechanical quantities are derived the simulated response is validated against the real, thereby proving the high fidelity of the steering system simulation model. <br/>Subsequently, a new torque-based control strategy is developed to compute online the hand-wheel feedback in driving simulators with the aim of enhancing steering fidelity and suppressing the disturbances which affect drivers' feel. Performances of the developed algorithm are tested against the strategy commonly used to calculate steering feedback in driving simulators, namely the position-based control, through Driver In the Loop experiments. The investigations demonstrate that the torque-based control reduces steering wheel oscillations and torque feedback fluctuations, caused mainly by frictions modelling, compared to the position-based control. The findings were also confirmed by subjective data from a drivers’ questionnaire. In particular, according to subjective evaluations the proposed approach results in a clear improvement of steering realism and steering feedback rendering around pure centre in driving simulators. <br/>The results obtained in the Driver In the Loop experiments are also verified through a neuromuscular model analysis. By this means, performances of the torque-based control and position-based control are tested objectively, and the effect of input sensors delay and actuator dynamics on steering fidelity and driver impedance are investigated. The analysis showed that the element with highest influence on steering fidelity and hand-wheel stability in driving simulators are steering frictions, and proved the superior benefit of the torque-based control versus the position-based control.<br/>Based on the demonstrated potential of the proposed approach it is conclude that the torque-based control closes the vehicle-driver loop with more realism in a driving simulator, therefore enabling more meaningful experiments.<br","Driving simulator; Steering wheel feedback; EPS system modelling; Driver In the Loop testing; Neuromuscular modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-20","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering","",""

Results here show that although a surprisingly large number of countries would be likely to be self-sufficient and some large countries could see environmental benefits, the global reactive nitrogen input and land use would be pushed far outside of planetary boundaries if global food trade were to disappear. This is mainly due to increased livestock consumption and production inefficiencies in Africa and Asia.

(graduation committee); Ridderinkhof, Wim (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Mineral oil spills at sea can have many negative consequences. For both preventive and responsive purposes, it is essential to accurately forecast oil spill evolution. Shear diffusion (in this context, i.e. the combined effect of vertical mixing and differentiated horizontal advection of mass) determines for a significant part the evolution of an oil spill. These processes are partially forced by waves. A viscous fluid layer attenuates the waves throughout the area the layer covers. In this thesis, surface oil slicks are modeled as a continuous viscous fluid layer. It is investigated to what extent the wave-forced shear diffusion of the oil is affected by the oil-induced attenuation of the waves. For this purpose, the spectral wave model SWAN is extended with a module for energy dissipation due to a viscous fluid layer. The stationary, 1D wave energy balance is solved for uniformly forced waves in deep water. A high cutoff frequency (5 Hz) is employed to include the wave frequencies at which the dissipation is active. Also, special attention is paid to the choice of the wind and whitecapping formulation. Simulations are performed in full factorial setup, varying wind speed, oil layer thickness and oil viscosity. The results are compared to a no-oil case. Based on the difference, functions are fitted for the reduction of two key wave properties: the whitecapping dissipation rate and the surface Stokes drift velocity. The reduction functions are included in the oil spill module of the particle tracking model OpenDrift, which is subsequently used to calculate oil spill evolution due to shear diffusion for 2DV cases. The results of oil spill simulations with and without the implemented reduction functions are compared. Idealized cases (only wave-forced) show that for sufficiently thick layers (h+ ≥ O{10^-3} m) of sufficiently viscous (ν+ ≥ O{10^-3} m^2/s) oil, the Stokes drift reduction can significantly affect the wave-driven evolution of an oil spill in two ways: the average forward transport is reduced and the skewness of the oil mass distribution is increased to ‘less negative’ or even positive values. If simple sheared wind drift and ambient vertical turbulence are added, however, the relative importance of these effects becomes smaller. In none of the cases, a difference is found for the distribution of the oil mass between surface and subsurface, which implies that the whitecapping reduction hardly affects the results. It is recommended that further effort is put into obtaining a detailed understanding of the (differentiated) forward transport of the surface and near-surface oil, so that wave and wind effects can be distinguished, and modeled independently, more accurately.","oil spill; mineral oil; shear diffusion; oil dispersion; Stokes drift; viscous wave attenuation; SWAN; OpenDrift","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

The Ooster is separated from the coast by a relatively deep channel, called the Schaar. Closure of the Grevelingen in 1971, with the construction of the Brouwersdam, initiated vast changes in morphology. Damming of the estuary mainly affected the tide-induced flow patterns and therefore the relative influence of the waves at the outer delta. In this study the main focus is on the morphological development near the coastline of Goeree-Overflakkee. During the past years an erosion trend of locally up to 27 m/year, just south of the Flaauwe Werk, led to concerns with Rijkswaterstaat. This erosion is caused by the migration of the Ooster along the coast. Out of precaution a beach nourishment has been planned in this area due to the potential danger for the Flaauwe Werk. However, uncertainty about the future morphological development and therefore the necessity to take measures remains. The aim of this study is to provide a better understanding in the changes that have occurred, bring more certainty about the future and therefore contribute to informed decision-making. The coast of Goeree-Overflakkee has had a long history of coastline erosion. Closure of the Grevelingen estuary led to an increase of this erosion trend at the Westhoofd due to a combination of increased tide-induced flow velocities and morphological development of the Ooster. The latter was characterised by an eastward migration which forced the Schaar into the coastline. This process initiated multiple nourishments in the period 1969-1985. The attachment of one of the shoals of the Ooster resolved this problem, resulting in a large accumulation of sediments on the beach. In the years thereafter these sediments have been eroded as the Ooster migrated along the coast and transported further north. The latter resulted in beach widening along the coast of Goeree-Overflakkee. Due to the rapid elongation of the Ooster the erosion problems of the 80’s returned. The Schaar shows a continuous decrease in depth and flow surface since 2003, according to data analysis. Model results show that the channel mainly plays a role during low tide when the Ooster is emerged. Significant tide-induced flow velocities occur in the channel. In general, the decreasing channel dimensions lead to an increase of the magnitude of the flow in the channel. However, this occurs for a limited time duration during the full tidal cycle. A striking observation is the small influence of the wave angle on the wave-induced flow velocities near the channel. Waves coming from the north are refracted considerably due to the extension of the Haringvliet outer delta. The result is a large net longshore sediment transport rate at the seaward side of the Ooster. This could explain the pace of the migration in eastern direction. Moreover these sediments are a source for the channel, contributing to decreasing the channel dimensions. In general the presence of wind decrease the magnitude of the flow in the channel. Based on these findings it can be concluded that the waves are the dominant forcing mechanism in shaping the morphology and attachment of the Ooster is expected to occur in the near future. Attachment of the Ooster implies the disappearing of the eroding currents. The duration at which this attachment can be expected cannot be deduced from this study. The erosion of the coastline will continue as long as the channel is present. Based on the width of the dune row and the presence of beach groynes the potential treat of the morphological development for the primary flood defences seems minor.","Bollen van de Ooster; Coastal morphology; Coastal erosion; ebb-tidal delta; Delft3D","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","51.823086, 3.877309"

In this thesis foldable Kirchhoff-Love plate elements are derived using a mixed/hybrid element formulation in combination with an enriched Finite Element formulation. The use of a mixed/hybrid element formulation enables great simplification of the enrichment functions, since the discontinuous rotation field is evaluated at the boundaries of the enriched plate elements, instead of the element domain.

The amount of power harvested for electricity is however very small in comparison to solar and wind. One of the reasons for this is the lack of consensus on the best design of wave energy converters. This thesis develops a novel system design for a wave energy converter array that has promise and implements, evaluates and compares control for it. The most important benefits of this new design versus the most used type of devices are that it does not rely on a connection to the ocean floor for energy harvesting and it is space efficient, meaning that devices lie close together. Control has never been designed for the type of device in this study to the best of this author's knowledge. The wave energy converter array consists of floating pontoons that are connected to each other. The wave energy is harvested through power take-off mechanisms in these connections. The most important requirement on the system design is survivability, as the ocean is a harsh environment. The kinematics are thus designed in such a way that forces on the connections can be set by the damping and stiffness coefficients of the connections. The array is optimized for efficient energy harvesting by its design, while keeping cost effectiveness in mind when possible. Not only the array itself is optimized for efficiency, the control is optimized for this as well. This means that the control problem is to maximize energy capture. Reactive and Resistive control are implemented and compared. A distributed version of these algorithms is investigated as well and improves on computation time for large arrays. Reactive control can improve upon Resistive control up to three times in terms of energy capture, depending on the efficiency of the power take-off mechanism. The reason for this great improvement is that Reactive control makes it possible for the array to reach resonance with the waves. The array performs average in terms of energy capture in comparison to other wave energy converters when Resistive control is used.","Wave Energy Converter (WEC); Array; System Design; Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-11-04","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

The challenge is to deliver high quality of care while dealing with limited budgets. An ageing population and in increase in chronic diseases leads to an growing demand for care. This growing demand leads to an increase in costs in the system, but the required budgets are not available. The rapid rise of costs makes healthcare systems unsustainable, a transformation is needed. Not only the costs, also other signs show that healthcare systems need drastic change. Patients are not satisfied, healthcare staff is dealing with burnouts and health outcomes are not as good as is desired. These different signs together show that the healthcare deals with a systemic problem. To address a system problem, the different factors should not be seen in isolation, the interlinked effect of factors should be considered. What is needed is a transformation towards value-based care (VBC). Theory proposed by Porter and Teisberg (2006) explains that the basis of healthcare systems need to shift from delivering volume to delivering value. From their perspecitveg value in healthcare means to improve relevant health outcomes while reducing the costs. The transformation to value-based care can be guided by the quadruple aim. The quadruple aim is a framework developed by Spinelli (2013) and used by Philips to show the different dimensions that need to be addressed in transformation: 1)improving health outcomes, 2) improving patient experience, 3) reducing costs and 4) improving staff experience. The quadruple aim is a suitable approach to guide transformation to VBC as it is widely used across the health system. The quadruple aim is seen as most complete overview compared to other frameworks, because all important dimensions of a healthcare system are included in the quadruple aim. However, the theory on VBC and the quadruple aim is general and needs a translation into a specific context. In other words, the global strategy of VBC needs to be made specific to guide local action. In this thesis, living labs are the context for defining local action. Philips wants to set up living labs with multiple stakeholders and learn how to initiate living labs for transformation to VBC. A key element in the initiation of a living lab is the construction of a common vision, because based on this vision actions need to be defined. This thesis results in a toolkit to supports the definition of a vision for a living lab and translate the vision into action. The toolkit can be used in co-created sessions with partners in the living lab. The toolkit provides tools to define purpose, partners and objectives in a local setting. The purpose for the living lab is defined first. An overview of the global challenge, vision and enablers in VBC is presented visually. Following the step-by-step approach will support the lab partners in defining a local challenge, vision and enablers. Based on the identified local vision, the partners and objectives for the living lab can be systematically discussed using tools. To support the co-creation sessions, the toolkit consists of four elements: A global purpose visualization. Work sheets that need to be printed and filled in during the sessions. A slidedeck to use during workshops. Facilitator instructions to support the facilitator in explaining the process. The toolkit has been tested within Philips and determined valuable for their business. Based on a test session suggestions for improvements are identified and included in the report. It is recommended to further test the toolkit in real-life settings. The toolkit shows to be relevant by providing a integrated overview of theory on VBC in a visual way. Besides, by outlining the process of initiating a living lab, this thesis is a foundation to develop more tools that can be used in living labs.","value-based care; Living Lab; Toolkit; Philips Design; Transformation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

In the last sixty years, numerical optimization has facilitated large advancements in this field. One of the areas in Structure Optimization is Topology Optimization, which is used for Additive Manufacturing purposes. In this thesis we explore Static and Dynamic Topology Optimization. In the optimization problems matrix equations of the type Ax = b, with A sparse and badly conditioned, are accelerated using deflation techniques in addition to preconditioning. We have applied several iterative methods, preconditioners, and deflation types to the topology optimization problems. The static problem concerns compliance optimization of a two-dimensional MBB-beam. The deflation type that reduced the number of iterations the most without introducing large overhead costs was rigid body modes deflation, divided over element squares. It was found that dividing the rigid body modes vectors over density based regions did not reduce the number of iterations. The dynamic problem concerns eigenvalue optimization of a three-dimensional moving wafer stage that is used for laser-printing computer chips. The optimization formulation contains a shifted eigenvalue problem that is solved using model order reduction. In the computations of bases for the reduction matrix equations appear, to which deflation techniques were applied. All deflation types reduced the number of iterations and needed time to solve the matrix equations. The best deflation type was using rigid body modes (RBM) divided over element cubes combined with eigenvectors from the previous iteration. The next best was the same combination without the division over cubes. Using eigenvectors or RBM separately were the least effective deflation types. There is an optimal amount of element cubes to use when dividing the RBM. The tests on a few grid sizes suggested a quadrupling of the amount when the grid size doubles, but more research is needed to really identify a relation between the grid size and optimal amount. When increasing the grid size to a level where parallel computing on a cluster was required, the deflation type using element cubes could not be used due to complications with parallel implementation.

However, its adsorption efficiency can be affected by natural organic matter (NOM). NOM is a complex matrix and widely exists in water bodies. During the drinking water treatment process, the large size fraction of NOM may block the pore of the granular activated carbon (GAC), and the small size fraction of NOM can compete with OMPs and occupy the sites. The goal of this study is to increase the OMP adsorption efficiency of AC filtration in the drinking water treatment process. The objective was to investigate the feasibility of the competitive NOM removal by zeolite adsorption prior to powdered activated carbon (PAC). Meanwhile, the filtration performance and advantages of nanofiltration (NF) with 1000 Da membranes were found out. Zeolite - AC and NF- Zeolite - AC combined treatments were exterminated. In this study, the properties of zeolites were reviewed and the zeolite with FAU framework was selected as the hydrophobic adsorbent. Batch experiments with FAU and PAC were conducted to examine the adsorption performance of 10 common OMPs in different water samples. Comparative batch tests on UV effluent and NF permeate were carried out with two stages, zeolite pre-treatment and PAC treatment. Ultrapure water and demineralized water were involved as the reference to prove the influence of NOM from adsorption isotherms. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) measurements were provided by the DWTP. NOM is confirmed to hinder the OMP adsorption on AC according to DOC measurements and adsorption isotherms. NOM smaller than 1000 Da is proved to cause the competition with OMPs. FAU-type zeolite pretreatment was failed to remove the competitive NOM removal.","Drinking water; zeolite; activated carbon; organic micropollutant; natural organia matter","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","CIE5050-09",""

Outdated scenarios will result in future pathways that are no longer achievable and therefore reduces their relevance and usefulness for making decisions. As some uncertainty is resolved over time, while other uncertainties arise, it is important to take these changes into account. Although the need to update scenarios to create meaningful insight for making decisions is clearly recognized, a clear and structured method for executing this process remains unclear. I propose that to configure a solution, two concepts need to be introduced 1) scenarios consist of a multi-layered structure, and 2) changes considered should be classified according to their impact and uncertainty. Based on this classification, changes are incorporated into the different layers distinguished. To apply these concepts during an update, the paper presents a generic framework to structurally incorporate new information and uncertainties into scenarios, keeping them up-to-date, guaranteeing that the scenarios remain realistic and useful. Within a test case the framework is applied to four scenarios describing the European power market to illustrate how the framework performs in a practical context. Results show that using the framework allows the complexity of the update to be simplified into a step-by-step process.

(mentor); Hoogenboom, Pierre (graduation committee); Voorendt, Mark (graduation committee); Muttray, Markus (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","This thesis focuses on modelling a gravitational launch of gravity based foundations (GBF's) for offshore wind turbines. This is an extension of the Blyth Offshore Demonstrator project by BAM Infraconsult. To become more competitive in the offshore wind energy market, the construction of self-buoyant GBF's installed using the `float and submerge' technique needs to be optimized. GBF's will need to be constructed on land, which calls for a way to `launch' the GBF's. Another study suggests the use of semi-submersibles or immersion structures, which are very expensive. Due to the GBF's high strength and stability, it might be suitable for a gravitational launch. Although these launching methods have been widely applied on steel ships and jackets, the application for reinforced concrete structures is rare, especially using slipways with an abrupt ending. A conceptual design is needed to test the technical and economic feasibility of this launching technique. For the purpose of making a conceptual design, the launching process must be modelled. The goal of this thesis is to develop models that can be used in a conceptual design phase to easily determine the optimal shape and dimension of the slipway used to gravitationally launch GBF's. This thesis contains three modelling methods: (simple) mathematical models, physical scale model tests and a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model in ANSYS Fluent. Simple mathematical models were derived to model each phase of the launching process. Translational movements when the GBF is in full contact with the slipway were described using a simple force balance, both for a dry and a partially submerged slipway. For the kinematics as it tips over the slipway edge, equations of motion were derived and solved. The main limitation of this set of equations of motion is that hydrodynamic forces are not included. For the kinematics of the freely floating structure, equations of motions were solved and hydrodynamic components were determined analytically from literature and numerically using ANSYS Aqwa. Physical scale model tests were performed to (1) validate and calibrate the mathematical models, (2) determine the most favourable slipway geometry, and (3) develop more insight into the GBF behaviour during a gravitational launch. The tests were conducted at a 1:100 scale. For calibration of the hydrodynamic components, free decay tests were performed. In the abruptly ending slipway launch tests, slipway inclination (9°, 14° and 21°), freeboard height (positive, zero and negative), and initial GBF velocity (high and low) were taken as variables to investigate their effect on the severity of GBF dynamics. Severity of the dynamics was parameterized by the maximum GBF rotation measured around the horizontal axis during the launch (pitch). A large GBF rotation means large motion amplitudes thus violent movements, which are undesirable. <br/><br/>Comparisons to mathematical models show good agreement in most cases after a calibration of the hydrodynamic components. The full launch procedure was not modelled accurately by the mathematical models. An empirical formula was developed relating the slipway variables to maximum GBF rotation, which provided more accurate results for a larger range of variables. A lower freeboard and a steep slipway inclination was always favourable. No such trend was observed for the initial velocity. Most favourable slipway geometry tested had a slipway inclination of 21° and a slipway ending below the water surface (negative freeboard), resulting in a maximum GBF rotation of 29° around the horizontal axis.<br/><br/>A CFD modelling strategy was proposed and used to compare to the physical model tests. The CFD model was set-up in 3D using a dynamic mesh and a three degree of freedom solver to compute all acting forces on the moving body. Despite a coarse mesh with insufficient quality, the solution converged and showed numerical stability, also for large motion amplitudes. Depending on the scale, the CFD model showed good agreement to the physical scale model tests. The CFD model has a high potential in terms of the range of initial conditions, flexibility in structure shape and dimension, and amount of output data. <br/><br/>The simple mathematical models (force balance, equations of motion and an empirical formula) are sufficiently accurate to analyse key differences between slipway alternatives to make choices in the conceptual design phase, after a calibration using physical scale model tests. Due to a long computational time and time consuming improvements, the CFD model is more suitable in a more detailed design phase, where it could be very valuable. <br/><br/>A first estimate of most important launch requirements was made using the mathematical models for abruptly ending slipways and showed technical feasibility. More research should mainly focus on improving the CFD modelling strategy and on making a conceptual design for a specific location to further investigate economic and technical feasibility.","gravitational launch; gravity based foundation; GBF; offshore wind energy; launch; concrete; caisson; wind turbine foundation; transportation; Blyth","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

To be able to achieve this, “a reduction of at least 60% of GHGs by 2050 with respect to 1990 is required from the transport sector” (EC, 2011). This research focuses on three methods that were identified by Kaack et al. (2018) for the reduction of emissions in the transport sector: increasing the efficiency of freight vehicles, reducing the carbon content of fuel used to transport freight and shifting freight to low carbon-intensity modes. To be able to stimulate the freight transportation sector to the three alternatives, a pricing policy that includes the CO2 emissions of the modes is identified: carbon pricing (Beuthe et al., 2002). Current literature has studied the influence of a carbon price on the container freight transport in the Netherlands while focusing on the modal shift (Zhang et al, 2014; Zhang et al, 2015) or researched the effects of internalizing the external costs on the Belgium freight transportation network (Beuthe et al, 2002). Furthermore, the influence of a carbon price on the potential for urban freight electrification in Madrid was researched by Arroyo et al. (2019). This research contributes to clarifying the effects of carbon pricing on the Dutch freight transportation. As current studies mainly focus on either the effects on the modal shift or the effects on the use of alternative fuels, these do not consider a combination of the effects and do not take into account the increase in the efficiency of the freight vehicles. Furthermore, the current literature focuses on a particular niche market (e.g. only container or a certain region). This research takes a broader view and looks at the influence of the carbon price on all commodities that have an origin, destination or both in the Netherlands. The main research question of this research is: HOW CAN THE FREIGHT TRANSPORTATION NETWORK USE IN THE NETHERLANDS BECOME MORE SUSTAINABLE, CONSIDERING MODAL SHIFT AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS? Currently, most freight is transported by trucks, which is a more expensive mode but has a high network density and enables faster transportation as there is no need for transhipment between modes (Platz, 2009). Inland waterway (IWW) is the second most used mode for freight transportation in the Netherlands (CBS, 2019b). IWW is a cheaper mode, but the transport is dependent on the available ports in the waterways network and is a slow mode of transportation. Rail freight transportation is used the least in the Netherlands (KiM, 2016). The rail mode can be cheap, however transhipment is expensive. Next to that, the trains are dependent on the railways service stations and do not reach high speeds due to inefficiencies (Islam &amp; Zunder, 2018; Janic, 2008). When looking at the emissions of the modes, a clear difference between the emissions is identified: trucks emit up to 2.5 and 5 times more CO2 than IWW and rail respectively (KiM, 2016). This results in an unsustainable distribution: the mode that emits the most emissions is used the most while the most sustainable mode is used the least.","Carbon price; multimodal; Freight transport","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

It was executed in collaboration with the Material Experience Lab in the faculty Industrial Design Engineering. The project follows the Material Driven Design method by Elvin Karana. The material being researched is the Formlabs ceramic resin which was newly developed and has been on the market for approximately a year now. The Formlabs ceramic resin is a 3D printable ceramic material which uses photopolymerization to solidify the resin into objects. The material requires extra steps and experimenting and is now mostly used in educational and researching environments, because of the challenges it brings. These challenges mainly occur because not enough is known about the material and the way of use. However, the Formlabs material has a great potential of being more user friendly and easier to use than other 3D printable ceramic materials. This is because the material is made for the specific 3D printer allowing them to work together perfectly, increasing the ease of use and success rate. The main research question for this thesis is: Which technical and experiential material properties should be emphasized to create unique material-user experiences? The research started with understanding the material by executing user studies, technical tests and by conducting many tinkering experiments. The tinkering process was based on the information provided by Formlabs. These experiments and tests led to several insights which created a clear overview of unique and interesting material characteristics. User studies concluded that the material was perceived as rough and tactually offensive but as pure, inviting and aesthetically pleasing because of the mat white colour, translucency and lack of impurities, creating a sensorial incongruence. Some interesting directions came forth out of the tinkering phase and the user studies. It is possible to create controlled cracks in the walls of objects. Another interesting opportunity is the possibility to produce hidden Internal structures which play with the translucency of the material. This is possible because of the high precision 3D printing technique used. Lastly digitally modified surface textures can be created which alter the tactual experience of the material. The translucency of the material and the possibility of digitally modified surface textures were further explored during this project. It was concluded from user studies that people experienced textures inspired by nature as more tactually pleasing. Furthermore, the translucency of the material allows for light to add depth to the more dimensional textures making the experience even more pleasing. An envisioned material experience was formulated by combining the findings and insights from the tinkering process. The envisioned role of the material was to attract people and invite and encourage them to interact with the object by touching and holding the surface. The tactile stimulation experienced is pleasant because of the digitally modified surface texture. When interacting with the object a hidden feature becomes visible emphasizing the translucency of the material. This hidden feature will showcase the opportunities 3D printing of translucent ceramics brings. User studies and an ideation session was held in order to materialise and realise this envisioned experience. This ideation resulted in a design direction: Design a product set or a product made up out of different components, which initially look identical but become distinguishable when a hidden feature is unveiled, by emphasizing the material’s translucency. The final product concept came to be a interactive table lamp which encourages people to explore the effects of light on the material. The lamps has digitally modified surface textures which remove the original tactile offensiveness, creating a pleasant tactile experience. It is also made up out of different components which look identical until the lamp is turned on, unveiling hidden textures.","3D Printing; Material Driven Design; Ceramic ink","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

There are many challenges associated with the management of master data in large and distributed organizations. Master data management (MDM) has been proposed as way to integrate and combine data from different sources in order to provide a unified view for the main business entities. This study focuses on the supplier domain and aims to explore the challenges of managing the supplier information in large and international companies, within the supplier-organization collaboration and from an enterprise-wide perspective. The identification of a supplier can result from the combination of accurate and complete name and address information. Problems in this information can be due to hybrid system landscape, multiple ERP kernels or lack of enterprise-wide uniform data rules and standards. Common supplier master data problems include the incomplete or inaccurate name and address combination, incomplete address information, international name or address and duplicated supplier records. Although actions can be taken to manage these issues, a reactive approach to the supplier master data problems is not the optimal solution. A proactive mindset needs to be adopted by organizations to avoid these problems. There is need for the supplier information to be in a central place and with unified format and data rules, so that data redundancy and duplication problems can be eliminated. Therefore, supplier MDM is proposed to help organizations create and maintain consistent and accurate supplier information. This study aims to develop an assessment tool for companies to assess their supplier MDM practices and capabilities. Thus, the objective of this study is the design of a model to determine a company’s maturity in supplier master data management. This thesis uses the Design Science Research (DSR) approach to develop a maturity model. Five research questions are formulated, each one representing one of the design science phases.

A set of model and solver parameters will be established as a starting point formore detailed modelling of FRP wrapped joints with different geometry and static load conditions.<br/><br/>Because of large complexity of the models, and inclusion of many contact interactions, Abaqus/Explicit should be used to model such joints. The anisotropic nature of the FRP requires elements that are robust and able to handle this anisotropy. Also the complex, curved and layered geometry of the wrap requires elements that discretize a 3D volume. Without the use of user subroutines, continuum shell elements are the only elements that meet this requirement.<br/><br/>Prediction of the behaviour of axial joints was very accurate, although no unique set of input parameters for the Cohesive ZoneModel were found. This is because multiple failure modes occur at the same time, which makes the system very sensitive to some parameters and completely insensitive to other parameters. Prediction of more complex X-joints was not very accurate. This is mostly due to differences between the geometry of the model and the real life joint. The models did suffer from hourglass modes. Different methods of hourglass control had limited effect. It was found that as irregularity of the mesh increases, the effects of hourglass modes decreases. However, the effect of hourglass modes needs to be decreased further. A solution to do this is proposed at the end of this thesis.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Despite the advantages such conception have been extensively predicted and supported in literature, a direct transition from manual to fully automated operation is at the current moment not feasible, both for technological and ethical restraints, related to lack of driver’s acceptance and trust. Within this frame of reasoning the Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) provide a useful intermediate step on the way towards full vehicle autonomy. Nonetheless, as a bridge in between the old and the new driving era, such systems shall optimize the driving safety and performance and at the same time convey a pleasant driving experience. In this framework the current research proposes to investigate the application of a lane tracing ADAS from a different point of view, shifting the focus from the pure vehicle performance assessment to the evaluation and optimization of the driver-system interaction in the steering task. Considering the state of the art, the research proposes as a resolutive approach the design of a comprehensive experimental methodology, by means of which extensively investigate the supported on-centre steering phenomenon from the haptic point of view and propose a meaningful list of KPIs for the assistance optimization. In this sense, the diversification of the steering feel for the same vehicle dynamic event, in terms of swaying path, reveals crucial: therefore, a modular approach for the definition of the steering strategies is proposed, based on human resource-optimization approach prescribed by the reaching theory of kinaesthetic control. As a testing platform the fixed base driving simulator of the European Toyota facility is chosen, allowing to perform driving experiments with high-end vehicle and steering model. The latter for the research purpose has been integrated with a seamless steering command, validated with proving ground data, to promote the realism of assistance and interaction. In this regard, the choice of an evaluation team composed only of expert drivers aims at fostering the evaluation precision and consistency at all the times, performed by means of a tailored steering feel questionnaire. As main outcome of the experimental activity, the collection of subjective ratings and objective steering characteristics is exploited to identify statistical correlation models, representatives of Driver’s appreciation with respect to steering objective characteristics. Among these the most relevant ones shall be selected as KPIs. The designed methodology is hence validated by means of a Pilot Study, through which the main method flaws, related to dataset dimension and lack of correlation validation, have been highlighted and solved by means of a revised method, and a newly applied driver’s impedance identification scheme. These last two details in the context of a Final Experiment eventually allowed the delineation of a concise list of KPIs, providing design guidelines both in control- and interaction-oriented way. In the acknowledgement of the achieved results and the overall potential of the designed approach, several scenarios for future improvement and application are delineated, in view of an always better rendered driver assistance.","LTA; Lane Trace Assist; ADAS; steering feel; Supported Driving; Human Machine Cooperation; Driving Simulator; Driving Simulator Experiment; Driver Impedance; Driver Impedance Identification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-18","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering","Driver Acceptance towards Lateral Control of the Vehicle at Toyota Motor Europe",""

Numerical and experimental studies suggest a great potential for TPMS-based architectures in the treatment of segmental bone defects, where supporting scaffolds are crucial in bridging the gap unable to heal naturally. However, current studies are limited to investigating the properties of classic TPMS archi- tectures. In this thesis, I present the design, fabrication and characterisation of a novel type of meta-biomaterials inspired by TPMS morphology.

Moreover, one of the developed designs applied basics of graph theory to construct the material which mimics the randomness of the trabecular bone structure, while preserving the benefits of regular TPMS morphology. The results demonstrate the improved performance of the modified TPMS scaffolds compared to classic structures in terms of permeability and compliance properties, crucial for the materials applied in or- thopaedic implants. The porosity and permeability values of the developed metamaterial were found to be in the range of trabecular bone. Additionally, the possibilities to simulate the mass transfer properties of the novel material were examined in COMSOL and valu- able qualitative results, like fluid velocity distribution and flow-induced wall shear stress, retrieved.

Unbelievable behaviour, especially eye gaze behaviour, could make the whole virtual character seem less believable. In human-human social interactions eye gaze is used to interact non-verbally.

If a virtual character were to respond to a person's gazing behaviour with its own gazing behaviour, will it seem more believable and socially present to this person? Do people look at- and follow the gaze of such virtual characters more? Do people apply ToM to reason about the mental states of such virtual characters? This study employed a within-subject design (n=24) with two conditions that were given at the same moment. The conditions were represented by two virtual characters where one had gaze aware behaviour and the other did not. Using a think-aloud procedure during and questionnaires after the Virtual Reality experience the believability, social presence and the application of ToM were assessed. Gaze behaviour with respect to the virtual characters was assessed as well using the onboard eye-tracker of the Virtual Reality Head Mounted Display. The results suggest that virtual characters were more believable and socially present when they respond to people's gaze behaviour through their own gaze behaviour compared to a virtual character without such gaze behaviour. Results also showed that in some situations people looked more at the virtual character without gaze aware behaviour than at the virtual character with such behaviour. However, gaze following behaviour and whether or not people apply ToM were inconclusive.

Low lying countries like the Netherlands are consideredmore vulnerable to the effects of sea level rise. Large parts of the Dutchcoast have been eroding for centuries and nourishments schemes of approximately12 million m<sup>3</sup> have been implemented annually in order to maintainthe coastline as it was in 1990. However, the future dune erosion will further increasedue to the impacts of climate change and hence the adaptation strategies shouldbe in line with the accelerated sea level rise and the possible effects thatmay bring. The most commonly used method to assess sealevel rise impacts on shorelines is the Bruun rule. However,Bruun rule’s deterministic nature cannot align with the risk-based framework thatcoastal zone management requires nowadays. This necessity initiated thedevelopment of a process-based model, the Probabilistic Coastline Recession(PCR) model, estimating the future coastal recessions in a probabilisticapproach. In this research, the PCR framework wasapplied at eleven locations along the Holland coast, in the Netherlands, underthree different SLR scenarios, the RCP4.5, RCP8.5 and Deltascenario. The availabilityof coastal profile data (from 1965 until now) and coastline position data (from1843 till 1980) made the Holland coast an ideal location to explore and extendthe applicability of the PCR framework. The most relevant assumptions for thiscoast were identified and explored. The recovery rate of the dune was a weakpoint of the PCR model and Holland coast was an interesting area to be tested.Three approaches of calibrating the natural recovery rate of the dunes werefollowed. In addition, the alongshore sediment transport which was assumednegligible to the previous case studies, in this work it was integrated intothe PCR model and pointed out that its contribution is important to the PCR.  For the eleven selected coastal profiles,20,000 simulations of 81 years (2020-2100) have been conducted and for everysimulation the most landward position of the coastline in every calendar yearhas been recorded. Hence, an empirical distribution of coastline recession forevery future year has been constructed. The ranges of the expected retreats in2100 (relative to 2020) for the different SLR scenarios are:0.5 m-155 m (for RCP4.5), 6 m-194 m (for RCP8.5) and18 m-172 m (for Deltascenario), corresponding to the 50 %exceedance probability values of the cumulative distribution function of thecoastline retreat. The average values of the coastal retreat for 2100 are 61 m,73 m and 97 m for RCP4.5, RCP 8.5, and Deltascenario respectively.The relevant average erosion volume by 2100 are 1664 m<sup>3</sup>/m,2005 m<sup>3</sup>/m and 2665 m<sup>3</sup>/m. According to thefindings, in 2100 the relative increase in volume loss along the entire theHolland coast is expected to be 95 %, 121 % and 173 %respectively for RCP4.5, 138 % for RCP8.5 and 195 % for Deltascenario.Finally, the results were compared to those raised from the Bruun rule method. Accordingto the findings, the majority of the profiles showing an erosive trend in thepast (before the ‘hold-the-line’ policy) raised slightly more conservativeresults when implementing the PCR model rather than when applying the Bruunrule method- especially under the Deltascenario. On the other hand, theBruun rule method is more conservative than PCR model for most of the accretiveprofiles. The PCR model can now be explored tolocations where the longshore sediment transport is not negligible. Theapproach followed in this study allows investigating the ability of the modelfor future coastal retreat estimates when a construction of a hard defence structureor a port may change abruptly the longshore sediment transport. Last, this studyadvances the PCR framework and can be a valuable assistance in the course offurther improving the model.  ","dune erosion; PCR; coastline change","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","","52.116515, 4.27689"

The Barsha pump uses the kinetic energy of water flowing through rivers to pump water to smallholder farmland for irrigation. The pump requires no external power source and all the energy required comes directly from the flow of the river. It is therefore a highly sustainable alternative to the currently used pumps, using fuel or diesel as a power source. These traditional pumps create greenhouse gas emissions and high operating costs for farmers. The aim of this thesis is to research and design a Product Service System (PSS) around the Barsha pump. Through a thorough desk research, threats and opportunities for the business model were identified. The main complication was identified to be the fact that farmers do not have a desire to use a sustainable pump if the investment costs are high. Therefore, the PSS should solve this matter by making it more affordable for farmers to buy such a pump. As there are no operational costs when using the Barsha, the PSS can focus purely on the overcoming the high initial costs.<br/><br/>Additionally, the opportunity of implementing a PSS for the Barsha pump was critically analysed. The attitude of the customers towards the service system as well as the simplicity of the service system are critical. If the system is too complicated, farmers are reluctant to use this and the chance of aQysta implementing it reduces significantly. Furthermore, the governmental subsidies for agriculture should be taken into account as this is a great opportunity to overcome the high initial costs. However, these subsidies also create a threat as they cause the farmers to be conceited and no longer willing to pay for any form of service or product. <br/><br/>Fieldwork was performed locally in Nepal to gather data and experiences from the different stakeholders: farmers, the government and possible partners. By communicating with people locally, further opportunities and complications were identified. It was verified that farmers are in great need of financial support for covering the upfront costs. Furthermore, it was identified that the farmers desire training about farming and need a connection with the market. A good designed PSS could help by delivering this. <br/><br/>The fieldwork determined the feasibility of a PSS for the Barsha pump and with the gained knowledge two designs were made. The concept design, Barsha Basecamp was validated by aQysta out of which the final design: Barsha Summit derived. A result-oriented PSS, where aQysta is responsible for the whole value chain and offers farmers a guaranteed income. <br/><br/>The conclusion of this thesis is that the ideal PSS, which is one that makes profit and creates impact on society, does not exist for this case. Also, too many variables exist which makes it too complex to stick to only one business model. The final design for this thesis is a sustainable business model that works well in theory, but it is yet to be determined whether it will work in practise as well.<br","Product Service System; Sustainable business models; aQysta","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

At the moment, Compressed Sensing (CS) is introduced to reduce the scan time, however, new methods are developed such as a deep learning method, called the Recurrent Inference Machine (RIM). In this study the effect of reconstructing undersampled MRI images with lesions, using the RIM and CS, was evaluated. In data of a healthy control, lesions were simulated. Evaluation is done by checking if the lesion has the correct intensity and shape after reconstruction of undersampled data. Methods: In raw data of a healthy control lesions were simulated. To test the RIM and CS, the images with lesions where first undersampled 4x, 6x, 8x and 10x. After undersampling, the images were reconstructed with both RIM and CS. First, the peak intensity difference was measured between the reference image (with simulated lesions) and reconstructed images for both RIM and CS. Second, one lesion was undersampled ten times with different undersampling masks creating different noise, for 3 different acceleration factors (4x, 6x, 8x). These lesions were reconstructed with both RIM and CS. The maximum intensity difference between reference and reconstructed image was measured and averaged over the ten different undersampled images. Results: In total seven different lesions were simulated in a healthy control with different intensities varying between 10\% and 100\% of the GM-lesion intensity in a FLAIR weighted scan. The intensities of all lesions were more accurately reconstructed with the RIM compared to CS at higher acceleration factors: the average intensity per lesions after 10 times reconstruction with RIM was more equal to the correct intensity compared to the reconstruction with CS. Conclusion: The RIM shows robust and accurate results on data with simulated lesions. Moreover, the RIM outperformed CS on data that was more undersampled. Therefore, the RIM may be used for reconstruction of MRI data that is acquired with shorter acquisition time. And since the reconstruction time is better, it could replace CS in the future. However, before the RIM could be used, further evaluations on actual patient data are needed.","MRI; Image Reconstruction; Deep Learning; Lesion Simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","52.292093, 4.957044"

Detached Eddy Simulation is a CFD method that combines the scale resolving capabilities of Large Eddy Simulation with the low cost modelling of the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. The method promises to capture unsteady flow phenomena better than RANS with only a limited increase in costs. Various DES variants exist, which use different methods to switch between the RANS and the LES regions in the flow domain. The main method used is the Improved Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation (IDDES) method. This is a combination of the Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation (DDES) method and a Wall-Modelled LES (WMLES) method. The DDES method shields the full attached boundary layer from LES and models it with RANS. The WMLES method does the opposite, allowing the use of LES within the boundary layer. IDDES chooses the most suitable one of these methods locally, to ensure a high accuracy and a robust method. The performance of the method when simulating limited span airfoil models and complex full car geometries is assessed and improved. A number of parameter variations are done on the airfoil models to improve understanding of the method through less costly simulations. The main application domain however, is motorsport. Three different aerodynamically complex car geometries are simulated with the IDDES method. The performance of the method is assessed by comparison with various RANS results and wind tunnel data in the form of axial force data, pressure taps and PIV data. Some parameter variations on the car are also tested to improve the results and obtain a reliable design process. The IDDES method is able to visualize more flow phenomena and characteristics. Additionally, drag and the impact of ride height changes are predicted well. Downforce is unfortunately generally overpredicted. There are indications that the results might be improved by varying the inflow conditions and by testing with finer time steps and/or meshes. Because of the costs involved and the desire to investigate the method as part of an extensive design process, this was deemed outside the scope to the master thesis. It is however, a recommended step for further exploration of the topic.","CFD; Detached Eddy Simulation; Motorsport; Full Car Simulations; DES; IDDES","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-11-15","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Aerodynamics","",""

This optimal concentration depends on the phenotype and genetic background of the cells. Due to bet hedging, the Cdc42 concentration is different between cells in a population and it is expected that the concentration, measured for many cells, is gamma distributed. This study describes a method for determining the concentration of Cdc42 proteins depending on the phenotype of individual cells. Fluorescence microscopy images were analyzed using custom designed software for tracking single cells and detecting budding and polarization events, based on existing segmentation software. This allows for estimating the cell volume and determining the concentration distribution based on the fluorescence intensity. The estimated cell volume is larger than was expected which is proven to be caused by segmentation errors. The intensity is shown to scale linearly with the number of fluorescent sources and using this result, the distribution for the Cdc42 concentration and copy number can be determined. For calculating the absolute concentration and copy number values, a constant still needs to be determined. To assess the reliability of the obtained results, validation measurements should be performed, for example by using different galactose concentrations to control the Cdc42 production by means of a galactose promoter or by using different genetic backgrounds. Based on the results, this method shows a possible way of determining the budding and polarization events and measuring the protein concentration for individual cells.","Saccharomyces Cerevisiae; Microscopy; Cdc42; Protein; Protein concentration; Image analysis; Budding yeast; Spinning Disc Microscope; Fluorescence imaging; Polarization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Aside from the problem of climate change, it is facing another problem – that of air pollution. Use of dirty fuels by residential households such as biomass and coal cause emissions harmful for the environment, as well as to the health of citizens. In order to reduce this, local governments are tasked with inducing a change in household fuel consumption from dirty fuels (such as biomass and coal) to ones that are cleaner and more efficient, such as natural gas or electricity. The ‘lower-tiered’ cities are often left to their own devices in how to implement suitable policies in order to reach these targets. As a result, the policies that are introduced often ensure targets are reached, but also leave citizens without any fuel alternatives, or forces residents to resort to other unhealthy fuels. This research investigates how lower-tier prefectures can stimulate their residents to shift daily energy fuel demand from traditional fuel use to cleaner and more efficient fuels, while preventing the population from unwillingly reducing their total energy demand. The research was performed through a case-study research in the prefecture city of Jingmen in Hubei province. Energy consumption demand behaviour was investigated using a system dynamics model through mechanisms of citizen reaction to energy price level, convenience of fuel consumption, knowledge about clean and efficient energy use and willingness to making a conscious change in consumption. The research finds that the urban citizens are concerned about the effects of fuel consumption on their personal health, while the rural population shows larger concern for the price of fuel and convenience of consumption. A ban on coal will best reduce emissions but it should be implemented in combination with a supportive policy in order to prevent citizens from unwillingly reducing energy demand. Other policies, such as providing an energy subsidy will be less effective and lead to higher levels of uncertainty.","Energy Policy; China; Energy demand; Energy consumption behaviour; System Dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","","31.0354, 112.1994"

One of the reasons is the lack of computational tools at these stages. The main objective of this research project was the expansion of StructuralComponents by the development of a parametric real-time computational tool prototype to quickly determine the feasibility of mid-rise buildings designs with rigid frames as stability members. A study of rigid frames behaviour was performed to define a range of applicability of the existing analytical representation and to develop two new methods to analytically represent rigid frames behaviour: a correction method for the shear beam representation and a method based on the Timoshenko beam theory. To allow for vertical connections of different rigid frame geometries, an analytical method to consider a different stiffness along the height was developed. The results showed that the analytical shear beam representation of rigid frames has a reduced range of applicability for parametric purposes. This reduced applicability is due to the combined shear and bending behaviour. The correction method follows from the prediction of the error when using the shear beam representation. In addition to the correction of the shear beam representation, the prediction of the error was defined as a parameter to classify the behaviour of a rigid frame as a shear, flexural or combined type. Both, the applicability range and the correction method are based on analytical and numerical comparisons, as well as the performed validations. The implemented software comprises Maplesoft to get the analytical solutions and Grasshopper with Karamba3D (which contains the finite element solver) to get the numerical solutions. The method based on the Timoshenko beam theory comes from the theoretical derivations of a serial system that takes into account both, bending and shear deformations. It was found that it is more appropriate to analytically represent the general behaviour of rigid frames with the Timoshenko beam theory and by additionally considering a different stiffness calculation for the ground floor. Also, it was shown that the vertical connections of rigid frame geometries can be addressed with the calculation of an analytical solution for each different geometry along the height. Both analytical approaches, the Timoshenko beam representation and the method for vertical connections were implemented in the tool prototype. Such a tool consists of a calculation method to assess the structural performance of a building by the simultaneous structural analysis of every rigid frame subjected to a lateral load. The three main characteristics of the tool prototype are the parametric adaptability, the instantaneous display of results and the stacking “Lego-type” connection between components. The validations in this research project showed that the proposed and implemented methods are suitable for preliminary design stages because the error for the most unfavourable geometric configurations resulted in less than 15 percent. It is recommended to conduct further research and tool development. In so doing, more informed decisions can be made during the preliminary design stages.","Rigid frame; Computational tool; Early design stage; Parametric design; Structural analysis; Structural design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Structural Mechanics","",""

Generalization of motor commands means that a learned movement, such as grasping a bottle, transfers to similar but new environments, such as grasping a carton of milk. However, it remains unclear to what extent we are able to learn an uncertain variable environment and to what extent these learned movements transfer to a new environment. We compared generalization to a new environment after learning a fixed (F) or trial-by-trial variable (V) velocity-dependent clockwise force field. Selecting the damping coefficients from a predefined distribution on a trial-by-trial basis introduced the variability for the variable group during the training trials, while the fixed group had a fixed damping coefficient during training. After training, both groups made reaching movements in a new force field that was fixed over all trials. Due to the uncertainty in the force field strengths, we hypothesized that the variable group would have more difficulties with adapting compared to the fixed group. However, because the variable group would experience more different force fields during the training, we hypothesized that they would perform better in the new environment. Based on the force field compensation factors, the adaptation to the training fields was: 79.8% (F) and 79.7% (V), p = 0.982. The generalization learning was similar for both groups: 78.8% (F) and 78.9%, p = 0.986. Interestingly, the trajectory measurements showed that the variable group was less accurate than the fixed group in the training fields, but more accurate in the generalization field. Therefore, our results show that variable force field perturbations can be learned and generalized in a similar manner as fixed perturbations and that the variable group, despite a more inaccurate performance in the training block, reached more accurately than the fixed group in the new environment.","Motor adaptation; Uncertainty; Generalization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-15","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

These studies require the computation of numerous computationally expensive CFD simulations and result in predominantly optimisation graphs of design objectives (e.g. Pareto-front figure). The quantity of generated data is intractable and therefore in practice not stored. All the physical insight into the flow-fields is lost and no data can be accessed nor any adjustments can be made. This work researches the combination of CFD simulations and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to simultaneously: 1) reduce computational cost and time, 2) retain physical insight by focusing on the prediction of flow-fields and 3) keep the ability to access information or to make adjustments. This research starts with the identification of 19 potential holding ML-algorithms. A suitable algorithm is chosen with the help of 4 criteria, that is referred to as the Proper-Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) - Interpolation algorithm. In studied literature it reportedly provided very high speed-up times, good accuracy, additional learning benefit and is relative simple. The POD-Interpolation algorithm is implemented on two test cases: the Von Karman Vortex Street and a Shear Mixing Layer. The results are summarised for both as unphysical and highly inaccurate. Two root-causes are identified: the first is an invalid assumption in the methodology and the second dominant root-cause is a fundamental flaw. Interpolation can never accurately predict dominant frequencies in a flow-field. With the inability of the POD-Interpolation algorithm to predict physical accurate flow-fields, a new proposed algorithm is implemented. This is referred to as the Sparse-Dynamic-Mode-Decomposition (sDMD) - Scaling method. This method relies on accurate scaling relations to predict flow-fields. However, almost no application cases have known scaling relations. The sDMD-Scaling algorithm is capable of discovering and using these newly discovered scaling relations to predict flow-fields. This is proven for the Von Karman Vortex Street case with self-made scaling relations: the Mean Residual Error of the predicted flow-fields rarely exceeds 7%. An error reduction factor of ≈ 10 is achieved when compared to the POD-Interpolation approach. The design space from the test case is computed ≈ 5.6 times faster with the CFD and sDMD-Scaling combination than with the conventional CFD approach. Furthermore, any new design point can be computed ≈ 309 times faster with the trained sDMD-Scaling algorithm than with a CFD simulation. The sDMD-Scaling algorithm proves that it is possible to combine CFD and ML to achieve the 3 aforementioned goals for a canonical fluid dynamic test case. Several recommendations are presented to improve the sDMD-Scaling algorithm for more complex cases. However, given the difficulties and efforts that went into the relative straightforward test cases, it is difficult to foresee any large-scale implementation of any CFD and ML combination for predicting flow-fields.","Machine Learning; CFD; Prediction; LES","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://github.com/TUDelft-SArntzen/MScThesis-Prediction_of_FlowFields GitHub Repository","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

This thesis has researched the application of a Multiple Partially Penetrating Wells (MPPWs) as a well design method to counteract the effect of buoyancy flow and improve the performance of HT-ATES systems (&gt;60°C). A MPPW is a well with more than one screen that allows injection and extraction of water at different depths in the aquifer.This method to counteract the effect of buoyancy flow was tested through numerical modelling with SEAWATv4. The modelled HT-ATES systems were running for four recovery cycles each including injection-storage-extraction-rest phases. The thermal recovery efficiency was determined over these cycles for 7 different scenarios and four different cases: a) A regular HT-ATES system with a fully penetrating screen, b) a regular HT-ATES system where buoyancy flow is neglected, c) an HT-ATES system with a MPPW with two screens, d) an HT-ATES system with four screens. The latter case was tested for three different control approaches based on data from four different locations in the aquifer.For the reference scenario where 90°C water was injected, a regular HT-ATES system had a thermal recovery efficiency of 0.61. With the application of MPPWs for both two or four screens this was 0.81 in the fourth recovery cycle, which approaches the case without buoyancy which had a thermal recovery efficiency of 0.88. The application of two or four screens did not show significant difference in thermal recovery efficiency after the first recovery cycle.A sensitivity analysis showed that the absolute increase in thermal recovery efficiency of an HT-ATES system with a MPPW compared to a regular HT-ATES is higher for larger buoyancy flow (i.e, high injection temperature and high (vertical) hydraulic conductivity), smaller injection volume and larger aquifer thickness. An applicability analysis showed that application of MPPWs is beneficial if the buoyancy flow (which is defined as the vertical hydraulic conductivity times the density ratio of the ambient groundwater and injected water) is greater than 0.1 meters per day.","High temperature; HT-ATES; ATES; buoyancy; flow; MPPW; multiple partially penetrating wells; thermal recovery efficiency; Monitoring; Control; Numerical modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

To keep the response burden on the Dutch households low, Statistics Netherlands applies a screening procedure to their selected samples. In our research, we investigate the effects of the screening procedure on the survey sampling process. We conclude that the effects of the screening process cannot be considered negligible. We derive an approximation of the inclusion probability of an element in the sample after screening. This probability is dependent on the number of people on address and the sampling fraction. Consequently, the probability is not equal for all inhabitants and the effects of the screening procedure become larger as sample sizes increase. Two different statistical tests are developed and applied to existing samples that have recently been selected and screened by Statistics Netherlands, to determine whether the sample after screening is representative for the population (and for the sample before screening) with respect to relevant auxiliary variables. From a super-population viewpoint, we investigate the properties of the generalised regression estimator. We prove that under modest conditions the generalised regression estimator is consistent and asymptotically unbiased for the self-weighting two-stage sampling design that is used at Statistics Netherlands. When screening is applied, we cannot conclude that the generalised regression estimator is consistent and asymptotically unbiased. We show how the Horvitz-Thompson estimator and the generalised regression estimator can be used to undo the effects of the screening procedure during the estimation of population characteristics.","Survey sampling; sampling design; inclusion probability; Horvitz-Thompson estimator; multivariate hypergeometric distribution; parametric bootstrap; generalised regression estimator; super-population model; consistency; asymptotically unbiased","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

In this environment, multiple groups of people from different organizations, and with different goals and policies have to share information. The information has to be shared without the risk of leaking information to unauthorized entities. Cryptography algorithms are used to encrypt information with a key to remain in control of when, where and to whom it is shared. All information is encrypted based on the concept of content-based encryption. In this unreliable environment, the cryptographic keys used to secure the data have to be available to continue collecting and processing information. <br/><br/>A key management architecture should be in place, to facilitate the generation and distribution of these keys. The purpose of this key management architecture is to provide the entities in the field with specific keys such that information access policies can be enforced. The challenge here is that in tactical networks, network partitionings are expected to happen. Therefore, the same keys have to be redundantly available at multiple locations to prevent a single point of failure. In a connected network, the keys can constantly be synchronized between these locations. However, the problem of key de-synchronization occurs if the network is split for some time, keys are changed on both sides, and then the network is recombined. This leads to possible conflicting keys because synchronization was temporarily not possible. The key management architecture must be able to handle such conflicts and reintegrate them as necessary.<br/><br/>In this thesis, we present a decentralized key management architecture with a solution for the key de-synchronization problem. We propose to use Conflict-free replicated data types, to store the keys at multiple locations and prevent conflicts. Conflict-free replicated data types is a concept to store and replicate data across multiple instances. This data type is characterized by the possibility to update the data in all instances independently, and concurrently, without coordination between the instances. Additionally, three approaches for the coordination of key creation are proposed with different levels of consistency and availability. The architecture and the three approaches are compared in experiments to evaluate the differences and prove the feasibility of the designs.","Key Management; Conflict-free replicated data types; Partition Tolerance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Cyber Security","",""

New concepts and technological solutions have failed to catch on. However, the cane seems unappealing and outdated to some potential users. Margot Scheltema, the initiator of this graduation project, is a future cane user. She feels that the current cane design is alien from her identity and she feels reluctant to use it. She is not alone: due to the social stigma, many cane users feel self-conscious when using the device, some even decide not to use it, despite the mobility limitations resulting from such decision. Research After the initial desk research phase, field research was conducted to explore questions of VIP mobility. The process contributed to a high level of empathy for VIPs. Autoethnographic studies were conducted in collaboration with Thijs te Velde, to build a base of self-experience concerning VIP mobility struggles. Through the collaboration with Visio Den Haag and Margot Scheltema, different perspectives were represented in the research data. The most important mobility struggles and attitudes concerning mobility aids were identified. Positive aspects of VIP life and the inherent dilemmas were also collected. The design solution The Dot Bot is a navigation aid consisting of a network of location-specific navigational and environmental information nodes (Dots) accessible to a specific user group. The information is stored in the form of audio descriptions created by the userbase. This way virtual DotBot community facilitates the sharing of commuting know-how. The information Dots make use of existing VIP relevant infrastructural elements in the tactile paving. It is aimed to enhance the perks of being part of the VIP community, cultivating feelings of connectedness and belonging. The semantic qualities of the cane are preserved, to keep it recognisable and ensure user safety in commute. However, there are moments where the effects of impairment are preferred to keep private. For this reason, I aimed to limit the need to ask for directions and aid VIPs in cultivating pride and the feeling of competence through exercising their ability to navigate autonomously. The way the information is stored and accessed supports this: for the outsider eye accessing information from a road stud on the tactile paving is invisible. During the evaluation phase, several aspects of the DotBot concept were tested with VIP participants. In the first validation session, insights on information needs during navigation were collected. In the second validation session the envisioned interaction was evaluated by the help of functional prototypes, and feedback types were also investigated. Further studies would be needed to establish the optimal Dot density in vibrotactile feedback pattern and intensity.","Inclusive design; IoT; positive design; Visually impaired; mobility; Mobility aid; smart cities","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

In agriculture, VWC can be used to monitor drought and assess crop productivity. Being able to monitor VWC is important to reduce agricultural vulnerability and scientifically manage agricultural water use. Due to the dense in-situ networks are expensive and have difficulties in capturing the large spatial variability of VWC. Therefore, remote sensing has great potential in VWC monitoring. With the application of remote sensing, worldwide data with coarse or fine spatial and temporal resolution can be extracted with relatively low cost. Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD), extracted from the radar remote sensing observations, is a dimensionless parameter that highly related to VWC. Thus, VOD can be used as an indicator for VWC. The present research aims to thoroughly analyze the relation between VOD and VWC. High temporal backscatter data and detailed field experiment data of soil moisture and vegetation water content during a full growing season of corn (between 18 April 2018 to 13 June 2018) were used. Correlations between VOD and VWC were analyzed. The result shows that VOD is highly related to $VWC_{bulk}$. However, the linear relation between VWC$_{bulk}$ and VOD is only valid before the heading stage at both co- and cross-polarization. Then, random forest machine learning was conducted to determine the sensitivity of VOD to the water content of different parts of the plant. This sensitivity analysis contains two parts: a) the sensitivity of VOD to the water content of different vegetation components and b) The sensitivity of VOD to stem and leaf water content at different heights. The results of a) show that VOD is more sensitive to stem and leaf water content in the vegetative stage whereas more sensitive to ear water content during the reproductive stage. Besides, stem, leaf and ear water content can better capture the VOD variation during the vegetative stage. The result from b) suggests that VOD can provide information about the vertical distribution of moisture inside the canopy. Finally, a cross-comparison was conducted between VOD and other commonly used vegetation indicators, which includes NDVI and Cross-Ratio. VOD is available regardless of cloud conditions and is, therefore, more reliable than NDVI. Compared with cross-ratio, VOD is better related to vegetation moisture dynamics.","single incidence angle L-band backscatter; vegetation optical depth; vegetation water content","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is a need for a sustainable solution to reduce or even eliminate traffic jams. Freeway traffic control has shown to be a sustainable solution to this problem. Especially the implementation of Ramp Metering (RM) installations and Variable Speed Limits (VSLs) as control measures is currently a widely researched area because the proper coordination of those measures can significantly reduce traffic congestion, traffic emissions and the risk of accidents. The Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework has shown outstanding capabilities for coordinated control of RM installations and VSLs. However, the inherent nonlinearity of traffic flow, in combination with the discrete nature of VSLs and the continuous nature of RM rates, yields a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) optimisation problem that has to be solved within every controller sampling interval. The computational time that is needed to solve MINLP problems generally increases exponentially with the size of the problem. Therefore, the implementation of MPC to large freeway networks remains challenging. This work proposes two novel MPC algorithms for coordinated control of continuous RM rates and discrete VSLs on large freeway networks. Both algorithms use a distributed control architecture and an alternating optimisation scheme to relax the MINLP problems and, hence, offer a trade-off between computational complexity and system performance. A case study is performed to evaluate the performance of both algorithms. In this case study a 30 km long freeway network is used that contains six VSLs and three RM installations. The first part of the case study shows that relaxing the VSLs to be continuous decision variables instead of discrete decision variables in the optimisation problems results in a major performance loss with a distributed architecture. This result contrasts with many related works, where the MINLP optimisation problems are relaxed by considering the VSLs to be continuous decision variables. The second part of the case study evaluates the proposed distributed algorithms by comparing their performance to the more conventional centralised and decentralised MPC algorithms. Both proposed algorithms have a lower computational complexity than the centralised algorithm, as they manage to solve the optimisation problems within the controller sampling intervals. Moreover, one of the proposed algorithms has a system performance that is remarkably similar to the optimal performance of the centralised algorithm.","Alternating Optimisation; Model Predictive Control; Distributed Control; Freeway Traffic Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

It tries to explain the current situation in the Surabaya River Basin and shows how ’river water’ and ’waste’ shape ontologies. Furthermore, how these two nonhuman actors act differently (or the same) in different ontologies. The definition used in this study for an ontology is ""a construction of how concepts of reality are constructed"". Several analyses are used. Firstly, statistics are used to support narratives where deemed necessary. In addition, QGIS is used to visualise data. Lastly, a flow diagram is made to show the flow of waste into the Surabaya River. Existence of multiple ontologies in the Surabaya River Basin is described. It is found that both reproduction of actions is present (on the short term) as well as production of different actions, which becomes more visible in the long term. For example, waste burning every afternoon is a reoccurring action. However, the reduction of single-use plastics is an evolved state. The riverbank is an important location in the relations and could serve as a suitable location for such actions. Lack of information, communication and facilities are identified to be the most important issues. In general, people are optimistic and motivated concerning the environment. However there are some people not engaged. This causes a divide and together with social control leads to tensions in the community. Recommendations include, among others, setting up an information sharing platform between institutions and community members and making use of the cultural resources to work towards a common goal.

The main interest of this project is on the sit-to-stand task of a transfemoral amputee fitted with an active knee and passive ankle prosthesis. The objective is to test whether strategies like asymmetric foot placement and reduced weight-bearing asymmetry could reduce the torque produced in the intact knee. Musculoskeletal model of an able-bodied human subject and a transfemoral amputee subject enabled with an active knee prosthesis is developed. Forward dynamic optimisations are performed by defining an appropriate framework required for simulating the sit-to-stand task. The process was verified by implementing the framework on the musculoskeletal model of an able-bodied individual and comparing it with experimental results available in the literature. The comparison showed a good agreement of simulated results with results reported in the literature. Joint torque profiles of the intact limb of the amputee model were then simulated with asymmetric foot placement and reduced weight-bearing asymmetry strategies. Placing the prosthetic leg posterior to the intact leg reduced the peak intact knee torques by 1.5% relative to placing the intact leg adjacent to the prosthetic leg. The peak intact knee joint torques were reduced by 13% in SiSt task simulation with reduced weight-bearing asymmetry.

Assessing ground-borne vibration and noise is of crucial importance, especially in soft soils in which Rayleigh wave velocity is low and amplification of vibrations is more likely to occur.

After having numerical model validated, several simulations are performed in order to study the factors influencing ground-borne vibrations.<br/>From the results of this study, one can conclude that ‘concrete slab beneath ballast bed’ is effective in reducing vibration strength at all distances when train speed is considerably lower than Rayleigh wave velocity of the uppermost soil layer. It is notable, however, that the application of this measure may bring about amplification of the vibration strength in the vicinity of the track for trains running at higher speeds. Nevertheless, regardless of the train speed, there is always a reduction in the vibration strength at further distances from the railway track. From practical standpoints, this aspect is of interest for the buildings located in the far field. From the results of a sensitivity analysis on changes to the width and thickness of the concrete slab, it can be concluded that an optimal solution of concrete slab dimensions can be found. It is observed that by changing concrete slab dimensions, the maximum vibration strength is mostly affected in close proximity to the railway track. In addition, the dispersion lines and oscillatory moving load in the Wavenumber-Frequency plane are analyzed. Their intersection indicates that the moving oscillatory load excites a wave of frequency and wavenumber given by the intersection point. If these frequencies are harmful for the environment then concrete slab application can diminish their content from response. Sleeper passing frequency content increases when the concrete slab is applied. The obtained results and recommendations from this study can be used for further studying the other factors influencing the effectiveness of the measure. Examples of these factors include, among others, various ground conditions (e.g., soft soils of different stratification, local changes in soil proper-ties, etc.), and optimization of concrete slab dimensions, material parameters, as well as, cracked and uncracked concrete stage. The numerical model developed during this research study can be further employed to analyze different aspects of railway induced ground-borne vibrations.","FEM; Railway induced vibration; vibration; abatement measure; concrete slab; Numerical Analysis; Train; Dynamic Analysis; Plaxis 3D","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-14","","","","","",""

Its building stock has shown to be highly vulnerable to these unexpected events. Among various building typologies, damage has been reported for approximately 12.9% of the churches in Groningen. From the perspective of conservation and prevention of loss of our historical and cultural heritage, the assessment of churches is of importance. As a majority of historical structures have undergone restoration works, that can be favourable for their seismic performance, it is worth noticing that for historical structures strengthening may not be necessary. Consequently, the question arises whether structural modifications during the lifespan of historical unreinforced masonry churches, positively influences their seismic performance. This thesis researches the seismic performance of the historical unreinforced masonry Dutch church Zandeweer, prior and post structural modifications, in the earthquake prone area Groningen. The church, built by the Moncks of Abdij van Aduard in the year 1230, underwent major renovation works in 1931. Its structure is composed of masonry walls, masonry ribbed cross vaults and a timber roof with timber cladding. During the restoration works in 1931 steel columns were integrated in the piers of one of the façade in the longitudinal direction, window openings in the curved façade were closed and concrete beams were added on top of the main walls. Its seismic performance was investigating in the positive longitudinal direction by studying its global nonlinear response and structural elemental behaviour and by indicating uncertainties and damage. A Nonlinear Pushover Analysis (NLPO) and the Simplified Lateral Mechanism Analysis method (SLaMA) were employed to capture the influence on the seismic performance of the church models. Although, the acquired results for the church models showed to a certain extend an insight in the influence of the structural modifications, an insight in the ductility behaviour of the structure was not acquired. Additionally, from the eigenvalue it was concluded that adopted single-mode analysis methods (SLaMA and NLPO) were not suitable, as the structural response of the church is governed by multi-modes. Moreover, with the highly unpredictable behaviour of the vaults in the structure the presented results were greatly influence by physical and numerical instabilities. For future studies is recommended to dedicate a detailed study to the numerical modelling and analysis of masonry ribbed cross vault structures. Furthermore, to conduct a detailed study on the church walls, for which subsequently various analysis methods can be employed and the influence of orthotropy of walls on the global response can be studied. Lastly, the analysis method can be changed by using methods that consider multi-modes simultaneously and that are known for less numerical instability problems than static analysis methods.","Groningen earthquakes; Historical masonry churches; Nonlinear finite element analysis; Curved shell finite elements; Simplified Lateral Mechanism Analysis (SLaMA); Nonlinear Pushover Analysis; Seismic Performance; Unreinforced Masonry; Masonry Cross Vaults","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-11-13","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Structural Mechanics","",""

By gathering trajectory data and calculating various Surrogate Measures of Safety it has become possible to analyse safety without waiting for accidents to happen. Using these indicators combined with Extreme Value Theory (EVT) one can estimate the probability of crashes as extreme (unobserved) events. The primary goal of this thesis is to contribute to the research that has been done so far on the application of Extreme Value Theory to Surrogate Measures for traffic safety analysis.

(mentor); Teunissen, L.P.J. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","The 2020 Olympics will take place in Tokyo. The expected heat and humidity will cause severe heat stress for athletes. To improve safety and performance of Dutch athletes during the Olympics the project “Thermo Tokyo – Beat the Heat” was started. This is a multidisciplinary project in which multiple universities, companies, sports organizations and sport innovator centers take part. Sailors are prone to heat issues because they are obliged to wear an insulating flotation aid. And they are not sheltered from the sun. The Sailing Innovation Center came with the proposition to design a cooling garment for Dutch sailors that are competing in the 2020 Olympics. The sailing context was analyzed. The best option for sailors is a cooling vest that can be applied underneath the flotation aid. Sailing regulations forbid wearing a cooling vest during a race because of the added weight around the torso. A cooling vest can still be worn before and in between races. According to literature, pre-cooling can have a possitive effect on exercise performance in hot and humid conditions. Using a Phase Change Material (PCM) is the best cooling technique for the sailing context. PCMs do not requires special equipment, only a freezer for recharging and a coolbox for transport are needed. Also, the cooling power of a PCM is independent from the environment. Project partner Inuteq provided PCMs for the project. Multiple PCMs were analyzed. A paraffin based PCM with a phase change temperature of 6,5°C is best for short and intense cooling. Combining ice with a thin layer of Neoprene is the best option if cooling duration is important. Laser sealing TPU sheets made it possible to create custom shaped cooling packs quick and easy. Multiple forms were tried. A raster of hexagons showed the right balance between flexibility and rigidity. Seven iterations of ideating, designing, prototyping and testing were executed. This lead to the design of a cooling vest that is easy to use at sea. It can be applied quickly underneath sailing clothing. And it can be stored in a medium sized coolbox. The design as proposed can not be produced on short notice by partner Inuteq. With some compromise the most imporant features of the design were transfered to a design that is producible well before the Olympics. The cooling power and duration of the vests is estimated by combining results from lab and exercise tests. The method used to make this estimation does not require a thermal mannequin. And it can be used for a variety of cooling vests. The vest is compared to other vests previously evaluated in literature. It is almost certain that the vest will have a positive impact on exercise performance in hot and humid conditions. It is hard to compare sailing to the exercise protocols used to measure the effect of cooling garments on sport performance. Nevertheless, it is likely that sailors can benefit from using a cooling vest during the 2020 Olympics if weather conditions are as expected.","Cooling; Garment; Sailing; Olympics; TPU; Phase Change Material (PCM)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-08-01","","","","Integrated Product Design","Thermo Tokyo - Beat the Heat",""

(graduation committee); Tuin, Henry (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","In contrast with other Dutch rivers parts, human measures in the upstream part of the River Meuse did not mainly focus on discharging surplus water, but on retaining water in dry periods. Almost 100 years ago seven weirs were constructed in the River Meuse to enable transport of coals. The structures reach, due to concrete degradation, the end of their technical lifetime and the manual operation does not meet the current ARBO-legislation; both make replacement of the weirs required. Rijkswaterstaat, asset owner of the waterways and weirs, invited the civil engineering sector to collectively develop weir replacement strategies in 2015. The future developments of the river and surroundings were an important subject during the meetings. With this in mind, during the co-creation meetings under the title ‘Grip op de Maas’, one of the proposed weir replacement strategies was called the Adaptive Meuse (De Bouwcampus, 2015). This perspective took the future uncertainty into account by proposing adaptive designing of the weirs. This study builds on this perspective by the objective of designing an adaptive weir in the River Meuse according to the approach of adaptive delta management.This approach states that designs have to be flexible and able to switch between multiple strategies for future challenges concerning flood safety and freshwater storage. In this study, an overview of the measures required to deal with the development of specific purposes is provided by adaptation schemes. When and if a specific purpose applies, depends on which of the four Dutch delta scenarios, DRUK, STOOM, RUST and WARM, evolves. These scenarios are based on a unique combination of the rate of climate change and socioeconomic developments (Wolters, Van den Born, Dammers, &amp; Reinhard, 2018). Adaptivity is obtained by regional adaptation measures over a particular stretch of the river and by weir adaptation measures. To address both the adaptivity of the river and the weirs, three design levels have been established. These levels are summed below:The global design level comprises the total dammed section of the Dutch River Meuse and two weir sections in Belgium. The series of weirs in the river still suffices the requirements; on this scale, no large adaptations have to be made now or in the future.The regional design level comprises the weir sections Roermond and Belfeld, since the adaptivity of these sections is the largest of all weir sections in the global design area.The local design level addresses the geometric design of weir Belfeld itself. The adaptivity of the designed weir enables the discard of regional adaptation measures with undesired implications.Since both dehydration and permanent flooding of the river valley have to be prevented and the water distribution over Belgium and the Netherlands is fixed in an agreement, the global adaptivity is limited. Weir removal or replacement of the current weir by a new weir at a different location is in most weir sections infeasible. Weir section Roermond forms an exception, since the commercial navigation uses the later dug parallel Lateral Canal, part of weir section Belfeld. Thus, the majority of weir section Roermond can be restricted to only recreational vessels. By modifications of weir Belfeld, it could possibly (partly) take over the functions of weir Roermond in future. In 2030 however, one-to-one weir replacement is selected to avert significant changes in groundwater table.For the regional design level, the future developments are split into the flexibility to groundwater changes, the use of freshwater for drinking water production, agriculture and industrial activities, the discharge of flood waves and the navigation on the River Meuse and to the port of Roermond. An adaptation scheme indicates what regional adaptation measures and weir adaptation measures are required to serve the purposes per time period in each of the four delta scenarios. On basis of this adaptation scheme, it is concluded that by designing an adaptive weir, measures along the entire weir section, for instance raising embankments or raising bridges, can be discarded in the future. The freedom of choice of the future waterway manager is preserved by an adaptive weir. In the last design level, an adaptive weir is proposed to replace weir Belfeld. The requirements to and the design of the adaptive weir are based on the regional adaptation scheme. The weir can be adapted by:constructing additional weir openings at the eastern embankment, enabled by the location of the new weir, which is just a couple of hundreds meter upstream of the current weir.adjusting the management of the weir gates, enabled by the choice of radial gates. The location in the weir section at which the dammed water level is independent of the river discharge can be shifted throughout the weir section. This allows the air clearance and the water level dynamics to be managed for container transport and ecological development, respectively. heightening the dammed water level, also enabled by the choice of radial gates. To withstand the larger water head, the initial investment increases by 30%. However, regional measures are saved in the future. Only the gates and height of the superstructure have to be adapted in the future to heighten the dammed water level.In conclusion, on global level, a change of the locations and numbers of weirs in the River Meuse is presently not desired and required, since the functions are met with the current weir layout. To guarantee this in the entire upcoming century, adaptations are required in the weir section Belfeld in the River Meuse. The resulting adaptation scheme after construction of the proposed adaptive weir presents the regional and weir adaptation measures that serve the mentioned scenario-dependent purposes. By the large adaptivity of proposed weir design, regional adaptation measures along the river with undesired implications can be discarded or minimized. Only if higher container vessels have to be accommodated on the Meuse River or the accessibility of the Prins Willem-Alexanderport has to be improved, regional measures are inevitable. The method used in this report can be used to set up adaptation schemes for all weir sections in the River Meuse. By involving Rijkswaterstaat and other stakeholders, the schemes can be turned into quantitative ones. Last, it is recommended to start structural calculations on the adaptive weir Belfeld.","Adaptivity; Weirs; Meuse; Replacement; Delta scenarios; Climate change; Belfeld","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","","51.319668, 6.112313"

The uprise of social enterprises proves that businesses can do both (Bersin, 2018). Addressing larger societal issues while at the same time create economical value. Maybe the most well-known example of this is Tony Chocolonely. But not all businesses have the luxurity to start from scratch with a revamped strategy that focuses on creating Social Impact. The majority of businesses today are those who have existed for a while and started without a social mission (MKB Nederland, 2019). However, they do feel the pressure, internal or external, to keep up with their new social role in society but they do not know how (Raman, 2011; Lepoutre, 2006; Laudal, 2011; Polonsky, 2009). Cases show that those ‘traditional’ businesses trying to change often fail to position themselves which results in negative backlash and irreversible damage (Confino, 2013). The question is: how to effectively help traditional business in their progress to change? Que Heartbeat Strategy, a research and strategy consultancy, who helps businesses in creating both economical and societal value (Heartbeat Strategy, n.d.). Through exploration of the concept ‘Social Impact’, relevant insights are found that led to the conclusion that there are three key aspects that contribute to solving the issue. The first two key aspects are to focus on internal alignment and focus on internal communication. It seems to be the key factor in creating change within a business rather than the current focus on external communication (Yuan, 2011; Dawkins, 2004). Internal alignment is created by defining a strong Social Impact positioning (Bhattacharya, 2010; Morsing, 2008; Forehand, 2003). This is key to create before carrying out Social Impact related activities and focus on external communication. And last, within a traditional business it is crucial to create awareness about how to balance idealism and business (Mousiolis, 2015; Longo, 2005; Personal interviews conducted with Moyee, Lemonaid and MUD Jeans, 2019). Insights led to the creation of a toolkit. The toolkit provides practical guidance to create a strong coherent vision on social impact. The first step to create lasting change. The toolkit allows Heartbeat Strategy to co-create with their client towards a Social Impact positioning. The co-creative approach ensures that the participants feel an ownership over the created content. The created positioning provides a strong starting point for traditional businesses onto which they can build further to create Social Impact in a sustainable, relevant and credible manner that is valuable for both business and society.","Social Impact; Creating Shared Value; Positioning; Design Strategy; Corporate social responsibility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Nevertheless, the uncertainties surrounding open spaces and ecosystem services jeopardize their consideration in public decision making. Certain of their aspects are not fully translatable in economic terms, primarily due to the absence of proper valuation tools. This results in not only under-provisioning of natural capital, but also unsustainable urban development. Hence, an imperative need to incorporate efficient ecosystem valuation tools emerges. The objective of this research is twofold. Firstly, it aims to prove and quantify the influence of urban open spaces on the surrounding real estate’s market value. Secondly, it investigates which characteristics of these spaces bear the largest impact, with a particular interest in ecosystem services. The methodology employed in the present study is a combination of both quantitative and qualitative methods. The quantitative part, designated as Phase I, includes the establishment of a hedonic pricing model, which quantifies the added value of proximity to the selected clustered open spaces, which are also called “Ecosystem Service Hubs” (ESHs). The qualitative part, addressed as Phase II, swifts the focus from the housing samples to the ESHs. It consists of activities attempting an ecological profiling of the ESHs.<br/>Phase I’s Hub Hedonic Pricing model revealed that ESH1 bears the largest influence on surrounding real estate, followed by ESH3 and ESH2. Notably, a 1% increase in distance would lead to approximately 2,7€, 0,8€ and 1,6€ per m2 for each hub respectively. Inserting the distance variable as a dummy variable, instead of a continuous one, displayed a similar behaviour. Thence, each housing sample is divided into categories in order to execute a distance effect sensitivity analysis. It is suggested that “young, large, row houses in greener neighborhoods” exhibit the largest distance decay effect sensitivity. Lastly, the overarching monetary values are roughly estimated. These are 5,81, 1,98 and 3,28 million € for each hub respectively, whereas the average value per m2 per house is 77,44€, 57,68€ and 107,47€ respectively. Concerning Phase II, the ESHs’ core components and characteristics are identified. Then, an association between the economic benefits and the core characteristics is attempted, through qualitative correlations. These are summed up in the following statement: “Ecosystem Service Hubs generate higher economic benefits when they are larger and more diverse, in terms of both composition and ecosystem services, with a significant sensitivity to recreational opportunities”.<br/>This research’s findings could prove to be insightful for urban planning, since they could be applied in two major ways. Firstly, given an identified Ecosystem Service Hub, the development of the surrounding area could be adjusted to encompass primarily the optimal house and neighborhood characteristics. Secondly, given the “house composition” of a certain area, the optimal location and profile of a new Ecosystem Service Hub could be selected. In both cases, maximizing the value of surrounding real estate is achieved through optimal spatial configurations. In conclusion, the added value of urban open spaces is plural and reflects the use and non-use value derived from residents. This research’s rough estimation of an average of 80,86 € per m2 per house is an indication of this added value, subject, however, to the narrow scope of the study. Attributing this added value to particular open spaces’ characteristics could only be executed through qualitative correlations. In order to enrich the previous results, an integration of multiple valuation methods (social and ecological), which incorporate the various value dimensions, is recommended. More conclusive and definitive results will motivate planners to opt for polices revolving around ecosystem services and natural capital, thus, satisfying the steadily increasing demand.","Ecosystem Services; Hedonic pricing model; Urban planing; Ecosystem Service Hubs; Nature valuation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Terwel, Karel (graduation committee); Ottele, Marc (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","This thesis ‘A decision support model for analysing the reuse potential of hollow-core slab floor components’ describes the development of a decision support model to investigate the reuse potential of a structural building component. For this research, the hollow-core slab floor component is chosen as the structural building component to be reused. The main research question to be answered is: ‘How can various methods and knowledge be integrated into a decision support model for deciding on the reuse potential of a hollow-core slab floor component to close the material cycle?’ The ambition of the Dutch Government is to transform from a linear economy to a circular economy, whereby waste is excluded and products will remain in the system for longer at a high-level value. However, the barrier preventing the implementation of high-value reuse is the lack of knowledge to understand the opportunities and the impact of high-value reuse. It appears that the reuse of hollow-core slab floor components is not yet common because of the uncertainty and risks involved in the reuse of these components. The component has various properties that are advantageous for the reuse of these components, such as the lightweight of the component, the long technical lifespan and the standard dimensions of the component to use it all over the world. By way of contrast, a concrete topping, bonded connections, and the high costs for the deconstruction of the components are seen as barriers to reuse the components. However, it has been investigated that it is possible to use these floor components for longer than they are currently being used. Still, this is only possible if there is a full understanding of the reversibility, the reuse options, and how to increase the reuse potential of these floor components. The ‘reuse potential factor’ is a factor between 0 -“waste-like”- and 1.0 -“resource -like”- and it is defined as a factor measuring the ability of a construction component to retain its functionality after the end of its primary life related to the economic and environmental impact of reusing this component. Therefore, the factors related to the quality – qualification factors – should be tested and the factors related to the economic and environmental impact – quantification factors – should be determined. <br/>There is a demand for a model that tests the performance of building components to assess the reuse potential of building components at the end-of-life stage. It is about making a decision about the consideration of the use of a new manufactured structural building component or a reused structural building component where the impact on the environment and economy remains limited. The first step to measure the reuse potential factor of the floor component is the reuse analysis in which the quality of the reused component should be determined based on the qualification factors. The qualification factors to be tested are the lifespan performance, technical performance, functional performance, aesthetical performance, and additional performance. The second step is the reuse evaluation where the ‘costs’ of the reused component are calculated based on the quantification factors. The quantification factors are the environmental impact costs and the economic impact costs based on the LCA and LCC tool. The decision support model analyses the relationship between the qualification and quantification factors of the reused hollow-core slab floor component and to compare the outcomes with the factors of a new manufactured hollow-core slab floor component.

One of the many important problems a person re-ID system has to address in order to achieve good performance is the feature misalignment problem. Past research has attempted to address this problem by using attention networks, pose-estimation modules, or semantic segmentation networks. However, they all eventually tend to pool these features to a single feature embedding, thereby not distinguishing regions with different semantic meanings such as the head, torso, and lower body. Most approaches also do not make use of all the information available throughout multiple layers (stages) of the feature extractor. Furthermore, although these additional features are used to provide extra information to the re-ID network during training, they do not take into account the importance of different regions of the image due to, for example, occlusion. To circumvent these problems, we propose a network that is capable of extracting regional feature embeddings that are associated with specific body parts of an identity, i.e., head, upper-body, lower-body, shoes, and foreground image. We extract these features from multiple stages of a feature extractor using a semantic-segmentation module. We then use multi-branch learning to ensure that these features are independently optimized by introducing separate modules (branches) for each regional feature embedding. To increase the robustness of the model, we also propose a novel testing strategy that makes use of the importance and visibility of specific body parts in both the query and gallery images in order to calculate a ranking list. Finally, to address the current lack of datasets that contain images from overhead face-down cameras, we introduce a new dataset named MatchNMingle-reID. Because of the viewpoint of the cameras, this dataset presents unique challenges that are not seen in current datasets and opens possibilities to create more generalizable models that can effectively address the feature misalignment problem.","Deep Learning; Person re-ID; Multi-stage; Multi-branch; Semantic-segmentation; Feature extraction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Technical solutions providing clean, affordable and reliable energy services to this target group already exist but still need to be improved to perform better. The development of business models to support the technical solutions is the key to entering BOP markets, but those business models to date are not entirely successful due to challenging condition dealing with BOP market, and only a few works of literature discusses specifically business model to support the availability of the modern energy access which is also the goal number seven of United Nation Sustainable Development Goals. <br/>The frugal energy innovation (FEI) can be a solution to deal with energy poverty problem, but there are many barriers in implementing the FEI principles, for instance, little number of financial access for the people in the base of the pyramid (BOP) and limited access to distribute the technologies to the BOP areas. This study suggests that in order to implement the FEI principles, a frugal business model can be used by the BOP ventures to provide clean energy access for BOP people in developing countries. Therefore, this graduation project is conducted to analyse the principles of frugal energy innovation in the context of a business model which is applicable for BOP ventures operating in the energy sector. We utilise a business model framework namely business model canvas (BMC) by Osterwalder and Pigneur, which is one of the most well-known business model frameworks.

Based on literature research, analysis of work methods, analysis of damage to older breakwater projects and interviews, it was deduced that during construction, the open work fronts of the submerged core section, emerged core section and underlayer section are in particular prone to the following damage mechanisms: - Reshaping of the submerged core due to head-on and oblique wave attack - Reshaping of the emerged core due to head-on and oblique wave attack - Reshaping of the underlayer due to head-on and oblique wave attack. - Mixing of rock material of different sections. - Overwash of dislocated material. When a damage event occurs, construction is delayed as repair works are needed. This delay increases the probability of encountering unfavourable conditions in the remaining construction time. Such positive feedback complicates any quantitative risk assessment. The main objective of this thesis was to investigate the feasibility of a computational model with which risks related to the construction phase of rubble mound breakwaters in sea-state conditions can be assessed. By simulating the construction process in time with a fully probabilistic process-based model, the financial risk due to storm-induced damage during construction can be assessed. Due to the stochastic behaviour of the parameters used in the building process simulation, the simulation outcome itself is characterized by a stochastic behaviour. To calculate the financial risk, the simulation is run multiple times like a Monte Carlo simulation. Quantitative damage calculations in the model were performed using methods reported in the relevant literature. However, currently available literature did not cover all damage mechanisms or the full extent of it. For these damage mechanisms, some newly developed methods were introduced. The damage profiles predicted by these methods turned out to be in excellent agreement with data from an older breakwater project. This older breakwater project was used as a reference case to test the model and analyses its performance. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis on the breakwater parameters showed that the nominal diameter of the core and underlayer material and the start date of construction works have the strongest sensitivity on the financial risk.","Rubble mound breakwater; Construction phase; Risk assessment; Damage assessment; Feasebility study; Probabilistic analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

For the Fotomuseum to shift from a traditional institution to an open and social environment, the public should be involved. Involving the public is necessary to create a high-quality visitor experience. Extensive literature and empirical studies were conducted in different domains; the Fotomuseum, millennials, participatory and engaging museum principles. The holistic approach resulted in a starting point for developing a framework for an overarching social museum activity. Within this framework, the four core-elements socialization, meaning-making, escapism and interaction are integrated on the  visitor museum experience. The resulting design framework for an overarching social museum activity consists of a model for designing open-ended activities encouraging social interactions and prolong the experience outside the museum’s walls. A narrative architecture presents six different narrative spaces to activate participation and engage millennials around the collection on-site. In addition to these two models, thirteen design principles were formulated. The formulated design goal accompanied by an experience vision functioned as a starting point for the design process. In addition to individual designing, different co-creation and evaluative sessions were organized resulting in a concept proposal for an overarching social museum activity: Photo Studio. Photo Studio offers millennials an active and memorable experience at the Fotomuseum, inviting them to explore and use the collection for developing one’s mini-exhibition. The platform allows visitors to explore co-produced exhibitions at home, which highlights the museum as an open, essential and social place. The activity supports and encourages individuals to collaborate in creative activities in a larger social experience. One could see the concept as a vehicle for maintaining social relationships as well as a process for personal meaning-making. Throughout the journey the link between photographers and millennials is addressed, allowing visitors to reflect the world as they see it and engage with each other around photos. Six different stages are described that moves the visitor towards developing one’s Photo Studio. With an application and three different interactive exhibits, visitors can select photos from the archive, edit them in the darkroom and construct their own visual story in the interactive exhibits space. Each interactive exhibit is designed with personal entry points and tools for creative expression to engage with each other socially. Finally, visitors can view their Photo Studio anytime, anywhere as the platform provides a replica in an interactive 360-view. The concept was tested with 16 participants in a simulated environment and seven different prototypes. Based on the insights, the overarching activity is presumably found to facilitate the desired engaging experience for millennials. All of the 16 participants positively reviewed Photo Studio. Each group developed discussions around photos, collaboratively discovering new perspectives. The activity was reviewed as fun, active and motivating.","Museum Experience; Participatory design; Interactive Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Follow-the-leader locomotion, as in the biological snake, is a solution that is obtained with shape memory control. The often used electric equipment to control the shape makes the current state-of-the-art of snake-like robots too complex. This thesis focused on a snake-like system using mechanical shape control to generate forward motion, to analyze the motion and comment on the expected behavior. Method: A 3D Simulink model was created with friction between the snake-like system and the surroundings as an important relation. A pre-defined sinus wave was passed through the snake-like system to analyze the motion. A low-cost, 3D printed, prototype was developed to validate the friction relation of the model. The prototype contains a belt feature with pre-defined path as shape control system and a snake-like system with four wheeled segments. Different configurations were assessed in the model by changing the wheel axis length, sinus amplitude and sinus frequency. Results: The prototype validated the realistic friction parameters in the model. Given the results of the model, the snake-like system creates forward motion by pushing against the surroundings when a sinus wave is pushed through the system. The wave parameters have a significant influence on displacement. When the configuration of the snake-like system creates more friction with the surroundings, the system is able to push itself further forward and generates more forward displacement. Conclusion:It is demonstrated that forward motion is possible when a snake-like system is connected to a mechanical shape control system. Now, the next step is to investigate random paths, to enable adaptable mechanical shape control being applied.","Design; Snake robot; Shape Control; Mechanical","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-12-31","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Medical Instruments and Medical Safety (MIMS)","",""

Piezoelectric sensors can be used to monitor both loads acting on a fibre-reinforced composite structure and elastic waves emitted from damage initiation within the structure. In certain marine applications, due to a harsh environment or for hydrodynamic reasons, piezoelectric sensors cannot be placed on the surfaces of the structure. Fortunately fibre-reinforced composite materials allow piezoelectric sensors to be embedded inside the structure. The focus in this research is on embedded piezoelectric sensor design, performance and behaviour. Carbon fibre beam specimens with embedded piezoelectric sensors have been manufactured and subject to low-frequency bending, high-frequency elastic wave emission, electrical excitation and monotonic bending to failure. The low-frequency bending test has given insight in the effects of sensor discharge, that is, decreasing and distorting the sensor response. Also it has been used to check consistency between different specimens. The effect of electrical discharge is practically absent around 1.8Hz but becomes apparent at lower frequencies. The test was simulated numerically. The simulation captures the effects of electrical discharge but underestimated sensor response amplitude by 40% to 65% for the small and large sensor respectively. High-frequency elastic wave emissions, originating from fibre-reinforced composite failure during monotonic bending, have been measured by an embedded piezoelectric sensor. The signals measured by the embedded piezoelectric sensor have a median signal-to-noise-ratio of 17dB. Using the spectral element method, a parameter study has been performed for a similar, two-dimensional setup. Embedded piezoelectric sensor length and embedment location in the plate thickness has been varied. Both a symmetric and antisymmetric elastic wave have been excited. It has been found that increasing sensor size has a negative effect on the sensitivity of the sensor. The antisymmetric elastic wave is better captured by the sensor response than the symmetric elastic wave. Effects of electromechanical resonance were not noticeable. Monotonic four-point bending failure tests were performed to compare structural integrity of a carbon fibre-reinforced beam specimen with an embedded piezoelectric sensor to a specimen without sensor. With embedded specimens, an average stiffness drop from 3 to 8% is noted. Specimens with small sensors on the tension side of the composite had a decrease lower than 4% in ultimate strain and at maximum 8% reduction in ultimate load and failure toughness. For specimens with embedded sensors on the compression side, the decline was larger, with the larger sensor outperforming the smaller sensor.","PWAS; CFRP; smart materials; Piezoelectricity; SHM; embedded sensor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our method clusters similar nodes in the graph together in a way that minimizes the geometric error that is introduced. The amount of compression that is applied can be influenced through a set of parameters that affect which nodes are included in the clustering process and the granularity of the clusters that are detected. The memory consumption of the sparse voxel DAG is reduced from 10% to up to 50%, depending on the characteristics of the scene, while introducing errors that are only visible when viewing the scene from up close.<br/>Our method is complementary to other state of the art compression methods for this data structure, and has a negligible effect on real-time rendering performance.","computer graphics; Compression; voxels; octree; geometry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The goal of this experimental study is to engineer a bio-inspired surface structure to improve the grip action of prosthetic hands. The low-cost FDM 3D printing technology in combination with the flexible material, Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU) 95A, was evaluated for this purpose. 3D printed surface (deformable) patterns were printed on top of a flat, rigid surface. The 3D printed patterns consisted of pillars or lines with varying thickness <i>d</i>, tip thickness <i>D</i>, wavelength <i>λ</i>, and curvatures <i>α</i> that were combined into different patterns. The frictional characteristics of the 3D printed patterns were assessed for nine different test scenarios, i.e. three different loads <i>F<sub>N</sub></i> against three different countersurfaces. Despite the small differences in the static coefficient of friction <i>μ<sub>s</sub></i> of the 3D printed patterns, some consistent trends were found. First, <i>μ<sub>s</sub></i> increases with increasing thickness <i>d</i>. Second, <i>μ<sub>s</sub></i> increases with increasing wavelength <i>λ</i> up to a point in which the decrease of number density of the 3D printed features decreases the overall friction. Third, <i>μ<sub>s</sub></i> increases for pattern curvatures with peaks in the opposite direction, such as wave or circular patterns. Lastly, <i>μ<sub>s</sub></i> decreases under increasing normal load <i>F<sub>N</sub></i>. The surface patterns were tested on the fingertips of a 3D printed prosthetic hand. The fingertips were assessed using the Box and Blocks Test (BBT), in which the pattern with the highest score displayed an ~70% increase in the number of blocks moved, compared to the original rigid fingertip of the 3D printed prosthetic hand in question. Further research and development are essential, especially for the FMD 3D print process of small dimensional printing in combination with flexible materials.

Empirical data from the experiment is used to estimate the relationships between the different components, followed by the assessment of their impact on the performance of the automated vehicles. It was found that visibility conditions have a significant effect on detection performance, which worsens in rainy conditions especially under streetlights. It has been also observed that there is a significant difference in Lane Position between Left Curves and Straight sections, and between lane widths less than 250 cms and those that have larger widths. These findings are combined with the results from the STAMP analysis to formulate a set of road infrastructure requirements that would lead to safe performance of Lane Assistance Systems.","Automated vehicles; Infrastructure requirements; Field test; Lane Assistance Systems; Systems Theory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

There are several advantages of this MAT based method. This method avoids surface reconstruction from a point cloud. It also works for the situation when there is surface missing in the input point cloud. For different point cloud datasets such as point cloud generated from meshes, AHN3 point cloud and point cloud generated from dense image matching, this method successfully deliver decent visibility result for all of them. The main challenge overcome in this thesis is the interior and exterior MAT separation. Two approaches, normal reorientation approach and bisector based approach are experimented in the thesis to separate MAT. The normal reorientation approach only works for point cloud generated from meshes. The bisector based approaches works for all the datasets testes. It successfully separates the interior and exterior MAT when there is surfacing missing. To speed up of the query process, spatial index is generated for interior MAT. In this thesis, two spatial indices are implemented, KD-Tree and R-Tree. Due to the limitation of my KD-Tree implementation, the KD-Tree does not improve the running speed obvious. There is a room to improve the KD-Tree implementation. The R-Tree achieves sharply improvement on running time of the queries. For 51567 points, the query based on R-Tree finished in 1880 ms. In a word, this thesis proposed an efficient MAT based method of visibility analysis in a point cloud.","point cloud; Visibility analysis; Medial Axis Transform","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

(mentor); Rueda, José L. (mentor); Dong, J. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","During the last years, electric power generation was based mainly on large centralized fossil fuelled power plants. However, nowadays and in the future, efforts are made to increase the share from renewable sources, as a result of increasing environmental concern. Indeed, in some networks areas, wind generators gradually start to replace conventional synchronous generators, while the European Union has set a “20 - 20 - 20” target plan, which aims to achieve a 20% reduction in green house gas emissions compared to 1990 levels, have 20% of the energy on the basis of consumption coming from renewable sources and a 20% increase in energy efficiency by 2020. Due to the increment of wind generator share, power system stability and reliability may be affected. This is attributed to the fact that the characteristics of wind turbines are different from the ones of conventional plants. Therefore different frequency, voltage and transient stability system performances arise which require different measures to be tackled. This report, underlines the importance of rotor angle stability studies in power systems with high share of power electronic interfaced generation units. These studies are related to the ability of the synchronous generators to remain in synchronism when subjected to large disturbances (e.g. faults). A supplementary damping control as a mitigation solution against rotor angle stability threats is studied in power systems dominated by full-scale power electronics wind generation units. This solution, as it is shown in this report, is cost-effective and is adopted for modification of the outer control of fully decoupled wind generators. Concerning related work reported in existing literature, several researchers have used the frequency deviation as input for power system stabilizer added to the grid side converter of a fully decoupled wind generator, whereas other researchers have used the terminal voltage. However, rotor angle remote signals for damping the Synchronous machines oscillations can also be used. Therefore, a supplementary damping control for fully decoupled wind generators, considering rotor angle deviations as input signal, is adopted in this report. The thesis report also provides a detailed overview of the adopted structure of supplementary damping control. Besides, a discussion, based on EMT and RMS simulations performed by using RSCAD and DIgSILENT PowerFactory tools respectively, is presented to address research gaps in existing literature, namely, identifying the most suitable wind generator locations for addition of supplementary damping control, the degree of improvement in damping performance due to the use of rotor angle deviation as input signal, the effectiveness of wind generator with the damping controller as affected by distance to reference generator, and the effectiveness of the controller when the distance between synchronous generator and wind generator is taken into account. Different indicators related to transient stability studies are used so as to evaluate the performance of the controllers, whereas optimization techniques are also utilized to find their appropriate settings. For the rotor angle stability studies, different power systems were studied. In particular, faults were examined in a modified IEEE 9 Bus benchmark system as well as the test system of the Great Britain (GB) transmission power system. The aforementioned systems are used to examine the performance of wind generators with damping controller in systems with different dynamic behavior. For each system, different scenarios were applied, by simulating different fault locations (modified IEEE 9 Bus system/GB system), or different wind share level (GB system), different time delays due to data latencies (GB system) and different input signals in the proposed damping controllers (GB system). The selected cases include critical operational scenarios, i.e. fault locations in lines with high pre-fault apparent power dispatch, faults in prone to instability synchronous machines’ terminals, high latency delays of 200ms. Faults with relatively high clearing time of 120ms are applied in the system, so the systems are examined close to their limits.","Transient Stability; Wind Generators Type IV; Supplementary Damping Control (SDC); Mean Variance Mapping Optimization (MVMO); Real Time Simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-10-01","","","","Electrical Engineering","MIGRATE H2020",""

Consequently, livelihood activities are diversifying and expanding, while spaces for doing so are hardly available or threatened to disappear. The general lack of resources and knowledge incapacities make many development plans dependent on the investment of foreign and popular interests. These ‘development’ schemes ought to answer to sprawling cities through increased accessibility and the premise of economic growth, but ignore local welfare and do not recognise the potentials around public space and infrastructure that shape socio-economic livelihoods. This thesis argues to look beyond the one way story of infrastructural development for solely city scaled interventions and proposes alternative infrastructure at places where different scales meet. This infrastructure focusses not only on roads, but is designed to integrate development, environment, living and justice as critical projects.

The goal of this report is to investigate the risk of liquefaction to the terpen due to induced earthquakes. Furthermore, fine sands was the most liquefiable soil type. The Naaldwijk and Eem formations have the highest liquefaction potential based on their soil compositions, densities and age. The Naaldwijk formation is the most prone to liquefaction since it is located more shallow in the underground. Afterwards, cone penetration test data was used to evaluate the soil classes, soil unit weights and soil behaviour indexes. The soil behaviour index values were used to asses the liquefaction potential. In the end, none of the three chosen terpen were liquefiable.

The fatigue strength is quantied by an estimated fatigue lifetime, which is the expected time to failure of the most critical point in the connection. The lifetime is estimated based on the yearly accumulated fatigue damage. A computer model of the structure has been constructed, with which time signals of the internal forces in the structure are calculated, based on the environmental loads. The pin connection was not included in this model, so internal forces in the steel tubular members have been translated manually to forces in the pin connection. The connection was decomposed in its basic components and nine potential critical locations have been identied. Stress concentrations are expected at these locations, which make them sensitive to fatigue. The internal forces were combined with the dimensions of the components, so that nominal stresses could be calculated. The hotspot stress at the potential critical locations was estimated with stress concentration factors (SCFs), which are found in literature. Relationships between the internal force and the hotspot stresses are derived in this way, and time signals of the hotspot stresses are obtained. Most of the identied locations could be assessed with hand calculations, except for two locations. They are analyzed with nite element software (ANSYS).

Shared decision making enables evidence and patients’ preferences to be taken into account. It improves the patient’s knowledge, understanding and patient-healthcare providers communication. However, various barriers for implementing shared decision making for patients with advanced heart failure were found, which consist of unclarity, uncertainty, lack of training, and lack of time. This thesis focuses on improving the shared decision making process at the Cardiology department at the Amsterdam UMC, location VUmc. Observations and interviews were conducted in the Cardiology department at the VUmc. In order to find similarities and differences between literature research and the current context.<br/>Interviews show that shared decision making partly applies to the current decision making process: although healthcare providers share plenty of information with the patient and family, they share it mostly verbally. Treatment options are explained to the patient multiple times, but no information is given in the written form. The booklet “Deciding with heart” was created to support the communication between healthcare providers and patients in the shared decision making process. It provides information about life-prolonging treatments for patients with advanced heart failure and sensitise them in individuating their values and preferences tackling two of the barriers found in the research: limited understanding amongst people with heart failure and unclarity of the roles in the care team. The booklet can be used to explain the patients’ prognosis and their treatment options in order to support them in the decision making process. The booklet helps to start a conversation between nurses and patients about making the best choice. The booklet was positively evaluated with nurses from the department of Cardiology in the VUmc and the outpatient clinic, and with patient representatives.

Subsurface reservoir heterogeneity with complex multi-scale features increases the complexity further. The spatial resolution required during a simulation is dependent on the type and degree of geological heterogeneity, but also on the flowphysics and thewell locations (Karimi-Fard &amp;Durlofsky, 2014). Traditional upscaling or multi-scale techniques are usually focused on the accuracy of the pressure solution and often ignore the transport. Improving the transport solution can however be quite significant for the performance of the simulation, especially in complex applications related to reactive and compositional flow. The use of a method called Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) enables the grid to adapt dynamically during the course of the simulation, which facilitates the efficient use of computational resources (Karimi-Fard &amp; Durlofsky, 2014; Cusini et al., 2016). In this work, the aim was to develop such an AMR framework for general-purpose reservoir simulation. The approach uses a multi-level grid and is applicable to fully unstructured grids. The adaptivity of the grid in the developed AMR procedure is based on a hierarchical grid. The multi-level grid is constructed starting with the static geological model, a fine-scale model that accurately approximates the prospective reservoir. The control volumes present in the model are described by a list of volumes, depths and reservoir properties, and by a connectivity list for all neighbouring blocks, with corresponding transmissibility. The coarser levels are constructed through cell partitioning of the fine-scale model, called level 0. A global flow-based upscaling is applied to redefine the cell properties at the coarser levels. Each coarser level is also described by a list of volumes, depths, reservoir properties and a connectivity list with corresponding transmissibility. An inter-level connectivity list is constructed which includes the connections between control volumes of consecutive levels. The connectivity lists with corresponding transmissibility, along with the cell properties of each control volume are combined to formglobal arrays describing the full hierarchy of levels. The simulation is then started at the coarsest level, while keeping the wells at the finest level of refinement for more accurate representation of the solution. Dynamic adaptivity is performed, based on adaptivity criteria which were developed specific to the used application, resulting in a new grid configuration. The multi-level connectivity list togetherwith the cell properties are redefined at each time step and used as input for the next simulation. The developed AMR framework was implemented in Delft Advanced Research Terra Simulator (DARTS, 2019) which uses the recently developed linearization technique called Operator-Based Linearization, developed by Voskov (2017). The performance of the proposed approach was illustrated for several applications, including geothermal energy extraction and reactive transport. For geothermal applications, several models were tested: a homogeneous reservoir with unstructured grid, a synthetic fluvial model with shale blocks illustrating the role of shale in thermal recharge, a highly heterogeneous fluvial system with low net-to-gross ratio, and several layers of a highly-heterogeneous SPE10 reservoir. The results of these flow examples demonstrate a high level of solution accuracy relative to the reference fine-scale solution. The solution error is considerably decreased as compared to the coarse-scale model. Important features are captured at a higher resolution while keeping the amount of cells to a reasonable number. For the fluvial model, a different approach was adopted for cell aggregation, consisting of grouping the facies together, where shale-regions are kept coarse, and highpermeability facies are kept at a fine level. This significantly improved the solution as compared to the coarse model, where cold front propagation is overestimated. For the application of reactive flow, the dissolution of calcium carbonate through the formation of wormholes was analyzed. Here as well, the solution is considerably improved when using the AMR model. The wormholes are accurately represented, with improved computational performance.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there is another approach where every node is responsible for the local problem in order to reach a solution: the decentralised optimal power flow (D-OPF). In this thesis, the aim was to improve the speed and flexibility of a D-OPF algorithm based on the Consensus and Innovation (C+I) method using physical measurements from a direct current (DC) system. While in previous implementations, the system would work towards finding the solution for one point in time, the suggested implementation works by performing online optimisation, meaning that there is less time required in propagating information around the system and faster solutions are reached. A possible interaction between the physical and optimisation layers was suggested, to make online control feasible. Using current droop control for a DC system, it was possible to react to sudden changes the system and, in the long term, optimise the electrical resources. The improvements in speed were then demonstrated by the simulations results, where the time to reach the optimal solution was reduced, when compared to previous implementations. In order to increase the flexibility of the system, adaptive behaviour for the critical optimisation variables was suggested. To reduce the oscillatory behaviour of the system, some gains were made proportional to rate of change of said variables, meaning that the system didn't have to rely on user determine values in order to converge. It was also implemented a solution to calculate the line resistance between two nodes, further reducing the need for external inputs. These implementations were tested and it was concluded that it improved convergence speeds, while increasing the flexibility pf the system. Finally, a test case, based on a real existing lighting grid, was designed in order to test the algorithm under larger networks. The results showed that for a 25% increase in the size of the network there was no significant increase in the time required to reach a solution, indicating that the system can be scaled further, and might be dependent mainly on the network structure, and not its size.","DC; Optimal power flow; Consensus and Innovation; Droop Control; Online optimization; Adaptive behavior; Parameter Estimation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-11-08","","","","Electrical Engineering | Electrical Power Engineering","",""

Especially in the city this group of people is slowly pushed out and sometimes forced to find housing elsewhere. This has a negative effect on the personal and financial growth of this people, but also on the economic, social and sustainable growth of the city itself. <br/> This research has been divided in three parts; [1] The gap in the housing market (the issue and its consequences), [2] the post-war neighbourhood, Zuidwijk (the social-historical context), and [3] sustainability (people, planet, prosperity). The target groups, those affected by the gap in the housing market, play a big role within this research.

The challenge herein is to bothminimize the running time of a circuit and tomodify it such that quantum gates only act on adjacent qubits while leaving the desired computational operation intact. These modifications involve the insertion of SWAP gates, which introduces computational overhead. Several exact and heuristic methods have been developed to determine the minimal number of required SWAP gates. Until now, the model sizes of exact methods scale superexponentionally in the number of qubits of the quantum circuit. The main research goal of this project was to develop an integer linear program that instead scales polynomially both in the number of qubits and the number of quantum gates in the quantumcircuit. 7 First, qubits located on a linear array were considered. The resulting integer linear program proposed requires O(n^2 m) variables and constraints, where n denotes the number of qubits and m denotes the number of quantum gates of the quantum circuit under consideration. Second, qubits located on a two- or threedimensional grid were considered. The programs both require O(n4m) variables and O(n^3 m) constraints. Subsequently we prove that, for a fixed quantum circuit, the optimal objective value of the one-dimensional problem is an upper bound for the optimal objective value of the corresponding two- and three-dimensional problems. Using CPLEX’s Branch &amp; Bound method, 131 benchmark instances of various circuit sizes were evaluated. The largest of which contained either eighteen qubits and sixteen quantum gates, or five qubits and 112 quantumgates. Furthermore, we identify problems on the interface of nearest neighbor compliant quantum circuit design and distributed quantum computing. Integer linear program formulations are provided for these additional problems.","Quantum Computing; nearest neighbor; Quantum Circuit Design; integer programming; Exact Method; SWAP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-01","","","","Applied Mathematics","","52.082295, 4.325859"

They can as well be described as urban strategies for economic development and urban competitiveness. Around the world innovation districts pop up and seem to provide the perfect and required environment for an innovation ecosystem to which talent and businesses are attracted. Katz and Wagner define these districts as “geographic areas where leading-edge anchor institutions and companies cluster and connect with start- ups, business incubators and accelerators” (2014, p.1). In theory, the success of urban innovation districts relies on the balance of three types of assets: physical (buildings, parks, plazas), networking (events, workshops) and economical (start-ups, businesses, shops) assets (Katz and Wagner, 2014). Research shows that dense, inner-city locations combine a critical mass of human capital, vital physical conditions, the right amenities and different sorts of proximity for knowledge exchange that enable businesses to innovate and grow (Morrison, 2014).<br/>It is in these districts that working, living and recreating fade off and that horizontal networking between a diversity of people is becoming increasingly important for innovation. Entrepreneurs and start-ups are considered economical assets in this respect and are crucial players in such districts as they tend to influence economic and job growth. Although they often lack the skills and experience, lack of finance, resources and means needed to do the job, they inhibit a great potential to drive and sustain innovation (Nguyen, 2016). To open up the benefits startups can provide, it is essential to understand how urban innovation districts can contribute to the development of startups. This research therefore focuses on the physical conditions innovation districts should provide and how these can facilitate and stimulate their development. This is investigated on in this research by a qualitative comparative case study within the planned Central Innovation District The Hague.","Urban innovation districts; Startups; Physical conditions; Central innovation district The Hague","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

Processes such as overtopping, beach erosion, and coastal flooding can result from a combined action of two or more physical processes. Traditional infrastructure design practices assume the highest load previously experienced as the design load, regardless of possible interactions between variables (or processes). This may lead to a misrepresentation of critical design loads. This thesis presents a methodology for defining infrastructure design loads accounting for their interdependence. The methodology is general and is based on regular vines. Vines are graphical tools for defining high dimensional distribution functions through pair-copula construction. With this premise in mind, the main effort was concentrated in formulating a series of steps to integrate several stages of the design: from the processing of raw data up to the choice of design loads for any specific design purpose. The vine-based methodology was applied to the design of a breakwater in Galveston Bay, Texas. This application showed that accounting for the interdependence between design variables provides a more comprehensive description of the physical system acting on the infrastructure. However, the vine-based method is computationally demanding. Hence, the applicability of this methodology should be evaluated on a case by case basis. In parallel, the possibility to define goodness of fit test for vine-copula based on the concept of tree-equivalent classes is explored. The focus is on model selection strategies based on graphical and statistical properties of the vines. The main motivation to investigate model selection strategies for vines is the considerably large computational time needed to fit all regular vines in more than 6 nodes to the data. In this thesis, a novel algorithm is developed to facilitate the implementation of vines in higher dimensions (vines with more than 6 nodes). This algorithm significantly reduces the computational effort to select a regular vine by allowing the user to test only a subgroup of vines in n-nodes constructed on specific characteristics of the vines in (n-1)-nodes.","Probabilistic design; multivariate extremes; vines; design loads; multivariate dependence modelling; Copula modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

The most common symptom is motor deficits. In order to overcome such symptoms, the motor brain either repairs the damaged tissue or reorganises to compensate for the injured brain region. To stimulate this reorganisation transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is considered to be a promising thera- peutic intervention. Simulations of electric field distributions generated by tDCS currently entail individualised volume conduction models to improve tDCS. A volume conduction model includes geometry and conductivity properties of tissue types in healthy subjects. When applying existing models to chronic stroke subjects, electric field distribution patterns differ substantially compared to healthy subject distribution patterns. In current models, the lesion is not identified and acknowledged as a distinctive tissue type, as it is yet unclear what the lesion influence is. However, the lesion is a potential source of variability in desired electric field distribution which could result in different motor recovery. A volume conduction model is designed by combining the software SimNIBS, which can segment the head of healthy subjects and LINDA, able to distinguish lesion tissue of chronic stroke subjects. The location and the conductivity value of the lesion seem to influence the electric field distribution of tDCS where this individualised model is preferred. Including the lesion is an important advance towards the use of volume conduction models for chronic stroke subjects to prospectively find optimal electrode configurations, keep the safety margins and to prospectively analyse the results of tDCS.","tDCS; Lesion; simulation; Volume conduction model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Daily global measurements of tropospheric NO₂ columns are obtained by satellites with increasing spatial resolution and signal-to-noise levels, to improve monitoring of emission sources and air quality forecasting. The recently launched TROPOMI instrument on-board ESA’s Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite measures tropospheric NO₂ with a spatial resolution of 7.1 km by 3.6 km. During its commissioning phase, the instrument was temporarily operated in ’zoom-mode’ to measure at a resolution of 2.4 km by 1.8 km. This research presents the processed results from this unique data-set, which allows mapping NO₂ pollution sources from space with unprecedented detail. Comparison to measurements at operational resolution shows the improvement in spatial information content, at the cost of increased noise and uncertainty. The benefits and possibilities of measuring tropospheric NO₂ at high resolution are explored with several case studies. Comparisons with chemical transfer model forecasts show the improved ability of these measurements to capture local NO₂ enhancements and possibly improve emission inventories. The found correlations with co-located space-borne CO₂ column observations and the performance of a plume detection algorithm applied to the data-set provide additional support for simultaneous high resolution measurements of co-emitted CO₂ and NO₂, planned for future satellites to improve CO₂ emission monitoring. Finally, test retrievals with the zoom-mode data, using experimental high resolution surface reflectivity and NO₂ profile shape input, demonstrate the potential impact of high resolution a priori databases on the retrieval performance.","TROPOMI; NOx; air quality; remote sensing","en","master thesis","","","","","","Double Master’s Degree programme, combining the Space Flight track from the Aerospace Engineering MSc programme at the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering with the Geoscience and Remote Sensing track from the Applied Earth Sciences MSc programme at the Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This raises the research question: How can an operational model link the supply of existing building materials with the demand for new construction projects in order to reduce the use of virgin materials and thereby improve circularity in the construction industry? The goal of this research is to provide a useful tool for the construction industry to join the transition towards a circular economy. Based on three levels of scale, an operational model is developed that gives a comparison between the materials costs of existing building elements and virgin building elements for a starting dwelling project. This comparison results in insight and an overview for clients, such as municipalities or housing corporations into the costs of potential dwellings built with existing building materials. The operational tool also gives insight in whether or not reusable building materials provide a feasible business case, considering a framework based on the clients input.","Urban mining; Existing building materials; Virgin building materials; Operational model; Project-based; Region-based; Enterprise-based; Feasibility; Circular Economy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

The built environment can play a significant role in reaching these objectives in the future since it consumes around 40% of the total energy consumption (Šjan, 2016). Also, approximately two-third of the existing stock in the Netherlands will be in use within the timeframe of these goals. Therefore, a major challenge is to adapt the existing stock to become more energy efficient or even neutral. The Dutch government obliges office space to have at least label C by 2023 (RVO, 2018). Real estate technologies can enhance the energy efficiency of these buildings by providing data on actual energy consumption. Nowadays, an energy performance gap exists between the actual and theoretical energy consumption stresses the need for more insights on a building level (Sipma, Kremer &amp; Vroom, 2017). Therefore, this research investigates to what extent this energy performance gap can be bridged by adaptations to the existing office stock in the Netherlands and what possible drivers and thresholds are for different stakeholder. A literature study has provided input for the development of a theoretical framework and the selection of the research methodology. A case study research has been conducted to underperforming office buildings in the Netherlands. Four case studies were conducted based on their energy performance gap, two buildings of energy label A and B will be researched. The research is focussed on buildings characteristics and stakeholder attitudes towards certain adaptations, either structural or behavioural. Findings of this research indicate that structural adaptions are rarely preferred by the investor due to possible loss of value. Tenant often lack insight into their own energy performance and are therefore unaware and unable to make decision on behavioural adaptions. A framework has been developed that provides steps to take fostering the process towards more sustainability in the built environment.","Adaptations; Stakeholders; Real Estate; Offices; Energy labels; energy performance gap; Sustainabilty; Case studies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

To prevent highly contagious or resistant microorganisms from spreading from one patient to the other, isolation precautions such as contact isolation are applied when patients carry such a microorganism. The first part of this theses describes how contact isolation has a negative impact on well-being on patients. The experience during contact isolation can improve by establishing an open healthcare environment and providing information during the full isolation process. Collective action theories appear to have potential to be applied to the context of infection prevention. The contribution of patients, healthcare providers and visitors to infection prevention can be stimulated by increasing community feeling, establishing connections between individuals and providing information about past actions of other individuals. Context research has been conducted in VUmc and results on the current patient experience are gathered in a patient journey. Conclusions on the current patient experience during isolation are as following: 1. a shattered sense of responsibility amongst different actors 2. different patient persona’s experience contact isolation differently 3. a difference in experience and behaviour of first time isolation patients and readmitted patients. To improve the patient experience during contact isolation, the second part of this thesis focusses on creating a solution. By combining the conclusions and the literature, a design vision is formulated: I want to increase the feeling of community amongst all actors in the contact isolation process, so that all individuals experience a sense of shared responsibility towards infection prevention in VUmc. A first step towards the design vision is created with the guidance of the following design goal: I want patients to develop a favourable attitude towards contact isolation during the first time into contact isolation by providing a tool that lets them experience partnership with healthcare providers and visitors in contributing to the safety of others. Building from the patient journey and the design goal, a solution, Bundel, is proposed. It aims to increase a feeling of shared responsibility amongst the different involved actors and stimulated collaboration between individual. Bundel provides necessary and desired information to patients and visitors at fitting times. The first time into contact isolation is slowed down by spreading the information a patient needs and wants over the isolation process. By providing all the information to patients from the start of the isolation process, they can discover the necessary information they are looking for when they are ready. In addition, visitors are increasingly involved in infection prevention, because the design makes their involvement necessary them. Bundel thereby stimulates them to personally find the necessary information. For nurses and other healthcare providers, Bundel facilitates the transfer from a ‘controller and corrector’ to a ‘guide and facilitator’ towards patients and visitors. Therefore, responsibility that currently mainly lies with the nurse, shifts to a more equally shared responsibility amongst all actors.","Healthcare; Patient journey; Contact isolation; Collective action; patient experience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

This technology is gaining popularity and is already supported by popular browsers such as Google Chrome, Firefox and Safari. The quality of real-time communication services depends highly on latency. For this reason, real-time flows have different requirements than conventional TCP flows which focus mainly on the transfer of bulk traffic. The IETF created the working group RMCAT (RTP Media Congestion Avoidance Techniques) to define requirements for real-time congestion control algorithms. One of the proposed algorithms is Google Congestion Control (GCC). This is the only real-time congestion control algorithm implemented in commercial browsers such as Google Chrome. Unfortunately, the performance of GCC in wireless networks has not been extensively evaluated. It is not clear yet what limitations a WebRTC communication might encounter in this type of networks, especially when it is competing with other type of flows. This project addressed this issue by evaluating GCC in different technologies, namely in wired, WiFi and 4G networks. Controlled testbeds were used for the evaluation. The experiments followed the evaluation guidelines for real-time congestion control algorithms defined by the IETF. GCC proved to be a compliant RMCAT congestion control algorithm in networks with no contention. However, the results obtained in wireless access technologies revealed that GCC collapses when TCP flows are present in the channel. This issue is not attributed to GCC itself but to channel access methods of this type of networks. It is necessary to implement procedures to assign a different QoS to WebRTC flows in order to overcome this problem.","WebRTC; Google Congestion Control; Performance Analysis; Wireless Networks; 4G Network","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Telecommunications and Sensing Systems","",""

Relationship between form, composition and phenomenal experience are explained in terms of “flow” and “Bodies”. Space and time are understood in terms of virtual flowing force acting on bodies, that they are actualized as sounds in music and “frozen” as materialistic objects in architecture, affording our sensational experience. Composition, is understood as synthesizing of individual bodies with order into a holistic body, in which tensions are created by the differential relationship of its constituent bodies.

There is a growing interest for techniques that pose the identification problem as a sparse optimisation problem.

In this work a novel identification method for Switched AutoRegressive eXogenous (SARX) systems<br/>and PieceWise AutoRegressive eXogenous (PWARX) systems is proposed that combines sparse optimisation with a SAT solver. The presented method aims to minimise the number of submodels needed to fit the data, while facilitating a prescribed minimum dwell time between switches. The procedure for the identification of switched ARX models is composed of two steps. The First phase determines the switching times in an iterative process aided by a SAT solver. Second, the model parameters and the switching sequence are estimated by<br/>optimising the sparsity of a sequence. The identification procedure for PWARX models operates similarly although it incorporates the knowledge that switches depend on the regressor. An extension to these methods that makes the identification of large datasets tractable is also put forward. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on synthetic systems from the literature and shows promising results. Finally, the proposed algorithm is applied to an experimental benchmark dataset for a nonlinear system.

The main character was constructed by the author, but based on the book ‘A man asleep’ by George Perec. Through this persona, the phenomenon of escapism is examined. Escapism is the act of constantly feeling that the only way forward is by going elsewhere, further examined as ‘dying a non-biological death’: an escape from being a part of something. This connection between the assemblage, the Recluse and the territories in which he operates, is brought together through rhythms. A rhythm can be understood as differences in expressivities of a surrounding. The Recluse somehow picks up on the rhythms of his environment, and they don’t match with his rhythms. Being out of sync with these rhythms, means that the Recluse is picking up a discrepancy between a collective expressivity and the potentials of the territory. Architecture is of course a form of expression: it expresses a certain materiality, arranged in a shape to produce expressive means. As such, architecture is a producer of rhythms. The architectural project proposes a new territory for the Recluse, one in which the central goal is to mediate between the rhythms of the world he tries to escape, altering them, to create spaces that interact with the rhythms of the Recluse.","territories; liminality; assemblages; Recluse; Paris; rhythms; mediation; mythopoeia","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","48.855241, 2.358653"

Seeing as wind farms are increasing in number and size, fast methods to generate good quality layouts can be beneficial for designers. Wind Farm Layout Optimization (WFLO) consists in finding a layout that maximizes the Annual Energy Production (AEP) of a wind farm. The procedure is driven by an algorithm that generates possible layouts and by a framework that evaluates their AEP. If the traditional method to assess AEP is adopted, layout optimization is computationally demanding due to the impact of each turbine's position on the productivity of the surrounding ones. Indeed, for any change in the layout, this inter-dependency forces designers to calculate wake effects and the wind resource-average energy production of the wind farm. This thesis proposes an approach to reduce the computational load of WFLO by pre-computing the power losses. Indeed, the approach avoids recalculating the expected power loss among turbines during the optimization procedure. This optimization strategy employs a novel approach, called Pre-Averaged Model (PAM), that expresses the expected power loss of a wake source at representative points around it. Firstly, the wind farm is discretized, and fictitious turbines are placed at each given spot. Secondly, PAM calculates the expected power loss caused by each fictitious turbine for the surrounding ones. Discontinuities introduced by wind resource discretization and top-hat wake deficit profiles affect PAM's accuracy substantially. Binning wind measurements in 72 wind directions solves the problem for typical engineering wake models. Then, a greedy algorithm uses the power losses of the fictitious turbines to build layouts constructively by adding an extra turbine per iteration. The effect of multiple wake sources on a wake target is modelled by linear superimposition of the pre-computed power losses. PAM is tested in combination with three greedy algorithms, namely, Basic Greedy (BG), Add-Remove-Move Greedy (ADREMOG), and ADREMOG II. This research demonstrates that the PAM and the superposition of the power losses can be reliably used for WFLO. Also, the joint use of PAM and greedy algorithms achieve an interesting trade-off between speed and quality of the layouts. Indeed, PAM is beneficial as it speeds up greedy algorithms. Furthermore, greedy algorithms allow generating better layouts at the cost of slowing down the algorithm. The balance between speed and quality can be regulated by using a finer discretization, testing different locations for the first turbine placement, or acting on the nature of the algorithm. In particular, the use of a re-location stage at each constructive iteration increases the quality of the layouts substantially but reduces the speed of execution. As a result, the proposed algorithms present different characteristics: the BG is the fastest but its median layout is the worst; ADREMOG produces the best layouts in the longest time; ADREMOG II is a compromise between the two former algorithms.","Wind energy; Wind farm layout optimization; Greedy heuristic; Annual energy production assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The buildings and infrastructures, such as roads, constructed on these soil layers are usually associated with substantial construction measures during the execution of the project and might suffer from damages induced by the post-construction deformations. In practice, one of the primary stages of road construction involves geotechnical in-situ investigations for determining the soil properties based on which the settlement is predicted through empirical models. There are several techniques for monitoring the post-construction deformation on roads, among which the most time and cost-efficient technique is advanced Differential InSAR (D-InSAR). Since no research has been dedicated to establishing a direct link between the geotechnical in situ measurements and deformation measurements, in this research, the main focus is to develop a fully data-driven methodology to model road deformation based on loading/unloading conditions and soil properties. The study area is the newly constructed part of the A4 highway (Delft-Schiedam) in the Netherlands.<br/>The proposed methodology in this research consists of three steps. In the first step of the methodology, the measurements that represent soil properties, loading/unloading and deformation measurements should be determined and gathered. Cone Penetration Testing (CPT) measurements and boreholes are two freely available data sets that represent soil properties. Another important soil property is the variations in soil water content can be characterized by temperature and precipitation. The latest stage of loading/unloading history can be determined by comparing the elevation of the study area before and after the construction. Deformation time series produced by D-InSAR techniques are suitable measurements for investigating spatiotemporal deformations on roads. After determining pre-processing steps for each of the raw data sets, the relevant parameters from each data source are extracted. In the next step, the correlations and similarities between the soil properties, loading/unloading condition, and deformation are investigated. The last step deals with extracting suitable features from CPT profiles in order to use machine learning to model the relationship between soil properties, loading/unloading conditions, and deformation. To this end, the CPT profiles are segmented, then qualitative (soil types) or quantitative descriptors of the segments are used as features. To determine the soil classes, Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier is used. The relationship between soil properties, loading/unloading and the linear rate of deformation is modeled through two tree-based algorithms, i.e. Random Forests and Gradient tree-boosting. The Pearson correlation and the coefficient of determination between soil properties, loading/unloading and the linear rate of deformation are 0.6 and 0.4, respectively. The correlation of deformation time series and temperature and precipitation is quite low and no consistent pattern could be found between the time delays. The soil classification by SVM classifier is more accurate compared to empirical charts. For the deformation modeling, the best performance metrics are obtained through the Gradient Boosting algorithm with quantitative descriptors as features, (Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is 1.1 mm/year, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is 1.5 mm/year and the coefficient of determination is 0.5). In conclusion, the resulting models with different algorithms and different sets of features are of moderate accuracy. The uncertainty of the models is due to three main reasons: 1. The complexity of the study area in terms of construction history 2. Lack of other necessary data 3. The uncertainties caused by the proposed methodology.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

These events can be induced by natural factors as earthquakes and extreme rainfall, as well as by human intervention, including construction and mining. A primary resource to conduct landslides studies for prediction, risk assessment, and mitigation are historical databases with accurate location of individual events. To increase the location accuracy of those past landslide events, and optimize conventional time- and cost- consuming mapping routines, this study aims to develop an automatic landslide detection method from free-of-charge optical satellite imagery (Sentinel-2) and global Digital Elevation Model (ALOS World3D-30m DEM) using Object-based Image Analysis (OBIA) in combination with Machine Learning (ML). Existing works have successfully used earth-observation datasets for the generation of landslides databases. Most of them apply rule-based techniques using features thresholds that are not global and therefore perform poorly when applied to new regions where the method was not developed. This study presents a first attempt of an automatic method that generalizes to landslides occurring over the entire world without knowledge of their cause or triggering factor. To obtain a robust method that can deal with the complex characteristics of landslides (e.g. diversity of shapes/sizes, land cover, illumination and spectral variability), we explored OBIA, an image processing technique that has demonstrated better performance than the pixel-based approach, specially when the target objects are bigger than the cell resolution. The developed method consists in cloud-free images acquisition and determination of suitable features for image segmentation and image classification. For the image segmentation, we developed a two-step approach that consists in an initial segmentation using k-means and the Red/Green Difference (RGD) as input feature to create homogeneous segments and isolate landslides from non-landslides. This first approach leads to oversegmentation of non-landslide areas and, consequently, to an imbalanced dataset. The second step consists in a merging algorithm using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as input feature to merge homogeneous non-landslide segments and balance the dataset. These two-stages include the setting of parameters as the number of clusters (K) and NDVI thresholds that were experimentally derived. Once the segments are created and the dataset is balanced, a non-parametric supervised classification using Random Forest (RF) was applied to identify landslide segments; the main advantage of this classifier is that it can deal with different statistical distributions of features and can handle imbalanced datasets. Using a training and testing set of 70% and 30%, our method achieved a precision of 83%, recall of 83%, and f1-score of 83%. We found that topographic features have less influence than spectral ones; however, their exclusion decreases the model performance in about 10%. Our method is built using entirely open source technologies allowing its applicability and re-usability. For future work, we propose to use our method to detect new landslides and increase the number of training samples. Additionally, we recommend to explore a complementary approach to the merging algorithm to reduce the number of non-landslide segments, balance the dataset, and keep accurate classification results while more training images are added to the model.","landslide detection; earth-observation data; image segmentation; random forest; imbalanced classification; machine learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2019","Reducing the cost and CO2 emission for the power generation for a liquefied natural gas (LNG) production plant by using inverter based generation is the main challenge posed in this thesis. Both factors can be decreased by using inverter based generation instead of the conventional gas powered power plant for generating the power for a islanded LNG plant. The overall objective is to develop and investigate the dynamic performance of these inverter based generation for usage in an industrial islanded plant. Within existing literature there are no examples of large scale (230MW) inverter based generation in islanded mode. This thesis provides insight on the economical cost and the impact during different operational scenarios of using the inverter based generation in large industrial islanded plants. The general methodological approach consist of 5 steps. Firstly the conventional generation is analysed, then the financial analysis is conducted. Two proposals for inverter based generation are introduced and financially analysed. The fourth step is to develop a Powerfactory model for the inverter based generation and finally several disturbances where applied to the new system to evaluate the performance during operational scenarios. The first step was to develop a model for the LNG plant and the power generation. I made a Powerfactory model with topology and parameters based on a recent study by Shell. The model was adjusted to resemble a real case study of a LNG plan located in Tanzania and generic controls from existing literature where implemented. The second step was a financial analysis of the conventional power plant. This lead to two proposals for implementing inverter based generation in a LNG plant. These where to replace the spinning reserve for a lithium ion battery and to replace a gas turbine by a combination of solar PV and a VRF battery. Both options where financially analysed. Replacing the spinning reserve with a lithium ion battery leads to a reduction of capital expenditure by 34M$ at expense of increasing the risk of load shedding. This can be mitigated by implementing a lithium ion battery as spinning reserve. The capital expenditure of the battery is 50M$. The maintenance of the gas powered power plant is reduced by 0.94M$ resulting in a return of investment within 16.6 years. The replacement of a gas turbine by a combination of solar PV and a VRF battery increases the capital expenditure by 222M$ but reduces the operational expenditure by 15 M$/year/turbine making for a return of investment within 13.1 years. The third step was to develop models for the two proposals. This was done using Powerfactory 2019. The lithium ion battery Powerfactory model is adapted for the operation in islanded mode. For the second proposal a technical model is developed. This model was implemented in the Powerfactory software. The fourth step was the case study of the system including the new proposal. Three studies where conducted: generation loss, 3 phase short circuit and load rejection. All of theses studies are compared to the conventional generation model. For the lithium ion battery the result was an improved reaction in the generation loss scenario. Because the ramp rate of the battery is much larger than the generator it is replacing. The control is able to detect a variation in frequency and starts to provide active power. In both the load rejection and the short circuit the contribution of the inverter is limited. The battery is unable to be absorb the excess energy since the battery is already full in the load rejection scenario. In the short circuit study case the maximum output current ofthe inverter is 20x lower than that of the generator it is replacing. For the solar PV and the VRF battery the load rejection study case shows improved reaction. The reaction is faster than that of the turbine it is replacing since the extra energy can be converted instantly so the result is less frequency deviation. In the generation loss study case and the short circuit the reaction of the inverter is limited. In the generation loss scenario the inverter is providing maximum output power to decrease the gas consumption of the remaining turbines and is unable to provide more. The inverter is also limited in the short circuit current during the short circuit study case. It is unable to providemore 1 pu current. Overall, the combination of implementing inverter based generation in to an islanded LNG plant a good solution to reduce the cost and emission of the power generation. Both solutions have a return of investment within 20 years and have positive effects in the study cases. A combination of the two proposals can mitigate the limited reaction of each of the individual proposals. For the short circuit scenario conventional protection will not be triggered.","LNG; Islanded grid; solar PV; lithium ion battery; flow battery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Electrical Power Engineering","",""

With the majority of scientific researches approaching sustainability while keeping economic growth as a central prerequisite, the following research adopts an alternative pathway, connected to the concept of strong Sustainable Consumption. The research project aims to investigate how Greek society can be transformed towards strong Sustainable Consumption by the agency of the alternative economic model of Social and Solidarity Economy. The emergence of Social and Solidarity Economy in Greece, during the economic and social crisis that the country faced from 2008 onwards, presents itself as an opportunity to investigate how such an alternative economic system may contribute to the expansion of strong Sustainable Consumption. As there is a lack of scientific studies addressing the transition towards Sustainable Consumption under Social and Solidarity Economy, the present thesis provides innovative results that could lead to further research on the subject. For this purpose, the following research question was formulated: How do Social and Solidarity Economy initiatives in modern Greece contribute to the transformation of Greek society towards ‘strong’ Sustainable Consumption? An extensive literature review on the concepts of strong Sustainable Consumption and Social and Solidarity Economy, alongside an examination of the current practices of the latter in the country of Greece, are presented. The individual initiatives are chosen as the unit of analysis of the research design to study the social transition. The development of an analytical framework, based on the theoretical framework of Transformative Social Innovation, attempts to answer the formulated research question. Under this framework Social and Solidarity Economy is defined as a Social Innovation that is described as a change in social relations, involving new ways of doing, organising, framing and/or knowing. The framework investigates the levels of transformative change that such innovations can achieve, mainly their transformative ambition, potential and impact. The methodology proposed to implement the framework follows the multiple case study approach followed by a cross-case comparison. Based on the literature review on the state of Social and Solidarity Economy in Greece, it was revealed that cooperatives comprise the most active and legally contextualised form of Social and Solidarity Economy in the country. Consequently, the selected cases were cooperative ventures operating in different areas of Greece. The research results enrich the knowledge on the different ways that cooperatives develop new social relations and new ways to frame, organise, do and know Social and Solidarity Economy. The analysis revealed that all cases relate to strong Sustainable Consumption concepts or practices and they have accomplished some level of transformative change, while all cases exhibit traits that can be described as innovative and that challenge the dominant institutions of production and consumption that exist under the neoliberal context. Concerning the current contribution of Social and Solidarity Economy initiatives in the transformation of Greek society towards strong Sustainable Consumption, it can be concluded that is limited. While the ventures demonstrate attributes that can put forward the concept of strong Sustainable Consumption in the country, and indicate that they have transformative capacity, a broader transformation has not been identified yet.","Social and Solidarity Economy; Sustainable Consumption; Greece; Cooperatives","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is done to determine the characteristics of the Gaussian filter based on real-life experimental values, which defines the Gaussian filter that creates coloured process noise in the Active Inference algorithm. To accomplish the main research goal, the following is done: - Create a linear dynamical model of the jackal robot and optimize the model in such a way that its velocity states resemble the experimental values of the velocities for the given experimental inputs. - Show the presence of coloured noise in the dynamical behaviour of the jackal robot. - Create a Gaussian filter and determine its characteristics, which can recreate the coloured noise found in the velocity states of the jackal robot in steady state turning. To accomplish this, experiments are done capturing the linear acceleration, rotational ve- locities, position and heading of the skid steer mobile robot using both the internal sensors of the robot as well as an external motion capturing system. A linear model of the jackal robot is constructed and discretised as the noise is a function of the difference between the experimental value for the next step state [k + 1]exp and the prediction of the next step state [k + 1]est. The prediction is made by inputting the experimental values for step [k] into the discretised linear model together with the model input. The difference between [k + 1]exp and [k+1]est is the noise on the velocities during the steady-state cornering experiments. Optimal values for Gaussian filter are found by fitting the autocorrelations of coloured noise which is made by filtering white noise with a range of Gaussian filters on the autocorrelation of the measured coloured noise. The result of this research is proof of the presence of coloured noise in skid steer mobile robots which in turn indicates that using Active Inference on these types of robots is a worthwhile approach to control and state estimation.","Active Inference; coloured noise; skid steer mobile robot; autocorrelation; gaussian filter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering","",""

In the one dimensional situation, this fitting resulted into a curve with a shape similar to the desired shape. Despite the similar shape, it did not fulfil the total growth requirements; it fell short by a factor 100. Instead, a Gaussian curve was used to represent the cell concentration. In one dimension this gave a similar looking curve, with a relative error of 0.2316 for the first couple of weeks of the gestational age of the embryo, where the length of an embryo is measured form crown-to-rump. For the other weeks, when the length of the embryo is measured from crown-to-heel, a relative error of 0.0507 was observed.

This thesis refers to these women as ‘fat’ instead of ‘obese’ in order to respect their cultural values. The research was divided into a theoretical background study, a qualitative user research and an explorative study with methods including interviews, quick prototyping and user tests. The insights gained throughout the project come together into an overview of the most stigmatizing beliefs: (1) Fat people eat too much and exercise too little; (2) Becoming fat due to an unhealthy lifestyle is your own fault; (3) Losing weight is a matter of self-discipline; and (4) Slim people are healthier, happier and more successful. According to this research, the stereotypes and prejudices manifested in these stigmatizing beliefs are the result of misunderstandings and lack of knowledge. Therefore, the overview is complemented with facts and myths about weight that unravel the beliefs. Based on this overview, an interactive platform for fat women was designed: Big Fat Nonsense (in Dutch: Dikke Onzin). This platform consists out of a website (www.dikkeonzin.org), a podcast, a discussion template and social media channels. The design is based on the finding that stigmatized women often cope with internalized stigma. They first need to be empowered in order to stand up for themselves. By reading facts and myths about weight, answering the reflective questions on the website and listening to stories via the podcast, they gain the confidence to start a discussion with a stigmatizer in their direct social environment. A discussion template can be downloaded on the website to structure their conversation about stigmatizing beliefs. By answering the questions on the discussion template, the users are forced to set agreements on the desired weight-related communication within their relationship. In order to reach the target group, the design is promoted via social media channels and ambassadors. Finally, the design of Big Fat Nonsense has been evaluated with the target group and their close relationships. The design succeeded to provoke nuanced and in-depth conversations. However, to fully validate the effect of the design, it should be evaluated by measuring the amount of stigmatization before and after usage.","Obesity; Stigma; Taboo; Design; Discussion Tool; Fat Acceptance; Body Positivity; Weigh-related Stigmatization; Weight Stigma; Weight Discrimination","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They are founded in 2002 with financial transactions as their main focus. Today, they have shifted their core business to ‘data’ as every form of transaction. INNOPAY is led by the belief “everything transaction” which is translated in into an award-winning same-titled management book. They believe collaboration and data sharing to be the end-goal for finding the highest value-added for all (data) transactions. The challenge The objective of this thesis is to find use cases for the business clients of banks that would be enabled by Open Banking. There are two reasons for the need for such use cases. First, there are no specific use cases directed at open banking at this moment. Second, creating innovative products is becoming the new standard to differentiate for banks. INNOPAY will be able to use this thesis and the use cases that it brings forth to illustrate the benefits of Open Banking to a large variety of different (potential) clients. Thesis Context The user The business clients of banks share touchpoints through the financial function of businesses. The financial function of a business handles the financial assists and their interactions. The financial function is a group of functions, tasks and dynamics that are set up differently for every business. This thesis analyses this complexity and describes how financial tasks between businesses are similar and can be used to analyse the financial function consistently. There is a definite shift in the tasks of the financial function in the lasts couple of years. The financial function is moving from an operational set of tasks to a more strategic set, actively participating with the (corporate) strategy. The current financial function has low affinity Change in the financial landscape Four elements are driving transformation in the financial product and service industry. 1.Technology Technology has been at the forefront of disruptive innovation for multiple decades. Technology is contributing to faster ways of gathering, analysing and securely transferring data anywhere on the planet. Bringing financial professionals together and growing businesses to never before seen sizes. 2.Competition Competition is increasing as challenger banks, and Fintechs are joining the financial product and service industry with new and innovative user-friendly products and services. 3.Customer expectations Consumers are surrounded every day by products and services tailored to their specific needs. Consumers expect user-friendly, fast and intuitive designs. This expectation is no different for business users. 4.Regulation The regulation on the forefront of this changing landscape is Payment Service Directive 2 (PSD2). PSD2 is the first regulation in the world to focus on opening up the banking system. PSD2 mandates the opening up three banking data and functionalities previously monopolised by banks themselves. These three data and functionalities are: 1. Payment initiation services (PIS) Allowing a third party (TPP) to initiate payments from your account 2. Confirmation of availability of funds (CAF) Reviews the current account to see if enough funds are available for the required transaction 3. Account information service (AIS) Allowing a third party (TPP) to access your account(s) information PSD2 opens up three data and functionalities, Open Banking opens up the rest. Open Banking is defined as a business approach in which value creation results from sharing, providing and leveraging access to bank resources. Data, processes and other business capabilities of banks are made available to an ecosystem of Third Parties (e.g. Fintechs, technology vendors, corporate customers) through application programming interfaces (APIs). Meaning, The groundwork Business banking • The competition on the financial product and service landscape is picking up between Incumbent banks, challenger banks and fintech. • Collaboration between financial product and service providers is believed to be the most constructive method of creating value-adding products and services. • Banks will need to focus more on their customer as user expectations are shifting. Open Banking • For banks to gain a competitive advantage, it is essential to open up data and functionalities while creating innovative use cases. • Leveraging Open Banking enabled data, potentially with non-financial data, could result in products unexperienced by financial professionals. • An increase in Open banking adoption is required as it is currently low. This increase can be achieved by creating inspiring use cases and promoting the concept of open banking. The Financial function •The financial has little affinity with Open Banking as it is stil in it’s early adpotion phase. To increase this adpotion they need to be educated and inspired. • The tasks within the financial function are moving from operational to more strategic tasks as more time is freed up primarily due to technological advancements and analytical capabilities. • The richness of data is essential for strategic tasks to make strategic decisions. While the quickness of data has more influence on the operational tasks. • The financial function is looking for safe and secure products and services that are easy to use, interoperable with high analytical capabilities that increase efficiency. The solutions For INNOPAY to be able to present different concepts to different clients, three concepts are designed. They are all presented in an all-in-one dashboard solution called Mynance. The reason for presenting the concepts through this medium is too combat three reoccurring pain points found during this thesis 1.Customer journey – for the financial product and service industry a lot can be won by focussing on the customer journey as this is currently mostly subpar. Having all products and services in one place would facilitate more user comfort 2.Data infrastructure- The number of products and services offered at this moment have major operability issues. Having an all-in-one solution would alleviate this pain. 3.Privacy and security – If all compliance is under one roof, there is no need to trust multiple parties. It also created the possibility to show the user what data they are sharing from one location. OutOfOffice OutOfOffice is a solution for the need for a 24/7 financial function. Instant payments are becoming mainstream and are moving from the consumer to the business realm. This concept relieved the pain for the financial function to be on alert 24/7 as payments can come in and go out after the financial function has gone home. It allows for settings to be predetermined to send a notification when the change in cashflows exceeds a specific limit. OutOfOffice can also be set to undertake actions automatically. BenchmarKing The BenchmarKing is a solution that focusses on the opportunity to use pools of Open Banking data as well as non-banking data to find benchmarks that were previously impossible or extremely difficult to compute, in real-time. Allowing the financial function to critically analyse their position against a variety of segments. Precisely showing a business’s weak and strong points to be able to invest time and funds into different essential business aspects efficiently. Alertify Alertify uses pools of Open Banking data together with non-banking data to find patterns in business processes. It will then notify the user and recommend future steps. These patterns are extracted from historical data and can either negative or positive. If a problem is detected, it will recommend as well as if an opportunity arises. This is done through prescriptive analysis. The quality of prescriptive analysis will be enhanced by artificial intelligence and machine learning. Validation The concepts are designed to a certain degree of detailing to be able to adjust them to use for multiple purposes. INNOPAY can present these concepts as a whole to demonstrate the ‘big picture’ or they can choose to zoom in on a particular aspect of a product (e.g. a specific benchmark metrics or business process pattern) to reach their more niche clients. These concepts are made for presenting and are not designed to be made into actual products. Would that be the case, a great deal of additional research would have to be done with regards to the user interface, user experience, and technical aspects like privacy and security.","Open Banking; Finance; financial function; PSD2; B2B; Prescriptive design; Futures thinking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Households in the Netherlands are one of the dominant final end users of energy and a transition within this group could contribute to reducing GHG emissions. Local authorities endorse efforts to implement energy policies, but face the complexity in actor networks. This research focusses on how public, private and civic actors manage upscaling residential heat-generating facilities to district scale in the built environment in the Netherlands. While measures to reduce the GHG emission for electricity seem decisive, the vast majority of the Dutch households retain a carbon lock-in for heating. A motion towards decarbonisation is an area-based approach in which deep geothermal district heating networks. Although scholars acknowledge the existence of barriers and opportunities of upscaling the residential heat provision to district level, little literature is found on cases where the existing residential building stock is adapted for renewable district scale heat-generating facilities with geothermal energy as source in the Netherlands. This research addresses the knowledge gap on the management of upscaling geothermal district heating networks by public, private and civic actors by performing an actor analysis. The main goal of the research is to gain understanding in the local approaches and efforts of Geothermal District Heating Development (GDHD) and aims to clarify, gather and model the involved actor roles. Empirical research on the managerial actor roles is performed on the development project of Ammerlaan-TGI and Haagse Aardwarmte Leyweg (HAL). The findings on the case study reveal compiled chronologic events managed by a variety of actors. While actors are interwoven with each other by their dependencies, their managerial roles are evaluated on using management aspects in a cross-case setting, indicating how related management aspect variables apply to the GDHD. The outcome is assessed by experts who participated in a two-round Delphi-study from which effective roles for upscaling of geothermal district heating in the coming years is determined. The results show a large public actor integration in GDHD and role segregation among the actors, pointing out the immaturity of the sector. The public actors need to continue using stimulus tools and develop regulatory tools to foster maturation of the sector and evoke competitive advantage. Also their capacity building tools should be used to their full extent to match the heat supply and demand. Consensus between public, private and civic actors is considered most effective in GDHD, where through intensive communication, negotiation and decision making is agreed on the desired environmental quality for the built environment, our built environment.","Geothermal District Heating Development; Actor analysis; upscaling; renewable; infrastructure; management aspects; management tools","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

CNNs are implemented on high-performance systems like multi-core CPU and GPU, these are of high power in nature and thus cannot be deployed in edge devices due to their limited battery power. The edge device has to provide real-time performance along with being low power, this prompts for an exploration of novel architectures catered towards the processing of CNNs. The recent works towards this goal have been the development of CNN accelerators using systolic array spatial architectures. The row-column stationary data-flow approach maximizes the reuse of weights, input feature maps and output feature maps across the array. Different applications require different performance, area and energy needs, and this makes it imperative to quickly prototype the architectural ideas and perform design space exploration. The challenging part is the non-trivial interactions between different architectural design parameters, as they play an important part in the complex design decisions. Hence, a hardware simulator to accelerate CNN is designed in this work. It is based on systolic array and uses row-column stationary data-flow with a near memory computing approach. The simulator supports different numerical precision such as 16-bit and 8-bit floating-point along with numerous design parameters such as the size of the systolic array, latency of MAC operation, PE local memory size, PE local memory latency and external memory latency. The functionality of the proposed design is verified on AlexNet. The Destiny memory modelling tool, along with energy and area estimation model, is used to perform a system study to investigate the trade-offs between different architectural design parameters.","Deep neural networks, CNN, Accelerator, Simulator, systolic array, Near-memory computing.","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Circuits and Systems","PRYSTINE",""

The main objective of this master thesis is to use virtual reality to enhance the current art experience and encourage their purchases, designing intuitive interactions between the viewer and the virtual art gallery. The project started with researching from three aspects, including human, technology and business, to explore the current situation of the galleries and customers, as well as the possible design opportunities. The result showed there were mainly two reasons why more galleries closed because of few customers in recent years. On the one hand, current galleries often couldn’t attract customers to view around for a long time. On the other hand, novice customers don’t have an easy and friendly way to purchase artworks. Therefore, it requires the design to find a proper way to help the small art businesses adopt a more modern way of selling artworks, and attract younger customers. The desired user experience focusing on three key elements (approachable, emotions, purchase) is determined after analyzing. <br/>During the conceptualization, three concepts focusing on three key elements were developed by conducting co-creation sessions. User evaluation was conducted using paper prototyping to test certain features and people’s likelihood of use. Six key elements that should be included in the final concept was concluded from the evaluation. By conducting the prototyping process, four steps of building a virtual gallery were found, and the process is able to be used as a guideline for researchers or designers who want to develop a virtual gallery. In order to find a relatively better interaction for certain functions, two gallery concepts were created to compare the interactions. In the last evaluation phase, the design concepts were tested with potential users to get critical feedback and suggestion. The recommendations and limitations were discussions as well in the end.","Interaction Design; VR; Virtual Reality; Art; Gallery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

Tram tracks are often shared with either motorized traffic or pedestrians/cyclists. In this mixed traffic reality, tram accidents are very rare but severe at the same time. Tram driving is really a complex and very demanding task, since the driver should run on time, maintain his/her concentration, predict the behavior of other road users and protect the tram passengers from falls inside the vehicle cabin. In the past, a limited number of studies has attempted to examine tram safety, especially in urban areas, where trams interact with vulnerable road users (VRUs). Subjective notions of traffic safety, that are more connected with the behavior of tram drivers, such as: perceived safety and driving stress, have never been quantified. This thesis covers all the previously mentioned research gaps in order to explain tram safety problems. By utilizing the new knowledge, a list of practical recommendations, which can reinforce tram safety without downgrading system efficiency, is developed. For the development of statistical models related with perceived safety and driving stress, a stated preferences experiment was conducted in Athens. In the survey, tram drivers rated perceived safety and driving stress in a 7-point Likert scale. According to the estimated model of perceived safety, non-exclusive alignments, such as tram/pedestrian malls and mixed traffic operation, downgrade perceived safety. Furthermore, the existence of an unprotected pedestrian crossing and high volumes of VRUs influenced perceived safety negatively. Driving stress is affected mainly by arrival delay and load of standing passengers. Route familiarity is an additional important factor that influences driving stress. The existence of many random beta parameters in perceived safety and driving stress models confirms the subjective nature of these notions. No statistically significant correlation between these two previous notions was observed. Experienced tram drivers believe that they are ready to respond properly in a section that they perceive as unsafe, if they are familiar with it. If there is no familiarity, tram drivers lack confidence and therefore driving stress is increased. Objective safety was examined in the tram network of Amsterdam using accident records and spatial data, such as location of stations and pedestrian/cycling crossings, level of tram lines separation, cycling intensity, city attraction poles and city districts. In Amsterdam, more accidents per km appeared in tram/pedestrian malls; yet, most of the fatal accidents have occurred in tram tracks that are not shared with other road users. High concentrations of tram accidents were also observed around attraction poles and inside the city center, where the flow of VRUs is quite high. Lastly, as a practical recommendation, a consistent design of a tram line using the knowledge from the estimated perceived safety and driving stress models is developed for the first time.","Tram; Traffic safety; Vulnurable Road Users; Perceived safety; Driving stress","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","",""

Through such studies, the ability of the SU2 CFD solver to produce high-fidelity results for external flows has been substantiated by data from numerous testcases. Interest in applying the suite to turbomachinery flow analysis and optimization has been on the rise in recent times. This has led to a significant extension of SU2 capabilities to deal with turbomachinery flows. Evidence of the ability of SU2 to carry out CFD analysis of ideal-gas turbomachinery flows is scarce; the suite has only been applied to a radial-inflow turbine case thus far. The present Thesis documents the first application of SU2 to radial compressor ideal-gas flow analysis. Two testcases are studied: an automotive turbocharger compressor including experimental data shared by MTEE and a mixed-flow Supercritical CO2 compressor including a baseline CFD result. SU2 capabilities are assessed via a solution verification study including a grid convergence study and through a comparison of SU2 results with those of CFX and experimental data for the turbocharger. The assessment is based on major compressor performance metrics: efficiency and pressure ratio. RANS steady-state, second-order accurate simulations are carried out for a single, voluteless compressor channel using the S-A and SST turbulence model with mixing-plane interfaces using non-reflective boundary conditions. The comparison includes an analysis featuring SU2 S-A and SST simulations as well as a three-point speedline comparison featuring SU2 S-A results. The Supercritical CO2 compressor testcase is preliminarily studied, again including results from CFX as well as SU2 for a single operating point. It is concluded that SU2 is capable of arriving to an asymptotically converged solution in the verification study while displaying a convergence rate similar to the theoretical value. In addition, SU2 SST results are in well agreement with simulation results. The speedline obtained using SU2 also matches that of CFX and experimental data to a good extent quantitatively as well as qualitatively. For the S-CO2 compressor the disparities between the solvers are notorious, which is likely due to combination of factors including near-wall mesh treatment in SU2 and the complex geometry of the testcase.","SU2; Radial compressor; CFD; Verification; Turbomachinery; Grid convergence study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

CF is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder affecting mostly the respiratory, digestive and perspiration system. Patients with CF have dysfunctional chloride channels in their cells, due to mutations in both copies of the gene for the CFTR protein. The CFTR proteins are necessary for the production of mucus, a malfunction of the CFTR protein will result in tough mucus. In CF, a lack of functional CFTR prevents normal sodium and chloride absorption in sweat and leads to excessive salt loss. Due to increased sodium and chloride concentration in sweat from CF patients, sweat makes a good clinical body fluid to indicate the medicines' effectiveness. By measuring the chloride or sodium concentration before treatment with the medicine and after treatment, an indication of the medicines’ effectiveness can be obtained. In this study, a potentiometric screen-printed sweat sensor has been developed to monitor the medicine effectiveness in CF patients. The sensor consists of a reference electrode and ion-selective electrodes for measurements of chloride and sodium concentrations. Multiple prototypes of the sensor have been developed and evaluated on their performance. Furthermore, a read-out circuit with low leakage/bias currents and 8 channels is designed to increase the read-out accuracy and speed. Since the sweat volume during rest appeared to be too low for real-time measurements, a sweat collector was implemented with the sensor to increase the sweat sample volume during real-time measurements. Furthermore, a pilocarpine sweat stimulator has been designed and tested to artificially increase the sweat rate. <br/>The developed system proofed to be a functional concept for real-time patient monitoring. In future research, the chemical structure of the membranes is the most important topic to be improved. Improvements in this field could extend the life-time of the sensor and would minimise the sensitivity differences between the sensors. Finally, the sweat sensor, collector and stimulator have to be integrated and minimised in one design to make a wearable device out of it.","Sweat; Sensor; Cystic Fibrosis; CF; Potentiometry; Stimulator; Screen-printing; Collector; Medicine effectiveness; Chloride; Sodium; Real-time; Monitoring","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-06","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

Within this dynamic context, real estate organisations choose a particular organisational structure. Changes in organisational context can imply a reconsideration of the organisational structure of the real estate department. As a consequence, university real estate organisations seek to attain the organisational structure that is most beneficial for their organisation and the management of their real estate. The corporate real estate management process is based on matching real estate with organisational objectives and adding value to organisational performance. Previous studies have therefore focused on aligning corporate real estate management with the core business of an organisation. However, many studies do not focus on the impact of the organisation on the real estate management process. As a consequence, university real estate organisations lack the information and tools to assess whether their organisation optimally supports the real estate management process. As the university real estate management process has become more complex, and financial resources have become rather limited in the last two decades, the question of which organisational structure optimally support the management of university real estate is of high relevance. This urges the need for new information and tools to assess the relation between organisational structure and corporate real estate management. This study therefore explores how the organisational structure of university real estate departments influences the university real estate management process. The research objective is to provide university real estate organisations with a toolbox consisting of information and tools to support them in making decisions about the structuring of their organisation and the management of their real estate. The toolbox consists of three tools: (1) an analytical tool that determines the organisational structure of a university real estate organisation, (2) a model that assesses the university real estate management process, and (3) a model that determines which organisational structure is preferred based on specific conditions and priorities. Following the results of the study, it can be observed that different structural configurations do influence the university real estate management process. The organisational structure of the university real estate department can be determined by a set of five structural choices, which will create different structural configurations. To find the organisational configuration that supports the real estate management process, university real estate departments need to consider which added values they want to achieve. Added value can be created by: •aligning real estate with institutional goals (strategic) •aligning real estate with the primary process (functional) •aligning real estate financial value, risks and costs with the production of real estate products and services (financial) •maintaining the quality and quantity of current and future real estate (physical) In this study, the added value of real estate is assessed by linking the four Corporate Real Estate Management perspectives with the five development stages of Joroff et al. (1993). The development stage of the real estate department determines whether the real estate department’s behaviour and focus meets the university’s current needs, or simply put: it determines how and which added value is created by the real estate management process. To conclude, the organisational structure of the university real estate department influences the way university real estate is managed, as different structural configurations influence how the real estate adds value to organisational performance.","University Real Estate Management; Organisational Structure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

While GPUs offer better performance as compared to FPGAs and are easier to program, they have higher power consumption. The FPGA implementations typically employ systolic arrays, which consist of processing elements connected in a regular manner through which data is streamed.

We design a systolic array architecture with general purpose processors and map the Smith Waterman algorithm on it. The design of the systolic array consists of scratchpad memories to store intermediate data. Since employing multiple processors is a common method to extract more performance nowadays, we compare our architecture with a multicore architecture. Simulation results show that the systolic array architecture promises more speedup than the multicore architecture, achieving a performance of up to 1.5MCUPS for 16 processing elements, which is 4x times faster than a 16-processor multicore architecture. Moreover the performance of the systolic array architecture scales well with increasing number of processors as compared to the multicore architecture. Mapping the SW algorithm to the systolic array architecture is possible using only 100 lines of code programmed within 2 person-weeks in C which is a standard, familiar language. Our experiences with mapping the algorithm onto the systolic array architecture show that it could result into a CUDA-like programming paradigm.","Multicore architecture; Systolic array; Smith waterman","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Engineering","",""

Primary school teachers not getting involved with programming education can be caused by a lack of belief in their teaching programming abilities. The belief in your own abilities towards a certain task is referred to as self-efficacy. We hypothesize that Dutch primary school teachers have a low self-efficacy towards programming education (partially) due to the teaching method used in programming education. Programming is often taught via discovery learning while Dutch primary school teachers use teacher-centered methods such as direct instruction more often. The usage of a certain teaching method can also influence the performance of the teacher. When teachers are able to use their existing knowledge and skills, then they have adaptive expertise. This research aims at answering the following question: What is the effect of teaching methods on the self-efficacy of Dutch primary school teachers towards programming education? The research question is answered through a mixed methods study consisting of a questionnaire, as part of a quantitative research, and an experiment, as part of a qualitative research. The questionnaire includes questions about teaching methods, self-efficacy, and demographics. In total 259 teachers participated within the questionnaire. We found that both direct instruction and discovery learning are well known by Dutch primary school teachers. Direct instruction is used by almost all participating teachers in their regular education. However, discovery learning is used by only 53% of the teachers in our sample. We also found that gender, grade, programming experience, and programming teaching experience result in differences in teachers’ self-efficacy towards programming education. Furthermore, teachers who expect to use discover learning in programming lessons have a different self-efficacy than teachers that do not expect this. An experiment is set-up in which ten Dutch primary school teachers give four programming lessons in Scratch while following either a direct instruction or discovery learning approach. Data is gathered on self-efficacy and adaptive expertise. We found that getting involved in programming education, independently of the teaching method, can increase the self-efficacy of teachers. However, the teachers in the discovery learning expressed more negative feelings towards the experience of teaching programming. The usage of discovery learning also seems to bring the risk of a decrease in self-efficacy. We think that adaptive expertise gives us more insights into this decrease. The teachers with a decreased self-efficacy showed higher levels of adaptive expertise. We think that this contributes to them having higher expectations of themselves. When these expectations are not met, a decrease in self-efficacy can occur. The research we have done indicate that the self-efficacy towards programming education of Dutch primary school teachers can increase while using either direct instruction or discovery learning. The experiment indicates that the usage of discovery learning can cause more negative feelings as well as the risk of a decrease in self-efficacy.","programming education; Self-efficacy; adaptive expertise; teaching method; primary school","en","master thesis","","","","","","Degree in Computer Science and Science Communication","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

We show that the most common uncertainty sets, for example resulting from linear least-squares identification, are almost surely different from the geometry a game theoretic adversary samples from.

Housing prices are rising, and the number of single-person households is increasing, which impacts the affordability of housing. Cohousing offers a possible solution to this problem. However, the level of empowerment of cohousing communities to self-organize is troubled by financial or legal barriers, among other things. Self-organization is defined as: initiatives that emerge spontaneously in civil society from autonomous community-based networks of citizens, who are part of the urban system but independent of government procedures, and that are created around a common intrinsic motivation. The concept of sharing economy might provide a solution for the current barriers to cohousing development. Sharing economy is defined as: collaborative consumption of under-utilized goods, enabled through access rather than ownership, often through the use of community-based online services. This research connects sharing economy to cohousing by looking at empowerment of self-organization of cohousing initiatives. Sharing economy and self-organization of cohousing communities are connected because both are community-based initiatives, which are built upon a common motivation, and both are not facilitated by political power. The following research question was answered by studying a cohousing initiative: How can the concept of sharing economy support empowerment of cohousing communities towards self-organization to create affordable homes? This study researches empowerment by researching the community’s social capital, research shows that social capital contributes to community empowerment. Research findings show that the studied cohousing project can be viewed as a sharing economy. This leads to both advantages and disadvantages for the community. Moreover, the project struggles with its self-organization and is largely dependent on the housing corporation. Lastly, the cohousing project possesses social capital, but some elements can be improved. Moreover, the research found that the sharing economy within the cohousing initiative can support some conditions for self-organization, as well as bonding social capital. However, the aforementioned disadvantages of the case study’s sharing economy may limit the benefits. To reduce the disadvantages of sharing economy, this study proposes a communication tool as a possible solution for improving communication in the studied cohousing project. The tool, called ‘(im)Perfection Puzzle’, uses geometric shapes to help residents explain their thoughts and ideas regarding a specific problem and as a result work towards the acceptance of the differences in everyone’s ideas. A test of the tool illustrated that the tool has potential, but future research is recommended as long term effects remain unclear. Also, research with other cohousing projects is recommended for validating the connection between sharing economy and self-organization, and sharing economy and social capital.","Cohousing; Collaborative housing; Sharing economy; Self-organization; Social capital; Empowerment; Communication design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

The building tries to give the expat a face by creating a building that reveals their qualities to the Dutch population. These new planned high-rise buildings, planned on the intersection of the new urban plan and the existing business district of the Danzigkade, at the Minervahaven in Amsterdam.

Through this possible conceptual design principles were introduced for for the development’s podium. These concepts were eventually converted into a collected form that composed of various aspects that refined the qualities of the building, the site and the possible functional interpretations. The refined concept for the podium concepts presents a combination of favoured elements for different uses, along with a proposed dwelling plan for expats in the towers. The site upon which the towers are placed is a central public square for the neighbourhood, and the building has to recognize, embrace, and celebrate that. The building took inspiration from the two streets it is connected with. The Danzigkade has low-rise and retail plinths, while intermediate streets form residential courts. The towers are respectively divided into 3 and 4 separate masses. The public floors above every six floors that create different distinct volumes within the vertical raster that create a transition between the base volume and the tower element.

The countries in this area have always been experiencing drought periods but due to the climatic changes, but, these periods are becoming more extreme leaving the population vulnerable. The inhabitants of Morocco have always lived in dry circumstances and for centuries created great water management systems to guide fresh water to the areas that needed it the most. Unfortunately, these systems cannot keep up with the rapid development of the country and even though the government is working on providing fresh water to the population, most of the inhabitants living in the rural areas do not receive the basic services, which leads to socioeconomic issues in these areas. The people in the rural villages do not have access to suitable quality and quantity fresh water, which causes health related problems amongst them. The traditional water systems that are still in use in the rural areas are not maintained properly, highly contaminated and polluted by the people as they do not have a good understanding on how these interventions work. The once respected water management elements and the riverside is neglected and the connection between the people and the water is getting lost.

These parameters include the rate of precession and the amplitudes of the nutations, of the length-of-day (LOD) variations, and of the polar motion components. The MOP are sensitive to the interior properties of Mars, particularly to the presence and size of a liquid core. However, uncertainties of current interior models in other physical parameters describing the internal structure of Mars, such as the temperature distribution, the composition, and the elasticity, limit the information on the interior obtainable from the MOP. Current estimates of the core radius have uncertainties of about 100 km, and suggest a fully liquid core. The improvement of the accuracy of the MOP solution from the landers coming from the inclusion of radio-tracking data from Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) was studied in this project. Both numerical (through the orbit determination software GINS and Tudat) and analytical (through the ORB software developed at the Royal Observatory of Belgium) methods were employed to asses the sensitivity of the TGO orbit and radio-tracking data to the MOP of interest. In particular, an analytical method based on Kaula’s equations was developed to predict the effect of the MOP on a wide range of orbits. The satellites most affected by CW were found to be those in near-circular orbits at about 40∘ of inclination. The orbiters most sensitive to LOD variations were those in near-equatorial, highly-eccentric orbits. As for the improvements on the MOP estimation due to TGO data, a covariance analysis was performed with different assumptions on the dynamical and observation models, and on the estimated parameters. The improvement with respect to a lander-only solution is of up to 6 % for the CW components, up to 8 % in the LOD variations components, and up to 20% and 12% on the nutations amplification factor and the FCN frequency (the latter two judged excessively optimistic). However, no definite inference on the resulting core radius accuracy improvement could be made.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

It grants access to the second largest inland waterway system in South America, covering (parts of) Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, Paraguay and Bolivia. The channel is a main bottleneck for navigation for two reasons; the channel has a continuous need for maintenance dredging and it is only navigable during a tidal window. Furthermore, the dredging effort shows high interannual variability, resulting in risks for the contractor and users. The current study identifies the dredging effort and strategy, and a conceptual model is made of what physical processes force the sedimentation. The IPCC reports are used to identify the effect of climate change and variability on the drivers of the sedimentation. The interannual variability is shown to be linked to climate variability, due to the ENSO phenomena. The drainage basin of the Rio Parana is affected by an increase in precipitation and sediment input during El Nino events as a result of the teleconnections of ENSO. A depth-averaged numerical model (Delft3D) is set-up to address the effect of climate, deepening and wind scenarios on the dredging effort and its variability. The numerical model was validated by comparing the reported dredged volumes in the system to the simulated sedimentation. Overall, the sedimentation in the system is found to be sensitive to highly energetic events due to a redistribution of the fine sediments over the estuary. The acquired knowledge on the physical processes of the system in combination with the outcomes of the scenarios are used to make recommendations on the future dredging strategy to reduce the risk due to variability. This study highlights the importance of taking into account the risks and chances due to climate variability in dredging projects in regions affected by teleconnections with a duration of around 10 years.","sedimentation; Delft 3D; climate change; Climate Variability Study; morphology; ENSO; modelling; dredging; Argentina; deepening","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-11-04","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","-34.6037, -58.3816"

The aim of this research is to improve performance of an advanced displacement sensor and an ultra-low noise inertial sensor, that can help measuring and correcting for seismically induced motion of the GW detetctor’s test masses. In a Rasnik, light from a back-illuminated encoded ChessField mask is projected onto a pixel image sensor, and the relative position is tracked between mask and sensor. In past experiments, Rasnik was modelled to have resolution of below ∼0.5 nm in X and Y, while RMS resolutions of ∼25 nm were measured [1], a longstanding discrepancy central to this research. It was found that, analyzing spectral information of Rasnik response data, Rasnik did in fact reach its sub-nm modelled noise floor. A resolution floor of 퐴፧ = 270 pm/√Hz was measured, shown to be limited by SNR of the pixel content and white noise aliasing. What is more, with a different setup, an optical magnification trick was shown to result in RMS resolution gain. For the forced-feedback accelerometer with interferometric readout, Heijningen [2] measured displacement sensitivities of up to 8 fm/√Hz above 30 Hz, while the instrument was modelled to be shot noise limited at 3 fm/√Hz - another discrepancy this research attempted to explain. A significant reduction of the thermal noise of the instrument’s mechanics was achieved by re-designing the feedback actuator. After that, the accelerometer’s performance was re-evaluated on a ultra-low vibration platform. A resolution of 50 fm/√Hz was measured, a factor 30 above the modelled shot noise. Sub-optimal relative intensity fluctuations in the laser, as well as laser frequency noise, were found to be responsible.","Gravitational Waves; Seismic noise; Inertial sensor; Position sensor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

All kinds of contaminants on the bathroom floor take people a lot of time and effort to deal with. With the development of computational technologies, smart products are gradually entering into our lives to solve these troublesome issues. Therefore, there is a chance to use new technologies to solve the bathroom floor cleaning problem and to make life convenient. Obviously, different people have different attitudes towards smart products, which influence their preferences on interacting with smart products. Based on my personal experience, Chinese and Dutch young adults have this difference, and are chosen as the target groups. To sum up, this project aims to explore the interaction with a smart bathroom floor cleaner in Chinese and Dutch cultural contexts. The main challenge is to collect and analyze information from different aspects, and then integrated into a complex system, namely a smart bathroom floor cleaner system. The related aspects include context, user experience, smart product technologies, etc. We analyzed the bathroom environment conditions, the cleaning related concerns, the expected cleaning experience, promising technologies, Cyber-physical systems principles, and the opportunities in Chinese and Dutch smart product markets. The results show that the two groups have no significant differences in bathroom usage and cleaning habits. The expected experience for both groups is trustworthy and effortless. However, their attitudes towards smart products are different. The Chinese group has higher interest, while the Dutch group is more conservative. This difference is also consistent with the difference in the smart product markets. Therefore, we designed different interaction concepts based on the device in different intelligence levels in the conceptualization phase. In order to design an interaction concept, at first we need a device concept that can meet the requirements of the bathroom cleaning. This device concept is formed by two cleaning robots and a base station. It has physical functions and cognitive functions about the bathroom cleaning. Then, the<br/>generation of the interaction concepts is based on the device concept’s variants with different intelligence levels. Supplemented by interaction techniques and emotional expectations, different interaction concepts were defined.<br/>To analyze the experience of these interaction concepts, we refined the concepts. Through the storyboard and prototypes, participants evaluated these concepts. The results showed that the interaction concept with the most intelligent device could best reach the expected experience. At the same time, interaction elements in other concepts (e.g. using mobile apps to show complex information) also received positive feedback. In the end, we chose the interaction concept with the most intelligent device concept, with elements from other concepts as supplements, and had the final interaction concept. The final evaluation indicated that the concept is able to make the cleaning experience effortless. Users have trust in the cleaning ability of the device. However, trust in machine intelligence is not enough yet. In the end, we provided recommendations for the difficulties encountered throughout the project and the areas that can be improved in the results.","Cyber-physical systems; Cultural context; Smart Homes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

The dwellings consist mostly of the so-called baithi chawls, which are typical for Mumbai. The chawls are more permanent than other slums, often using materials like concrete and brick, and residents usually have land ownership. Still they are considered to be slums or informal settlements, because the houses and even apartment buildings are illegally built. The permanent nature doesn’t solve much though, as conditions in these chawls are similar and sometimes worse than in the slums.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Global Housing","","19.431328, 72.824086"

In India, the urban population has increased form 18 percent to 34 percent of the total population between 1960 and 2017 and is expected to exceed the rural population at the end of 2040. The growing urban population will putt stress on the availability of natural resources. The access to water, a vital resource for human existence, is already one of the resources threatened by urban growth. Only 70 percent of people living in urban areas in India have access to safe drinking water through piped infrastructure. The urban poor regularly lack access to the official means of water distribution because they live in illegal houses. In Mumbai, the largest city in India, around 42 percent of people live in slums and depend on informal water distribution systems like water trucks, neighbor water taps, public water stands, private water shops, ground water pumps or water kiosks. If the growing population of Nala Sopara is housed in the same way as before, the consequences will be severe. An increase in flooding will mean that more people will be cut off from electricity, drinking water, work, education and healthcare. Therefore better access to drinking water and good protection from flooding are main goals for the expansion of Nala Sopara. This will not only result in better health of inhabitant and more time to spent on work, study and other activities but may also become a tool for community making. But how can the growing population on Nala Sopara be housed in a way that water does no longer cause a threat but becomes a resources for community growth and empowerment of the urban poor? This research will try to answer this question. The goal of the project is to come up with a housing design for the expanding areas of Nala Sopara that delivers a better solution against the problems related with water while also providing a comfortable living space for the inhabitants. Since these problems are not at all unique to Nala Sopara alone, the design may also provide solutions to similar regions in India and the Global South.","India; Mumbai; Global Housing; Affordable Dwelling; Affordable Housing; monsoon; Flooding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","Global Housing Mixing Mumbai:","19.431931, 72.826911"

For instance, in the semiconductor industry, the deposition process of many thin films is conducted in a high-temperature environment where the vacuum needs to be precisely monitored and controlled. Although a number of micro-fabricated vacuum gauges which show great performances have been implemented by silicon technology, they are not dedicated for high-temperature applications. The traditional Si-based sensor will lose its functionality when it is exposed to high temperature because of the degradation of the silicon. This research work focuses on the implementation of a high-temperature compatible vacuum gauge, and the aim is to achieve an operation temperature (i.e. 500 ◦C) compatible with current high-temperature compatible electronics reported in the literature. The combination of poly-SiC and micro-bridge based vacuum gauge is proposed as a feasible solution. The fabrication of the vacuum gauge is conducted at the EKL cleanroom, and Pirani gauges with various geometries are fabricated by employing thin-film technologies for deposition and lithography for defining patterns. The gauge with a length up 1000 μm and a gap size down to 500 nm is achieved without any buckling. The fabrication process is a four-mask step, and it provides the potential for mass production and integration with readout electronics. The micro-fabricated Pirani gauge showed good measurement results. Empirical Pirani gauge design rules were confirmed by experiments. It is confirmed that a longer beam and a smaller gap size will bring a larger dynamic range. At room temperature, the nominal gauge (length = 250 μm, width = 8 μm, thickness = 2 μm and gap distance = 500 nm) shows a maximum resistance change of 17.8 % from around 10 Pa to 100000 Pa, with a maximum sensitivity of 0.44 Ω/Pa. The vacuum gauge also showed a successful operation up to 750 ◦C, with a maximum sensitivity of 0.787 mV/Pa (1.097 Ω/Pa). Although the high-temperature compatible gauge is successfully fabricated, some issues, such as the rectifying behaviour of Ti/SiC junctions and the non-uniformity of poly-SiC deposition, are still unsolved. The integration with high-temperature readout electronics could be the direction of future work.","High temperature; vacuum gauge; SiC; micro-bridge","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-06-30","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

However, their refurbishment and especially zero-on-the-meter, is too expensive and it is not possible to find the required funding. Following the guidelines of the Project MVI-Energie, which proposes disconnecting from the gas and decreasing the heating demand (that can reach up to 70% of energy demand) by insulating as such to be able to change to low temperature heating. This study focused on portiekapartments and proposed a refurbishment strategy to achieve LT-ready, while lowering the costs, time and nuisance to the residents. The facade criteria regarding the energy efficiency are the results of a parametric simulation, which includes every significant facade variable and the innovative process of applying external insulation at the optimal percentage to achieve LT-ready. The results of this simulation - diagram of solutions- can be used to upscale the research and as a guideline to quickly and easily understand if this strategy can be applied to other buildings and what it will need, based on their facade characteristics. For the technical solution a prefabricated small size insulating panel is used, that reinforces the economically feasible and fast refurbishment idea. An important aspect of the solution is to be adaptive (for example provide different cladding options) and can be part of a two-step refurbishment by providing the opportunity in the future to be continued to deeper refurbishment if needed.","refurbishment strategy; dutch post-war portiekapartments; facade insulation; LT-ready; economically feasible refurbishment; prefabricated panel; parametric simulations; Multi Objective Optimisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","",""

And secondly, to add to the body of existing scientific knowledge on ground effect.In order to identify the opportunities for adding scientific knowledge, first a literature study was conducted. The conclusion of this study proved that there is insufficient research literature available on wing-bodies in the ground effect to answer the investigation launched by the aerospace company.A methodology was chosen to fulfill both objectives, namely generating ground effect performance data by means of CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) computations. The results are validated using existing wind tunnel measurements.It was determined which data points had to be calculated to cover the parameter space and it was established that the required effort could be completed within the time frame of this thesis. The landing high-lift configuration was the principal configuration to be investigated. Using this baseline, the impact of the following changes on ground effect performance were determined: a) changes to the high lift settings b) change to the engine thrust setting c) changes to landing gear deployment d) changes to the nacelle size e) changes to the wingtip geometry. After completing the calculation of all data points, it was also possible to develop a method that will enable engineers to calculate the effect of incremental changes in geometry and configuration, required for the initial stages of aircraft design.The main conclusions in order of importance are:For low to moderate angle of attack α, the ground effect is beneficial. Lift is increased by up to 3.5% of the total lift, drag is reduced by up to 33% of the total drag.However, as α&gt;8.0°, the ground effect becomes less beneficial and the ground effect can even be detrimental, leading to a loss of lift of up to 5.5% while still having a drag benefit of up to 33%. The agreement between windtunnel data and CFD calculations is within 0.4% accuracy for the lift, and within 1.5% of the total drag value, except at the extreme case at moderate to high α and very close distance to the ground. Some of the differences can be explained in terms of practical problems in simulating the ground boundary conditions in the wind tunnel.The impact from a change to high lift setting and a change to thrust setting are most significant, with changes of up by up to 2% of total lift and up to 3.2% of total drag.There is a smaller but still quantifiable impact from the gear effect and the nacelle effect.A change to wing tip geometry has a minor impact on ground effect behavior, as lift is changed by up to 0.26% of total lift, only between 10.0°≤α≤12.0°.","Ground Effect; CFD; Aircraft","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

This thesis explores if the GIS standards, their implementations, and the organizations themselves are mature enough to support quality decision making in sectors like the risk management, by developing GIS web applications with up-to-date spatial datasets and complex geo-processes. Motivation for this research has been the Risk Indicators for Infrastructure in Data scarce Environments (RI2DE) GIS web tool of Deltares institution, a tool that performs GIS analysis based on datasets with global coverage, in order to detect areas around road infrastructures that are susceptible against climate related geohazards, and its need to provide quality risk maps and more friendly to the user Graphical User Interface (GUI) through status reporting messages and control of the processes. The tool is developed with open source technology components, OWS and standard data formats (such us Geographic JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) (GeoJSON), JSON and eXtensible Markup Language (XML). Having as case study the RI2DE tool, within this research the OGC Web Processing Service (WPS) 2.0.2 standard that is responsible for publishing geoprocesses as web services and its free and open source PyWPS 4.0.0 implementation has been evaluated according to the new operations for job monitoring and job control that the standard offers, in order to assess if it is feasible to have status report messages and control of the processes. Moreover it has be assessed how easy is to find and access up-to-date datasets, services and tools from distributed Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI)s that implement the Catalogue Service for the Web (CSW) standard, and how flexible are the WPS to accept different inputs. From an early stage of this research it has been clear that the status reporting and the control of the process would have been difficult to be implemented, since the PyWPS implementation of the WPS 2.0.2 is still undergoing until the delivery of this thesis. While the standard has been published since 2015, the only available full implementation of it is from the ZOO-Project, which arise question regarding the complexity of the standard specification and the currently state-of-the-art technology. The greatest achievement of this thesis has been the integration of the distributed searching for services at different CSW catalogues, at the RI2DE tool web browser.

The rise of the temperature can affect the Sea Surface Height (SSH) in more than one way, and since 70% of the Earth’s surface is covered by the oceans, if the oceans are being affected then the whole Earth also is. The monitoring of the SSH can help the scientist predict the changes that will take place in the future. The SSH is a dynamic phenomenon that constantly changes not only within different decades but also from year to year, month to month even within the same day. These changes are the result of various phenomena and are called anomalies. When the SSH is monitored different phenomena are represented in different time scales and it is important to be taken into consideration if there is the need for a proper understanding of the SSH phenomenon. Many spatial data vendors are providing a large number of data-sets related to the monitoring of SSH and its anomalies and as a result, there is the need to find the most effective way to extract information from the data. Over the years has been established that one of the most effective ways to extract information from data is through the various visualization techniques and since the data of SSH is mainly spatial the main visualization technique is cartography. The advancements of the technology over the last couple of decades have led to a reality that the ”online” application is the norm and consequently the web mapping and web geographical information system (GIS).<br/>The goal of this thesis is to propose an architecture for a web GIS application that will be able to visualize dynamic data while adding elements of interactivity to improve the chances of the Sea Surface Height Anomaly (SSHA). IN order to achieve the goal of this thesis three main research questions need to be answered: What type of animation should be used (in order to visualize the passing of time), what interactivity elements should be added (e.g. zooming/panning in space and time) and what system’s architecture is optimal for such application (server-side/client-side etc.). This document is providing guidelines on how to create such an application and is resulting in the production of a prototype. The first part of this thesis is the review of the main ideas that are introduced in this project and how they were implemented by other researchers. Then, a comparison between the different implementation techniques (for every research question) is taking place to determine the main characteristics of the application. The final part is related to the implementation of the chosen techniques that lead to the development of the prototype application. The resulted prototype even though it is not perfect, due to technical limitations that were a consequence of implementing some of the most recent concepts in web development, is functional and paves the way for the development of new improved dynamic/interactive web GIS applications (https://giorgosdimo.github.io/MSc-Thesis/).","Sea Surface Height Anomaly; Dynamic visualization; Interactive; Web Maps; Tiled Maps; Video Tiles; Video Synchronization; Zoom in Time; Web GIS; WVMS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

A wide variety of these 3D data needs have emerged in multiple domains and for many different applications. Though, research have shown that the interoperability of this 3D data nowadays still is a challenging task. Many barriers are caused by different perspectives of organisations, technical issues during conversions of data and a lack of guidelines. For this research, a case study is done in The Netherlands, one of the countries that experimented a lot with topographical data already. The Dutch Cadastre, Kadaster, has been working on a country wide covering 3D topographical basemap. However, also some of the Dutch source holders of large-scale topography have taken steps towards the development of 3D city models. The question that now arises, and also the main research question of this thesis, is: “How can a variety of 3D city models be integrated in a country wide covering 3D basemap based on large-scale topography?”. In order to achieve an answer to this question, the methodology has been split up into three components. The first component contained a literature study on 3D city models. The second component of the methodology included the interaction with stakeholders, such as Kadaster and various source holders of the Dutch topographical data. This interaction is performed by means of interviews and surveys. The third component contained the technical part, in which different 3D test data is collected and compared. The test data is for almost all stakeholders provided in CityGML, which is an international 3D standard used for 3D models. Various differences in the 3D data of the stakeholders are found. These differences can be found in the contents, the source data, the process and the management. Based on these test data and their differences, a workflow is developed in order to integrate the data. This workflow uses open source tools as cjio and citygml4j for the manipulation, integration and conversion of the data. This resulted in an integrated 3D model, containing both the data from Kadaster as well as the data from the source holders. Results have shown that the differences between the test data, semantically as well as geometrically, led to gaps and height differences in the final integrated model. This study has proven that different 3D city models can be integrated in a country wide covering model, which can be converted to various formats (CityGML, CityJSON and OBJ). A workflow is developed that integrates the test data of 5 Dutch source holders with the data from Kadaster. A few challenges during the conversion and integration of data had to be overcome. These challenges were either caused by errors in the code of the test data or by bugs and errors in the software tools. In the end, two proposals were given for further organisational developments towards a national 3D basemap based on large-scale topographical data. These proposals were based on the results of the literature study, the interviews with stakeholders and the data comparison and integration. In option 1, a national 3D basemap, developed and managed by Kadaster, is proposed. In option 2, a new basis registration, the 3D BGT, is proposed. In this situation Kadaster will provide a 3D basemap once and the source holders will collect and parse the mutations in 3D.","3D city model; large-scale topography; The Netherlands","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

In particular, after having performed a verification and validation phase over a wide set of problems (including various space missions such as Cassini, Messenger, Rosetta, and others), we focus on their application to a solar polar sailing mission to the Sun, attempting to minimize its mission cost and duration. Therefore, building on previous studies of such a mission scenario, we first constructed a model for simulating the journey of the sail from a geocentric GTO to the Sun, not only accounting for gravitational forces, but also atmospheric forces, the non-ideal solar radiation pressure force, and other environmental aspects. Then, a guidance model for the sail was set up, so that the attitude of the sail could be controlled during its journey to the Sun. This entire framework was formulated as both a single and multi-objective problem. Finally, a trade-off was performed between the newly developed ACO and other state-of-art global optimizers. For the single-objective case, these include artificial bee colony, simple genetic algorithm, self-adaptive differential evolution, particle swarm optimization, and other methods. While for the multi-objective scenario three different optimizers have been tested against the multi-objective ant colony extension: an evolutionary algorithm with decomposition, a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm and a multi-objective variant of particle swarm optimization. The found results are very promising: for the single-objective problem, the ant colony optimizer has managed to outperform all the algorithms. Whilst for the multi-objective case, the genetic algorithm seems to provide the best Pareto fronts, although the results are very competitive with those of the ACO, especially for lower function evaluations. In the end, besides providing the scientific community with new powerful global optimizers for SO and MO problems, we managed to halve the mass of the solar sail compared to previous studies, while still keeping a similar time of flight.","Optimisation Algorithms; Solar sailing; ant colony optimisation; Global optimization; Astrodynamics; Optimisatiom; Trajectory optimisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-12-31","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""
