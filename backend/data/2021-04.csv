(mentor); Avis, G. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Quantum communication can enable new features that are provably impossible with classical communication alone. However, the optical fibers used to send the quantum information are inherently lossy. To overcome the exponential losses over distance so-called quantum repeaters are needed to amplify the signal. As opposed to memory-based approaches, the third generation of quantum repeaters, also called one-way quantum repeaters do not require two-way communication thus enabling very high communication rates. In particular, the one-way quantum repeater based on photonic tree states proposed<br/>by Borregaard et al. (2019) realizes this task with a very modest amount of resources. Nevertheless, the method considered is susceptible to operational errors. In this work, we propose the use of code concatenation of a stabilizer code and the tree code, so that by measuring stabilizers of the stabilizer code and applying the syndrome corrections we can achieve a fault-tolerant one-way quantum repeater. In order to do so, we present a detailed protocol that uses the 5-qubit code. Moreover, we develop the first fully general simulation framework for studying the performance of tree-code based one-way quantum repeater<br/>chains, which in this thesis is used to perform an analysis of the proposed<br/>protocol. We find that the code-concatenation protocol under consideration has a similar tolerance against operational errors to the protocol proposed by Borregaard et al. (2019). Unfortunately, we are not able to draw a distinction between the tolerance of the two approaches. We do however suggest modified protocols that may provide fault tolerance. Studying these is beyond the scope of this thesis.","quantum communications; Quantum information; quantum internet; quantum repeaters; fault tolerance; Quantum Error Correction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Work is presented on a novel hybrid fs/ps two beam CARS application for spatiotemporal gas phase hydrogen thermometry, capable of sampling at a rate of 1 kHz. The aim of the research is to assess the feasibility of directly probing hydrogen for accurate temperature measurements in a combustion environment. Typically, nitrogen is used in applied CARS thermometry because of the inert nature of the gas and the availability on both the products- and reactants side of the flame. Nitrogen is well understood in CARS applications and is therefore used as a benchmark for the results obtained through hydrogen thermometry. No hydrogen was available in the lab, so a rich premixed methane-air flame was used in a regular Bunsen burner. At high equivalence ratio’s sufficient amounts of hydrogen are formed as an intermediate species to be probed in the flame. Quantum-mechanicalmodels were used to predict the molecular responses of the corresponding molecules, after which they are compared to the experimental data. The feasibility of hydrogen thermometry was assessed through a series of three different experiments: using the standard output pulse of the regenerative amplifier at 35 fs for spatiotemporal measurements, using the 35 fs pulse for point measurements, and using a frequency broadened 10 fs pulse produced through filamentation for point measurements. Nitrogen and hydrogen spectra were recorded simultaneously to ensure proper data comparison. The 1 kHz acquisition rate enabled the evaluation of temporal correlation in the temperature data. The spatiotemporal CARS measurements clearly depicted flame dynamics at 1 Hz and 12Hz, but the signal to noise ratio in the hydrogen signal was too weak to properly assess the data. The point measurements using the 35 fs pulse yielded similar average temperatures, but the precision in the hydrogen temperatures was poor (25%) due to the fact that only the first two S-branch transition in hydrogen were excited. In the experiments using the 10 fs pulse, the first four S-branch transitions in hydrogen were excited. This greatly improved the precision for the temperature measurements (2%), surpassing that of the nitrogen thermometry (4%). The nitrogen and hydrogen temperatures also showed great temporal correlation (0.85-0.9). However, there was a very consistent temperature deficit in the hydrogen temperatures of 550K, most like caused by a wavelength dependence in the optics (which are optimized for narrowband applications) which severely affects the higher Raman shifted hydrogen signal. Lastly, an experiment was done using the 10 fs pulse to probe O-branch transitions in hydrogen, and a serious discrepancy between the CARS and CSRS spectra were found, again likely caused by the optics in the setup. These results approximated nitrogen temperatures much better, within 7% at 2000 K. Overall, the results were promising, but not yet conclusive and more research is needed.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The identified target users are female physical therapy patients with a young family who experience lower back pain. Prevalence of lower back issues are highest among musculoskeletal conditions and issues related to lower back pain have a large influence on the rest of the body. Here the posture changes due to poor posture behaviour, creating deformities in the body. These deformities can be measured by adapting strain resistive sensors to textile based sensors and integrated them in a tight fitting bodysuit. For this purpose, the zigzag stitch, shieldex 2-ply silvercoated yarn and 85% lycra proved most successful in obtaining a useful sensor signal.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In the current moment in time, there are large societal transitions happening, such as the transition to sustainable energy or the transition towards a circular economy. Design-led transitions are societal transitions towards more sustainable futures, led by designers (Irwin, 2015). These transitions help us to move towards a more sustainable future for organizations, and are there- fore something largely all companies would want to participate in to accelerate this. In this increasingly complex, dynamic and networked world (Dorst, 2015), companies cannot solve these large-scale societal issues alone.Therefore, in order to accelerate the transition, it is vital for companies to work together, as the challenges of today cannot be solved by companies by itself. One of the ways in which companies can collaborate is in ecosystems, which has increasing interest of scholars and practitioners. Specifically, this project focuses on transition ecosystems, a specific type of ecosystem focusing on accelerating transitions. In transition ecosystems, companies build multilateral partnerships that need to interact with the shared goal to help accelerate transitions. These ecosystems are first explored by parties and then formed before they work towards the transition. The forming phase of ecosystems is a critical phase, since during this phase a lot of tensions and complications arise, which need to be taken into account in order to have a succesful ecosystem formation. These tensions occur, because within forming an ecosystem there is a gap between the organisational perspective and the ecosystem perspective Organisations want to participate in the transition in order to stay relevant, but might feel threatened or vulnerable by having other parties present. If actors can move towards an ecosystem perspective, they are able to find new collaborations. In order to be able to see their possible new roles and co-create possible futures in the ecosystem, they need to release their concern about current threats and competitiveness. In order to get these parties out of their current role, a dialogue is needed between actors striving to form an ecosystem. This project included a design approach to understand how designing ecosystems can accelerate transitions. For this research, 15 interviews are conducted (13 initial interviews and two follow-up interviews for validation).These interviews informed the designer, to design a toolkit to bridge the gap between the organizational and ecosystem perspective in transition ecosystems. The Value Network toolkit designed in this project aims to bridge the gap between the organisational and ecosystem perspective. It aims to do so by allowing organisations to think free of the constructs of the current situation, see their organisation in a new role and see the value of the ecosystem . The toolkit is aimed at strategic designers facilitating the forming phase of an ecosystem. In the value network toolkit, three tools were developed to facilitate discussions to relieve tensions. The three tools were validated and tested using both expert interviews and a test case, and based on this iterations were made.  The project concludes with a critical reflection and relates back to existing literature.","ecosystem; Transition Design; Business Ecosystems; Toolkit","en","master thesis","","","","","","Roxanne is a Strategic Product Design student who also has a background in Innovation management","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Gas turbines (GT) play a crucial role in the transition to fully sustainable energy. Conversely, the expected growth of the GT market is met with more stringent regulatory requirements. Clearly, an increasing turbine inlet temperature (TIT) is beneficial for the efficiency of GT cycles. With increasing TIT, however, the magnitude of the thermal loads becomes unbearable, causing thermal fatigue of the component in a transient setting such as GT start-up or shut-down. Therefore, it is crucial that the thermal loads are well managed, which is typically achievable only by adequate external and internal cooling. Generally, such cooling systems are modeled in the industry using an uncoupled heat transfer (HT) approach, assuming that the heat coefficients (HTCs) are only influenced by the aerodynamics of the flow field: HTCs are obtained in a separate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation and are extracted and mapped on the solid domain of the component. Firstly, the report presents a comparison between the uncoupled approach and the increasingly popular conjugate heat transfer (CHT) approach, in which the fluid and solid domains are solved in a single simulation. To do so, the commercial code (STAR-CCM+) is first validated for both laminar flat plate and turbulent offset jet in a steady-state setting. The latter is done by comparing three Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models. The popular wall treatment methods: blended and high-y+ wall functions (WFs) are also compared. The comparison between the two HT methodologies is done by a parameter sensitivity study, involving the thermal conductivity of the solid (for both laminar and turbulent cases), Turbulent Prandtl number, and turbulence intensity. It was concluded that the realizable k-epsilon model is the most accurate for this flow. Conjugation played a marginal role for all parameters. with only a considerable difference in the stagnation regions, when the solid conductivity is low. The results using a high-y+ WF displayed high numerical dissipation due to the coarse mesh size and hence the difference between the HT methodologies was artificially low. It is therefore advised that the study of the high-y+ WF is repeated on a different flow arrangement/setting (e.g. increased inlet velocity). Secondly, the thesis details a study around the internal cooling of Siemens GT transition piece (TP), using CHT. An introduction of perpendicular ribs into a fully developed turbulent channel flow can theoretically significantly increase the heat transfer coefficient through the introduction of large-scale vortices downstream. An optimization routine was run with a hybrid algorithm to study the effect of different rib configurations in a steady RANS simulation, aiming to minimize both mass flow and transition bond coat temperature. The performance is compared to the baseline smooth channels used in the Siemens TP. No better results were achieved for both objective functions in comparison to the baseline case mostly due to the length of the channels. However, a considerable decrease in the coolant consumption was present with a limited increase in the BC temperature. The study showed that the optimization of such ribs can minimize the effect of skin friction (which influences the amount of coolant), and presents a possible further improvement of the TP cooling, without relying solely on the experience of the designer.","Conjugate Heat Transfer; Turbulation; Optimization; Cooling; Combustion Equipment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-04-30","","","","","",""

The area inland has been appointed as a Natura-2000 area because of the highly appreciated ecological value. A reduction of saltwater seepage would cause potential harm to the flora and fauna which is undesired. Two sectional models of the density dependent groundwater flow have been developed to map out the growth of a freshwater bubble forming beneath the Hondsbossche dunes and the corresponding decline of saltwater seepage to the polders inland. The two sections chosen are a section perpendicular to the coastline through the middle of a small lake De Putten and a section perpendicular to the coastline just south of a small lake Abtskolk. Both sectional models have been tested through a calibration process for the measurement data considering the freshwater head and geophysical properties of the groundwater. From the models the development of the groundwater regime for the coming 95 years has been calculated (100 years in total and 5 years until the present situation). Besides this the development of the groundwater regime in several sectional variations to the developed sectional models have been investigated. This has been done to investigate the impact of certain assumptions in the layout of the sectional models. These variations to the sectional models also are an indication of the range of possible changes to the groundwater regime for the whole area because elsewhere in the area these resulting sections could be present. Looking at the results of both sectional models and all model variations the conclusion can be drawn that the biggest reduction of saltwater seepage takes place in the years 2026 till 2056. Therefore it is advised to take action against the reduction of saltwater seepage before 2031. A sensible way of doing this is to firstly identify the most critical sections perpendicular to the sea in the area of interest. A good first step would be to identify the most permeable spots in the clay layer beneath the dunes. The results show that in these spots a faster spread of the freshwater bubble is expected. Besides this it has become apparent from the model results that the small lake De Putten attracts a bigger fraction of the seepage currents in comparison to the surrounding area. It would be a good idea to investigate where other hotspots for seepage are present in the area. In these areas the reduction of saltwater seepage would most likely be more intense. The identified critical sections would be the best places to start implementing measures against the decline of saltwater seepage. When actions are taken timely and precisely it is expected that the decline of saltwater seepage will remain small and the ecological value of the polders will remain.","sand replenishment; SEAWAT; MODFLOW; Groundwater","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-04-25","","","","Water Management","","52.73777248752, 4.642055274547395"

That high-dimensional nature can severely challenge traditional (often Euclidean distance based) approaches to noise and dimensionality reduction. Furthermore, statistical analysis of such data is often hampered by the curse of dimensionality, concomitant with large numbers of pixels and channels, by the growing abundance of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) measurements, and by the detrimental effects of noise accumulation. It is therefore necessary to find efficient means of reducing high-dimensional (and large data size) measurement sets to a lower-dimensional representation while incurring minimal information loss. Addressing this challenge is essential (a) to enable processing of the massively multivariate measurement sets acquired by several promising imaging technologies today (commonly hundreds of gigabytes to terabytes per experiment), (b) to avoid that computational analysis becomes a bottleneck for the development of new instrumental capabilities, with hardware setups theoretically capable of yielding terabyte to petabyte imaging but currently considered impractical, and (c) to enable archiving massively multivariate measurement sets, often required to be stored for several years and containing information suitable for additional science projects. This thesis focuses on this challenge specifically. First, it explores structured and regularized matrix decomposition methods based on the l<sub>1</sub>-norm, e.g. building on principal component pursuit (PCP), to address this challenge. Second, it delivers custom implementations of these methods. Third, it develops and implements an application-driven framework for automatic setting of hyperparameters. Finally, it applies and compares these methods using several spectral imaging case studies spanning both very small scales, in molecular imaging of organic tissue, as well as very large scales, in the spectroscopic imaging of Outer space.","big data; spectral imaging; imaging mass spectrometry; integral field spectroscopy; matrix decomposition; linear algebra; sparsity; molecular imaging; astronomical imaging","en","master thesis","","","","","","Master of Science in Systems and Control Master of Science in Aerospace Engineering","","2026-04-30","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

In the fight against global warming wind energy helps realise green house gas emission reduction targets. Moreover, given a globally increasing demand for energy, the role of wind energy is set to become even more important. Historically, the cost of wind energy has decreased significantly, making it more competitive with respect to fossil fuels. This trend is set to continue thanks in part to a driving factor, which is the increasing size of wind turbines. However, there are several impediments to the upscaling of wind turbine sizes. The larger, more flexible wind turbine components experience greater loads. To mitigate increasing fatigue loading, which limits the lifetime of components, thereby increasing the cost of wind energy, smart control methodologies are needed. The existing literature indicates that individual pitch control (IPC) offers good perspectives for fatigue load mitigation. An interesting approach to performing IPC is by means of model predictive control (MPC). Unlike conventional IPC implementations, MPC offers the designer a more intuitive way to evaluate trade-offs between, e.g., power generation and load mitigation. In addition, an important advantage of MPC is its ability to handle constraints explicitly. A particularly interesting application of MPC for wind turbine operation concerns convex economic model predictive control (CEMPC). By means of a simple change of variables, the normally troublesome nonlinear dynamics are transformed into linear dynamics. As a result, relevant optimization problems can be reformulated in a convex fashion. The formulation of such a convex optimization problem is useful because such problems enable a global optimum to be found, and can be solved relatively efficiently. Unfortunately, the existing CEMPC framework is limited to collective pitch control (CPC). To facilitate further load reduction, it would be useful to extend the CEMPC framework to the domain of IPC. This thesis therefore seeks to investigate how the existing CEMPC framework can be extended to the domain of IPC for the purpose of wind turbine load mitigation. It is shown that an improved CPC implementation of CEMPC can be extended to IPC by considering a blade-effective wind speed and CPC-equivalent aerodynamic power for each blade. With regards to load reduction, a case study of out-of-plane blade root bending moment fatigue load mitigation indicates several important difficulties that require further investigation. Arguably the most important impediment for future load reduction prospects within CEMPC using IPC is the inability to consider the pitch, which is an important variable to minimize various sorts of loading, as a free optimization variable.","Convex Economic Model Predictive Control; Individual Pitch Control (IPC); Fatigue Load Reduction; Wind Turbine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Circular Skin enhances circular solutions like recycling, repair, refurbishment or reusing the components of the product that will determine a decrease of the raw materials consumption and energy expenditure.

(mentor); Cleij, Diane (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In conditionally automated driving, drivers should be free to engage in non-driving-related tasks until warned by the system to take over. Over-reliance on automation can lead to dangerous driving behaviour such as engagement in non-related driving tasks during the transition phase and delayed response to take over requests. Take-over time and quality were shown to be influenced by several factors such as involvement in a secondary task, the complexity, and criticality of the driving situation, or the modality and intensity of the take-over request. We found a paucity in research into the effect of post-take-over complexities. Understanding the effect of traffic situation just after transition phase on driver's take-over behavior is crucial for developing highly automated driving systems regarding safety. Therefore, we conducted a driving simulator experiment and tested the influence of post take-over situation complexity on take-over behaviour and driver's trust during automation initiated take-overs. Twenty-four participants drove two conditions, one with high situation complexity and the other one with low situation complexity in a fixed-based driving simulator. Participants were driven with conditionally automated driving and asked to play a game until warned by the automation to take over. The take-over performance was assessed based on safety performance (take over reaction time and no. of collisions) and subjective measures (self-reported perceived trust and technology acceptance). Sub response times in terms of the first gaze and hands on the steering wheel time after the first TOR is prompted, were also analyzed using video annotations. Results showed that situation complexity does not affect take over reaction time, though it significantly affects trust in automation rating. No significant relationship has been found between sub response time and overall take-over reaction time in both situation complexity. Eleven collisions occurred, which indicates that some participants fail to resume control on time. Some participants did not resume control at all and trusted on the automation in both complexities. Higher trust rating in low complexity situation indicates that drivers might develop complacency, resulting in degraded take over ability in unexpected take-overs and delayed response to take-over. This suggests that people develop a wait-and-see attitude and only reclaim control when they feel the need for it. These findings can help design automated technology and policies to ensure the inherent risk in conditionally driving automation can be eliminated.","Take over process; Take over reaction time; highly automated driving; situation awareness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering | Human Factors","",""

The process is beneficial for software quality but challenges remain for identifying refactoring opportunities. This work employs machine learning to predict the application of the refactoring type Extract Method in an industry setting with the use of code quality metrics. We detect 919 examples in industry code of Extract Method and 986 examples where Extract Method was not applied and compare this to open-source code. We find that feature distributions between industry and open-source code differ, especially in class-level metrics. We train models to predict Extract Method in industry code and find that Random Forests perform best. We find that class-level metrics are most important for the performance of these models. We then investigate whether models trained on an open-source set generalize to an industry setting. We find that, although less performant than a custom fit model, a Logistic Regression type model performs admirably. Afterward, we examine whether these models perform on unseen industry projects by validating on projects excluded from the training set. We find that average performance is decent but lower than when using the whole industry dataset or an open-source dataset for training. Lastly, we conduct a blind user study in which we ask experts to judge predictions made by our best model. We find that experts generally agree with the model's predictions. In the case that experts agree with the model's prediction to apply Extract Method, they do so because of high code complexity. When they agree with the model's prediction not to refactor they most frequently give the reason that the respective methods are already sufficiently understandable.","Refactoring; Machine Learning; Industry; Data driven","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

Novel adaptive image-guided radiotherapy techniques are developed for this machine. However, new qualityassurance (QA) techniques are required that check if the (adapted) planned radiation dose is the same as the dose given to the patient. Dose reconstruction, based on the MR-LINACs logfile, can be a new powerful QA tool. Here, we verify logfile based dose reconstruction with the treatment planning system (TPS) dose and Delta4 phantom MR+ on various timescale and discuss its potential as a new QA tool for the MR-LINAC.Method:Software was developed and validated for comparison of the different dose distributions. A patient RT-plan was selected with the intensity modulated RT step-and-shoot technique. The first experiment TPS dose – Logfile was performed at timescales: 1. Total RT-plan 2. Per beam. The second experiment Delta4 – Logfile was performed at timescales: 1. Total RT-plan 2. Per beam 3. Per segment 4. Per 200ms.For analysis, visual comparison, dose profiles, dose difference (DD) and gamma-index (90% of the data) were used.Results:The patient RT-plan had 7 fields and 57 segments. Outcomes of the first experiment were: 1. Total RT-plan: DD = -1.5 to 1.5% and gamma-index (DD=1% &amp; DTA=1mm) of 0.89. 2. Per beam: DD = -3.3 to 2.4% and gamma-index (DD=2% &amp; DTA=2mm) of 0.87.Outcomes of the second experiment were: 1. Total RT-plan: DD of -2.7 to 2.4% and a gamma-index (DD=2% and DTA=2mm) of 0.69. 2. Per beam: maximum DD of -4.7 to 2.5% and gamma-index (DD=2% and DTA=2mm) of 0.99considering all beams. 3. Per segment: maximum DD of -5.9 to 6.0% and gamma-index (DD=3% and DTA=3mm) of 1.0 considering all segments. 4. Per 200ms: the cumulative DD in a high irradiated area was -4.0 to 7.1%, after the2nd segment and -5.2 to 5.3%,. after the 7th segment.Conclusion:Logfile based dose reconstruction might be newest QA tool for the MR-LINAC. Accuracies meet current accepted criteria for IMRT treatment plans considering the total RT-plan and per beam timescale.

The goal of this thesis is to estimate to what extent these vessels can be used, the impact that these vessels will have on the supply chain and the cost impact of the implementation of Capesize vessels. The production of AMG is expected to be increased up to 5.5 million ton of steel for 2026. Therefore, it will require an estimated 12.9 million ton of raw materials (12% increase compared to 2019) which mainly consist of iron ore and coal. Up to 31% of this material can be shipped from source ports that are accessible by Capesize vessels. The draught restriction of 12.5 meters for the canal, limits the amount of bulk material that can be unloaded by the Capesize vessel to 105,000 DWT which is 60% of the maximum of 175,000 DWT. The remaining 70,000 tons of material can be unloaded externally and be transported to AMG by the use of inland barging vessels. The increased volume of Capesize vessels compared to the current Panamax vessels will lead to an increase in load size and a decrease in load frequency which will affect the downstream installations of AMG. Most of the current quay cranes will be unable to unload Capesize vessels due to the increased size of the ships. A proposed crane was introduced in the model to examine the ideal positioning to unload Capesize vessels and barges. 6 realistic scenarios for 2026 have been examined with varying levels of Capesize utilization. As a result of these scenarios vessel arrival lists for full year were simulated. Each of the vessel lists served as input data on a quay model with as results the downstream impact. The main output parameters were the waiting time for sea vessels, waiting time for barges and the amount of material that had to be stored on a temporary storage. In general, the implementation had a negative effect on all three of the output parameters resulting in additional quay costs. The net effect of Capesize vessels on the total costs was positive thanks to the lower shipping price per ton of material. This benefit was partly compensated by the increased costs for barging that was caused by Capesize transport. The shipping costs for Capesize vessels should at least be 2.53 dollar per ton cheaper, to break-even with Panamax vessels. Under current circumstances the full-scale use of Capesize vessels can be feasible. However due the high volatility of the dry bulk market and bunker prices, it is impossible to guarantee this will be the case for 2026.","Capesize; Vessel Logistics; Ferrous Industry; Supply Chain","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-04-30","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

Various critical aspects of CCA development remain unclear. Lately, the dynamic process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was highlighted to play a crucial role in the fundamental mechanism of metastatic dissemination. However, in vitro EMT studies are mainly limited to conventional 2D models which lack in vivo tumor physiology. Recently, 3D organoid culture methods provide us new model possibilities. Therefore, our research aim was to establish a representative in vitro organoid-based epithelial-mesenchymal transition model in cholangiocarcinoma including its in vivo pathophysiology and tumor microenvironment. This study focusses on three different aspects of the tumor microenvironment regarding EMT activation in CCA organoids: 1.The effects of EMT promoting growth factors and culture media on EMT activation. Various growth factors are highlighted to play a crucial role in EMT activation in different cancer types. To study EMT activation in CCA, various growth factors were added to CCA organoids. We observed round shaped organoid structures consisting of single layered epithelium for all conditions. Additionally, gene expression levels of EMT related markers were increased for specific growth factor conditions. The use of various culture media combined with transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) showed the most substantial differences in mRNA expression of EMT markers in branching medium (BM). Based on these results, specific growth factors and BM were used to find the optimal culture conditions to induce EMT. Although we did not find significant morphological differences between the various conditions, altered gene expression levels of EMT markers were observed after TGF-β1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) treatment in BM. 2.The effect of the tumor extracellular matrix on EMT activation. The tumor extracellular matrix (ECM) is an important component of the tumor microenvironment that stimulates the malignant behavior of surrounding cells. The combination of CCA organoids and patient-derived ECM resulted in morphological changes. Cells with a polygonal shape adopted an irregular shape after TGF-β1 treatment. On top of that, our data revealed that patient-specific ECM and CCA organoids altered the gene expression of EMT related markers. 3.The effect of the interstitial fluid flow on EMT activation. The use of a microfluidic platform enabled us to study the effect of fluid flow on EMT in vitro. Cells formed organoid structures in the absence and the presence of a fluid flow. However, cells only migrated to the surrounding culture medium due to the presence of a fluid flow. When cells were seeded directly into the chip, cells formed a tube structure with protrusions growing outwards. The protrusions growth was accelerated by the addition of TGF-β1 and led to increased cell migration. Additionally, fluid flow conditions resulted in altered gene expression levels of EMT related markers. Our data suggest that fluid flow could potentially stimulate EMT in CCA organoids. Overall, our findings have demonstrated that growth factors, native ECM and interstitial fluid flow could be used to induce EMT in vitro. Indicating that the tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in EMT and tumor progression. Our novel in vitro CCA organoid-based EMT model provides a foundation towards a more representative EMT in vitro model to unravel the underlying mechanism of CCA and its progression.","Cholangiocarcinoma; Epithelial-mesenchymal transition; Tumor organoid model; 3D extracellular matrix; Tumor-on-a-chip model; Tissue engineering; Regenerative medicine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-04-30","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

An auxiliary buffer connected to the input pad is used to drive the voltage across the ESD protection diodes to a near-zero value, thus ensuring leakage currents in the femtoampere range. Two kinds of protection diode structures were designed and characterized. Based on the results, an auxiliary buffer was designed to bootstrap the diodes. Next, the bootstrapped ESD diode structure was taped out and measured. A low leakage test PCB was designed using techniques such as guarding, shielding, and via-fencing, resulting in bare PCB leakage currents well below 20 fA. The ESD protection circuit is fabricated in TSMC 180 nm MS/RF CMOS technology and occupies an area of 0.043mm2.

In addition this paper reviews the reconstruction process of the Frauenkirche in Dresden, Germany. Heritage propagates our history and cultural identity and must therefore be viewed critically to prevent deceit. One way to examine the sincerity of heritage can be done by basing it on authenticity. Yet, the latter is a subjective concept and no universal criteria can be formulated, since it comes down the perception of people. Due to this effect, post-war reconstruction in historical style is likely to be seen as authentic because it responds to a collective desire of the people, although it can be seen as deceitful in regard to the historical continuum of the reconstructed object. Examples of reconstructed heritage around Europe show that due to the strong relation between heritage and cultural identity, socio-political factors underlie inevitably the way we deal with heritage, whether it is to enhance, cultivate or destroy cultural identity. The Frauenkirche demonstrated how authenticity is obtained in reconstruction to the original style by applying the Anastylosis principles. However, it also illustrated the complexities of the debate prior to the reconstruction, since multiple symbolisms were assigned to the church and how finally, one of these was neglected when rebuilding this emblematic drawing. Thanks to this framework, it is possible to conclude that reconstructing the Notre Dame to its last known visual state is not likely to be seen as authentic when it deliberately results in creating replicas without an obvious notion of the destruction that the fire caused. The most critical aspect in authentic reconstruction of the Notre Dame is to let the principles of reconstruction meet the people’s desire assuming that heritage owns its status by being meaningful to people. Therefore, these meanings and symbolism that people assign to the Notre Dame need to be identified before being translated in design principles.","AR2A011; Notre Dame; Frauenkirche; Heritage; Authenticity; Reconstruction; Authentic reconstruction; People-centred reconstruction","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

However, the biomechanics of this movement are not known. In this thesis the standing-up movement with the use of the thigh push-off strategy (TP), the armrest push-off strategy (AR) and the no arm aid strategy (NA) was analysed. The aim was to find out why TP for standing up is being used as a compensation strategy by elderly people. Method: We examined upper and lower limb joint moments and lower limb muscle forces in three different sit-to-stand strategies in nine healthy elderly men. Inverse dynamics and static optimisation were done in OpenSim using a 3D musculoskeletal model. Results: The lumbar extension moment in TP was significantly lower compared to NA (p=0.04). Rectus femoris force is lower in phase 2 in TP compared to AR. AR upper limb joint moments were significantly larger in dominant and non-dominant shoulder external rotation (p=0.02, p&lt;0.01), elbow extension (p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.001), and wrist flexion (p=0.04, p=0.02) compared to TP. Also, dominant shoulder abduction (p=0.04) moment was higher in AR compared to TP.

These induce vibrations of the base, which create noise, wear and fatigue problems and reduce the accuracy of the systems. Dynamic balancing is a solution to eliminate these reaction forces and moments by generally introducing additional counterweights and counter-rotating elements. Mechanisms having zero shaking forces and moments are called, respectively, force balanced and moment balanced. Dynamically balanced mechanisms are both force and moment balanced. Since the introduction of additional elements increases the total mass and inertia of the mechanisms, the method of inherent dynamic balancing aims at designing dynamically balanced mechanisms which do not include additional elements. By considering dynamic balance as a design principle, all the links contribute to both the motion and the balance of the mechanisms. These are called inherently dynamically balanced mechanisms and can be synthesized from inherently force balanced linkage architectures, which are based on principal vectors. However, the design of these architectures consists in parallelogram linkages which can potentially compromise the force balance when their links become collinear. In addition, links can overlap and represent a potential limitation in real applications. This thesis presents techniques which modify the linkage architectures and can prevent the potential issues related to their original design. The number of degrees of freedom can be reduced and specific motions can be created by constraining links’ rotations and translations. Moreover, parallelograms’ sizes can be modified and links can be replaced by machine elements like sliders, gears, belt and chain drives. It will be shown how force balance is maintained after having modified the linkage architectures.","Dynamic balancing; Shaking force balancing; Center of mass; Linear momentum","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

Adding a Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) processed germanium bottom cell to a multi-junction device has the potential to provide a low-cost boost in conversion efficiency by utilizing a part of this spectral range below 1.1eV. For this thesis, 89 amorphous/nano-crystalline hydrogenated germanium (a-/nc-Ge:H) films were PECVD processed with the objective of creating a device quality material that is stable, intrinsic and has a high photoresponse. These characteristics are required to enable p-i-n bottom cell integration in a multi-junction device and prevent post-deposition oxidation and carbonation. To this end, the following three approaches were applied: I. Boron doping to increase the activation energy; II. Hydrogen plasma treatment (HPT) to decrease the defect density of the material with hydrogen passivation; III. A decreased electrode gap to improve the photoresponse. These approaches were integrated in the sample preparation steps. Subsequent film characterization was carried out by using vibrational analysis, elemental analysis, and opto-electrical analysis. <br/>The influence of boron doping was considered insignificant and the influence of hydrogen plasma treatment was considered inconclusive. Furthermore, a decreased electrode gap did not result in a higher photoresponse. Reported photo-/dark conductivity ratios were in the range of 1-7. However, the decreased electrode gap resulted in lower deposition rates and higher refractive indices of 4.9-5.0 (compared to 4.1-4.9 for a 20mm electrode gap), indicating denser films. A substantial fraction of the films was processed at an increased temperature of 275°C. It was found that increasing the processing temperature from 200°C to 275°C resulted in considerably denser films with refractive indices of up to 5.2, leading to higher activation energy (up to 314meV) and very low post-deposition oxidation and carbonation. Therefore, by increasing the processing temperature, it was accomplished to produce denser, more stable films, which have a lower bandgap energy and are more intrinsic.<br","germanium, PECVD, temperature, a-Ge:H, nanocrystalline, oxidation, carbonation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","DISCO",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Microgrids are a promising tool that can help transition the electricity grid towards a smart grid. They can provide significant benefits to the power grid in the form of increased reliability and flexibility. The microgrid controller sets the electricity consumption and generation of all controllable devices within the microgrid and controls how much electricity is exchanged with the main electricity grid. Model Predictive Control (MPC) has been proposed as a method for developing such microgrid controllers. MPC can deal well with the many different constraints that are imposed on the control of the microgrid. Because controlling a microgrid involves switching devices on and off, microgrids are often modelled as a hybrid system. A downside of MPC for hybrid systems is that, a mixed integer optimization problem must be solved at every control step. Solving mixed integer programs is computationally complex, especially for large scale problems. The difficulty of the optimization problem limits the response time of the microgrid controller. Parametric MPC has been suggested as a way to reduce the computational complexity of the controller and to create an efficient single level MPC controller. In parametric MPC the control input is parametrized according to a set of parameters and a control law. Instead of determining the inputs directly by solving an optimization problem, the optimization problem determines the optimal parameters of the control law. This method can reduce the number of optimization variables significantly and increases the scalability of the controller. To ensure the parametric controller performs well a good parametric control law should be chosen. In this research a new way to determine the parametric control law is proposed. The control law is represented as a combination of expressions. These expressions are represented using a set of expression trees. Using expression trees a wide array of different non-linear functions can be represented. During an offline optimization step, optimal control inputs are determined using a regular MPC controller on a set of scenarios. Expression trees that are able to parametrize the control inputs well are then learned from these control inputs using a genetic algorithm. By using learning methods to determine the control law, the design of the parametric controller can be automated. Using this method there is no need for the control system engineer to determine a parametric control law through trial and error testing. This can speed up the design process and could allow parametric MPC to be used for systems for which input parametrizations are difficult to find. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated through a case study in which a microgrid is simulated with 2 controllable generators, renewable generation, an uncontrollable load and local energy storage. The performance of the parametric MPC controller determined in the offline optimization is compared with a handcrafted parametric MPC controller and a regular MPC controller. The estimated economic cost of operating the simulated microgrid using the different controllers is compared. Furthermore the computational complexity of the different controllers is analysed. The results show that the offline trained parametric controller achieves similar performance in both operating cost and computational complexity as the handcrafted parametric controller. This shows that the proposed offline optimization algorithm can be used to determine an effective control law for a parametric MPC controller. This will make it easier to design parametric MPC controllers for different systems in the future.","Microgrids; Parametric; model predictive control; frequency control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

The project aims to increase the livelihood of smallholder farmers in the Maharashtra, India through. A socio-hydrological (SH) model is used extensively in this research as an evaluation tool. However, the baseline research indicates that the lack of stress mechanics in the SH model used in the intervention might cause inaccuracies in yield estimation. Furthermore, it has never been validated at a farmer level before. This research aims to implement the stress mechanics in the SH model, evaluate the overall performance of the model in terms of predicting crop yield, identify potential sources of errors, and give recommendations for future studies. The research uses iterative top-down approach due to the large study area and the varied nature of the 308 farmers surveyed. The research implements the water and temperature stress mechanics based on Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) AquaCrop framework. For the performance evaluation process, this research uses four model scores namely Nash-Sutcliffe (NS), log of NS, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and the coefficient of determination. Furthermore, the sources of uncertainties are divided into two categories namely lack of knowledge (i.e. generated by parameter, input, observation, and structural errors) and variability (i.e. generated by climate variations). The lack of knowledge uncertainty is investigated using Monte Carlo Sampling calibration and the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) concept is used to obtain the uncertainty intervals of the model. Going further, the errors are divided into residual and structural error. The latter is explained and quantified through a structural error model using a combination of qualitative analysis, Principal Component Analysis, multiple linear regressions, and projection of the data into kernel space. Then residuals between the model yield + structural error vs. the observed yield is thought to be explained by the residual errors. Lastly, the effects of climate variations to the stability of the model are evaluated.<br/>After the initial calibration, the model scores are NS: -0.343 to -0.996, log of NS: -0.655 to -1.91, MAE: 447.1 to 553.2 kg/ha, and r-squared: 0.003 to 0.008. Because of the poor performance of the model, the uncertainty intervals from GLUE are not enough to capture the total errors of the model. However, after adjustment using the structural error model, the model scores become NS: 0.83, log of NS: 0.56, MAE: 149 kg/ha, and r-squared: 0.859. The adjusted yield calculation has a residual error as Gaussian distribution with standard deviation of 150 kg/ha. The qualitative analysis identified several factors that contribute to the errors viz. farmers' capital, irrigation behavior, and crop production process such as canopy cover growth. Lastly, there is no major instability found through the bootstrap analysis. The physical model is not performing well, especially when it is calculating yield for individual farmers over a large study area. However, the structural error model can adjust the yield prediction so that it is close to the observed yields. This indicates the poor performance is likely to be caused by the prevalence of structural errors in the model instead of the uncertainties regarding parameters, input, or observation values. Therefore, it is recommended for future research to address this first. This can be done by further study and incorporation of more crop production processes, soil water simulation, and exploratory interviews to identify patterns and more factors that can influence the errors.","Error quantification; Monte Carlo simulation; GLUE; PCA; Kernel method; Calibration; Socio-hydrological model; AquaCrop model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","Water Efficiency in Sustainable Cotton-based Production Systems in Maharashtra, India",""

(mentor); Zaadnoordijk, W.J. (graduation committee); Abraham, E. (graduation committee); Schoups, G.H.W. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In this report, the tidal method is used to estimate hydraulic aquifer parameters. The principle of the tidal method is to use head fluctuations in observation wells, caused by tidal motion in a sea or river, to determine regional hydrological characteristics of an aquifer system. As the wave propagates into the aquifer, the amplitude of the signal decreases and the phase increasingly lags behind the tide at sea. The extent of this is determined by hydrological aquifer characteristics, hence aquifer parameters can be estimated, by calibrating a model that reproduces the measured tidal propagation. Knowledge of hydraulic aquifer parameters is important since these are needed in groundwater models. The case study was performed on Schouwen-Duiveland where use was made of hydraulic head fluctuations from three groundwater observation wells and water-level observations in the Oosterschelde. First, these time series were analyzed to estimate the amplitudes and phases of the constituents present in the data. Noise in the data was reduced with the use of Pastas (a model to analyze hydrological time series; Collenteur et al., 2019) and a Butterworth filter, after which both methods were compared. Pastas was used to decompose the fluctuations observed in the groundwater to different contributions of hydrological stresses (e.g. rain and evaporation) and Butterworth was used to flatten the frequency response for frequencies that are not of interest. The use of the Butterworth filter is preferred, partly because it produces the smallest standard deviations for the amplitude and phase estimates and because it is easier to use. Moreover, especially for the wells with a low signal to noise ratio, the Butterworth filter is better at extracting the tidal signal. In addition, a graphical determination of the amplitude and phase was performed to check if this relatively quick and easy analysis gives accurate estimates of the M2 amplitude and phase as well. It was concluded that with a high signal to noise ratio and a dominantly present constituent (M2 in this case), the amplitude can be reliably estimated. Determining the phase with this method did not give satisfactory results. In the inverse modeling part, the hydraulic aquifer parameters are determined, which is done with a least-squares minimization of the observed and modeled amplitudes and phases. For the optimization, both a one-aquifer and a two-aquifer model were used, both based on the one-dimensional, multi-layer solution presented by Bakker (2019). The optimization was performed with a global optimizer. The obtained fit to the observations was somewhat poor, moreover, unrealistic optimal parameter estimates indicate that the model, to some extent, incorrectly represents the real system. This also implies that some of the model simplifications do significantly impact the results. Simplifications presumed to mostly influence the model results include homogeneity, one-dimensional flow and the use of a straight shoreline. The presence of some model error signifies that the resulting parameter estimates should be treated with care. The hydraulic conductivity and the resistance of the one-layer model were consistently estimated at their upper boundary and the storage in the leaky layer was estimated to be negligible. Therefore, only one parameter group (i.e. the diffusivity) could be estimated with the optimization. The fit of the model was not perfect, a compromise must be sought based on what residual the model minimizes. As a result, all diffusivity estimates within and around the range [1.07E6, 1.31E6] m<sup>2</sup>/day are all considered to be reasonable estimates. For the resistance of the aquitard (<i>CU</i>) and the storage in both the aquifer (<i>S<sub>s</sub>U</i>) and the aquitard (<i>σU</i>) it was analyzed which parameter values gave unreasonable results. This resulted in a lower bound for <i>CU</i> (<i>CU</i>=663 days) and an upper bound for <i>σU  </i>(<i>σU </i>=1.22E-4 m<sup>-1</sup>). For <i>S<sub>s</sub>U</i> reasonable results are obtained between 2.28E-6 m<sup>-1</sup> and 1.87E-5 m<sup>-1</sup>. The lower bound for the <i>CU</i> estimate seems to comply with estimates based on two models (REGIS-II and GeoTOP). Finally, the two-aquifer model was considered to be useless for parameter estimation. Presumably, this is predominantly caused by a small amount of amplitude and phase data compared to the number of parameters to be optimized.","Tidal method; Geohydrology; Hydraulic aquifer parameters; Inverse modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","","51.6855341,3.833860"

Profiled SCA is especially interesting as it assumes that the adversary has unlimited access to a clone device that can generate sufficient traces to create a profile of the device. The latest techniques used for profiled SCA are based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). However, CNN's are limited in scope in how they define convolution. By running the convolution over a graph instead, we can achieve a more flexible convolution method. Therefore, we want to apply graph neural networks (GNN) to SCA. To achieve this, we need to translate our SCA problem to a graph signal processing (GSP) problem. This is done by generating a graph based on the power traces on which the traces can be run as graph signals. Subsequently, this graph is used in a GNN to solve the GSP problem. We experiment with different GNN architectures to see how they differ in performance compared to SCA state-of-the-art. We also want to observe how our model deals with the different leakage models and if there is a considerable performance gap between them. We also want to see how GNNs deal with countermeasures such as masking and desynchronization. Finally, we perform hyper-parameter analysis to know whether we can reduce the number of learnable parameters without substantially decreasing the performance of our model. The numerical results demonstrate that our model is not competitive compared to state-of-the-art methods. The performance of our method is mainly derived from the classification multilayer perceptron instead of the graph convolutional filter layers. However, the results suggest that the graph convolutional filter layers are potentially helpful in existing SCA architecture as an initial layer that performs feature extraction.","Cyber Security; Graph neural networks; Graph signal processing; Profiled Side-channel Attack","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Cyber Security","",""

The cultural differences of commemoration of this conflict complicate coming to a stable convergence of a single render of the traumatic events. To date, research has been limited to the psychological basis of memory and the sociological impact that empowers individuals to overcome their trauma. Yet, it is not clear what the possibilities are to bridge the cultural differences of commemoration in order to achieve reconciliation. Hence, this thesis explicates the difference between Western and Arab mourning by comparing two Israeli and two Palestinian memorials in typology and event. The considered case studies are The Military Cemetery on Mount Herzl (1960), the cemetery in the mosque of the refugee camp in Shatila (1982), Monument to the Negev Brigade in Beer Sheva (1963-1968) and a Palestinian monument in ‘Ailabun (1983). The concept of universal mourning in joint cemeteries is proposed as a starting point for reconciliation on the basis of the similarities from the comparison. The personal, physical and political complications of the bereavement process of traumatic memory of Hirst and Manier (2008), which follow from a theoretical realisation of the joint cemetery, emerge to be the core barriers for the creation of reconciliation circumstances by spatial interventions. Therefore, this thesis provides suggestions to bridge these with existing reconciliation formats divided into the Coexistence Model, the Joint Projects Model, the Confrontational Model and the Story-Telling Model.","AR2A011; Israel-Palestine Conflict; Reconciliation; Monument; Joint Cemetery","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

With DESHIMA a wideband THz signal is fully sampled by several hundreds of channels of which the frequency is defined by an array of band-pass filters. Each band-pass filter which is connected to a separate MKID which can be read-out simultaneously by a microwave read-out signal. This single-pixel system can be expanded through the implementation of steerable antennas. Especially when several spectrometers are used to create a multi-pixel spectrometer, the process of measuring the Universe's background radiation could be sped up and also be used to calibrate the instrument. In this thesis an on-chip platform is designed which is able to quantify the achievable phase-shifting capabilities of a superconducting microstrip line at terahertz frequencies. This is done by exploiting the non-linear behavior of a superconductor's kinetic inductance to a dc current. DC-biased superconducting Fabry-Pérot (FP) resonators, replacing the role of the filter-bank mentioned above, have been investigated and designed to quantify the phase-shifting capabilities by probing the shift in the resonance frequency. The injection/extraction of DC biasing currents on the FP resonator need to be transparent to the THz frequencies. To do so, low-pass stepped-impedance filters have been designed. A Chebyshev filter has been implemented with a stepped-impedance filter which has a minimal rejection of 45 dB between 300 and 400 GHz. This is necessary to prevent leakage of the THz signal into the bias feeds. The two filters reactively load the FP and have an effect on the Q-factors. This change, without any bias current applied, is small enough to be neglected. The tuning of the FP with a dc bias current is limited by the critical current the superconductor can support. This is determined by the geometry and material characteristics of the superconductor. The sensitivity of the superconductor to a dc current is limited by its kinetic sheet inductance. The larger this value is, the larger the tuning range. The results of the simulations shown that with this design it is possible to obtain a phase shift of roughly 0.7% which coincides with phase shift values found in other studies. It is therefore possible to implement this design to create beam-steerable superconducting antennas. The design is being fabricated as this is written and will be measured in the coming months.","Fabry-Pérot resonator; Superconducting resonator; Phase-shifter; Kinetic Inductance Detectors; DC bias current","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Telecommunications and Sensing Systems","",""

Since PV cells are tested under standard test conditions (STC), but real world working conditions differ, it is interesting to see how 2-junction PV performs worldwide in different climates. Worldwide spectra where simulated in SMARTS using data from NASA’s Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) and Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) and from the Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean (JISAO). SMARTS provides only clear-sky spectra, to account for cloudiness, the BRL model is used. The top absorber is 1.72 eV Perovskite and the bottom absorber is 1.12 eV Si. Because Si is an indirect bandgap material, a limiting Efficiency model by Richter et al. is used that takes both Auger and radiative recombinations into account. Because this model relies on variables and constants only given for Si, and the top absorber is a direct bandgap material, the detailed limit model by Shockley and Queisser is used to calculate the performance of Perovskite. The distribution of high and low local yearly average irradiance is overall realistic, except for the north of Africa and the Middle East. Here aerosol optical depth (AOD) values are elevated. The elevated AOD can be explained by dust events, still these areas should be among the ones with the highest irradiance. The AOD effects the blue side of the spectrum mostly. All spectra where normalised using CERES’ irradiance data. The Richter model is thickness dependent. Thus the optimal thickness of Si is determined to find the optimal efficiency. To distinguish between the effects of the top layer and local climate effects on the thickness, firstly the optimal thickness of single junction Si is calculated and analysed. The optimal thickness ranges from 70 to 870 µm globally. The average is 205 µm and the irradiance weighted average is 165 µm. For double junction Perovskite - Si current matching was used to find the optimum. The thickness of Si ranges from 10 to 4500 µm. But only nine locations (of 597) have a thickness above 500 µm. The average thickness is 77 µm and the irradiance weighted average is 81 µm. Locations with a high optimal thickness had a blue-er spectrum than the locations with a low thickness. Using the optimal thickness of single junction Si and current matching, the optimal top-bandgap was determined around the world. The optimal bandgap ranges between 1.55 and 1.76 eV, the average is 1.655 eV and the irradiance weighted average is 1.663 eV. The relation between the top bandgap and optimal Si thickness was determined under STC. High bandgaps had the lowest optimal thicknesses and the thickness increased with decreasing top-bandgap. Alterations in spectrum and temperature where applied as well to find the effect on that relation. Decreasing temperature and airmass both resulted in an increase in optimal thickness per bandgap vise versa. Changing the spectrum has a greater effect than the temperature change.","double junction PV; Perovskite; design parameters; SMARTS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-04-29","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Today, many traits underlying two opposing ideologies persist in reminding the time when East and West Germany followed different paths. The condition of women is one of those. GDR’s socialist politics put the nation in a pioneering position in the way towards gender equality and women’s independency, particularly in their relation to work . In the context of cold war, visual arts played a prominent role in the construction and spreading of ideologies. From US Comics to Socialist Realism, artists participated in shaping the narrative of a binary world. German Democratic Republic, as a young nation part of the soviet bloc, was no exception. The reconstruction of East Germany was done under the light of artworks spreading the vision of the socialist ideal. Surfing on the thin line between pure Art and propaganda, countless creations, such as the notorious Unser Sandmännchen [Our Sandman] , influenced the way East German society pictured itself and envisioned the future. Given those two simple observations, it is worth wondering how GDR progressive politics regarding women’s condition reverberated in the artistic sphere, a key-element in the shaping of East German society. To this end, this article will be mainly investigating a unique data set. On the occasion of the ninth National Art Exhibition of the GDR, held in 1982, artists willing to participate were required to fill a standardized application form. This collection almost 3000 forms constitutes a sample of comparable primary data. The research will be based on the analysis of this data, the goal being to extract geographical, temporal, political, and social data, with a focus on gender distribution. As an authoritarian government adept of propaganda, the SED (Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands [Social Unity Party of Germany]) inevitably throws a veil of uncertainty on internal social and political studies, for the eye of the researcher . The examination of raw data will allow to outline tendencies, without having to deal with state influenced studies. This will hopefully help to achieve a higher degree of trust in the depiction of basic trends in the artistic community in the GDR. Using observation and data analysis as the driver of this research, the goal is as well to develop a contextual theory on how to deal with this data, as well as how to build reliable knowledge and investigation methodology from it.","AR2A011; Gender Equality; GDR; Data analysis; Art","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011","51.050407 13.737262"

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Zeewolde is het jongste dorp uit de Flevopolder, desalniettemin kent het een interessante geschiedenis. Lange tijd was de stichting van het dorp, vanwege teruglopende werkgelegenheid in de landbouw, onzeker. Door Zeewolde te situeren nabij het recreatiegebied aan het Wolderwijd kon zij zowel een verzorgende rol spelen voor de agrarische bevolking als voor recreanten, en was zij levensvatbaar. Inmiddels is Zeewolde een dorp met ruim 22.000 inwoners, en kan worden onderzocht hoe de veranderingen in met name de landbouw en recreatie het ontwerp hebben beïnvloed. De ontwikkeling van de IJsselmeerpolders in ogenschouw nemend kan worden vastgesteld dat er, naast het landelijke overloopbeleid ten behoeve van de Randstad, twee ontwikkelingen zijn die een grote invloed hebben gehad op het structuurplan van Zeewolde. Allereerst de vergaande mechanisatie en schaalvergroting in de landbouwsector die zich sinds het begin van de twintigste eeuw aandient en ervoor zorgt dat de werkgelegenheid en daarmee bevolkingsdichtheid op het platteland sterk afneemt. Daarnaast de opkomst van massale recreatie ten gevolge van toegenomen vrije tijd door de economische groei sinds de jaren vijftig. De twee ontwikkelingen samen hebben het neveneffect dat het platteland niet langer als locatie puur voor voedselproductie wordt gezien, maar ook kansen biedt voor onder andere recreatie. Om de nieuw ontdekte belangen mee te nemen bij de inrichting van het landschap ontstaat er langzaam maar zeker een meer integrale manier van landschapsinrichting, gebaseerd op structuurplannen. De dubbelrol die Zeewolde kent door zowel agrarische als recreatieve bevolking te verzorgen is duidelijk zichtbaar in het centrum. De buitendijks gesitueerde centrumdelen, zoals het Havenplein en de boulevard, zijn voornamelijk bedoeld voor recreatieve voorzieningen welke om seizoenspieken aan te kunnen ruimschoots aanwezig zijn. Het binnendijkse centrumdeel voorziet juist in de dagelijkse behoeften van de permanente bewoners. Deze verdeling is ook, zij het minder duidelijk, terug te zien in de eerste woonwijken rond het centrum. Waar in de Akkers bewust de sfeer van een boerenpolderdorp is nagestreefd ligt in Zeewolde Zuid de nadruk meer op de nabijheid van het Horsterwold en de jachthaven.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The Industrial Pedagogical Technicum, completed in 1978, has developed a curious status among the large-scale construction projects of the Late-Soviet period in Georgia. The dimensions of curiosity result from the fact that, until 2017, the architect was unknown to most local architects and historians, and that there are few and inconsistent drawings of the building available in the public archives. Additionally, the location of the Technicum is also disconnected from the greater city, and a sculpture which was affixed to the auditorium facade, of unknown inspiration, was the only element that could be seen through the thick vegetation. The architectural process of designing and constructing the staircase leading to the Technicum auditorium terrace was based on the urban morphologies, historic vernaculars, and the contemporary vernaculars which are the texture of the city. The design was an attempt to represent the regional heritage of the IDP residents, while adopting the local informal methods of material sourcing and construction. Traces of activity show that the terrace of the building is still in use, as a result of the access staircase, though there have been several attempts by authorities to stymie this activity. The first chapter of this paper will elaborate the ontology of the Technicum and its sculpture, and examine the contemporary Georgian social and political matrix using past correspondence with governmental entities, active non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and surveys and interviews conducted with Tbilisi residents between 2017 and 2020. The second chapter of this paper will discuss the initiatives taken at the Technicum in response to the site conditions and processes of the sculpture’s removal. Finally, the third chapter of this paper will further elaborate the context of the Technicum and sculpture’s appropriation, while discussing the processes employed in activating the auditorium terrace as a public space. The third chapter will give definition of the architectural position of the ‘vernacular appropriations of Modernist architecture’ which result in idiosyncratic and dynamic public space.","AR2A011; Appropriation; Vernacular; Tbilisi; Modernism","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

Nevertheless they are rarely applied, due to their poor manufacturability. To enhance their applicability, a topology optimization framework is proposed and verified, able to generate finite thermoelastic metamaterials with tailored unidirectional thermal expansion, manufacturable through automated multi-material additive manufacturing methods. The superelement method is utilized to optimize for finite thermoelastic unit cell arrays connected to solid strips allowing for easy mounting, instead of non-realizable infinite arrays which are optimized in existing frameworks that use the homogenization method. The robust formulation is combined with a filter domain extension approach, to obtain manufacturing tolerant, black and white solutions and minimum length scale control. Uniform material layers are enforced, to obtain layered designs manufacturable with multi-material additive manufacturing methods. Using the proposed framework, a finite thermoelastic unit cell array is optimized for near zero thermal expansion. It is validated that the superelement method is more suitable for the computation of the thermoelastic response of small unit cell arrays, compared to the commonly used homogenization method. A physical sample is manufactured and experimentally validated. Experimental validation confirms numerical predictions and shows that the proposed design approach is able to generate performant and realizable thermoelastic metamaterials.","Thermoelastic Metamaterials; Topology Optimization; Static Condensation; Robust Design; Multi-Material Additive Manufacturing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Saeid, S. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This research is intended to create an insight into the heat exchange occurring in a well and to find ideal well conditions in which the performance of the heat exchange is maximised. For demonstrating and studying these aspects the well of Grouw-01 is analysed. The well of Grouw-01 is a depleted gas well attained from Vermilion Energy and is in shut-in state. Re-using these shut-in or abandoned wells can provide fossil fuel-free energy for the local community. Such wells have the potential to be used for geothermal energy generation, either by using them to directly access warm water from a reservoir or as borehole heat exchanger, without direct connection to a potential reservoir. In this study there is no contact with the reservoir. As there is no contact, a method is created in which the injected fluid can reach the surface within the same well. This is done by creating a circulating system of a working fluid in the well in which the heat is extracted from the subsurface and carried to the surface by the working fluid. For the fluid to be able to circulate, a tubing is installed inside the well which is an inner-tubing. Such a well with circulating fluid systems is designed like a Deep Coaxial Borehole Heat Exchanger (DCBHE). The software COMSOL Multiphysics 5.4 is used for the reconstruction of the well design in 3-D. The model is based on the former gas production well Grouw-01, which has been in the shut-in phase for over 5 years. For such systems, the design conditions need to be optimized as these conditions can help increase the heat extraction. The different properties that can influence this are the type of working fluid, the material and thickness (insulation material) of an inner-tubing for fluid circulation, flowrates, outer-well size and injection temperatures. Finding an ideal design condition is the main goal. The software allowed an intense sensitivity analysis on the properties which can influence the heat extraction. The outcomes of the different sensitivity analyses show that<br/>-The heat capacity of the working fluid is critical for the amount of power that the fluid delivers. Working fluids with high heat capacity deliver a higher power output compared to the working fluids with low heat capacity. However, a working fluid with low heat capacity normally delivers a higher production temperature. -The flowrate in which the fluid circulates, has an optimum limit in which fluid cooling is minimum during upward flow and heat extraction during downward flow maximum. -Insulation material of VIT (Vacuum Insulated Tubing) is crucial for the system to function, the properties of the VIT play a prominent role in this. A material with similar thermal properties can function as a replacement for the VIT. -Increasing the thickness of the inner-tubing (VIT) delivers a higher power output. This power increase is small compared to the increase of inner-tubing thickness. -The outer-tubing has similar effects on the power output. If the size of the outer-tubing is doubled there is a small increase in power generation. -The simulated different well depths show a linear relation of the temperature, power output and depth of a well. -Injection temperature of the working fluid should remain low for higher efficiency. -Simulating a reversed working fluid cycle, in which the fluid is injected through the inner-well and produced through the outer-well can cool down the working fluid if the flowrate is low. Based on the amount of energy that the Grouw-01 well can provide to the energy requirements of households, a system of heat supply and demand is created for an economic analysis. In the economic analysis the value of the different materials, project costs and revenues from this geothermal project are analysed in three different cases. The costs involved are divided in capital costs, operational costs and a government take in the form of taxes. The results of the economic analysis showed that the project is financially viable, unless there is an increase in the OPEX or if the project load hours are drastically reduced. In this thesis, based on sensitivity studies and the literature review, an efficient DCBHE is introduced. In addition, the economics will give an insight into the financial viability of this efficient system. This thesis provides information for geothermal engineers, well engineers, researchers and whoever are interested in alternative energy methods.","Geothermal; Monowell; BHE; Co-axial; depleted reservoir; wells; re-use wells","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Petroleum Engineering and Geo-sciences","",""

Therefore, it is needed to better anticipate and prepare for or prevent disruptions from occurring. Increasing interest for the application of machine learning in supply chain (risk) management has been observed, but applicational studies are lacking. Therefore, a generalised methodology consisting of six steps is proposed to introduce and apply machine learning to provide insights in supply chain operations and predictive analytics for supply chain (risk) management. The six steps are: Data collection and exploration, Performance and metric definition, Data preparation and feature engineering, Supplier grouping and feature selection, Data pre-processing and Algorithm comparison and evaluation. The methodology is applied to a case study from Philips Magnetic Resonance and Image Guided Therapy factory with the focus on predicting delivery performance of supplier deliveries by means of classification. Experiments show that the application of the methodology led to successful model development for individual suppliers resulting in binary and multiclass classification models obtaining Matthew’s Correlation Coefficient (MCC) scores up to 0.9 accompanied with 98% accuracy, 100% precision and 83% recall and MCC scores up to 0.75 accompanied with 88% accuracy, 85% macro-precision and 80% macro-recall, respectively. Additionally, feature selection showed the possibility to assist root cause analysis to improve (internal) operations or supplier relations by identifying important characteristics relevant for observed delayed deliveries. However, noticeable differences in performance for individual suppliers is observed, indicating the need for additional research focussing on increasing overall prediction performance (in the specific case study) and therewith direct applicability in operations.","Machine Learning; Material Management; Supplier Disruptions; Supply Chain Management","en","master thesis","","","","","","ME track: Transport Engineering and Logistics (Mechanical Engineering) CIE track: Transport & Planning (Civil Engineering)","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","",""

(graduation committee); Hendriks, B.H.W. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Background Current neurosurgical visualisation systems, operating microscopes as well as exoscopic systems, display problems that make their performance suboptimal. Operating microscopes severely restrict ergonomics, occasionally leading to pain or injuries. Existing exoscope systems have diverse limitations, therefore not yet being able to completely replace the neurosurgical operating microscope. A plan was made to develop a new and improved visualisation system, tackling the problems encountered with standard operating microscopes, as well as existing exoscope systems. This will be done by developing technology that integrates three important techniques which hold the potential to improve neurosurgical outcome, i.e. surgical visualisation, navigation technology, and 3D X-ray imaging. The rising temperature in this system might cause unwanted deformations which lead to inaccuracies in the visualisation. Therefore the objective of this thesis is to firstly develop a virtual model of this system and secondly, to evaluate the thermal stability through simulations, in order to ensure that the system's accuracy is adequate despite potential deformations due to increased temperature. Hence the research question: ""Is the thermal stability of the new exoscope concept sufficient for adequate accuracy?'' Method To ensure the new visualisation system possesses all essential features required for improving and possibly replacing the current visualisation systems, its requirements are summarised. This set the foundation of the new system's design. The best concept is elaborated upon after evaluating different design concepts, meaning that different combinations of materials, frames, and mounts were designed. To evaluate which set-up best performs in regard to stability, simulations were carried out with 3D models of the concepts. These simulations were performed in COMSOL Multiphysics, a programme that can calculate heat transfer and displacement throughout the system, mapping out how susceptible the concept is to increasing temperature. Results A total of 23 simulations were carried out in COMSOL Multiphysics. The first five aimed to provide insight into important material properties, which was used in the next stage to select four different materials: anodised aluminium alloy 6061, stainless steel 304, invar, and silicon nitride. The next simulations evaluated the different combinations of frames, mounts and materials, concluding that the design made out of invar, displayed the least deformations. This selection was made based on displacements found in the zoom and the navigation lenses. These would eventually translate into a certain image shift, reducing the system's accuracy. After finding the most stable design, the absolute image shift was calculated from the displacements. The shift reached a maximum of approximately 0.10 mm for the navigation lens and 0.18 mm for the zoom lens. Conclusion Despite the increasing temperature and other possible effects as gravity, the image shift remained within acceptable limits. This means the virtual concept has thermal stability high enough to provide adequate accuracy during surgery. The new exoscope system is therefore feasible in terms of stability, meaning that the integration of the navigation and the 3D X-ray systems could be a valuable improvement to the current neurosurgical visualisation systems.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-04-21","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Recently, there has been an increasing interest in extending these methods to the statistical study of stochastic partial dierential equations. In this thesis, we are concerned with statistical inference for the linear stochastic convection-diusion equation (SCDE) driven by a stochastic forcing term that is spatially a Matern process. The approach is based on spectral methods for partial dierential equations and approximates a solution to the SCDE via a Fourier spectral decomposition. The resulting spectral processes are given by a family of uncoupled Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, for which computationally ecient statistical inference is possible based on the Kalman lter. We give veriable experimental results for all statistical problems - ltering, smoothing and parameter estimation - based on simulated data. We further derive a novel weak solution to the SCDE driven by spatial Matern noise for spatially periodic boundary conditions and show that the solution is indeed approximated by the Fourier spectral decomposition, thereby validating the statistical model. For the heat equation, we generalize the spectral ltering approach on compact Riemannian manifolds. Experimental results for this generalization are given on the two-dimensional unit sphere.","SPDEs; Bayesian Filtering; Spectral Methods; Convection-Diffusion Equation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

Its aim is to provide appropriate tools that can be used to compare the performance of the two structures in terms of loading and overtopping. To this end, small scaled experiments of the two structures are carried in a flume with a flat bottom. These are performed in intermediate water depths and consist of different combinations of wave height and wave steepness. A box is positioned behind the superstructures to collect overtopping volumes. Pressure signals are retrieved from pressure sensors positioned on the surface of the crownwall and the vertical wall, while water elevation signals are retrieved from wave gauges in the flume and in the overtopping box. Several analyses are performed in order to retrieve results of individual waves regarding the wave characteristics, reflection coefficient, overtopping volume, maximum pressure, impulse, impulse duration, maximum force, force angle and point of application of the force. The effectiveness of the crownwall in reducing overtopping volumes is found to decrease for more severe wave attacks with larger wave height and wave length. The lowest loading cases result in a quasi-static pressure signal which has approximately the same maximum value for both structures. More severe wave attacks generate impacts at the seaward top outer edge of the crownwall, which result in an increase of maximum pressure up to 1100%. For these cases, impulses are calculated and the results are found to be less uncertain compared to maximum pressure, while their duration shortens for higher and longer waves. The variables describing force are retrieved by integrating the pressure signals on the surface of the superstructures and the results of maximum force are found to follow a similar trend to these of maximum pressure. Corresponding equations from curve fitting are derived for each of the mentioned variables regarding the crownwall. In lack of design overtopping formulas for regular waves, an equation is derived for the prediction of overtopping for the vertical wall in order to allow comparison between the two shapes. The formula of Goda is evaluated for the case of the vertical wall and is found to accurately predict pressure at still water level, while it underestimates pressure at higher positions. Nevertheless, using this formula to estimate loading on a vertical wall is suggested due to its range of applicability and high accuracy at still water level. These equations can serve as a tool to compare solutions of a crownwall and a vertical wall, and assess which of the two is the optimal solution.","crownwall; breakwater; pressure; overtopping; curved","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Concrete Structures","",""

The mobility hub is a place where multiple modalities come together, including public transport and shared mobility. As the mobility hub is a relatively new innovation, limited research is available on the topic, especially on finding potentially suitable locations for a mobility hub. In this research, the knowledge gap on the potential of locations for a mobility hub is addressed by developing a globally applicable methodology to determine the potential of locations for a specific mobility hub type: the regional mobility hub. The regional mobility hub is located outside of the city center, and for this type of hub, an area potential determination methodology has the highest added value. The developed methodology is a combination of the GIS-Multi-Criteria Analysis and Multi-Actor Multi-Criteria Analysis available in the literature, leading to all areas in the region being evaluated for their regional mobility hub potential, taking the end user, operator and government perspective into account. The result is presented in multiple heat maps based on scenarios with varying stakeholder influences. The methodology consists of 5 criteria (Potential demand, Costs, Generalized travel costs, Link to surroundings and Impact) measured by 9 attributes to incorporate all relevant influential factors found in the literature. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used to determine the criteria weights. The developed methodology is applied to the region of Rotterdam, to find out whether the methodology works as expected. From multiple analyzes, it appears that the methodology is suitable for tackling the location potential determination problem, as it works logically. In future research, the focus should be on extending the methodology to incorporate freight transportation. Besides, the methodology can be improved by incorporating revealed preferences of shared mobility users.

Disambiguation rules filter out certain parse trees, making a grammar less ambiguous. Giving a formal semantics for these disambiguation rules is still an ongoing research topic. In this thesis we verify an existing semantics for these rules by Souza Amorim and Visser (2019) for a subset of expression grammars. These grammars may contain infix, prefix, and postfix expressions. We verify the semantics by proving that it is both safe and complete. Safety states adding disambiguation rules will not change the underlying language of the grammar, meaning each sentence in the language will have at least one valid parse tree that does not get filtered out. Completeness guarantees that a grammar is unambiguous, meaning that each sentence in the language will have at most one valid parse tree that does not get filtered out.

This study aims to determine how architects have worked within the restrictions present in East Jerusalem. Specifically, it investigates how architects have redefined their profession and went outside of the traditional boundaries in exercising their profession. To answer the question of how architects practise their profession in area of conflict, a research has been conducted into the roles of various Israeli and \ Palestinian architects. The research focussed on both their public standpoints regarding the conflict and their impact on the built environment of East Jerusalem. The result of the research has showed that architects have created new roles for themselves in which their are able to use their architectural traits to influence the design of the city by different means. They use their connection to the conflict as instigators in their fight to, once again, play an important role in shaping the city. Furthermore architects have expressed their architectural ideas through other forms that the traditional physical means. These results suggest that the architectural profession has the potential to influence much more than just the built environment. By exercising their profession in combination with other disciplines the architect is able to create architectural work that goes beyond the building or even the city. Their newly created roles have the ability to redirect the future course of the conflict, by forming public debate and removing restrictions for future architects. Their connections to other disciplines and broad use of expressing their work has turned them from single instances into architectural typologies. They can be seen as a proposition for future architects working within East Jerusalem.","AR2A011; Archetypes; Architectural profession; Positioning; East Jerusalem; Conflict","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011","31.78336,35.23388"

(mentor); Spaargaren, Gerben (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Implementation of nature-based solutions (NBS) in flood defenses is hindered by a lack of probabilistic tools and design guidelines that can be used to assess spatial and temporal variability in these biophysical systems. It is well established that nature-based elements, such as vegetation, attenuate waves, capture sediment, strengthen the subsoil and invoke numerous ecological benefits. This thesis proposes a conceptual framework to design and assess hybrid flood defense (HFD) systems within the context of current Dutch design guidelines: `wettelijk beoordelings instrumentarium' (WBI). The framework builds a dynamic probabilistic tool (DPT) to assess the effect of temporal variability of NBS elements on wave loading. The framework was applied in a case study at Hellegatpolder to investigate temporal effects of nature-based elements on nearshore wave heights during storm conditions. Data was collected specifically for the idealized HFD system at Hellegatpolder. Vegetation and nearshore wave height data was unavailable and therefore, an autocorrelation function was developed to sample temporal vegetation data. A numerical XBeach model was constructed to model nearshore wave heights for a bare and vegetated foreshore, resulting in a uniform database. Development of a static and dynamic Bayesian network allowed dynamic probabilistic modelling of nearshore wave heights. Application-specific model settings combine normative hydraulic storm data with the database and probabilistic models. The developed DPT was applied to model nearshore wave heights for a bare and vegetated transect for each vegetative season.Numerical modelling using XBeach was applied to model 7 years of data with a temporal resolution of 30 minutes for both bare and vegetated foreshore scenarios. The numerical results conclude that vegetation at Hellegatpolder attenuates waves with an average of 54%, where wave attenuation was 1.7 times greater in July compared to December. The effect of bathymetry morphology on nearshore wave height was found insignificant for short time scales.A static Bayesian network (SBN) was built to model nearshore wave heights in a fixed point in time. The validated SBN was able to model nearshore wave heights with 90% accuracy. A dynamic Bayesian network (DBN), was created to model offshore hydraulic parameters time series. DBN achieved an accuracy of &gt;85% for short time scales (&lt;25 hours). Utilizing the DBN for long term modelling resulted in progression towards the mean value of the marginal distributions. Statistical validation of both models rejected the representation of the dependence structure using only a Gaussian copula.Application settings were defined in MATLAB to manipulate the database, probabilistic models and normative hydraulic storm conditions. The configured DPT was run to model nearshore wave heights for a bare and vegetated foreshore specifically at Hellegatpolder. During storm conditions average wave attenuation due to vegetation was 45%. Average wave attenuation results were thus lower than those available in the numerical dataset (54%). Moreover, wave attenuation was 3 times greater in summer compared to winter months. Furthermore, the DPT resulted in dynamic wave loading (i.e. varying through time) compared to the static WBI loading conditions. Resulting DPT wave heights were 82% lower during winter months than the normative loading defined by the WBI.These results show the effect of variability on wave attenuation. The percentages and factors are expected to differ for other locations. Nevertheless, the obtained results clearly illustrate the significance of temporal modelling of HFD systems. The method presents a novel conceptual framework to include the effects of NBS elements in the design and assessment of flood defenses. The conceptual framework, numerical and probabilistic models can be applied for other HFD systems, enabling engineers to assess flood defenses more realistically - a critical step in the implementation of NBS in design guidelines.","Bayesian Networks; Dynamic Bayesian Networks; Flood Risk; Temporal; Probabilistic modelling; XBeach; Guidelines; Hybrid Flood Defense; Nature Based Solutions; NBS; HFD; DBN; BN; Temporal Modelling; Dynamic Probabilistic Tool; DPT; Flood Risk Prediction; WBI","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Purification protocols address the need for higher fidelity states than what can be directly prepared. These protocols consume several noisy input states and return an output state of higher fidelity, succeeding probabilistically. We introduce a recurrence based purification protocol for two-colorable graph states on $d$-dimensional quantum systems (qudits). We analyze the performance of the protocol in terms of the minimal required fidelity of input states as well as the expected number of attempts required to successfully reach a specific target fidelity. We find that not only is the purification regime larger for states of greater qudit dimension, but the expected number of attempts to successfully purify a state may be orders of magnitude lower. We develop error thresholds for the protocol with faulty two-qudit operations using a general uncorrelated error model and study the dependence on system dimension and state node number. We observe that the gate error threshold of the protocol improves with increasing dimension and moreover that the threshold depends on the degree of the graph but is otherwise independent of the number of nodes. The qualitative behaviour of the error threshold is captured by an analytically solvable model in which a restricted class of errors is considered. The error thresholds determined here may serve as one benchmark of assessing whether future experimental implementations of two qudit operations function well enough to realize a practical advantage of replacing qubit with qudit states in a multi-partite quantum information protocol.","quantum information; quantum network; purification; qudit","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

In many practical scenarios however, their applicability is still limited, mainly due to insufficient speed and efficiency. On the other hand, robots that use wheeled locomotion are fast and efficient, but are generally confined to flat or prepared surfaces. A relatively new approach, to use the advantages of both forms, is the combination of walking and driving technology into Hybrid Walker-Wheeler technology. In this research we will explore the feasibility of applying Hybrid Walker-Wheeler technology to the Zesbenige Robot (ZebRo). ZebRo is a small walking robot with six One-Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) legs and walks with an insect-inspired gait. It is being developed with the intention to go on a mission to the moon. The objective in this thesis is to increase the speed and energy efficiency of the ZebRo on flat surfaces, while maintaining its robustness and walking capability on rough terrain. We will set up the criteria for a new design, explore various options and parameters and choose a concept. We will then do a number of simulations to analyse the properties of a wheel and a leg and to apply these in the design. The final prototype consists of a single module with a wheel, a one-DoF leg and a custom-design coupling which switches torque, from the motor, between the wheel-axle and the leg-axle. This prototype was tested and evaluated on its electrical power consumption and the torque and speed transmitted to the leg-axle and wheel-axle. From these results, we were able to draw a number of conclusions and make recommendations for a ZebRo equipped with Hybrid Walker-Wheeler technology.","zebro; Hybrid Walking Driving; driving simulation; walking simulation; Coupling Mechanism; autonomous robot","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","Intelligent echanical Systems",""

To safely and reliably carry out these tasks and navigate to its objective, especially in complex and cluttered environments, the MAV is also required to sense and avoid (S&amp;A) obstacles. Due to the MAVs limitations in weight, power and processing power, vision systems usually prove ideal for sensing the environment, being a cheap, lightweight, power efficient and a rich source of information. They do however require adequate computational resources and most importantly, good visibility. When the environment does not host these conditions, for instance when flying though dust, smoke or fog, other sensors need to be utilised that can provide more robust sensing to ensure safe and reliable operation. Radar sensors are mostly unaffected by atmospheric conditions and have been used extensively in the aerospace industry for this purpose. These sensors were traditionally heavy and power hungry, only applicable on ground or in large craft. However other radar sensors have since come about that are more suited for use in small MAVs. Specifically, lightweight, power efficient and compact frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radars have increasingly been used in advanced driver assistance systems as auxiliary sensors, however there has been little work to integrate them on MAVs. This sensor provides the range, horizontal bearing and radial velocity (Doppler shift) of any objects in the field of view, which can then be used for multi-target tracking (MTT) [38]. The major disadvantage of the sensor is the limited field of view (approximately 80 degrees horizontal) and noisy nature of the sensor, especially in cluttered environments. The challenge is to explore filtering, tracking and avoidance algorithm pipelines to extract meaningful information from the raw data and investigate the sensor’s effectiveness with respect to obstacle avoidance on MAVs. This will include algorithms such as data association, estimation and avoidance, as well as an investigation of neural networks to aid in processing the raw data and provide some filtering. This will be accomplished by integrating the sensor on a MAV and testing and tuning the algorithms both in real life (in the cyberzoo flying arena of the aerospace faculty), and using data gathered as part of an obstacle detection and avoidance dataset that was generated during this project. This will hopefully allow MAVs to operate safer, either using a standalone radar or integrated with other sensors.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The desired wall controller property of a metamaterial to suppress TS waves is evaluated. This study shows that TS wave attenuation is achieved if the wall-normal velocity from a metamaterial is in-phase with the TS wave pressure. TS wave amplification is obtained if the pressure and velocity are more than (approximately) 90 degrees out of phase. The p-v phase relation corresponding to a Helmholtz resonator only remains in the amplification regime. Therefore, the conclusion is drawn that a single Helmholtz resonator can only amplify TS waves.

Therefore, municipal and industrial wastewater streams need to be treated before their disposal in the environment. Currently used biological and physical-chemical treatment methods have drawbacks such as high greenhouse gas emissions, high energy use and high use of chemicals. This research used bipolar membrane electrodialysis (BPMED) as a technology for the removal of ammonium sulfate from industrial wastewaters with extreme characteristics. The industrial stripper/scrubber system removing nitrogen from industrial waters creates an ammonium sulfate rich water stream with a pH of 2, a temperature of 70 degrees Celsius and concentrations up to 250 g/L. The study investigated the influence of a low pH, high concentration and high temperature on the removal of ammonium and sulfate from wastewater and in situ generation of sulfuric acid and production of ammonium hydroxide. Key performance parameters to measure the influence of these extreme conditions were the efficiency of nitrogen removal in the form of ammonium current efficiency and ammonium removal efficiency}) and sulfate removal removal efficiency. Other key performance parameters of interest were the consumed energy for this removal in the form of electrochemical energy consumption, the purity of the generated acid and base and the final ammonium concentration in the base and the sulfate concentration in the acid. Model wastewater with a pH between 2 and 10, a concentration between 50 - 250 g/L ammonium sulfate and with a temperature between 20 degrees Celsius and 40 degrees Celsius was treated with BPMED. The influence of pH, concentration and temperature was researched independently in experiments of 180 minutes, after which the removal efficiency and the quality of the produced acid and base were assessed.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-04-23","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

In this research we focus on UAM services such as those provided by Uber Elevate. We therefore present a framework to solve the Urban Air Mobility Problem with Time Windows (UAMP-TW) under dynamic demand, using an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) algorithm. The objective of this study is to maximize the operational profit and consider customer satisfaction. Satisfaction is measured by two factors: (1) deviation from desired departure time to actual departure time and (2) deviation from nominal trip duration to actual trip duration. In our analysis we aim to determine a relationship between customers and their contribution towards profit. We address this by running simulation instances that cover three operational scenarios: a morning and evening commuter transportation case (scenarios 1 and 2) and the an occurrence of an event at a specific location (scenario 3). Multiple simulation runs indicated stability, for all three instances, due to low variation of the profit from the mean. A sensitivity analysis on the customers' time-window lengths, satisfaction factors and types concluded that customers with higher time-window lengths are more profitable since it is easier to share-rides with other users. The analysis also showed that when the satisfaction factors have a higher weight in the deviation from the departure time than the trip duration, the overall customer satisfaction is increased together with the profit and the percentage of customers who share rides. Scenario 1 has a higher rate of rebalancing empty vehicles because most requests are generated in the suburbs while the depot is located downtown. This leads to a lower vehicle deployment. In scenarios 2 and 3, most requests are generated downtown and thus more vehicles are deployed. Under dynamic demand, the algorithm has an acceptance rate of new requests of about 90% while a penalty is given to customers who cancel a ride. Analysis showed that customers are rejected if an empty vehicle has to rebalance to their location unless they are premium. In terms of the computational efficiency the algorithm is able to handle between 40-50 requests simultaneously.","Adaptive large neighborhood search; optimization; Ride Sharing; Urban Air Mobility; metaheuristics; Dynamic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Air Transport and Operations","",""

Modeling methods: two modeling methods have been developed. One of these methods involves the implementation of discrete fibres in a relatively compliant material matrix while the other method involves an anisotropic hyperelastic material model developed by Holzapfel et al. (HGO model). The adhesional and frictional behaviour of an epithelial cell is evaluated for the contact forces at the interface between the adhesive pads and the interface. These forces are dependent on the tree frog behaviour, which consists of proximal pulling on the limbs and adjustments in the body posture and the position of the limbs. Modeling results: a higher fibre density and fibre-matrix bonding is found to increase adhesive performance. An increase in the fibre-matrix stiffness ratio is found to be beneficial for adhesional performance, while an optimum value for this ratio is found for the frictional performance. The modeling results show that the proximal pulling on the limbs by the tree frog without positional adjustment has no significant effect on the adhesive and frictional performance. An adjustment in the body posture and the position of the limbs, however, is found to significantly increase the adhesive and frictional performance. Experimental methods: samples that mimic the tree frog epithelial composite structure are fabricated. These samples consist of a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) material matrix in which acrylonitril-butadieen-styreen (ABS) fibres are embedded. Experiments are performed to measure the frictional and adhesive performance of these samples. The experimental results are used to confirm the modelled results on the influence of the fibre-matrix stiffness ratio and the fibre density. Experimental results: for adhesion, the model results are in agreement with the experimental results.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This project started with the following assignment: redesign the Adria Action caravan to fit in a circular economy and to have less CO2 emissions. However, the outcome of this project is not a redesign of a caravan but a framework for Adria to work towards (partial) circular As an example of the functioning of this framework, a redesign of the bathroom floor was done.To get to know the particular caravan and the caravan industry an analysis of the context was conducted. An eco-analysis on material basis of the Action caravan was done and visits to experts in the industry, repairmen and a caravan recycling company, were made. The main conclusions from the analysis were that the structural body has the most value, both economically as environmentally, and therefore needs to be used for a longer time. There already is an effort made but it is complicated due to components that are hard to repair and due to a lack of support and instructions and availability of spare parts. In the caravan industry and this company there is also little standardization which means there are a lot of unique parts. This makes it hard to find fitting components and to reuse perfectly good components in other vehicles. The successful business of repair and recycling companies shows that there is value after the sale of the caravan but it is made unnecessary complex to retain this value by the organization of the caravan companies.The framework shows that designing caravans for a circular economy involves more aspects than just redesigning the individual parts for reuse, repair and recycling possibilities. There are different levels on which actions can take place and to become completely circular, these levels must work together. First, analytical capabilities, such as LCA and hot spot mapping, are needed to assess the current condition of the caravans and evaluate improvements. To do this, a different way of documenting will be required within Adria. Next, with this objective way of assessing the caravan, focus points can be found and components can be redesigned using the circular economy ideals. Those adjustments can then again be evaluated.One of the focus points found is the bathroom floor. It is a critical part because it protects the frame from moisture, the bathroom is not functional without the floor and it is very difficult to disassemble and reassemble the floor. At the moment, the floor is being repaired with polyurethane, which restores the value of the caravan at that time, but the repair makes the component non-recyclable and therefore no longer part of the circular economy. It is more sustainable to replace the tray as a whole. So when redesigning the tray, it was looked at how this can be done easier. It requires minor adjustments to the part and larger adjustments at a company level. On a company level, some variables should be agreed on as a fixed standard. This makes future designs backward compatible and therefore makes it easy and cost-efficient to produce an extra part when a customer orders it, enabling the replacement of the tray.","Circular Economy; Caravans; Design Framework; Repair","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-04-23","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

In this thesis, the designer combined a design approach called Value Sensitive Design with the list of requirements methodology taught at Industrial Design Engineering. This resulted in a new methodology that allowed the designer to develop a concrete list of requirements and wishes for improving well-being through design. To establish this list of requirements, the design student performed a detailed literature review on positive psychology, behavioural economics and digital parenting literature. In addition to this, he interviewed both parents and children to empathise with their world views. Lastly, he performed a market analysis to understand how the context and available resources could affect Unpluq’s capacity to take up a role in this new market. Based on this research, the answer found is that improving digital well-being in the family life requires the design of a choice architecture that helps parents and children take more conscious control of their time and attention (both transactional values). Doing so should allow them to spend these transactional values on activities that align with things they intrinsically value. This choice architecture should help rearrange actors, artefacts, and stimuli within the family home environment so that time is less easily spent without intentional consent. Based on this list of requirements, the design student initiated a design process to translate these insights into a physical design concept that Unpluq could bring to the market to help families rearrange this choice architecture. This design process was executed by iteratively evaluating design concepts with both the client, potential end-users, experts, and professionals from different psychology and pedagogics fields. In the end, the designer delivered a concept that stimulates reflective thinking about what users find intrinsically valuable and provides tips, tools and challenges that push them to try and change habits. This is done by focusing on conversations that help raise awareness of the critical issues and stimulating the iterative goal setting that the family should engage in to start solving these issues for themselves. The way that time can and should be allocated for intrinsically valued activities was so unique for each individual and family that it is hard to find one solution to help everyone. Therefore, the core insight of this project for Unpluq is that if they would be interested in entering this market, their focus should be on helping families reimagine the way they use their environments within their own family homes. This should be done both individually and together through reflection and iteration and supported in that journey by scientific and expert information.","Digital Well-being; Positive Psychology; Behavioural Economics; Start-up; Parenting; Value-Sensitive Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://unpluq.com/graduation-niels/ Presentation webpage","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

This is in contrast to current black-box modelling approaches. These black-box modelling approaches result in models where the variables and parameters have no economic interpretation. Companies who develop macroeconomic scenario models such as Ortec Finance, have identified this as a major limitation. In this thesis, an economic-engineering approach is taken. Engineers use the laws of physics to develop grey-box models. Economic-engineering theory is based on the analogies between the dynamics of economic phenomena on the one hand and mechanical phenomena on the other hand. By applying these analogues, a structural method is developed that translates the National accounting and the circular flow theory of macroeconomics into the laws of physics and engineering concepts. The engineering approach leads to three main contribution: 1) A bond graph model for the United States economy. 2) A linear time-invariant state-space model derived from the bond graph model to perform time domain analysis and 3) The Laplace transformation of the model to perform valuation and analysis in the frequency domain.

However, the growth could be obstructed by the difficulties of scaling up production of developed prototypes. Most OoC prototypes are not suited for mass production because of the material used, namely polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). In this thesis a roadmap for the OoC prototyping process is proposed, which can be carried out in small labs without expensive equipment, and which can be directly scaled up to mass production. In the proposed roadmap the polymer cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) is used instead of PDMS. Expensive etching processes typically used to fabricate a mold are replaced by stereolithography printing and soft lithography. The final parts of the chip are soft embossed and for assembly thermal fusion bonding is suggested. These steps require relatively simple equipment, namely a stereolithography printer, a spin coater, a fume hood, and basic lab ware. Next to that, a press for embossing and bonding is required. Such a press is designed, fabricated, calibrated, and tested in this thesis. The press enables embossing and bonding experiments with high repeatability on a simple desktop and can be fabricated in roughly 2 - 3 days in a workshop with standard materials costing no more than € 250,-. Temperature of the compression platens can be controlled within 0.25oC precise up to 180oC. Compression forces up to 3.5 kN can be applied and an accuracy of ±32 N and ±80 N for forces up to respectively 1.3 kN and 2.0 kN can be reached. The performance of the press is tested by carrying out embossing experiments, which yielded replication accuracies comparable with literature for channels of 170 µm deep and 1 mm wide. Next to that, a protocol is produced for spin coating COC films with controllable thickness between 7.5 and 14 µm on top of a COC substrate.","BBB-on-Chip; Organ-on-Chip; Microfluidics; Spin coating; Soft Embossing; Prototyping; Heated press; TOPAS; COC; PDMS; PID control; Temperature Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Micro and Nano Engineering","",""

Although often effective, not all patients have sufficient pain reduction after implantation. Objective: Analyse the acute effects of tonic and burst SCS on spectral features in the whole brain and in specific brain regions using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Methods: Resting state MEG recordings of seventeen patients with SCS set to a cyclic stimulation program were analysed. Spectral analysis was done by computing power spectrum densities and calculating the ratio between different frequency bands. Time frequency decompositions were then computed to image the spectral changes over time. Results: I showed a shift of power to the 7-10 Hz range during tonic and burst stimulation ON, and that burst stimulation modulated the regions involved in the medial pathway more than tonic stimulation did. I also hypothesised that burst stimulation has a lingering effect on the neuronal activity after it is switched OFF. Lastly, I showed that alpha power decreased at the moment the stimulation switched ON or OFF. Conclusion: Although most findings were not statistically significant, the results were similar to the results of studies with patients who had longer exposure to SCS. There is still room for improvement in SCS treatment, and MEG analysis of acute modulation can help to gain more insight in its working mechanisms.","Magnetoencephalography; Spinal cord stimulation; Chronic pain","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Technical Medicine","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The Dutch heating transition involves changing the heating systems of eight million buildings to a sustainable alternative by 2050. Many heating system technologies are available, but deciding which systems are cheapest for all these buildings is a difficult question to answer. Local policymakers are increasingly making use of heating transition models that estimate the feasibility and costs of systems in municipal neighbourhoods. The applicability of these models is limited by the degree of uncertainty about the future as well as the complexity in communicating the model results to policymakers. Sensitivity Analysis (SA) is a tool with which the most influential model uncertainties can be identified, quantified and communicated. So far, limited energy transition model studies have extensively used this method. A case study of SA on the CEGOIA heating transition model was performed to fill this gap and evaluate SA’s value. CEGOIA calculates the costs of a variety of heating systems and optimizes the allocation of scarce energy carriers such as green gas and hydrogen to find the lowest societal costs. Sensitivities of eight heating system options were analysed in different archetypical neighbourhood contexts using Fractional Factorial analysis, the Method of Morris and the Sobol’ Method. Out of an initial set of 953 parameters, a subset of less than a dozen highly influential variables – consistent between neighbourhoods of different physical characteristics – was identified for each heating system option. High sensitivities indicate that changing the value of a parameter leads to a large change in total costs. These sets, therefore, describe exactly what uncertainties are crucial to evaluating what heating system is the cheapest possible solution. Variables in these sets include, but are not limited to, the price and infrastructure costs of electricity and gas, heating installation costs and insulation costs. Interviews with other heating transition model owners further illustrated that the use of systematic SA as done in this analysis is not the norm. Besides results and insights from the CEGOIA SA, further applications for SA in heating transition modelling is postulated to be able to improve the modelling process, as well as better, understand complex model dynamics. One recommendation is, therefore, to include SA as part of the toolkit for the large heating transition models currently being used in the Netherlands. The main barrier for doing so with CEGOIA is the computational time of the model, which limited the number of parameters that could be evaluated as well as the SA techniques that could be used. Still, a more systematic analysis of sensitivities in heating transition models will provide insights that ultimately aid Dutch policymakers in making robust decisions.","Sensitivity Analysis; Heating transition modelling; Model uncertainty; CEGOIA; Method of Morris; Sobol' Method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

The elbow external valgus torque is assumed to be indicative for the applied load on the UCL. This study investigated the maximum external valgus and extension torque and their corresponding load variability during a baseball pitch and the relationship between the magnitude and the within-pitcher load variability of these elbow torques. Furthermore, this study investigated to what extend the elbow torques and the ball speed are related. Eleven Dutch AAA pitchers each threw 25 fastballs. The motion was captured with an optical motion capture system. The ball speed was measured with a radar gun. The data of the upper body, in particular the elbow torques, were analysed using a custom-made 3D inverse dynamics model. The results show that the within-pitcher load variability differs among pitchers. A higher applied elbow torque compared to other pitchers indicates a higher within-pitcher variability. From these results, both a higher valgus torque and a higher within-pitcher load variability are expected to lead to higher injury risk. It is advised not to take one pitch per pitcher into account since it cannot represent all the pitches, especially if only the fastest is selected. Among the pitchers, ball speed is found not to be a good indicator for the elbow torques. Within a pitcher, the ball speed serves better as an indicator. This study emphasises the importance of analysing each pitcher’s results individually instead of comparing them to the whole group.","UCL; Baseball; Variability; Within-pitcher load variability; Elbow; Injury; Pitching; Ball speed","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-04-23","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Sleepers exists in their current form for a long time. The transition from wood to concrete sleeper has been made, but wood is still used and present in many track sections. As creosoted wooden sleepers are not allowed to be installed on the tracks anymore the search for durable and sustainable alternatives has started. One promising type is a hybrid sleeper constructed from recycled plastic (polyethylene) with steel reinforcement. The main part of this thesis is to create a finite element model that is capable of describing hybrid plastic sleepers. The ultimate goal is to be able to use this model to assist in sleeper acceptation. Current rules, regulations and high availability requirements make it difficult to test sleepers in the track under live loading conditions. Not many infrastructure managers are eager to install not already proven technology in their tracks. The general parameters of the model were investigated and combined with some specific finite element modelling methods. Those formed the starting point of the design. Important design methods were the parametrisation of the model as much as possible to allow assessment of slightly different models. Secondly a mapped mesh was preferred above a free mesh to improve on accuracy. Also the amount of detail is kept high to be able to fully investigate the sleepers, e.g. to investigate the reinforcement bond. The ANSYS APDL-language is used to program the FEM parametrically. This resulted in a comprehensive finite element model of one a whole sleeper. Fully modelled with base plate (without detailed fastening), rail pad and rail section. Every part is constructed out of solids and meshed with a mapped mesh including the reinforcement. Two model methods, a general circular and a more element wise optimal octagonal model, were used to generate the reinforcement. All single sleeper models can be connected to form a piece of track with several possibilities in altering the foundation parameters per sleeper or allowing for different types of sleepers inside the track. Concluding all generated finite element analysis (FEA) results could not impress enough to recommend the usage of FEA for sleeper acceptation. Especially with new, very non-linear behaving materials and a very dynamic loads, the effort involved in creating a validated finite element model (FEM) would be too great and the results not usable enough. For some parts a FEM can be beneficial, during design for example. Other simpler models than the one constructed here could be helpful if directly based on test results. But at least at this point in time, with relatively unknown materials, the direct testing of sleepers under loading conditions laboratory and in the track itself with close monitoring are regarded much more informative.","Railway; Sleepers; Hybrid railway sleeper; FEM modelling; ANSYS APDL","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://github.com/agriemink/AnsysSleeperModel.git Repository link Project repository with the ANSYS APDL files.","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","",""

Our framework overcomes the problem of catastrophic forgetting across episodes by selectively slowing down learning of important neurons and by rehearsing a small set of examples of constant length.

Voltage source converters are extensively utilized to interconnect renewable energy sources at various transmission levels, facilitate the asynchronous interconnection of system areas through HVDC links and enable the installment of responsive demand units into the grid. The latter increase of power electronic interfaced units in the power system has significantly altered its dynamic behavior as the system is characterized by low inertia conditions, fast and more frequent dynamics, lack of inertial response, limited short circuit capability and uncertain generation and demand mixes. Under these new operating conditions one of the main concerns of TSOs is the ability of the system to withstand active power-frequency imbalances. To cope with the frequency stability issues encountered, power electronic interfaced elements introduced, can be effectively utilized to offer ancillary services such as fast frequency support to the grid due to the high controllability levels and the rapid response capability they exhibit. This thesis project deals with the optimization of the frequency response of a multi-area, multi-energy hybrid HVAC-HVDC power system when common active power-frequency disturbances occur. The system analyzed consists of 3 electromagnetically decoupled areas through MMC-HVDC interconnection links with different generation and demand mixes characterized by different inertia levels due to the integration of fully decoupled wind turbines type IV and proton exchange membrane electrolyzers. The controllers of the power electronic interfaced elements have been modified with the active power gradient control scheme to provide fast frequency support in case of commonly occurred active power-frequency imbalances. However, to avoid insufficient or over regulation of the systems’ frequency when multiple elements target the same variable, a coordinated tuning strategy is more than necessary. For this reason, in this study two different problem formulations have been proposed aiming at a coordinated tuning of the parameters of the frequency controllers of the synthetic inertia elements participating in the frequency regulation. To effectively solve the optimization problem and enhance the frequency stability of the system a powerful metaheuristic optimization algorithm, the mean variance mapping optimization algorithm has been used. The optimization results can effectively highlight the tuning strategy that achieves the best frequency response of the system under various commonly occurred active power-frequency disturbances and provide further insight on the proper utilization of various synthetic inertia sources with respect to their response capabilities and location.","Fast active power-frequency response; Mean Variance Mapping Optimization (MVMO); MMC-HVDC Transmission; Wind Turbine Type IV; PEM electrolyzers; Optimization; Tuning; Frequency stability; Active Power Gradient; Multi-Energy System; Power System Stability; PowerFactory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-04-30","","","","Electrical Engineering | Electrical Power Engineering","",""

Despite extensive previous research on the cost of rework, and constructability, the underlying mechanisms within executed projects in the Netherlands have not yet been observed from research. Notwithstanding the thorough previous research, indicates a need to identify the prevailing underlying mechanisms. This research addresses the following main question: What are underlying mechanisms for managing cost of rework related to constructability in Dutch marine infrastructure projects? The known underlying mechanisms for managing the cost of rework related to constructability were derived from the literature. These mechanisms were verified and extended through exploratory semi- structured interviews. The interviewees were senior experts from a client company, a design and engineering firm, and a contractor. Besides, the applied and unapplied mechanisms in Dutch marine infrastructure projects were observed from two case studies. The case studies included further semi- structured interview sessions. The findings from the three sources introduced themes regarding the mechanisms for constructability inclusion. The themes included a set of related mechanisms, which addressed the main research question. The inclusion and application of these themes in the project could minimise the cost of rework related to constructability in Dutch marine infrastructure projects. The most pertinent themes caused the changes and rework observed in the case studies and are indicated as manageable by the design and engineering firm. The identified themes were as follows: 1) extensive transfer, verification, handover, and control of knowledge, documents, models, requirements, needs, and products, 2) inclusion of experienced expertise or knowlegde (early) in the process, and 3) stick to the plan and process by all stakeholders after awarding. Limitation of the research were only two case studies, digital interview sessions, and missing quantification of the mechanisms' contributions and relevance. Some interesting results from this study were the unwillingness to learn, improve, and share previous insights and experiences of person in the Dutch marine infrastructure sector. The diverse perspectives, current market developments of the project approach and contracting, and the human contribution and obstruction were additional findings of this research.

Recommendations for further research are 1) to test the validity and causes of the newly identified mechanisms; 2) to identify individual contributions and obstructions to the project, and 3) to quantify the effect of the mechanisms on scope, time, money, quality, personal health, and safety.","Constructability; Cost of Rework; Mechanisms; Design and Engineering firm","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

The applications of ML cover a wide range of disciplines, including the natural sciences. Presently, the field of catalysis is still relatively unexposed to ML and other data-driven techniques. This can largely be attributed to the broad variety and complexity of catalytic data, which obstructs data unification into large structured databases. This is problematic because ML requires large amounts of information rich data to ensure its effectiveness. Additionally, applying ML techniques requires expertise and often coding experience. These requisites impede the adoption of ML by catalysis researchers, that are not necessarily programming experts. In this thesis a data management and analytics platform is developed to reduce this inaccessibility barrier. Our platform is designed to guide catalysis researchers through the ML workflow, and construct effective ML models. Throughout this process the platform supports several key functionalities, which include interaction with a database instance, data visualization, ML model construction, and ML model application. Furthermore, the usefulness of our platform is demonstrated in a case study, where ML models are built to predict the catalytic performance based on molecular descriptors of the catalyst. Due to a lack of suitable existing catalytic datasets, we construct and use an artificial dataset that mimics kinetic catalytic data. Artificially constructing the data allows us full control of its underlying mechanisms. This aspect is used to build dataset variations where we study the effect of database size and descriptor strength on the performance of ML models. The results of the case study quantify the effects of database size and descriptor strength, which are useful in identifying the objectives for future construction of databases from real catalytic data.","catalysis; analytics; platform; database; machine learning; AutoML; catalysis informatics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Chemical Engineering","",""

How far inland salt intrusion reaches is dependent on a balance of buoyancy forcing, water depth, discharge of the canal and the amount of mixing. Wind, bottom roughness, and sailing ships contribute to mixing. Currently, little is known about the contribution aof the latter to mixing. It is important to better understand the role of ship traffic in order to make more accurate models and take the right measures to protect the fresh water supply function of inland waterways. The flow field in an unstratified canal has been well studied, however, little is known about the effects that ships have in a stratified canal. Ships move water when sailing through a waterway. This induces three water movements: primary and secondary waves and the propeller jet flow. These processes can contribute to mixing by shear instabilities and internal wave breaking.A sailing ship in a stratified canal has been modelled using a moving grid approach in the 3D non-hydrostatic finite element model FinLab to study these effects in detail. The propeller has been neglected to simplify the model. A parameter study has been performed to observe the influence of several parameters (such as the canal blockage, internal Froude number, and canal bank slope) on the flow pattern and the amount of mixing. The amount of mixing is found to be in the order of magnitude of 1 percent for one vessel over 600m canal length a representative range of parameters of canal geometry, density profile, vessel draught and vessel speed. The actual effect will be larger since the internal wave field is still present at the outflow boundary and since the propeller has been omitted from the model set-up. Processes around the vessel and the internal waves contribute about equally to the amount of mixing in the model domain. The internal waves are estimated to have a contribution of about twice as large if the modelled domain was longer. As the interface comes up behind the vessel, it is likely that the propeller jet can have a large impact on the density field directly behind the vessel. The vessel speed, density profile, relative density difference, layer distribution in a two-layer flow, canal blockage, draught to top layer height ratio, and the slope of canal banks are important parameters in the amount of mixing generated. Due to the cumulative effect of the ship traffic, mixing by ship traffic is estimated to be of large importance on the density distribution in a canal. More research is needed to include this effect in large-scale numerical models and find a good parameterisation. How mixing by ship traffic could finally be implemented will be dependent on the numerical model that is used, and the amount of detail that is needed.","mixing; salt intrusion; inland waterways; ship traffic; FinLab; internal waves; return current; stratified flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

Since the main purpose of these institutions is not to heal but to accommodate, the question arises how these institutes can strive to provide a real home for its inhabitants. This thesis presents several design considerations that may serve useful within the design process to aid into reaching this goal. These considerations are based on studying the Thomashuizen concept which was initiated by Hans van Putten with the same goal in mind. This concept is compared to the Rudolf Steiner clinic as a historical precedent from the interbellum period which is known to deviate from other historical conventional examples. After a thorough analysis, the concepts of scale, context, image and pragmatism were identified as aspects that could be considered when designing an institute that provides assisted living for mentally disabled people.

Seeing as these estimations are dating from before the COVID-19 pandemic, the time currently spent indoors will probably turn out to be even higher. Spending this much time indoors has such a large potential for impact on health, both mental and physical, even though research on this topic has almost exclusively been done on the direct physical effects of spaces. Direct physical effects on spaces might include, but are not limited to: temperature, acoustics, air quality, and lighting.<br/>Seeing as these physical attributes in a building have an effect on physical health, would it then not also make sense for them to have an effect on mental health? Acoustics, for example, can lead to headaches, which is an obvious physical issue that - in this case - comes from prolonged exposure to bad acoustics within the building. Research done by Seddigh, Berntson, Jönsson, Danielson, and Westerlund (2015, p. 37) even shows that an improvement in acoustics was always met with ‘lower perceived disturbances and cognitive stress’. This thesis aims to provide insight into the effects physical attributes in the built environment have on the five senses, and - per extension - physical and mental health. Since health is an especially important factor to take into account within health care facilities, this thesis will reflect upon the design choices made within recently built health care facilities. Only recently built health care facilities were chosen for this seeing as both psychology and architecture are ever-evolving, and these facilites will hopefully provide more insight into the current state of affairs within both of these fields of study. The research question that will be used to gain insight into these effect is: How do the design choices in recently built care facilities affect the healing processes of their patients?","","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

One such automation is the use of computer-based solving methods to aid engineers in their search for their ideal goal, such as automated planar mechanism design. Contrary to creating mechanisms manually, automatic methods are able to create and evaluate mechanisms in quick succession. However, computers can often reach intricate designs which are not directly feasible in the physical domain. These programs do not focus on being able to manufacture the mechanisms, thus, the designs often have features that make it difficult or even impossible to create physically. Examples are inadequate spacing between joints or a mechanism consisting of many elements for which a good layer assignment is hard to find. To ensure these designs are physically feasible, a manufacturability check can be implemented. Sen et al. created a method to obtain manufacturable planar mechanisms for kinematic designs consisting of rigid bodies and revolute joints. This method identifies structural, kinematic or geometric infeasibilities for all layer assignments. When a mechanism is fully feasible, it can be manufactured. However, this method is still limited. It is only applicable for mechanisms consisting of rigid bodies and revolute joints. This restricts the application space of possible designs. Also, this method is not tested with physical examples. In this research, an extension of automatically created manufacturable mechanisms is developed. Firstly, it extends the method such that spring elements in a design can be checked for manufacturability and surrounding links can adapt their shape to accommodate for the springs, resulting in a wider field of applications. Secondly, a method is introduced to simplify the steps to manufacture the theoretical design. Four mechanism prototypes are built using the available methods and their manufacturability is evaluated. Lastly, this research can be used to find the layer assignment with the least amount of layers, resulting in thinner mechanisms for space-constrained applications.","Mechanisms; Rigid Body; Spring; Gravity balancing; Manufacturability; Optimization; Prototyping; Manufacturing; Representation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

It was a new disease for which many countries were not prepared. In the Netherlands there was a scarcity of virus tests, and lack of coordination on the allocation of these scarce tests. Besides, there was no proactive acquisition of<br/>spread information, and spread predictions were not used. To address these issues, government institutions could use UAVs. The UAVs acquire virus spread information, by coordinated and proactive delivery of virus tests to people’s home. This information is important for detecting virus outbreaks early, and to respond with appropriate measures, such as social distancing measures. This research aims to develop and evaluate such a multi-UAV test delivery system, using the agent-based modelling and simulation paradigm. The system consists of two main components: (1) The system coordinates the UAVs’ region of focus, by using a Bayesian decision network. This Bayesian decision network uses the virus case predictions of a spatiotemporal generalised linear prediction model, and the observations of the UAV system to make coordination decisions. (2) The system uses neighbourhood search and exploration techniques to detect virus cases that otherwise would not be identified. The methodology has been applied to a case study of 5 municipalities in the province of Noord-Brabant in the Netherlands. These municipalities were strongly hit by the COVID-19 epidemic. The main conclusions are that increasing the number of UAVs, increases the virus detection and decreases average delivery time. Furthermore, the Bayesian decision network is effective in prioritising the allocation of test resources to regions with higher epidemic severity. It does so by allocating more time to severe regions. Additionally, neighbourhood search is an effective way to find unobserved cases. Moreover, exploration in combination with the fixed response threshold model was found to be more effective than neighbourhood search.","UAV delivery; Agent-based modelling; Epidemiological modelling; Bayesian decision network","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-05-01","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Currently recycling building materials is already the approach. Yet, since this costs a lot of energy and results mostly in downcycling, it is not ideal as a long term solution to achieve a durable circular economy. Adding to this, is the space limitation within the continuous growth. The usage of the existing space and infrastructure has to be optimized. This research is answering what is the best strategy to close material loops in South Holland while reusing the existing water infrastructure, amplifying it with integrated (data) networks and improving socio-spatial justice with circular hubs. The research is being executed by analysing the most efficient waterways to use in the area, defining transformation locations according to a data-driven matrix and designing the most efficient circular hub network possible. The waterways will connect circular hubs on 3 scales, a regional processing hub, a city storage &amp; purchase hub and a flexible last mile hub. Transporting materials and goods in between the circular hubs helps in reducing CO2 emission and it can substantiate traffic on the roads. This leads to less busy highways, safer city centres and efficient use of transport. All the logistic flows and used-material flows come together in the Virtual realm, where all used-material data is accessible and a twin-region is ensuring spatial justice. Therefore the concept of Virtual X Water is the answer to define the transition towards a circular economy in 2050.","regional planning; urbanism; Water urbanism; Data","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","AR2U086 R&D Studio – Spatial Strategies for the Global Metropolis",""

Het gebied rondom de Grote Kerk omvat het oudste gedeelte van het centrum van Alkmaar en is een locatie omringd door monumentale en kenmerkende architectuur. Het grijs-roze natuurstenen bankgebouw is het resultaat van een ingrijpende transformatie van het oude postkantoor. In 1960 ontwierp de Alkmaarse professor en architect Piet Hendricus Tauber het postkantoor en in 1994 maakte hij voor hetzelfde pand een nieuw ontwerp in opdracht van ABN AMRO. Tauber groeide op in twee generaties van architectuurstromingen met aan de ene kant de opkomst van de modernisten, die zich tegen de traditionele vormen en opvatting over de architectuur verzetten, en aan de andere kant de traditionele architectuur waar vakmanschap centraal staat. Tauber kreeg van kinds af aan het vakmanschap van het bouwen mee doordat hij opgroeide in een ambachtsfamilie, waarbij zijn vader meester metselaar en bouwopzichter was. Echter tijdens zijn opleiding in Delft maakte hij kennis met de modernistische architectuur en het streven naar vernieuwing. In veel van Tauber zijn latere werken stelde hij vakmanschap boven alles en was hij zowel traditioneel qua vormgeving als modern omdat hij hierbij geen beroep deed op historische vormen. Het doel van dit onderzoek is om het ontwerp voor het postkantoor en het bankgebouw van Tauber in zijn tijd en locatie te plaatsen. Hierbij wordt voortgebouwd op bestaande literatuur over de geschiedenis van Alkmaar en de bibliografie over Piet Tauber. In dit onderzoek zal aanvullend worden ingegaan op het ontwerp en ontwerpkeuzes voor het postkantoor en het bankgebouw. Met behulp van interviews met Frans Tauber en Robert Koppes is er extra informatie verzameld over de beide projecten. Frans Tauber is de zoon van Piet Tauber en de interieurarchitect van de transformatie tot het ABN AMRO kantoor. Robert Koppes was de projectleider bij Tauber Architecten voor de transformatie van het postkantoor tot het ABN AMRO kantoor. Later, in 2015, heeft Robert in opdracht van ABN AMRO met Koppes Bouwkunde het interieur heringericht en het gehele pand verduurzaamd (energie- en CO2-neutraal). Het onderzoek begint met de achtergrond van Piet Tauber en de achtergrond van zijn vader Hendricus Tauber en wordt vervolgd met onderzoek naar de jeugd en studietijd van Piet, de start van zijn eigen bedrijf ‘Tauber Architecten’ en zijn theorie ‘Bouwen naar opdracht’. Verder wordt ingegaan op de Alkmaarse geschiedenis, in het kort de stedelijke groei en ontwikkeling van vanaf de 10e eeuw. Daarna worden de verschillende plannen voor de herontwikkeling van de historische binnenstad in de 20e eeuw beschreven. Na het literatuuronderzoek wordt er dieper ingegaan op de ontwerpen van het postkantoor en het ABN AMRO kantoor.","AR2A011; Piet; Tauber; Alkmaar; Bagijnenstraat; ABN AMRO; PTT post","nl","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011","52.6328271, 4.7427559,17"

Therefore, in view of international agreements and the developing climate crisis, by 2050 this construction- and demolition sector should be transformed into a circular system that limits CO2 severely. It is important to bear in mind that current waste collection and waste treatment in the Netherlands are often separated and that it is a system that does not integrate social and spatial aspects, such as education or embeddedness in the urban fabric. These processes lack in optimal use of existing spatial systems in order to stimulate a sustainable circular flow of materials. In order to tackle this problem, we envision to integrate several systems of existing waste collection stations and treatment facilities and involve citizens in the waste system rejuvenation. In order to achieve this, we build upon the existing network of waste collection stations, by transforming it into a multi-functional system. Adding social values to the existing systems such as educational facilities and maker spaces improves their spatial quality and contributes to more public awareness about these systems. In order to achieve this, we propose to integrate systems into the urban fabric and improve the dialogue with the cities in the South Holland region. However, the unique identity of each location requires a multi-layered approach, consisting of central hubs and local- and flexible spokes. The central hubs emphasize logistical optimization of circular material processes, while the local and flexible spokes focus more on public awareness creation. The local spokes do so through integration with the city and the flexible spokes with a more adaptable character by being related to construction sites. To determine the functions and characteristics of each site, the regional strategy will take into account all individual spatial, environmental, social, and technical characteristics in order to achieve the best interaction between them. The multi-scale integration and rejuvenation of the system improve the efficiency and the sustainability of waste collection, with an impact on the spatial qualities of the waste collection stations. In turn, this leads to added social values and crucial society-wide awareness for the transition and active engagement of citizens in the circular economy.","","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","AR2U086 R&D Studio – Spatial Strategies for the Global Metropolis",""

The province of South-Holland and the Port of Rotterdam hereby form the heart of the economic centre of the Netherlands, contributing to 21% of the national GDP. However, the economic growth and prosperity of the region is inevitably linked to CO2 emissions and pollution. On the local level, the petroleumscape produces an invasive effect on the livability of its direct environment, exposing the local population to the burdens of the financial gains of the petrochemical industries. Also, we urgently need to transition towards a more sustainable energy system due to growing risks as a result of climate change. This poses a challenge to the region, since the main driver of the current industry is based on a highly centralized energy system. Such systems are not fit to make use of locally perceived potential of renewable energy sources. In the transition towards a distributed energy system, ecologic, social and economic challenges with strong spatial components arise in the region of South-Holland. Therefore, this strategy aims for an approach for giving shape and meaning to the energy transition in the province of South-Holland. Our team explores the way in which decentralization of certain building blocks in the mechanisms of energy production, conversion and storage could deliver a more democratic, self-sufficient and resilient system. Simultaneously, it should empower the local economy. By rearranging and reimagining the configuration of space in the port region, new spatial layers come to existence, which are oriented towards improving social and ecological structures. Once the polluting industries transform into cleaner industries, new spaces and opportunities open up for sustainable redevelopment of the waterfront. Space for recreation, flora and fauna will bring about a more gradual transition from port to city to hinterland.

This led to the question addressed in this historical research: How can a striking example of 19th century mental health care architecture be useful to reduce stress among psychiatric patients in contemporary Dutch facilities? The historical part of the study focusses on St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D.C. designed on the basis of the design principles of the revolutionary physician Dr. Thomas S. Kirkbride. Furthermore, the research compares this historical research with contemporary scientific research into the influences that architectural interventions have on people’s and psychiatric patients’ stress. Finally, the research ends in a number of recommended design choices based on historical principles and contemporary scientific research which is substantiated with examples from contemporary innovative Dutch facilities. Thus, recommendations are made to design tranquillity.","AR2A011; stress-reducing architecture; psychiatric institutions; Kirkbride","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

The questions that arose quite quickly were, among others: how many people will live here then? How will we have dealt and continue to deal with the challenge of sustainability? How will the climate have changed? This resulted in the question that guided the rest of the research: will we still be able to live here? The process starts with the acknowledgment that climate change is a serious threat to us and the way we live. Then there is the realization that it does not make sense to imagine a future in which the economic structures have changed, but the landscape and the way we deal with this threat has not. From this, we continue to envision South Holland in 2100, to see what the landscape could look like and how the circular economy and its activities could exist within it. While drawing up this image, the answers to the questions of flood risk and circularity are not found separately, but sought in the creation of synergies between different sectors and layers. The idea is that the transforming landscape can be a generator of change within the agricultural sector and energy production as well. If the environment changes, the ways in which we use, inhabit or move through it will shift, too. The resulting strategy is about protecting what is crucial, using what is possible and letting go of what we can. This is all striven for in order to reach our goals of having South Holland protected from floods and sea level rise, a circular and sustainable agri-food sector, 100% clean and renewable energy and increased environmental health, all while taking into account the (societal) challenges of the century.","circularity; flooding; climate change; resilience; Delta; Delta cities","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","AR2U086 R&D Studio – Spatial Strategies for the Global Metropolis",""

These catalysts are used in many industries to make processes more energetically favourable. Climate change is pushing humanity towards the usage of more green energy and catalysts play an important role in this transition.For example, in the hydrogenation reaction used for the storage of H2, where the catalyst is involved in the storage and removal of H2 on a storage medium like CO2. The properties of the catalyst involved in this (de)hydrogenation reaction can affect the selectivity and yield of the reaction. Designing a catalyst that maximizes the property (yield for example) that we are interested in for a specific reaction, is an essential asset to tune catalyzed processes. Computational screening of many catalysts has attracted the attention of academia and industry due to constant developments in the field of computational chemistry.In these computational methods, predictive models together with DFT and/or DFTB methods can be used to correlate a set of reaction descriptors with catalyst properties. The model has a higher probability to find novel molecules with a high activity when more (reliable) training data is used and when the search spac eof the model is confined to a local chemical space. This means that newly added molecules for screening should be structurally closely related to the molecule that was used to build the model. Unfortunately, large data sets are not readily available for transition-metal containing complexes although these complexes are widely applied in the field of homogeneous catalysis. In this research a Python-based workflow, ChemSpaX, that is aimed at automating local chemical space exploration for any type of molecule is introduced. Thisworkflow enables the user to place fragments on molecules based on 3Dinformation, while staying close to the quality of the initial structure. This enables data-driven property calculations and prediction models, which could eventually be extended towards the automated design of new catalysts. Various representative applications of ChemSpaX are presented in which data-driven xTBand DFT property calculations are done. The found correlations between catalyst properties are shown and it is shown that ChemSpaX generates structures that have a reasonable quality for usage in data-driven prediction models for high-throughput screening.  ","catalysis; data-driven; density functional tight‐binding theory; chemical space exploration; Python; data science; material design; chemical engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-04-22","","","","Applied Sciences","",""

However, this means that ships may have to sail very close to or even through the mud layer on the seabed, with possible effects on ships’ resistance and manoeuvrability. This study has made a step in understanding these effects on ships’ resistance. In order to study the effects of the different mud characteristics on the passing vessels, non-Newtonian models have been implemented in ReFRESCO, the CFD code developed by the Maritime Research Institute Netherlands (MARIN) in collaboration with several non-profit organizations around the world. The objective of this study was to test the ability of ReFRESCO to simulate and assess the influence of a fluid mud layer on the resistance of a ship. RANS simulations are performed for the flow around a KVLCC2 benchmark vessel at model scale with h/T=1.2 and a Froude number of Fn=0.064. Calculations were carried out varying systematically the mud layer thickness (h_mud/T=0.1-0.3), the mud density ratio (ρ_mud/ρ_water=1.05-1.2) and the mud yield stress (τ_y=0-1 Pa). The mud is modelled with the regularized Bingham model. The results show that the resistance of the ship increases in the presence of a mud layer, mainly in the pressure component. The pressure resistance shows a significant peak when the internal Froude number 〖Fn〗_i approaches one. This suggests that the increase in resistance is mainly due to the dead-water resistance, which is highly dependent on the (combination of) ship’s velocity, mud layer thickness and density. The influence on the resistance due to the yield stress appears rather limited, and it depends on the density ratio between water and mud. Results also suggest that yield stress has mainly an effect on the viscous pressure component.","CFD; RANS; fluid mud; ship resistance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","NAUTIMUD",""

In this work the inverse boundary element method is used to create a coil design method for an arbitrary surface. This method is described and the mathematical framework is analyzed. A regularization method for the inverse problem has been designed in the form of a regularization matrix. This regularization matrix is constructed such that it can handle arbitrary surfaces.

These concerns might have a long-term impact on travel patterns, with nearly a third of travelers planning to fly less after the pandemic. The aviation industry, an important part of the global economy which provides 65.5 million jobs worldwide, has been hard hit since the virus outbreak. Experts agree that addressing new passenger concerns will be critical as their willingness to fly will drive the recovery. Developed in collaboration with the aircraft manufacturer Embraer, this project explored ways to increase the perception of viral safety in current aircraft, and translated these findings into a product proposal, which provides a feeling of safety and privacy during a flight. To understand the factors influencing the perception of viral safety, interviews were conducted with recent flyers and flight attendants. The collected data showed that contracting the virus is a big worry, especially while eating. Not only does it reduce the feeling of safety, it also exposes passengers to the risk of infection as a result of removing the masks. In order to facilitate ideation, a brainstorming session with aviation experts was conducted. Prototypes were developed and tested with travelers using virtual reality technology to define solutions that evoke a sense of safety. The combination of insights allowed for the development of ""COVR"" – an aircraft interior element that separates passengers, providing a feeling of viral safety and, as a result, increasing the willingness to fly.","Aviation; Perceived safety; COVID-19; coronavirus; Perceived viral safety; Comfort; Virtual Reality","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

This thesis follows the Fake News Game example using active inoculation in the form of a game against social engineering risks. Inoculation draws the analogy with vaccines and says humans can be injected with small pieces of persuasion to trigger the development of antibodies against that persuasion, similar to how vaccines protect humans against diseases. The player is placed in a social engineer's shoes and learns six often used psychological techniques in social engineering attacks in the game. These techniques are shown in short, interactive sections, where the player experiences how these techniques feel. This way, the body learns how to recognize these techniques and develop its antibodies against them, thus learning how to protect against them when they are used for real. The game is built to be flexible and modular. The flexible and modular setup of the game allows for adjustment to the target audience. This way, it can also keep up with the rapidly changing developments within cybercrime. The intervention was tested within the Dutch Armed Forces in a three-group pretest-posttest quasi-experiment.

Although the shipping industry has managed to remain relatively free of climate regulation this is changing with the IMO goals for 2050. The military sector has also escaped scrutiny on sustainability issues. But this is also changing as the Dutch Ministry of Defence expressed the ambition to reduce its carbon footprint, with the eventual goal to reduce the operational dependency on a scarce resource, and to comply with national and international regulation. The direct aim, therefore, is to reduce the fossil fuel consumption by 70%, and to comply with IMO regulations by 2050.<br/>In this thesis the possibilities for reducing fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions will be examined. This will be done for the seagoing large surface vessels of the Royal Netherlands Navy by using alternative fuels. <br/>This question is answered through the execution of two case studies of vessels with different mission profiles: the Zeven Provinciën class Air Defence and Command Frigate and the Landing Platform Dock Johan de Witt. For both vessels, a design process is carried out in which more detail is progressively<br/>added whilst down selecting the most suitable technologies.<br/>The first step in the design process is an operational analysis. This operational analysis uses the perceived missions profiles and the RNLN maritime doctrine to make a prioritization in a set of technical properties or measures of effectiveness. In the second design step, a systematic design variation is used to estimate the effect that different energy carriers have on the main dimensions of the vessel. The parametric design tool developed for this is an adapted version of the SPEC tool developed by Marin. The model estimates the required power and the weight of different weight groups of the vessel. The final design step continues with a more detailed proposal for a power plant configuration for both case studies. With this detailed design a final assessment of the fuel consumption, exhaust gas emissions, and operational effectiveness is made.<br/>Throughout the design phases it was established that the displacement of both vessels would increase significantly due to the lower energy density of the selected fuels. In the case of the Air Defence and Command Frigate, the high top speed and relatively high fuel and system weight lead to a larger increase in required fuel and installed power due to the increasing resistance when using anything but the most energy dense fuels. For the Landing Platform Dock, which has a more modest power requirement and a relatively low system and fuel weight, the increase in displacement is smaller. In conclusion, it can be said that the goals stipulated by the Ministry of Defence are attainable. The effect on the operational effectiveness varies between vessels but the overall fuel consumption, cost, and displacement are sure to increase significantly.","Naval vessel design; Alternative fuels; Energy carriers; Fossil fuel consumption; Systems engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

In addition, the wetland provides natural resources for local communities and habitat for variety of species. The planned dam construction upstream of the wetland and projected changes in the local climate could affect the physical and ecological equilibrium of the system. Baseline information on seasonal inundation dynamics is necessary to sustainably manage these potential threats. The wetland is sparsely instrumented, which has hampered a thorough temporal and spatial understanding of the local water balance. In addition, the highly vegetated nature of the wetland, and relatively frequent cloud-coverage, motivates multi-source integration of remotely sensed data to capture flood patterns at a high resolution.<br/>In this study, the spatiotemporal inundation pattern of the Mara Wetland in Tanzania is reconstructed using optical remote sensing data. The annual fluctuations in aerial wetland extent are analysed in parallel to the fluctuations of local water balance components: downstream water level of Lake Victoria, upstream discharge, direct precipitation and evaporation. The analyses aims to shed light on the underlying mechanisms and hydrological processes that control the hydric status of the wetland. Comparing the temporal changes in extent with surrounding physical processes provides insight on the responsiveness of the wetland to specific water balance components.<br/>The intra- and inter-annual trends in inundation of the Mara Wetland are reproduced for the years 2017, 2018, 2019. The Random Forests (RF) algorithm is trained bi-seasonally (using bands and derived water and vegetation indices from Sentinel-2 data and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) as input variables), and used to classify the land-covers of the wetland region in a semi-automated way for a total of 73 Sentinel-2 scenes. The scenes are classified into 7 individual land-cover classes; 3 wetland classes (open water, flooded vegetation, wet floodplain) and 4 dryland classes (dry floodplain, wet agriculture, dry agriculture, bare land). The overall classification accuracy achieved (based on an independent validation set, not used to train the classification algorithm) is 98.6 %. The spatiotemporal variability of the inundated area is used in combination with available hydrological field-data to reproduce the local water balance.<br/>The seasonal expansion and contraction of the wetland follows a consistent bi-modal regime, and the results from the waterbalance affirm the importance of local precipitation in the seasonal expansion and contraction of the wetland. The base-flow supplied by the Mara River, together with the backwater from Lake Victoria appear to be at equilibrium at the extent of the permanent swamp during the dry season, insinuating the importance of the riverflow during these low-rainfall months. The occasional yet extreme flood events induced by high discharge rates are expected to play a specific ecological role in the wetland, and should be accounted for during future dam operations upstream.","Wetlands; Remote Sensing; Sentinel-1; Ecosystem Services; Hydrology; Ecology; Hydrodynamics; Inundation; Hydroperiod; Lake Victoria; Mara River; Optical remote sensing; Waterbalance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-01","","","","Civil Engineering","","-1.529167, 34.126111"

The Kaplan-Meier Product Limit Method was used to estimate capacity and recovery distributions for selected sites to overcome stochastic characteristics of traffic flow and investigate the relation between heavy vehicle share and capacity drop at Dutch highways. Furthermore, a simulation study was executed to investigate increased heavy vehicle share scenarios and changing physical and operational characteristics of heavy vehicles. The empirical results show a connection between heavy vehicle share and the capacity drop, although not statistically significant. Currently, chaotic properties of breakdown flow seem to superimpose the impact. However, it is possible that the effect becomes influential as the current maximum observed share of heavy vehicles during breakdown grows from 9% up to 15%, which appeared to be the worst case scenario in simulation. Besides, concern is raised as a decreasing breakdown capacity was observed on several Dutch highways, even after correction with the PCE values of the increasing heavy vehicle share.","Freight Traffic; Capacity Drop; Heavy Vehicle share; Empirical analysis; Simulation; Dutch highways; Kaplan-Meier; Product Limit Method; Passenger Car Equivalents","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","",""

A shift in construction is needed towards the circular economy to close material loops, decrease and eventually stop the depletion of the earth’s resources. The construction project organisation could be an important vehicle for this transition. The construction project organisation is made up of all actors who, together, realise a project. The outcome of a project is the result of the collaborations, interactions and partner networks within a construction project organisation. Organising these interactions in another way could result in a more effective approach towards the circular economy. The demand for circular projects is increasing and despite this increase in demand, the construction project organisations still approach new types of projects in a linear way. Governments are speeding up this process, by creating regulations, incentives, and deadlines for all industries. The built environment has to change their way of working to commit to these new standards in the future. Product-service systems is a concept which could contribute to this transition in the built environment and reduce the depletion of resources. Consumers will pay for project-use and the producer will maintain ownership which stimulates sustainability. To accomplish this in the built environment and increase project value, construction project organisations have to change their traditional structures and develop new partner networks. The following research question will address this problem: How can construction project organisations change towards the Circular Economy and add value by implementing Product-Service Systems? The purpose of this research is to fill the gap between theory and practice. This is done by restructuring the stakeholder network of a construction project organisation, to meet the circular demand, by implementing the concept of product-service systems. The aim is to get a better understanding of the current state of construction project organisations and how they could implement product-service systems more effectively.","Product-Service System; Circular economy; construction project organisation; actor network; stakeholder network; system integrator; building in layers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

Alternatively, Organ-on-Chips (OoCs), dynamic microphysiological platforms, can be employed to recapitulate organ functions and mimic the cell's microphysiological environment. OoCs also promote the study of transport mechanisms and tissue barriers, such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a critical structure responsible for the regulation of the brain fluid microenvironment. Monitoring the ionic environment of the BBB and its variation due to the effect of drug testing is thus critical, indicating the need for integrated sensing elements. The rapid evolution of silicon technology and microelectronics has contributed to the development of field-effect transistors (FETs) for use as biosensors, ever since their first appearance in the 1970s. Such devices can provide real-time and label-free detection of target bioanalytes with high sensitivity. There are several types of FET-based biosensors based on different geometries and utilising various materials, but currently, no optimal consensus for a biocompatible FET-based biosensor with high sensitivity and reliability has been established. In the present thesis, floating gate FET-based sensors implementing flexible electrodes suspended on an optically transparent sensing area were designed and successfully fabricated for application on blood-brain barrier ion environment monitoring. Before the designing process, a thorough literature study on FET-based alternative solutions compatible with the BBB-on-chip application gave an overview of the available technology. It also indicated a lack of theoretical background behind the sensor's operation mechanisms. To face this issue, theoretical and simulation models were created based on the floating-gate MOSFET operation. Additionally, the electrical double layer (EDL) role, only included in models in the presence of a reference electrode is examined. The novelty of the sensor configuration lies with the implementation of an additional planar electrode in the sensing area of the OoC, tackling the issue of the external reference electrode use. Possible models describing the interaction between the additional electrode and the FGFET are created for comparison with experimental data. The novel sensor is designed aiming towards optimised sensitivity while also examining the effect of different configurations on the behaviour of the planar electrode. Dual-gate operation of the fabricated sensor in electrolyte indicates an increase of the output signal up to 16$\%$ compared to single-gate operation. In contrast to model predictions, the sensor does not operate in saturation mode, rendering the mathematical models ineffective. The simulation-based model is suggested for following applications after fine-tuning based on experimental data. Overall, a strong basis of the theoretical background was established, making ground for future studies.","biosensor; charge sensing; microfabrication; organ-on-chip","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-04-15","","","","","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Stand capacity assessment is an essential factor in airport planning and design due to the large investments associated with airport development. Fulfilling anticipated demand while still considering future growth is key in airport master planning. In this paper, a mixed-integer linear programming optimisation model is proposed, which determines the stand mix and needed operational equipment through a value-focused thinking process. The decision-maker defines a priori the optimisation objectives (what to optimise for and the factors incorporated within the optimisation), after which different cases will be explored. The framework incorporates a trade-off between operational factors, different stand types, area limitations and flight frequency through two objectives: capital cost and operational cost. A trade-off between the two objectives is made through weight factors, which results in a Pareto curve. The model is validated through a case study performed using a design day flight schedule of Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. This paper shows the implications of the trade-off between capital cost and operational cost, the drivers for flight splitting, the use of swing stands, incorporation of area limitations and the implications of incorporating the weekly frequency of flights on the stand mix. It is recommended to apply the weighted sum method and the creation of Pareto curves to create a value-focused thinking process for a decision-maker. The availability of an optimisation framework, which allows airport stakeholders and decision-makers to get insights into implications of strategic decisions on stand capacity in the form of a trade-off between objectives and optimisation factors, will benefit the airport development process.","Airport; Strategic Stand Capacity; Stand Allocation Problem; Stand Capacity Assessment; MILP; Stand mix; Robust Scheduling; Flight Frequency","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Zitman, T.J. (mentor); van Maren, D.S. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The lower Ems river suffers from hyper-turbid conditions. These conditions are caused by channel deepening over the last 50 years, resulting in an asymmetrical tidal wave. This asymmetry has resulted in an increased<br/>import of sediment into the Ems river. Recently some effort has gone into determining whether or not the local tidal barrier (Emssperrwerk) can be used to alter the asymmetry of the tidal waves propagating through the Ems estuary. Previous modelling studies, using state-of-the-art models, have been able to reproduce prototype tests involving the same tidal barrier but very little effort has thus far gone into determining what the optimal barrier control regime is and what the restriction imposed on the barrier operation mean for the overall<br/>effectiveness of the barrier. The operation of the tidal barrier was schematised and described using two factors: closure percentage and closure duration. The effectiveness of a broad spectrum of combinations determining the tidal barrier operation is modelled using a simple one-dimensional model which takes only into account the (simplified) hydrodynamics in the lower Ems river. The results of the model indicate that only in part of the Lower Ems the tide can be adjusted to become symmetrical or slightly ebb-dominant. This requires a closure duration longer than approximately 240 minutes. The length of this stretch of river is increase further by increasing the closure percentage. Similarly, increasing the closure percentage also leads to a decrease in the tidal volume and the amplitude of the M4 component. For this reason, the closure percentage should be kept as low as possible, as long as the barrier operation is able to reduce the sediment import into the Lower Ems. The required length of the stretch of the Lower Ems with a symmetric tide is estimated to be around 12 km. Applying restrictions to the barrier operations showed that shorter barrier <br/>operations should be preferred, since short operations allow a larger number of<br/>tidal waves to be altered, increasing the effectiveness in a realistic setting. Based on these considerations an optimal barrier operation consists of a closure duration of approximately 300 minutes and a closure percentage of approximately 60%. The results showed that the method used for evaluating the barrier operation is unable to distinguish between water levels signals consisting of altered and unaltered waves. The effectiveness of the barrier operation is<br/>still estimated by considering the whole water level signal. The impact of the barrier operation in the model interfered with the seaward model boundary. This error increases in magnitude with increasing closure percentages. Making the results for those combinations unreliable. In order to make more reliable conclusions about the effect of the tidal barrier operation, subsequent models should encompass a larger domain and include a more detailed schematisation of the channel geometry, river discharge and the tidal barrier itself.<br","tidal asymmetry; Ems Estuary; tidal barrier","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","","53.31990705750681, 7.306800670204746"

These technological developments provide opportunities for buildings to react to their environment in real time. Hence, reducing the energy demand of the built environment which is critical in addressing the issue of climate change. However, there is a distinct lack of human-centered interfaces, leading to discomfort among occupants This not only results in discomfort, such as visual discomfort experienced due to an oversupply of light, but also a reduction in productivity. In this thesis, a novel dynamic building shading technology is discussed, and the occupant is added directly into the control loop, to discover their preferences, and to avoid visual discomfort and glare. Hence, the main posed research question of this graduation project states: “How can an automated system, consisting of switchable glazing and a system that can sense the needs of the occupant, be used to control glare in an effective manner?” An effective manner of controlling the switchable glazing should both minimise glare, the negative sensation associated with the oversupply of light, and, optimise the use of daylight. The occupant’s facial expression and micro-movements and a lux sensor are combined in a new control strategy, to sense visual discomfort in real-time. Previous studies are analysed to create an office-like environment to test this hypothesis, seeing whether it is possible to predict if one is experiencing glare by one’s facial movements. Two experimental studies are conducted, (i) the first experiment to determine the physical characteristics of the experiment room and (ii) the second experiment to test the novel control system. During the second experiment, a benchmark control strategy and the novel control strategy are tested in the office-like environment and the results are compared. The results from the facial movements show that, in particular, eyebrow movements, may be triggered by light. The results express the potential of adding the face to a control strategy for controlling the amount of light transmitted through the glazing. However, after evaluating the effectiveness of the system, its benefits in terms of daylight and improved availability of view are not clear. For now, at least, in its prototype form, the novel system appeared to be no worse than the benchmark. The desired goal is an interaction between the user and switchable glazing, providing a personal comfortable indoor environment, whilst optimizing the usage of daylight. To reach this, more data has to be collected, however, the following key improvements are suggested; (i) gathering the occupant’s response regarding the level of discomfort immediately (in real-time),(ii) the matter of how to improve the potential for each individual to have their own system is investigated, (iii) the light should be measured via more sensors in different places (for instance fixed to the wall). It should be measured in real-time to determine which one is most beneficial. Furthermore, relation ought to be considered with the architectural design of the building. (iv) The experimental set up mirrors an actual office building to enhance the correlation of the data gathered during such experimental studies, also to study the data with real sunlight, the most common source of glare","Visual comfort; Glare; Switchable glazing; Intelligent façades; User-centered design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","",""

The main problem in the informal urban areas of Semarang is the lack of healthy water infrastructure. Introducing a more green environment is a crucial element in the design proposal; it is a fundamental issue for developing the industrial area that provides income for most of the kampungs inhabitants. The design stimulates the reconnecting living with its scenery. The ecology that used to be the primary support for the economy has lost its value; the groundwater got overexploited, clean water is scarce, the rivers are polluted, the sewage system is unhygienic, and floodings often happens. Additionally, there is a shortage of income for the residents in the kampungs resulting in poor living conditions. The graduation project aims to improve the local work environment in a healthy ecological way. The project invests in promoting the relationship of the community with water and integrates a low tech approach to building technology with local and reused materials.

This research aims to develop a strategic stand planning model capable of selecting profitable turnarounds that will expand the network of a hub, integrating those turnarounds into the pre-existing schedule and efficiently capturing transfer passengers. The model includes 2 main goals, namely i) the maximization of the number of captured transfer passengers and the ii) minimization of connection times, which are integrated with 2 other objectives, iii) the minimization of unassigned turnarounds and iv) the minimization of tow moves. The 4 objectives are solved hierarchically in the order: iii)-i)-ii)-iv). In an attempt to tackle the inherent complexity of models that include transfer passengers, the problem is split into two less complex levels. One solves the multi-objective function and the other delivers a specific stand assignment. This approach significantly reduced the computational load for large input sets. The results show that an efficient stand planning can maximize the transfer passenger throughput by up to 38.66\% and reduce the average connection by 17.86\%. It was also possible to conclude that objectives i) and ii) conflict with each other. Further results confirmed that the time slot to which each new turnaround is allocated is the best slot for the airport, but it is not necessarily the most profitable for the airlines. This research could lead to the development of tools used by rapidly expanding airports to assess the connection potential of new routes. It can also be utilized by busy airports to optimize the current schedule and to make important time slot decisions.","Optimization; Transfer Passengers; Stand Allocation Problem; Hub Connections; Connection Times","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Verma, T. (graduation committee); Sirenko, M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Over the last couple of decades, refugee flows have been telling us a story of increasing numbers that are unlikely to go down anytime soon. The region of Eastern Africa only is home to 2.7 million people finding refuge in refugee settlements that are not often associated with permanency. UNHCR handbooks and many competent authorities state that refugee camps are of temporary character and as a result we observe a significant similarity in post-disaster food assistance and food assistance in a quasi-permanent settlement. The subsequent disparity between the way of organising food distribution and the needs of the population is the main motivation for the development of Food ATMs. This novel method of food distribution is based on allowing beneficiaries to determine how food is withdrawn to suit their own lives. A key point on how beneficiaries will use the Food ATM is a population's perception of the Food ATM. For instance, alleged food shortages might move people to hoard food and consequently undermine whole-system performance. Assumed similarities in literature on panic-buying events suggest that a combination of behavioural factors is a key vulnerability. Since a system of Food ATMs has not been implemented before, a conceptual design was made by 1) acquiring information through expert consultation on the design of an individual Food ATM and 2) the creation of an optimisation model forming an optimal network of Food ATMs. In order to analyse the interaction between a system of Food ATMs and beneficiaries, the current set of Operation Research (OR) models with stochastic or game theory-based formulation of food demand had to be expanded. For this purpose, concepts from research on panic-buying and emotion-related social interaction were used. This research contributes with the union of these concepts in a geo-spatially explicit Agent-Based Model, replacing current OR models' top-down formulation of demand with an agent-based bottom-up formulation. This enabled 1) increasing the understanding of interaction between a supplier of recipient of food assistance and 2) analysis of proposed operational policy in the context developing the Food ATM. Following 2), this thesis provides policy recommendations that have been made based on subsequent quantitative and qualitative investigation of model results. This thesis represents a first step to investigate the effects of individual behavioural factors in the realistic context of improving food distribution in the Bidi Bidi refugee camp in Uganda. New insights taught the relevance for further research, most notably on the relation with the bigger humanitarian supply chain, information diffusion between beneficiaries and the strategy for a population's adoption of the Food ATM.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://github.com/daanieo/FATM_ABM Supporting code","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

In addition, this region houses large volcanoes that have been active until geologically recently (200 to 100 Ma ago). Research has not succeeded in pinpointing the cause of this long-wavelength areoid high, while some researchers claim it is due to a mantle plume, others suggest that it is caused by volcanic construction and the associated flexure in the lithosphere. This work aims to contribute to resolving this question with the development of a new mantle convection model for Mars. It is renewing in four aspects; (1) A Mars model is developed in SFEC (Tosi, 2007), which has been primarily used for Earth studies, (2) mantle anomalies are analysed in order to determinewhether they could be involved in the creation of the Tharsis volcanoes, (3) the solutions challenge the current views upon the (pre-dominantly isostatic) support of Tharsis and (4) a new method is developed to assess the similarity of models and observations for low degree spherical harmonics (n Ç 5) fields. The research contributes to a better understanding of the Martian interior and the volcanic activity in the Tharsis region. Seismic studies of the Earth’s interior have correlated large provinces on the core-mantle-boundary with plume generation and hotspots that arise on Earth’s surface. This research investigates whether similar structures in the Martian mantle could be connected to, or even be the cause of, the volcanism in the Tharsis region. Firstly, a crustal reduction is performed to obtain the gravitational field of the mantle and core. An Airy model is used for this as research found this to be the dominant form of compensation for long-wavelength features on Mars (Mussini, 2020). Subsequently, density anomalies are positioned in the mantle and their gravity potential is computed and compared with the observations.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Side-channel Attacks can be performed in various ways by measuring the power consumption, the electromagnetic emission, or even by measuring an algorithm's execution time on the targeted device. More or less sophisticated methods can be used to utilize this information in order to perform a Side-channel attack, more specifically by training Machine Learning models with traces acquired from a profiling target or by directly performing statistical analysis to a black box target. Of course, performing a successful attack in a black box scenario requires large amounts of traces, even for unprotected implementations. On the other hand, with the state of the art Machine Learning methods, a successful Side-channel attack can be performed by acquiring a smaller number of traces. Nevertheless, for every case, in order to perform a Side-channel Attack, first traces have to be acquired from the target. This acquisition phase is a time-consuming and computationally expensive procedure that requires hardware tools and human supervision. For this reason, in this thesis, we investigate if synthetic Side-channel traces can be generated when the Hamming Weight (HW) model is used as a power model. To generate synthetic traces, we use Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (GANs), a Deep Learning approach that is the state-of-the-art augmentation method in many other fields, especially in Computer Vision. Therefore, we introduce a pipeline to define the architecture of the GANs but also to improve and evaluate it. In other words, we investigate novel ways to introduce new software tools to minimize the time and processing power needed to perform a successful Side-channel attack. Since the HW model is used, the Side-channel datasets follow a specific binomial class distribution, and by using GANs, we can augment the dataset by altering this distribution according to our will. For this reason, before performing data augmentation, we investigate how the profiling models' performance is affected by the trace's class distribution. Next, we use our pipeline to define two GAN architectures: a shallow one able to generate high-quality synthetic traces for unprotected implementations and an enhanced second architecture that can generate synthetic traces even when mild countermeasures such as jittering are in place, by being more stable but also more computationally expensive. We apply the pipeline's methodology on unprotected datasets and on datasets with mild countermeasures such as jittering and we made some steps leveraging GANs to solve the task of augmenting dataset that consist of Side-channel traces. In this way, we managed to compare the GANs with the well established Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), and we observed that GANs achieved similar performance with SMOTE and, in some cases, better.

This study aims to propose a method to increase Amsterdam's greenery that will add social and environmental value through the renovation work of quay walls. The main objective is investigating how the quay walls can be redesigned to gain improved moss colonization as the primary greening method. The research question is: “How can quay wall elements be designed with improved bio receptivity to stimulate high moss growth coverage that will add social and environmental values to Amsterdam citizens’ wellbeing?”. It is further divided into six sub-questions to gain knowledge of bio receptive definitions and concepts first, followed by the study of bio receptive construction materials properties in the second part. The third part aims to gain fundamental moss knowledge. Afterward, a moss field survey is conducted on construction materials in The Netherlands as the fourth part. The fifth part consists of the moss cultivation technique and experiment to gain more practical knowledge of the construction materials. Finally, with the acquired results, a bio receptive quay wall design with other practical considerations is proposed in the last part. Initiated with fundamental literature research on existing bio colonization works, followed by more specific building materials properties and moss knowledge studies on the first three parts. Afterward, a simple field survey on twelve sites has been conducted to determine moss growth conditions on building materials related to quay walls. Later on, an indoor moss cultivation method through the use of terrarium has been done to gain insights into material properties, ideal growing condition for mosses and moss cultivation technique. Based on the acquired knowledge, a simple quay walls element is redesigned to promote moss growth, keeping the site orientation in mind and moss cultivation practicalities. The first three parts' results will not be described since these are basic definitions and knowledge needed for the following three parts. During the field survey, the importance of moisture for moss growth on building materials is crucial. Therefore, not one specific material property value margin is needed, but a set of material properties and environmental conditions should be satisfied to gain successful moss growth. The duration of direct sunlight exposure will influence the site's moisture condition, which will further affect moss growth. Only twelve moss species were found and identified that are able to grow on construction materials, which is used for the moss cultivation method on the construction materials during the experiments. The use of a terrarium to test moss growth on construction materials followed by a moss cultivation idea gained interesting moss growth results. It turns out that the mosses' growing temperature should be below 25 degrees Celsius at all times, especially during the germination phase, followed by a humidity level above 80 percent. For this reason, significant moss growth results on the terrarium test samples are only gained during the end of the fall season and the winter season when the temperature is below 25 degrees Celsius. Sadly, this method is still uncommon, therefore, not fully understood and controllable; improvement on the temperature and lighting control of the terrarium test method is needed to further develop the terrarium test method into a moss receptivity testing method. Finally, the redesign of the quay wall element focus is to increase moisture gain through capillary action on the masonry finish of the quay walls. This can be achieved by using bricks with an Initial rate of absorption value above 3.0 kg/m2*minute and pointing made of either trass lime or lime 4 | P a g e mortar to promote capillary absorption of the masonry finish. Site consideration regarding quay wall orientation should be taken into account since this will influence the moisture condition and the moss cultivation technique time of application during winter and protection against external factor that prevents moss germination. It is concluded that moss growth on quay walls can be stimulated by particularly improving the moisture condition on the quay walls exterior finish, as moisture was found to be the key parameter that determines the presence or absence of mosses on concrete structures such as quay walls. Resulting in an increase in greenery in Amsterdam city, which can be further translated into social and environmental values such as better air quality by filtering airborne dust, stimulating the ecosystem by producing food for the primary consumer and followed by an increase in the benefits of access to nature to human health. How citizens will perceive the green moss quay walls is unknown, especially since the moss growth comes with other organisms' growth and is not evergreen throughout the whole year and how will the moss growth influence the durability of the material over a long period. Therefore, more studies and experiments regarding moss greening should be conducted to understand this greening method better.","Green Quay walls; Bio receptive facade; Moss greening; Green facade; Bio receptivity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

(mentor); Coelen, J. (graduation committee); Hagg, Jan Paul (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This report describes the results of a graduation project, which was completed at Hombli, a brand of Avanca International B.V. Hombli offers smart home products and has the ambition to become a leader in this domain. In order to achieve that the company wants to create Intellectual Property in the future and have a solid brand. Hombli has two issues however First of all Hombli’s current positioning risks losing its uniqueness. Competitors also claim to be simple to use, easy to install and safe. Secondly, the way it currently creates new products is sensitive to being copied by competitors. Hombli imports products from China, adjusts them to their liking and integrates it into their ecosystem of devices. Many of these smart home products are also available to competitors, making it hard¬er for Hombli to stand out. A question rises when looking at these obstacles: How can Hombli become a household name and create I.P.? To answer this question a two step approach is proposed: First a future direction will be designed, resulting in a clear and differentiating brand story for Hombli. Second a new way innovation process will be designed as well as improving the existing way of innovating. By doing trend research and using the trend spotting method (Simonse, 2017), a future scenario is created. Summarized it resulted in the following: Because of an increase of people suffering from mental stress and the home becoming an even more prominent space in people’s lives, it makes sense for Hombli to facilitate well being at home. Then the way the company currently innovates is analysed. The existing process which focusses on sourcing products has some disadvantages. Lack of communication, no prioritisation and confusion about responsibilities result in unnecessary slack in the process and in turn hinders innovation. This then also leaves even less room for any exploratory activities. Principiles from the User Centered Design method from Abras, Maloney-Krichmar &amp; Preece (2004) are used to redesign the current innovation process together with the employees that actually use it. During the weekly sessions the different stages of the process are discussed, altered and put to practice with actual products. The process is altered to become more like the Stage Gate innovation model from Cooper (2008). Advice is given on how to implement this in the organisation. Then the process focusing on discovering new ideas is introduced. Throughout the steps assumptions regarding the product direction are validated. This is done through initially desk research, then interviews with target users and an individual co-creation session. The product idea that results from that session is put to the test using a Smoke Test (Cops, 2020). A method used often by start-ups to see if their value proposition gains traction. The results of this step are positive and give a green light for next iterations. Then recommendations are given to further expand the proposed changes in the company to have a lasting positive effect in the future. Concluding, limitations of this research are also shared.","Innovation process; Future visioning; Strategy design; innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Architectural experimentation is the process of generating design ideas and making design decisions. The traditional tools, drawing and modelling, have proven to be fruitful. However, when zooming in on the essence of experimentation, one may wonder if drawing and modelling are the only possible tools to support the process of exploring and deciding. By detaching drawing and modelling from the act of experimenting; the research tries to broaden the traditional laboratory and explore the meaning of experimentation within design education. Furthermore, the research provided knowledge in, and experience with, non-traditional experimentation tools. The latter two have been applied into the design project. In the design process, traditional tools have been combined with non-traditional tools, such as film, blogging, movement and writing poetry. These experiments allowed for a sensitive and reflective approach towards the design (location). Especially the non-traditional tools allowed for looking at the design (location) from multiple perspectives. This resulted in the discovery of existing and potential qualities, but also in design principles and a guiding theme. The design takes place in the Bossche Stadsdelta. The Bossche Stadsdelta is the name for an area in ‘s-Hertogenbosch that will be developed in the coming years. However, due to physical separation by water and the lack of a shared identity; the area is not yet experienceable as the Bossche Stadsdelta. Luckily, the experiments with traditional and non-traditional tools imply that the area has a lot of existing and potential qualities. Therefore, a folly route is introduced. Follies are ornaments of the Bossche Stadsdelta: born from what is already there. They amplify existing (potential) qualities and are open for human action. The follies are mutually connected by sightlines and a shared architectural language. Together it allows locals and visitors to consciously move and stop throughout the area: to experience the Bossche Stadsdelta as a whole.","Bossche Stadsdelta; folly; experimentation; design process; route; experience; reflection; education; amplify","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Explorelab","",""

Ecommerce is growing steadily, and the recent Covid19 pandemicgave an extra boost to that. Besides, customers are seeking more flexibility inthe logistic services. Parcel delivery is changing, yet this leads to variousnegative externalities including congestion, air, and noise pollution. Theseeffects let companies seek innovative solutions for their parcel transport. Oneof these innovations is ’crowdshipping’,parcel delivery done by the crowd instead of conventional delivery companies.By making use of existing passenger transport rather than a speciallydispatched driver to ship parcels, parcel shipping should be economically and environmentallymore sustainable. Crowdshipping is a service that has shown potential in pilotsand smallscale researches. However, strategic analyses of the impact ofcrowdshipping on all actors in the transport systems are still lacking. Thegoal of this research is to explore the interactions between travellers and parcelshipments in various strategic crowdshipping contexts and assess their impacton transport use. To achieve that, the following main research question will beanswered: ’<b>How could sustainable crowdshipping impact freightand passenger transport use?</b>’. A simulation model is built using agentbased modelling to explorebehaviour and simulate possible effects. This model consists of interactionsbetween four agents in the system; the customers,crowdshipping platform, travellers and occasional carriers. First, thecustomers place their orders at the platform. When travellers make their trip,they could consider carrying a parcel along their way. They notice their plannedtrip to the platform, which will calculate the optimal parcels for them. Thetravellers could opt for one of the parcels and turn into occasional carriers.The impact of crowdshipping is assessed by calculating the detour theoccasional carriers travel to deliver their parcels. Other outcomes are the providedcompensation and percentage of matched parcels, to determine the viability ofthe platform. The spatial demarcation of the simulation is most of the provinceof South Holland in the Netherlands. In this study area, 2.3 million peoplereside who order over 220,000 parcels each day. Furthermore, 4.1 million tripsare made daily by car and bicycle. Taking the willingness of both customers andtravellers into account, 13,000 parcels and 750,000 traveller trips enter themodel. Four experiments are performed to inspect system behaviour in variouscontexts. The results show that implementing crowdshipping in this study areacould be viable. The average provided compensation is lower than the priceconsignors currently pay for conventional delivery. Besides, the delivery degreeseems acceptable to get a decent level of service. Through crowdshipping, thetravelled distance in the passenger transport system will increase because ofthe detours taken by occasional carriers. This increase subsequently leads to adecrease in freight transport distance through a decreased demand inconventional parcel demand. However, the passenger transport increase exceeds thefreight transport decrease. The crowdshipping platform could limit the takendetours by making strategic choices in their implementation. This might be atthe expense of their delivery degree. It is advised for the public authority toset boundaries for the platform and stimulate strategic matching choices basedon these possible externalities. When interpreting these results, cautionshould be taken. The approach has some shortcomings regarding the spatialdistribution of detours, costs of platform’s viabilityand first leg distances for parcel transport. Furthermore, limitations could befound in the assumptions made for the simulation model. This includes theabstraction that travellers do not deviate from their planned trips andmodalities, and travellers could only carry one parcel. Another simplificationis made in the matching strategy by the platform which might have led tosuboptimal drivers for the parcels. Other limitations are caused by flawed datause. Travellers’ and customers’willingness could therefore be unreliable. Also, pedestrian and publictransport travellers are not considered due to data deficiency. Furtherresearch could be done in three ways within this field of study. First, moredata can be gathered to solve the abovementioned limitations. This includesdata on preferential routes for occasional carriers and willingness data fortravellers in all modes. Secondly, other conceptual choices can be made tooptimise the detours per parcel with forecasted travellers, or to conceptualisethe collaboration between conventional and crowdshipping delivery. Finally,research can be done to study intervention methods and corresponding legalpossibilities for the public administration to limit travellers’ detours.","Crowdshipping; Agent-­based; Simulation; Case study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

This issue is aggravated when considering the 200.000 houses that still need to be built in the region in the upcoming decade, increasing the amount of waste and pollution produced, not only by the construction of new houses, but also by new infrastructure. The province government has multiple obligations to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and so has committed to achieving an entirely circular economy by 2050.This report focuses on the Construction and Demolition sector and its implications on the province’s spatial structure, focusing on three key themes: housing, socio-spatial justice, and the C&amp;D Sector.By using methods and practices found in Soft Planning theories, such as soft spaces, horizontal structure of stakeholders and open-ended proposals and design policies, the outcome of this research provides new perspectives on how to tackle social and spatial inequalities for the province of South Holland, whilst shaping the C&amp;D Sector towards more sustainable, circular practices. The soft transition takes the existing initiatives within the construction sector into account and aims for utmost collaboration with all stakeholders. Particular attention is paid to low-income neighborhoods that bear the brunt of construction companies’ externalities and do not directly benefit from their proximity to educational institutions and job opportunities. Resultantly, a set of patterns is formulated in order to set the stage for co-creation and facilitate the collaboration of the different actors at the scale of province, city and neighborhood. The report further details how these patterns could be applied on a contextual basis, and explores these scenarios in two locations within the province; Binckhorst, in The Hague, and Dordrecht.","Circular construction & demolition sector; Housing; Socio-spatial justice; Soft planning; Circular jobs","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","AR2U086 R&D Studio – Spatial Strategies for the Global Metropolis",""

The M4H is an area where, in the past, heavy dock work was carried out. Space has now been made to expand residential Rotterdam with high-density housing and facilities and to transform the area into a working-living environment. Children and their families’ presence in this future city is essential for the vitality of it, and quality of life in it. At the same time, a family home does not consist out of one type. In recent decades the composition of the standard family (the family of a father, a mother, and an average of two children) is fragmented into a wide variety of family compositions. The one-parent family, a family in which one parent raises one or more children without a second parent in the picture, is one of them. This type of family has an increasing share in our society. In addition, a large number of these families live in Rotterdam. It would be beneficial to keep it that way. The Keilewijk design offers housing for one-parent families in future Rotterdam. Keilewijk pays attention to a clear division between the domain of the public, the collective, the family and the individual. The design offers suitable homes and collective spaces for one-parent families, which at the same time -based on American sociologist Richard Senett's theories of the Open City- can contribute to the support of inclusiveness in future Rotterdam. Keilewijk represents a design in which a wide variety of suitable homes stacked together form an intimate vertical neighbourhood. A design that offers room for children to, step by step, take distance from their front door and to gradually get to know their city of Rotterdam.","family dwelling; Inclusive City; Dutch Housing; Modern families; Rotterdam; Collective Housing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Dwelling","","51.907639, 4.432083"

Dutch painter, architect, engineer, town planner, draughtsman, glass painter Hans Vredeman de Vries(1526-1609) mastered one of these discoveries, perspective, and invented his imaginary worlds with his pen and paper. He was a unique figure who contained many scales of and between art and architecture. By visiting antiquity and going through the frame of artworks, this paper investigates this playful dynamism between art and architecture in the world of Hans Vredeman de Vries.","AR2A011; art and architecture; Hans Vredeman de Vries; Scale Change; Dutch Renaissance; Frame of Art","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

The agrifood sector is the largest contributor with an annual turnover ofabout € 5.5 billion. About half of the surface of the province is dedicated to thissector, entailing many jobs and steering innovation worldwide. In line with theambitious target of the Dutch government the province aims to be fully circularin 2050. This means the agrifood sector is facing an enormous transition.However, the sector faces several major socio-spatial and environmentalchallenges. The current monoculture food landscapes contribute to 20% ofGHG emissions, consumes 67% of fresh water, and results in subsidence,salination and lack of biodiversity. Additionally, with the challenge to build230.000 houses and the space needed for energy transition and nature,the pressure on space increases. The distribution of these negativeexternalities results in socio-spatial inequality, placing a burden on mainlylower income communities, including a lower socio-economic positionfor farmers. Nature-inclusive agriculture has the potential to tackle theseissues as an overarching framework. How can the agrifood sector in theProvince of South Holland transition to a nature inclusive circular system?This project aims to have a 100% nature-inclusive agrifood sector in 2050.To reach this goal, this project starts by further investigating the currentlinear system and its environmental social and spatial issues. It can beconcluded that the socio-spatial challenges are most present in the fringeswithin the province. Hence, a regional vision and strategy are proposedthat transform the linear-manufacture-waste model into a circular andnature-inclusive agrifood sector, through re-activation of the fringes inthe province. The fringes offer a high potential for implementation of avariety of nature-inclusive and circular functions, that can be establishedthrough stakeholder engagement, co-creation and participation of localresidents. Part of the strategy are 3 fringe typologies, that can be expandedthroughout the region. As a result, the agrifood landscapes become morenature-inclusive and resilient, with a shorter and more just food chain, whilstsimultaneously providing equitable access to healthy and accessible food.This report is interesting for governance parties or businesses in theagrifood sector that aim to transition to a circular economy. It could alsobe valuable for knowledge or educational institutions related to agriculture,food, nature-inclusive or transition methods, and regional spatial planning.","Circular Economy; Nature Inclusive Agriculture; agrifood sector; socio-spatial justice; fringes","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","AR2U086 R&D Studio – Spatial Strategies for the Global Metropolis",""

Further continuing this trend of exploitation and destruction of ecology will only worsen the planetary stresses the Anthropocene has established. Hence emerges the urgent necessity to reorganize and reinvent our current food system towards a sustainable and circular one to sustain life on our planet. Accordingly, the primary goal of this project is to achieve sustainability in the food sector, thereby achieving circularity and food security. The Netherlands has an extraordinary position in the global market and is globally leading in agricultural research, technology and innovation. Therefore it could prove to be fruitful to develop a regional sustainable agricultural model that could become a role model for sustainable agriculture globally. The vision is to reduce the spatial impact of our food system while discontinuing the destruction of new habitats. To achieve this, a healthy diet must be embraced, which not only proves to significantly improve our health but also facilitate a transition towards a healthier planet. By evaluating the spatial, environmental and health impacts of the current model, the negative externalities at each stage of the food sector are investigated. The diversification of the crops to be grown within South Holland is crucial in order to facilitate the transition from a food exporter to a self-sufficient region with respect to the food sector. To encourage more sustainable food production and enhance the relationship between people and their food production, it is invaluable to invest more power in the producers. Finally, the various steps involved in the food systems and the gap between people and the source of their food are reduced by initiating big food retail corporations to focus on food production. Thus, the transformation of the food industry through the integration of a sustainable agriculture model and reshaping the public’s perception of food consumption and dietary needs, will ultimately create a more healthy and balanced landscape, while aiming towards the collective goal of mitigating climate change.","agrifood sector; self sufficiency; diet change; landuse; crop diversification; biodiversity; Planetary Boundaries; sustainable agriculture; lancet diet; South Holland","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

Action is needed now and circularity can help to make sectors more sustainable. The agri-food sector plays a big role in this, as we need three times the surface area of our country to support the needs of the inhabitants.The agri-food sector is putting too much pressure on space and resources and this pressure will only increase as the population continues to grow. However, by creating spaces that are used more efficiently this pressure can be reduced while also providing for a growing population.Decreasing the pressure of the agrifood sector on space and resources will lead to a drastically new South Holland in 2050. To achieve this new South Holland, research will be done on several aspects. First the current situation needs to be analysed. Furthermore, research is needed on possible interventions and the future implications of these interventions. After extensive research is done, a vision of 2050 can be formulated:By 2050, both the land and the sea are used in a space-efficient way, reducing the (carbon-) footprint of the province and providing more food for its own population. Buying and eating local food have encouraged people to become more aware of the process and where the food comes from. This has resulted in a shift in diet and the inefficient space for cattle farms is reduced.This conversion provides space for nature, housing and agriculture while also leaving room for the plans of the next generation. By reducing the meat and the dairy industry, space opens up for more nature and some small scale housing in the green heart. To replace the loss of dietary protein, the province makes a shift towards seaweed and aquaculture. More circularity is achieved through the use of “waste” streams of the harbour, horticulture, arable farming and the meat and dairy industry","","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

A key challenge in designing an optimal control system for this purpose is modeling the unsteady aerodynamic loads in a form convenient for control analysis, namely, a state-space form. In this thesis, three novel approaches for generating state-space realizations of unsteady aerodynamic loads, with one varying parameter, are presented. The approaches are based on parametric Loewner frameworks, namely, transfer matrix interpolation, global basis, and multivariate interpolation. The parametric Loewner frameworks are combined with additional techniques for reducing the system to standard, stable form. The input to the realization problem is the aerodynamic transfer matrix, calculated with a compressible potential solver for a pitching and plunging flat plate at discrete values of reduced frequency and the parameter of interest, free-stream Mach number. An extensive analysis on accuracy, dimension, and dynamic behavior of the parametric state-space models is carried out to determine the approach most suitable for aeroservoelastic applications. It is shown that for the considered aerodynamic model, all the approaches are time efficient and generate highly accurate and low dimensional state-space representations of the unsteady loads. However, when applied to aeroservoelastic modeling, the approach based on multivariate interpolation method is expected to suffer from numerical instabilities due to the high numbers of degrees of freedom. The other two approaches, based on transfer matrix interpolation and global basis, are more suitable for modeling multiple input-multiple output systems and model reduction. Therefore, these approaches are considered appropriate for control design. The conducted research and gained experience suggest that the approach based on global basis is generally preferred over the transfer matrix interpolation based approach. However, in the cases with large sampled sets or drastically changing aerodynamic data over the parameter range of interest, the approach based on transfer matrix interpolation is recommended.","Unsteady Aerodynamics; state-space models; Loewner framework; generalized realization; aeroservoelasticity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

To do so, gain-and-pain-sharing methods that can positively influence a collaborative environment are explored.

Second, the research scope includes projects with high complexity because otherwise, gain-and-pain-sharing do not have effects, and most problems arise due to complexity. Lastly, the research focuses on the client side, since the client chooses the type of contract and criteria. The objective of the research is to provide clients with insight into the gain-and-pain-sharing possibilities and practical implementation steps to implement a gain-and-pain-sharing mechanism to incentivise collaboration. In the literature, different definitions of gain-and-pain sharing were identified and combined into the following definition: ‘Gain-and-pain sharing is defined as an agreement that allows the parties in a construction project to share profits or cost savings and to share losses due to errors or cost increases. Mutual benefits are achieved through gain sharing. Benefits could, for example, also be a reward for one’s delivered work, a bonus or recognition, and losses are the risks’. Based on this definition, the following gain-and-pain-sharing concepts were identified: -Bonus-malus; -Sharing of new created benefits; -Risk pot; -Target cost. The different concepts have different effects and different reasons for use as gain-and-pain sharing mechanisms. The way to deploy the mechanism depends on the choice based on the vision and strategy that the client has for the project. These two elements in turn depend on the company and project objectives, project specifications, experience with collaboration concepts, risk aversion, market conditions and one of the most important conditions, the scope certainty. It can be concluded that the gain-and-pain-sharing mechanism is deployed by different concepts for different purposes to incentivise collaboration and create mutual objectives. This coordination for the implementation of the mechanism is custom-made for each project based on a number of steps.

This can be done by eliminating all horizontal flight segments during the approach phase, reducing theaverage thrust. Such an approach is called a Continuous Descent Approach (CDA) and has been the subject of manystudies. Ideal CDAs are flown with idle thrust, which results in the largest fuel flow reduction but which has a verybig drawback; The vertical profiles of ideal CDAs vary greatly between aircraft making it difficult for ground-basedsystems to predict the exact position of an aircraft ahead of time ([35]). In order to deal with this added uncertainty,additional separation is needed. This greatly reduces the capacity, which means that such a concept can only beused when there is little traffic. ([26]) This greatly limits the benefits since there is very gain during such times. Thereare other types of CDAs, which take away the need for this added uncertainty, however. These are called a fixed orconstant Flight Path Angle (FPA) approaches. Where the FPA during ideal CDAs is optimised by each aircraft’s FlightManagement System (FMS) for that particular flight, an average is used for this type. This average is then flown witha small, off-idle, amount of thrust. Which means that although in general the noise and emission reductions aredecreased when compared to ideal CDAs, ([35], [8]) the capacity is increased ([25]).In this thesis, fixed-route fixed FPA approach procedureswill be designed for the SchipholTMA and compared to currentdesigns. This will be done by trading off the environmental benefits for capacity under robustness and flexibilityconstraints. Although only part of the descent occurs inside of the TMA, most of the emission and noise reductionscan be achieved here as the inefficient level segments that usually occur here are moved to the upper airspace ([32]).","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This thesis aims to provide more insight into the crashworthiness behaviour of a composite aircraft fuselage. This is achieved by studying both analytically and numerically the crushing behaviour of composite energy absorbers. The analytical model, which is based on energy dissipation rates, generalises previously derived analytical models to study a wider variety of structural components. It is found that the analytical model can give an estimation of the mean crushing load of square, C-shaped, and corrugated specimens. Next to the analytical study, numerical models are created to gain insight into the behaviour of the studied shapes when subjected to crash loading. Another part of the numerical study investigates the effectiveness of different material models to capture the complex failure mechanism of the composite crash absorber. In LS-Dyna, the MAT054, MAT058, and MAR262 material models are used, which are all able to reproduce the results obtained from reference tests. The ability of the material models to recreate the crushing phenomenon is thought to originate from the opportunity LS-Dyna offers to degrade material properties in the crush frond, which incorporates the formation of cracks and delaminations. In the final stage of this research, a case study is performed, where different absorbers are introduced into a simplified digital twin of the Next Generation Multifunctional Fuselage Demonstration as developed by the STUNNING project. Here, it is found that the fuselage's energy absorption can be increased by introducing energy absorbers. All the simulated fuselage sections show similar behaviour in the first crash stages, characterised by the flattening of the lower section of the frame. Subsequently, the behaviour of the absorber and the surrounding structure highly depends on the absorber's integration. Finally, it is found that by combining the numerical results of a baseline fuselage section and the analytical model for the energy absorbers, one can estimate the energy absorption of the augmented structure with a discrepancy of less than 20$\%$. This proves that the suggested analytical-numerical method can aid engineers during the preliminary design for crashworthiness of a thermoplastic composite aircraft fuselage.","Analytical; Numerical; Crashworthiness; Thermoplastic; Composite; Fuselage design; Aircraft","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The municipality has identified that there is a need for improvement on this aspect to fulfil their ambition to support citizens beyond mitigation of the impact of poverty and offer citizens opportunities to get out of poverty. Research has been conducted on the phenomenon of poverty, the poverty reduction system, stakeholders in the system and relevant trends and developments. Based on insights from this research a desired future for the poverty reduction system has been formulated. This desired future consists of a simple system that stimulates prevention of problems, offers integral support, works with a personal approach, is based on trust and is a system in which impact is reflected on. Several possible directions to arrive to this desired future and solutions within these directions are explored and have led to a strategy for the municipality: Working towards a poverty reduction system that offers integral support to Utrechters in poverty by connecting them with the right organisations in the system. This strategy consists of three steps and has been given shape in the form of a concept. The concept consists of a tool to enable guiding organisations in the poverty reduction system to identify integral support and connect with organisations that offer the identified forms of support. This way the guiding organisations can provide citizens with integral support.","Poverty; Design; Systemic design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","This exploratory study was performed to improve the understanding of the emerging phenomena of Business Model Innovation (BMI) and Corporate Venture Capital (CVC), in the context of European electric utilities. More specifically, the potential contribution of CVC activities to BMI of European electric utilities was assessed. A thorough literature study and consultation with two external energy industry experts were conducted, complemented by a case study addressing two incumbent European electric utilities. These included Dutch utility Eneco with its CVC unit Eneco Ventures, and French utility ENGIE with its CVC unit ENGIE New Ventures. First, four different business models for electric utilities were identified: Traditional Utility, Green Utility, Cooperative Utility, and Prosumer Utility. The latter three of these all emerged during the past decade as (partly) response to six main developments that are changing the energy sector. These include the ‘Three D’s’ (Decarbonization, Decentralization, Digitalization), as well as Electrification of end-use sectors, Energy system flexibility, and Energy efficiency at demand-side. It turned out that traditional (incumbent) utilities are currently insufficiently aligned with the six developments, and their viability is challenged by innovative newcomers in the industry. As a result, they are in need for fundamental business model innovation. However, this is a highly complex process, subject to many potential barriers. Of a first set of 31 mutually exclusive potential barriers to BMI of traditional utilities, 28 were found to be relevant. These included both generic barriers hindering all BMI in general (despite sector or company differences), and specific barriers hindering BMI of incumbent utilities in specific domains related to the six energy sector developments. Subsequently, the CVC domain was assessed. A first set of 21 mutually exclusive potential benefits of CVC activities was identified. Besides the fact that CVC can lead to financial gains, in line with its purpose as instrument for stimulating BMI the remaining 20 benefits are strategic. Of these 21 potential benefits, eleven were found to be relevant for traditional utilities, mainly including the most strategic ones. Integration of the two subjects led to a first set of 29 potential relationships between barriers to BMI and benefits of CVC activities of traditional utilities. Of these 29, eighteen were confirmed, affecting seven CVC benefits and eleven BMI barriers. Hence, it was found that CVC activities can deliver a valuable contribution to BMI of traditional utilities by helping them to overcome multiple important barriers, which must ultimately result in better alignment with the energy sector developments. The affected barriers mainly include organizational and company resource barriers, but also one financial and profitability related barrier, one awareness related barrier, and one institutional barrier. Also, CVC can have a general accelerating effect on BMI. However, the contribution of CVC does not extend to most regulatory, technological, and awareness barriers to BMI. All in all, the potential contribution of CVC to BMI of traditional utilities is significant, but other organizational instruments will be required to help traditional utilities tackle their massive challenges.","Business Model Innovation; corporate venture capital; electric utilities; Energy industry; Energy Transition; business model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The project site is the Maasmond at the port of Rotterdam. It covers an area of almost 10 km2 and, on average, a monthly volume of 400.000 cubic meters of sediment needs to be dredged. The operations are currently performed using trailing suction hopper dredgers (TSHD). Several new fully working emission free concept work methods were designed. These were assessed using a multi-criteria analysis, where emphasis was placed on energy reduction, reliability, interference, risk and safety. Given the scope of this research, costs are not decisive. General conclusions for the solutions contain the splitting of the total process. As the energy consumption of a conventional hopper is too high to operate on a battery cell, the work method is split into three different processes being:<br/>(i) gathering, (ii) pumping and (iii) transportation. Two work methods scored best in this research, Sloped Water Injection Dredging (SWID) and the Fully Autonomous Submerged Dredger (FASD). SWID consists of Water Injection Dredging vessels, fixed structures and autonomous barges. FASD contains the design of a submerged dredging vessel. It can be concluded that a harbour environment is suitable to perform emissions free maintenance dredging with only small alterations to the current technology.","Dredging; Maintenance; Emission Free; Boskalis; Harbour","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","","51.950235, 4.1463090"

Right now the province of South Holland copes with a conflict of space, as there is a need for more housing, renewable energy infrastructure, food, and nature. There is not enough land to keep up with the current trends and this creates many conflicts. The behaviour of the actors within the food chain leads to a linear food sector which is cost efficient but needs a lot of land for export of products. Furthermore it produces a lot of unnecessary waste and pollution.These conflicts could be prevented by changing the way we consume and use our land. The agricultural sector needs to be more space efficient, by using new technological advances. We can make the sector more efficient by changing the behaviour of the actors in the food chain. In the future everyone should be able to live in a healthy and sustainable South Holland. By changing consuming behaviour and methods of farming we can create interesting new foodscapes while solving the conflicts.The following steps are recommended for the development of circular economy. First, we will consume more consciously by eating more local and less meat. As a result, exports are no longer important and a lot of space is freed up in the port. Later, the farmer will use new technology and can produce, through vertical farms and withcultured meat, more on smaller pieces of land. This frees up a lot of space, leaving enough space for people and nature.This not only means that in the future it will be possible to buy a house in South Holland. It also shows that we relate differently to nature and the world around us, reducing climate change and boosting biodiversity.","Circular economy; food chain; behavior; conflict of space; foodscape","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","AR2U086 R&D Studio – Spatial Strategies for the Global Metropolis",""

Currently, consumers are disconnected from where their food is produced, leading to a high environmental impact, unhealthy choices and social injustice to the farmers’ work. The proposed strategy of change for the region would see South Holland shift away from being an export based business of livestock farming, lowering and limiting production to local needs, while changing the attitude of farming, and reshaping it as a spatial part of everyday life, freely accessible to the region’s citizens. In order to do that a strategy of transitions is chosen, recognizing three core spatial movements based on the three pillars of sustainability; diet transition, attitude transition and technical transition. Diet Transition - changes in food consumption would also affect the spatial landscape upon which food is produced. Attitude Transition - raising awareness toward how meat and dairy is produced would affect the cities where consumption takes place and how the different actors are treated. Technical Transition - would help change the Dutch industrial sites from an exporter of goods to an exporter of knowledge while supplying it with clean energy, creating a better South Holland while benefiting other countries. In the vision, it is recognized that these movements have spatial manifestations in the form of rings, with their points of overlap being ideal to the beginning of change, as they are where new sustainable relations would be most meaningful. These zones are where the transition of attitude, diet and technology will happen for the circular agriculture in South-Holland. A toolkit of 21 typologies is created with a focus on these transitions while keeping a pleasant environment. The new vision will lead to a circular economy in the livestock sector of South-Holland with sustainable relations between producers and consumers.","circular economy; South-Holland; agrifood sector; Stakeholder participation; value change","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","AR2U086 R&D Studio – Spatial Strategies for the Global Metropolis",""

This ongoing harbour activity played an important part in the stimulation of the industrial development of Rotterdam Harbour and along with this also in the development of the building itself and its adjacent neighborhoods. Along with the industrial development, the demands for the building kept growing, until the Maassilo could no longer meet them and the Harbour industry had to shift away leaving the building unused. After this the Maassilo had been redeveloped, with respect to the existing, to house an event program. Even though this redevelopment respected what was left in and around the Maassilo, the new event program does not use these still existing elements to remind to the history of the building and place. Instead, it overshadows this rich history. In order to give light to this history, this project has been approached from a specific position: as the caretaker of the history of Maassilo. This position has been taken in order to define how to treat this building and the various elements it still consists of. These elements can serve as tools to remind to the historical narrative of the building and place. Since the history is made clear by the narrative, the elements that contribute to this narrative have been treated with the utmost care. In this project the Maassilo has been treated in a way that uses its still existing elements as tools to remind to its historical narrative. This taken position in combination with the needs of the adjacent neighborhoods resulted in a design that contributes to the awakening of the spirit of the Maassilo as well as the wellbeing of the inhabitants by improving the connection between the building and its adjacent neighborhoods, implementing a food-related program that responds to the needs of these neighborhoods, and by revealing the concrete grain silos by making cuts through them.","Harbour Heritage; Maashaven; Heritage & Architecture; Historical narrative; Caretaker of History; Rotterdam Harbour; Maassilo; Grainsilo","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","","51.898130778646774, 4.494843051897923"

Next, it will discuss the history of the American Shopping Mall, since the origin of the Dutch Shopping Centre can be traced back to this typology. After the historical analysis of the American Mall, a spatial analysis will be made to Tunderstand the building characteristics of these typologies. Ending with the history and success of the shopping centre in the Netherlands.","AR2A011; Shopping mall; Shopping centre; Human scale; Accessibility; Integration","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","With the significant industrial and economic growth of the beginning of the twentieth century life was busy and of fast pace. Every now and then citizens wanted to escape from reality. Spending time in nature became popular and eventually the trend of outdoor-living emerged. After having been outside for a while people were able to return to their hectic city-life again. Outdoor recreation and camping laid the ground of what is now known as the weekend-, summer- or holiday house. The ones who could afford it let their own private summerhouse be designed in order to get regenerated by nature. Two main contrasting design approaches for summer houses were noticeable in the Netherlands between 1930-1940; romantic-picturesque and hygienic-sporting. The following question is researched: How did the two prominent ways of designing summer houses fulfil their originally intended function in the Netherlands between 1930-1940? Literary review on the emergence and development of the summer houses and their synonyms served as a background for the later discussed case studies. A series of case studies is included in a catalogue that is attached in the appendix. It was determined that the romantic-picturesque approach was most commonly used. It was characterised by proper integration in the environment and a focus on the exterior rather than the interior. The summerhouse was used after having spent time in nature all day. Therefore, protection against nature was provided by making little interruptions in the exterior and therefore giving it a closed character. The hygienic-sporting approach was characterized by the blurring of the building’s borders, letting interior overflow into exterior and therefore literally meeting the outdoor-living demands. Huge openable curtain walls made the garden an extension of the living room and lured people to do sports and play games outside. The focus was rather on the functionality than the aesthetic value. The research elaborates on the two main design approaches but does not deny the existing of in-between approaches as well.","AR2A011; summer houses; weekend houses; holiday residences; outdoor-living; romantic-picturesque; hygienic-sporting; the Netherlands; 1930s","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

Instead of only serving as reminders of pain or symbols of commemoration, in recent years some European memorials actually contribute to the liveliness of urban public space and find their new roles to assimilate into city life. In this case, it is necessary to redefine the role of memorials in contemporary times and explore new ways to integrate them into urban daily public life. This research aims to investigate how contemporary memorials can be actively integrated into the daily life of the public as inviting public spaces and support various activities to enhance spatial vitality and commemorative effects through the case studies of the Berlin Wall at Potsdamer Platz, the Memorial Bridge in Rijeka, and Princess Diana Memorial Fountain. The paper concludes with recommendations for design strategies to enhance the spatial vitality of contemporary memorials, which can potentially be helpful to the architectural memorial practice.","AR2A011; memorial; public space; spatial vitality; daily public life","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011","52.509905, 13.376324"

Starting with the socio-cultural changes from this period for the Netherlands and the United States, it can be stated that the Second World War had a major influence on the way in which the mentally ill were looked upon by society in both countries. This has ultimately resulted in a general deinstitutionalization in the mental healthcare in the Western developed countries, where the care for the mentally ill shifted from the institution towards the community. Furthermore global medicinal developments resulted in new psychotropic drugs that improved the manageability of patients. This made it possible to develop new socio-therapies that focussed on creating social connections for patients as a form of group therapy. New psychotropic drugs also made it possible to transition from distinguishing mental patients in manageability to a distinction in treatment methods. In both countries it was tried to normalize mental illness in society and to implement the newly developed treatment methods in the organization of mental care. This implementation was clearly visible in both countries in the form of indoor and outdoor space for group therapy and additional sports facilities. In the Netherlands, the socialization of the mentally ill was attempted by bringing the institution and society closer together and by representing ‘normal’ society as well as possible. In the United States, this was attempted by leaving the institute completely behind and having the mental care of patients taken care of by their communities in the form of Community Mental Health Centres. In both cases, the healthcare facilities are based on a particular community with different needs. This makes it difficult to identify universal mental care architecture for both countries. That is why the focus is on the organization of and influences on psychiatric healthcare institutions and the differences in this between the countries.","AR2A011; Mental health; Architecture; post-war; Dutch; Reconstruction","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

Various studies have been done on Singapore’s economic growth and urban development. However, the literature that looks at the relation between these topics is limited. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to find out how urban design and the establishment of MNC’s are interconnected. The research is conducted through existing literature reviews on interest factors that are important for MNC’s decision-making. These factors are linked to urban design aspects that are integrated within Singapore’s city structure. Aspects that will be taken into consideration are infrastructure and green spaces. Next, the impact of MNC establishment on the urban design aspects of Singapore’s CBD will be analysed through the use of primary sources. The main findings are that the quality of urban design is of insignificant importance for the establishment of MNCs in the early development stages. Urban design influence for future investment decisions remains unclear. However, the investments from MNCs were a major factor that shaped the CBD’s urban design into what it is today.","AR2A011; Singapore; Urban design; Multinationals; Quality of life; CBD","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011","1.2801,103.8509"

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic forced an important part of the population to stay home and to experience the telework. This context of major crisis was an opportunity for utopists and idealists to speculate about the future of the general organization of our civilization. On June 9th 2020, the New York Times wrote “What If Working From Home Goes On… Forever?”. In such climate of uncertainty, especially at the beginning of the crisis, this question was relevant to ask. One year later, the generalist utopia gave the floor to a more nuanced reality. The most common tendency suggests a hybrid solution between the office and the home working with one major argument: Flexibility. What is sure now is that the concept of office building will deeply change in the next years. Or did it already? In 2016, Carlo Ratti was already asking the question “If work is digital, why do we still go to the office?”. It is because an office space is much more than a place where employees work individually behind the screen of a computer. Otherwise, telework would be commonly used since its apparition in the 1990’s. There is a need of social interactions, of knowledge sharing. The intention of this paper will be to take a step back in the history of workspaces in order to analyze and highlight its evolution as well as the changing consideration of the employee and therefore the investments made to increase his comfort at the office. Focusing mainly on the situation in Belgium, the intention is to precisely understand the social, economic and political dynamics that influenced the evolution of work environment. An emphasis will be made on the New Ways of Working strategy (NWoW), a recent approach of the office space mainly developed in Belgium and the Netherlands.","AR2A011; office building; comfort; Management; Covid-19","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

The position of the School of Hunstanton in the architectural debate of the post-war period is mainly determined by its contrast with the Hertfordshire Schools. This was due to the fact both buildings stood for something that was part of a broader public debate over the role of architecture under the Welfare State: Hertfordshire for only taking flexible building system and well-being of children into account and Hunstanton for not subjecting architecture to political concerns. This contradiction in the architectural debate affected the way in which Hunstanton was viewed, namely either as a functional school building or as an architectural statement.","School of Hunstanton; Smithson; Hertfordshire; New Brutalism; Image","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

The initial goal of the section was to contribute to the elimination of women's oppression by expanding the knowledge of this social reality. The emergence of the second feminist wave in 1960 in the Netherlands motivated women to establish female study groups, to link societal changes to the academic content. In 1977, architecture students in Delft followed this trend and organized female consultations at the Faculty of Architecture. They started sharing personal experiences concerning the women’s movement linked to their position within the faculty and the architectural profession in general. Despite internal disagreement from the faculty’s dean, the consultations ultimately led to the official course of Women’s Studies in 1978. The goal of the course shifted during the first years from the “oppression of women in the built environment” into a more scientific field of the “construction of gender differences”. In 1986, staff members started questioning the future of the section. They believed that two scenarios were possible for the development of Women’s Studies: the section could continue as a separate study field or integrate with existing research areas. Unfortunately, for the future of feminist studies at the Faculty of Architecture neither of these scenarios became reality. The section lost its support, and therefore the needed money flow, and got disbanded in 1998. The aim of this research is to link recent questions concerning the position of women in architecture to the achievements of the Women’s Studies section 40 years ago. The current activism is linked to the persistent gender gap in architectural practice, which shows that the topics covered by the Women’s Studies course are still relevant today. In the current women’s movement, the subject goes beyond the oppression of women and into intersectionality, in which the societal discrimination of multiple social groups comes to light. To bring about actual change, listening to and talking with the students is not enough. They need the right resources to take that next step in the women’s movement to eliminate inequality and exclusion in universities.","AR2A011; Women’s Studies; Architectural Education; Anna Vos; Heidi De Mare; Intersectionality; Delft University of Technology","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

One of them – Lithuania – got independent from the Russian Empire in 1918. More than 100 years of occupation left deep scars in Lithuania’s history. A revival became both an opportunity and a significant challenge. Two years after Lithuania got independent, the capital Vilnius was occupied by Poland and the second-largest city Kaunas was announced as the provisional capital. This significant historical moment determined radical transformations of Kaunas city. Restoring the Lithuanian identity, especially without Vilnius, became one of the major priorities. Therefore, trying to create Lithuanians’ architectural style served as a tool for inspiring society and for showing the advanced progress of the newly reborn country to the rest of Europe. These modernist buildings of Kaunas were named as the Architecture of Optimism. The positive feeling about Lithuania’s future was prevailing at that period because the country has not seen such radical progress of living environment in ages. In just 20 years Kaunas from countryside looking area became a modern, competitive city: the centre of academic, economic and political life. The city’s number of residents increased from 92 to 155 thousand (Vaitekūnas, 2021). This situation strongly influenced the architectural and urban identity of the city. From newly built individual art deco style houses to an art museum – distinctive modernist architectural style reflected the search for national identity and the turn towards the West. Architecture students that were coming back from abroad to independent Lithuania affected these searches drastically. The mix of modern Western approach and traditional values influenced previously mentioned distinction of architecture.","AR2A011; Kaunas; Modernism","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

The movement draws its inspiration from the Golden Age of Flanders during the Renaissance which had a strong architectural identity. The style started in Antwerp where it became really popular and rapidly spread to Brussels. The pavilion presented for the International Exposition of Paris in 1878 embodied this national style. Despite all of this, the style did not manage to become widely used in the whole country and even less in Wallonia, the French-speaking part of the country.

The historical, social, political and linguistic situation implies the division between the communities since the creation of the country. The lack of representation and the sense of belonging from a part of the population and the rise of the Flamingant movement at the same period influenced the Flemish Revival’s tracks.

In 1917 he and six other well-known architects, started a magazine ´De Stijl´, a manifest for Dutch Modernism in art and architecture. Five years later, in 1922, Oud withdrew himself from De Stijl, but he continued to design according to the manifest of ‘De Stijl’. Examples are ‘Het Witte Dorp’ (1923) and ‘Café de Unie’ (1924). With the residential district ‘De Kiefhoek’ (1928), he gained national and international fame.<br/><br/>Oud always struggled with the style of Modernism. After a period of strictly designing modern buildings in the 1920s, he experimented with forms that did not relate to the Modern architectural bases. Before and during WWII II, from 1938 until 1942, he built the head office of Shell in The Hague. The building was completed in 1946. His design of this building was poorly received. Most of the Modern architectural critics had no sympathy for this ‘old fashioned’ way of designing. As a result, Oud’s name was removed from all the magazines and his articles were refused in other countries.<br/><br/>This thesis will investigate why the Shell building of J.J.P. Oud was generally rejected by critics. Through thorough investigation in literature and notes of Oud, regarding the design of the Shell building, the explanation of the frame of mind behind the design will be analysed. In addition to the first hand sources, also secondary resources, such as books and articles, will be explored. These secondary resources will give an explanation of the rejection of the critics towards the design of the Shell building.","J.J.P.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Radical experimentation, formal plurality, and oscillation between architecture and visual arts permeated the 50s and 60s generation of architects and artists on both sides of the politically divided Europe. Central and Eastern European examples from this period are often undervalued, if addressed at all, both by Western European standards and even their local contexts. VAL—Voies et Aspects du Lendemain—collective was formed in 1968 Czechoslovakia by the conceptual artist Alex Mlynárčik and the architects Viera Mecková and Ľudovít Kupkovič. VAL developed eight distinct utopias and megastructures in parallel to the global trends and Michel Ragon’s techno-centric theory of prospective architecture. As the height of VAL’s activity coincides with the peak of the normalisation period in the 70s Czechoslovakia, their utopian projects remain resistant to clear-cut interpretation then and now. Heliopolis, Akusticon, and the People’s Assembly of Argillia are three distinct projects of VAL explored in reference to the themes of monumentality and architecture-sculpture, prospective architecture, and performance art influenced by Nouveau Réalisme. Despite the unobstructed idealism that VAL emanates, it is argued that VAL’s proposals go beyond an uncritical techno-positive utopia and can hardly be distilled from the irony and socio-cultural critique. And it is in the act of designing the libertarian utopias that VAL members found a form of individual escapism as means to express themselves creatively and to manageably live in a totalitarian regime—utopia as escapism. By subverting the expectations of what are the forms of expressing architectural dissent, escapism is understood as an act of resistance.

Since the first commercially available computer was released in 1951, a digital revolution was started across contexts - exposing new ways to connect disparate fields. Digital geographers Sarah Elwood and Katharyne Mitchell concluded that digital approaches inevitably change ways of knowing, remembering, and communicating across space, time, and collective memory. When it comes to trauma-related museums, the rise of digital initiatives allowed the public to access traumatic collective memory beyond space and time limits. Moreover, by the beginning of 2020, with worldwide lockdown measures under the Covid-19 pandemic, digital developments have become a new impulse. To deal with new challenges, some museums started providing online virtual tours via web conferencing software to the public who cannot visit museums physically. The study of the impact of digital media on memorial museums helps to grasp trends in museums’ digitization and explore the possibilities of memorial museums’ development in an interdisciplinary way. Against these backgrounds, this article aims to investigate the role of digital media technologies in contemporary trauma-related museums - especially memorial museums. The objective is to critically reflect on the digitization of traumatic memory and explore the boundary between physical articles and digital artefact. Moreover, this study hopes to raise key issues for media scholars more broadly in terms of developing critical practice concerning new technologies, as well as for historians, museum and memorial curators.","AR2A011; memorial museum; digitization; collective memory; cultural trauma","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011","40.711362349869894, -74.01260043178357"

The environmental, psychological and economical benefits of green space in rapid urban densification is clearly evident and increasingly, green is (re)introduced in cities. Private, public or collective green spaces are also strong enablers for civic engagement. The focus of extant research has mainly been on public or private green spaces while collective green spaces seem less investigated. This thesis endeavours to join different disciplines connecting collective green spaces, linking these to spaces in Amsterdam built in the late 19th, early 20th century, and investigates if use has changed over the last century. Three characteristics were identified used for the analysis of collective green spaces: ownership, accessibility and sociability. The case studies investigated are: Vondelpark, Bellamyplein and Zaanhof. The analysis shows that ownership has indeed changed over the last century, but that accessibility and sociability remained relatively similar, within the historical boundaries and zeitgeist of the different periods. Ownership changed from private to public as maintenance could not be afforded anymore and municipalities controlled urban planning. Collective green spaces were designed to bring residents together, providing play areas for children and to enjoy nature individually or together; this is still very accurate 100 years later. While this research has made a small contribution to the research canon, further research could investigate additional characteristics and expand the number of collective green spaces in Amsterdam, the Netherlands or internationally.","AR2A011; Collective Spaces; Green Spaces; Amsterdam","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

In this case, temporary medical structures become indispensable. The Covid 19 pandemic brought to the fore architectural challenges such as the spatial reorganization of healthcare facilities for high occupancy levels, the issue of infection control, the integration of new technologies, and the flexible and sustainable use of space. As a result, planners were urged to think about flexible and adaptable structures that were efficient in terms of materials, time, effort, and cost. This resulted in innovative solutions from which we can learn for future crisis and emergency situations. <br/>The goal of this thesis is to create a ""catalogue"" of design strategies within the typology of temporary medical structures that can be applied to future projects during the Covid 19 pandemic but can also be applied to other scenarios where requirements overlap. Therefore, temporary medical structures before and during the Covid 19 pandemic will be embedded in their broader context and examined according to specific parameters. These parameters revolve around hygiene, psychological aspects, program, technology, and the architectural context. The analysis of the case studies is based on publications, articles, statements, and interviews with healthcare professionals. In this way, the reader is provided with an in-depth overview of strategies that can be implemented in temporary medical structures to solve challenges posed by crisis and emergency situations.","AR2A011; Covid-19 pandemic; Temporary medical structures; Medical architecture; Healthcare architecture; temporary architecture","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

However, because it does not yet have global recognition and the tiny house movement is still very young, there is a need to first understand what a tiny house entails, where this movement comes from, and what the reasons are for people to switch to this lifestyle. With the answers to these questions, a more concrete look at the Netherlands will be undertaken. Literature research will be conducted and existing research based on surveys with tiny house enthusiasts will be used to provide answers to the above. This thesis contributes to the interdisciplinary literature on this topic. With the outcome that tiny houses can offer solutions to the housing shortage in the Netherlands and in the field of environmental sustainability, it is recommended to conduct deeper research in the future to get an even better grasp on what ways tiny houses can contribute to this.","AR2A011; Tiny House; Movement; Contemporary Lifestyle","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

Despite the differences between the two buildings, they share similar starting points regarding the sites they are located in. The plots alone comprised a challenge for the architects who had to deal with the strong presence of natural elements, such as water and soil, as well as their adaptation to the historic built environment that they belong to.In order to indulge in projects’ architectural characteristics, it entails the understanding of the reasons that led to a specific design - the main factors that shaped the compositions. Therefore, this thesis questions how their syntheses were developed, what were the starting points of each design, as well as the differences between each architectural approach. It is significant to understand the main references of each project, as well as the ultimate aspiration of each building, meaning what the architects wanted to achieve apart from a functional building. Comprehending the theoretical framework of the architects, is an imperative step for answering the question of what can be learned from the design process in architecture.The research topic requires the adoption of a mixed-methods approach. The sources used, consist of archival material, preliminary sketches, literature, and material of the design phase provided by the projects’ architects upon request. Aiming to gain a better understanding of the physical buildings on a personal level, site visits are a mandatory prerequisite too. Besides, municipal documents give valuable insights into the development of these projects, in the context of their greater setting. Finally, conducting interviews with the principal architects of the projects, will give a new perspective on the design process of the projects. Moreover, the studied literature will be translated and visualized through personal illustrations, allowing for the development of a personal proposal of the5design process of the projects.

The analysis focuses on tracking changes in intensity and distribution of urban diversity in representative moments of Matera’s development, from the expansion of the vernacular neighbourhood of the Sassi with the 1950s introduction of modernist architecture, through the present-day. Whilst the historic center of the city, dating back to the Neolithic, has experienced remarkable economic growth and continues to thrive under the impulse of international recognition, the more peripheral modernist neighbourhoods are in decline, despite their widely acknowledged architectural and cultural value. Provided as a political answer to the lack of suitable and affordable housing after World War II, these often forgotten neighbourhoods are representative of the Italian re-construction efforts, guided by Adriano Olivetti’s Community Movement and designed by a team of architects, lead by Ludovico Quaroni and Luigi Piccinato, under the theoretical framework of Friedrich G. Friedmann. Initially intended to recreate the forms of aggregations and social ties of the Sassi in modern forms of living, neighbourhoods such as La Martella, Borgo Venusio and Spine Bianche have experienced progressive decline, whilst the historic center of Matera has been object of public investment and continues to be a sought destination. This research will enquire the role urban diversity has played in this discrepancy in order to derive conclusions that might inform present and future urban planning policies. The Diversity Index Method developed by Dan C. Baciu and Callum Birchall (Baciu, Birchall, 2021) applied to primary historic records will be used alongside secondary literature to analyse the different urban configurations to find patterns that lead to urban density or isolation. The preliminary argument is that diversity of both building uses and outdoor public infrastructure leads to growth and urban vitality, whereas mono-functional developments lead to isolation and decline.","AR2A011; Diversity; city growth; Vicinato; Mapping; Diversity map; neighbourhood; vernacular; modernist utopia; Matera","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011","40.6664, 16.6043"

However, in the deep South of the country, a city remained alien to this progress. Indeed, isolated for a long time, it was unable to challenge new immigration movements and ended up exceeding its saturation limit. That town was Matera, the ‘Shame of Italy’. In a country projected towards the new millennium, it was unacceptable that almost 20.000 people were living together with animals in dirty and cramped caves. Matera seemed to blame the national political class for not having taken steps to eradicate this age-old misery. The city had to be decongested, so to move part of its population and allow the caves to regain the human scale they always had. However, it did generalize: all the caves had to be cleared and the delicate countrymen life had to be transferred to a galaxy of model rural villages. In the end, few of these were made, none properly. Those same people who lived in poverty were moved to modern dormitory districts, which yet had all the comforts allowed by modern times, but which were not suitable to hosting a community shaped by consolidated urban and interpersonal relationships. Only in the 1990s, it was realized that that life, those people, could not survive outside of those same narrow caves. The human and the architectural and natural components were inseparable.

This eventful past also ensured that this history was repeatedly revised by the German Democratic Republic (GDR) and the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) - true to the motto ""History is written by victors"". This revision can be an expression of rediscovered histories and newfound knowledge, but also has the potential to marginalise and ignore the unwelcome. Particularly in the initial phase of their existence, both states were highly selective in their respective historiographies, and symbolically significant buildings of the system's rival were partially erased. Other peculiarities result from the planning mechanisms that both forms of state applied, which can be discussed on the basis of the respective ideological standpoint. During the cold war, architecture became an important way to shape and express collective and national identities. As a result, the politics of the GDR, especially in the form of the Unity Party, Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands (SED), intervened in many cases to express socialism also in architecture and urban planning, which resulted in an urbicide of identity-forming buildings of the political and ideological competitors were systematically removed from the cityscape. Similar actions, but with reversed prefixes, were taken by the Federal Republic of Germany, which reunited the formerly separated parts of east and west Germany in 1990. Since this reunification, measures taken by the GDR are being reversed, a process that is driven by private supporters who fund the revival of a lost homogeneity in the cityscape. Thus, on one hand, GDR architecture is gradually disappearing, while on the other hand, buildings from the pre-war period are often reconstructed in their place. A process that continues to this day, and gradually documents the rapid change of ideologies and the perception of history in successive political frameworks. The paper therefore examines the development of Potsdam in both successive German states and case studies of the Stadtschloss and Garnisonkirche on the basis of a literature study, as both buildings are reflecting the eventful history of Germany and the changing ideologies in the built environment as they have been razed during the period of the GDR and were reconstructed after the reunification.","AR2A011; Urbicide; Potsdam; Reconstruction","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011","52.39886, 13.06566"

The question whether and how a building would be built or not becomes a political and social discussion. So considering the above, can architectural competitions still be considered to be innovative and experimental, as their organizers claim?This research will focus on Boijmans Van Beuningen Depot in Rotterdam. The 61,5 million euro project designed by MVRDV will be finished in September 2021. The design is the winning design out of the international competition where 47 firms participated in. The selection committee chose five designs to continue to the final round, the five firms included: MVRDV, MAD/NIO/Okra, Neutelings Riedijk, Koen van Velsen and Zwitserse Harry Gugger/Barcode Architects. The interest in the competition will be who the judges were and how they selected the winning design, the various designs will be compared using simple drawing. Despite winning the competition, MVRDV was almost disqualified from the competition, due to a mistake by Sjarel Ex, the director of Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen. After the court declared they were the winner, various parties such as the government and surrounding institutes doubted if the building should be built.

Whichever changes will happen, they will have an effect on the food system. In South Holland, this will happen with the transition to a circular economy. In order to deal with the unpredictability of these changes, this report proposes to create a resilient system. The main question that will be answered is ‘How can resilient food systems contribute to a circular agri-food sector in South Holland?’. In this context, resilience is the ability to ensure the provision of system functions in the face of increasingly complex and accumulating shocks and stresses. <br/>Through capacities of robustness, adaptability, and transformability a just transformation to the circular food economy can be ensured. The strategy Recipe for Resilience derives from this definition. Based on a network of a mix of three types of hubs, the strategy calls for a more widespread and integrated distribution of knowledge about food and the food system. These hubs are the Seeds, where knowledge and food produce germinates, the Melting Pot, common interacting ground for all actors, and the Mixers, the in-between spaces that are not transparent. Together, they supply a network facilitating producers, distributors, and consumers. Thanks to this high-functioning network of knowledge, the main goals of the strategy can be achieved. <br/>During and after implementation, there will be high stakeholder engagement through all layers of society, local food cycles with feedback loops to distribution centers and farmers, and the knowledge about it will be widespread throughout the South Holland population. The constant exchange of expertise will ensure feedback loops throughout all layers of the knowledge production. Through this constant adaptation and transformation, a resilient system can be achieved.","Agri-food sector; Resilience; Knowledge; Actor involvement; circular systems","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","AR2U086 R&D Studio – Spatial Strategies for the Global Metropolis",""

Although the cities of Ferrara, Mantua and Sabbioneta are all revered for their Renaissance town planning, the way that the Renaissance has manifested itself in these cities is quite different. The Addizione Erculea of Ferrara does not resemble the typical Renaissance addition as it has a quite irregular layout. However, it is the Humanistic approach to urban development with which the addition was designed that makes Ferrara a true Renaissance city. Also, the urban structures of Mantua don’t immediately reveal why the city is so revered for its Renaissance town planning as both the outlines and layout of the city are mostly irregular. For Mantua, it is the way that the ruling Gonzaga family displayed their power that is typical for the Renaissance: they were constantly developing Mantua, as they felt that their own magnificence would be reflected through their city and they created an environment of architects, artists and artisans that established a new artistic language there. Finally, the urban fabric of Sabbioneta is the most literal manifestation of the ideal city of the Renaissance. The entire design of the city is heavily influenced by classical Roman town planning practices and, although the outline of the city and the grid layout seem to be irregular, they are deliberately planned this way through complex calculations.","AR2A011; Renaissance; Urban Development; Ferrara; Mantua; Sabbioneta","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

Therefore, the thesis concentrates on Berceni neighbourhood between 1977 and 1989 as a case study for a larger urban phenomenon under the late Romanian Communist Regime (1965-1989). In this context, the research juxtaposes the Marxist ideologies on women's emancipation (proliferated throughout the Eastern Block) with the experiences of female inhabitants in Berceni. This contextualisation is crucial, given that response to women's issues was state-enforced and disseminated top-down. In aiding with a broader political and economic agenda, state policy dictated that women should be liberated from home duties (the private sphere) and be transposed into productive members of the society (the public sphere). Given that decision making was assigned to a predominantly male political elite, the state disregarded the family resources necessary to fulfil tasks historically associated with womanhood. Therefore, Socialist Women became just as tied to domesticity as their predecessors. What changed was that they were now forcefully assigned a dual character: an aseptic asexual public persona of state worker along the already existing sexualised domestic one. In understanding the link between women and domesticity, the research confronts the implications of state propaganda on the Lived Experience identified in the stories of some of the women inhabitants of 1977-89 Berceni. Among other points, the paper highlights women's isolation, over-working and distrust as some of the aftermaths of this clash between ideology and context.","AR2A011; Propaganda; Communist architecture; Gender; Berceni; Housing","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011","44.389122, 26.115875"

Nevertheless, the number of church visitors is decreasing becausethe number of faith bearers in the Netherlands continues to decline. This meansthat fewer churches are needed which results in more vacant churches in thefuture. A way of preserving church buildings is repurposing. In theNetherlands, 1500 church buildings have already been transformed into newfunctions and differ from apartments to supermarkets. But how does the publicperceive these buildings, and how does it differ from the past? Do theserepurposed church buildings contribute to the preservation of the history ofthe Netherlands? This will be investigated on the basis of the followingresearch question: “What is the value of repurposedchurch buildings through the course of history in the Netherlands?” This question is answered by dividing the research into three chapters, starting with the historical context of religionand church buildings in the Netherlands. The historical context of churchbuildings in the Netherlands was first mapped out by means of variousliterature studies. It can be said that throughout history, there have beenmultiple periods of change in the importance of faith and thus church buildingsin the Netherlands. The so to say all-time low of this notion was during thede-pillarization period in which the Netherlands became one of the most secularcountries in the world. In the second chapter, the church buildings that can befound in the Netherlands today are examined. It can be said that the value ofthe church building is still seen as added value in society today. However, itsnotion of value has changed over time. Where the church was first seen as aplace of faith and closed communities, the church is now experienced as a placeof culture and heritage, a place for the community that must be accessible tothe outside world. The historical added value, along with the value as aconnecting element in society, makes the church worth preserving. Repurposinghas been happening in the Netherlands for centuries, but especially since 1970repurposing has played an increasingly important role. When a church isrepurposed, people believe that it should be treated with respect. The peoplealso like it when a public function comes in return. This is often the case,both due to the demand of the community and the urban location make churchesextremely suitable for public functions. Despite this, there is often criticismof the repurposing of churches, just like the church buildings discussed inthis thesis. Initially there is often indignation and opposition. But itappears that in the longer term acceptance is there, it is often a matter ofgetting used to. This has resulted in the fact that these repurposed churchbuildings are increasingly becoming part of the society. The value andperception of church buildings may change over time but the appreciation forthese buildings remain. ","AR2A011; Repurposing; Church buildings; Repurposed; Church architecture; Church","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

Because the in-between space concept is perceived differently by architects, theories and works of two Dutch and two Japanese architects are investigated. The Dutch architects are Aldo van Eyck (1918-1999) and Herman Hertzberger (1932) and Japanese architects are Kisho Kurokawa (1934-2007) and Sou Fujimoto (1971). This research reveals that the in-between space concept emerged as a response to the modern movement in the Netherlands. Van Eyck and Hertzberger strived for more human centred architecture and therefore implemented in-between spaces in their buildings. Kurokawa and Fujimoto are both influenced by Japanese culture. The in-between space concept is traced back to the Buddhism origin of the country. Even though the motives of the architects of both countries are different, the implementation is similar. The Dutch architects emphasise the human relationship with each other slightly more, whereas the Japanese architects emphasise the relationship between humans and their environment more. The ambiguous character of an in-between space leaves room for interpretation, providing new perceptions and a different spatial experience. The in-between space is a space in it’s own right and therefore just as important as other spaces.","AR2A011; in between space; Japan; Netherlands; Aldo van Eyck; Herman Hertzberger; Kisho Kurokawa; Sou Fujimoto","en","student report","","","","","","","","2021-04-15","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","“The city should be for everyone”. According to Paulo Mendes da Rocha, “the city has to address the issues of coexistence, inclusion and the transformation of its own fabric”. This is the “battle” the Brazilian institution SESC is facing from its birth in 1946. As a non-profit private institution kept by trade businessmen, SESC primary aim is the welfare of workers and their family. However, the institution is also open to the general community. It was created with the purpose of providing to the society education, health, leisure, cultural and medical facilities. This approach to an inclusive architecture is reflected in the units that SESC has built across Sao Paulo; most famously the SESC 24 de Maio, by da Rocha, and the Sesc Pompeia, by Lina Bo Bardi. This two interventions have a fundamental role in the redevelopment of social functions within the tumultuous Brazilian community. In fact, “this cultural and recreational facilities have been part of political operations in the transformation of historic centres”, where architecture is the responsible for the existing urban and social environment rebirth, as the facilities are developed in abandoned transformed buildings, to give back to the city its own fabric. This was very unconventional for the 2nd postwar period, as the government was pushing for a massive construction of new buildings, also influenced by the advent of modernism in Brazil. The idea of an industrial architectural heritage din’t exist at the time. These interventions, especially Bo Bardi’s Sesc Pompeia, are revolutionary: they were meant for the preservation of the form, the structure and the idea of that place, working places where the work was hard becoming places for workers’ leisure. The architectural heritage meet the social, historical and political background. Therefore, this thesis will deepen the combination of means like businessmen’s fundings, collaboration between architects and users and the redevelopment of the industrial heritage, that allowed this institution to be powerful enough to express itself against hard existing social, political and economical conditions, thanks to a revolutionary architectural translation.  This institution is considered a worldwide recognised model. In fact, some European recreational and cultural centres which have references (or similarities) in the SESC projects will be used as examples of how the city can be redeveloped starting from its existing fabric. However, the contemporary city is disputed between those architects looking for a multifunctional architecture redeveloping the existing environment, and those who are focused on architecture as a performance, asking for “mono-functional signature” architectural work by a famous architect”. This debate is the second and conclusive part of the thesis, an analysis of these examples of the SESC-influenced buildings, both developing and facing challenges within the contemporary western cities, being preferred the construction and spreading of new ‘icons’. This landmarks’ construction with the aim of attracting tourism is making forget the importance of the development of an architecture based on the social sustainability, thanks to infrastructure containing various programs for the local citizens. The example of SESC in São Paulo—“quite a vertical and densely populated city, a city of great resources and also tremendous poverty, a city with a high crime rate, a city with severe traffic issues, and a city with public health problems”—it’s an evidence of the key role of architecture’s contribution in the urban development, currently threatened by interventions that do not better respond to modern cities requirements.","AR2A011; Heritage; Brasil; Community; SESC; Bilbao-effect; City; Paulo Mendes da Rocha; Lina Bo Bardi; Built environment","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

The most important reasons for this were photographers’ focus on documentation over aesthetics, their inexperience with the working conditions on the building site, and the developing technology of the camera.

The first part of the research analyses the concept of ‘Garden Cities’ (1902) created by urban planner E. Howard to overcome urban poverty. The second part investigates ‘Victory Gardens’ and the ‘Dig for Victory’ campaigns that were introduced to cope with the food shortage during both World Wars. The last part of the thesis explores sustainable cities concepts created in the 70s and the theory of Continuous Productive Urban Landscapes (2004) to overcome climate crises. In addition to this, I am mapping London’s agriculture fields, community gardens, and allotments at each section of the research that monitors the changes of physical connection between food cultivation and urban areas. The analysis defines three main strategies of agriculture integration into urban planning: zoning line; integrated into the urban areas; intermixed with the urban fabrics.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Czechoslovak architecture built in the Communist period, which lasted from 1948 until 1989 holds a negative image in the eyes of the public (Národní Galerie Praha, 2020). Architecture built during the communist regime is frequently criticized for its strong political and ideological background. Moreover, many of these structures are being neglected which further increases their general disfavour. However, this paradigm has started to shift. This is the case, especially amongst the post-communist generation who seems to enjoy this architecture more for its aesthetics and function and they can disconnect this architecture from the regime it was built in (Hatherley, 2015).A more professional audience argues that these buildings are the heritage of the past which should not be seen only in the light of the period when they were built (Národní Galerie Praha, 2020). Many of these structures are deeply functional while maintaining a unique and high aesthetic quality which is often so rare in the region. It is often assumed that the architects who designed these buildings had to collaborate or affiliate with the regime of that time. Yet, almost always the opposite is true (Vladimír Brož, 2019). One of the obvious proofs of this is that many of these architects were removed from their position and any public appearances after they condemned the invasion of the Warsaw pact in 1969. Second, architecture in Czechoslovakia was much more closely associated with art at the time than it is now. As a result, its position in reflecting on the current state of society may have been more significant during Communism, when freedom of expression was more restricted than it is now.An example of these aspects of the former architecture is a building of the Federal Assembly, nowadays known as the New National Museum designed by Karel Prager. The building was built as an extension of an older building that served the stock exchange. Its new function was a Federal Assembly, a parliament. Yet, it only ever held a formal function because it was finished after the invasion of 1968 thus in the period of Normalisation when the ‘power’ was no longer in the hand of Czechoslovakia but rather in the USSR’s.The original purpose of the building was to represent a new, more progressive ruling of the communist party and the architecture should have been the way to communicate this message. However, this never happened because of Normalisation. After 1969, the trust in the communist party fell massively and its physical representation in the form of architecture followed suit.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Publicly accessible urban spaces in New York City are subject to different ownership models. Some are privately owned by corporations, which are called POPs. Others are publicly accessible urban spaces publicly owned by the Department of Parks and Recreation. Because there is little research about how the ownership structures of these two different ownership structures affect the accessibility and use of their different publicly accessible urban spaces, in regards to the organisation of political events. I hypothesise that there is a difference in accessibility and use, for different ownership structures, regarding political events. Political events was chosen as the main use due to the change within the political climate in the United States of America, during Donald J, Trump’s presidency. The main research question is: Is there a difference in the accessibility and use of publicly accessibly urban spaces in New York City for political events depending on their ownership structure? For each of the different ownership structures three case studies’ urban design features and rules and regulations were introduced and analysed. Following this chapter, different types of political events are introduced by including events that took place within the case studies. From which, certain urban design requirements were identified that were necessary to host different political events. After comparing the case studies’ urban design elements and rules and regulations with the identified requirements of different types of political events, it was concluded that there is indeed a difference in accessibility and use of publicly accessible urban spaces in New York City for political events. Publicly owned public spaces are more accessible and useful for hosting political events regarding the urban design elements within the case studies. However, POPs are more accessible and useful for hosting political events regarding the rules and regulation of the case studies.","AR2A011; Publicly accessible urban space; POPS; Publicly owned public space; Political events","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011","40.7092504,-74.0112015"

The adoption of CBM strategies is not yet widespread due to the stringent requirements imposed by aviation authorities and the fact that the prognostic and health management (PHM) technology is still in its infancy. Along with the developing technology, CBM requires a performance evaluation in terms of aircraft maintenance schedule optimization. This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning model to solve the airline maintenance scheduling problem subject to prognostics uncertainty. A Deep Q-Learning model is trained to schedule A-check routine tasks. The approach preserves the dichotomy of the maintenance problem by scheduling both interval-based clusters of tasks and condition-based tasks monitored with synthetic prognostics. Maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) data from a major European airline was used to construct a realistic simulation and a model tailored to their operations. We explore a wide range of scenarios with varied numbers of tasks scheduled with a CBM policy, as well as different magnitudes of uncertainty in order to enable a viable maintenance strategy. Compared to traditional maintenance policies, the results demonstrate that the implementation of CBM reduces the fleet ground time and improves the task's interval utilization when assessing the uncertainty involved in prognostics.","Condition-based maintenance; Airline maintenance operations; Operations research; Reinforcement learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-04-15","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Architecturally, this pursuit culminated already six decades ago in the de-facto capital of the EU, when in 1959, the Belgium capital, Brussels, not only became the administrative, but also the architectural focal point of Europe. After the completion of the European Economic Community Commission’s building (Berlaymont) in 1968, it developed into the first architectural manifestation of the then still young ECC laying the groundwork for one of the first symbols of the EU’s united diversity. When comparing the different numbers of Google search results on European government buildings, the term Berlaymont in Brussels delivers an approximate of one million results, while other representational buildings like 10 Downing Street in London or the Élysée Palace in Paris return 13 or even 38 million search results. Even the Federal Chancellery of Germany generates more than double the search results of the Berlaymont. Although this statistical footnote is probably not the most reliable instrument for measuring how the EU quarter is publicly perceived, it hints at the missing presence of the building in the conscience of European citizens. With this in mind, one can ask how the architecture of the European institutions in Brussels is actually perceived through the eyes of those who are the actual subject of the European Union’s ambition to unite: Its citizens.

The question is investigated through the case study of the trinational border area in the metropolitan region of Basel, where Switzerland, Germany and France meet. The central theme propelling the discussion is the question of how the idea of the border has changed through history in the three countries and how this has affected the architecture of the study area. The research provides an insight into how the abstract ideas of borders and nations are translated into urban form.Over the course of history, the Basel region has seen many different systems of territorial division. The physical lines can be traced back to the roman era, but the widely accepted meaning of the border has varied greatly over the centuries. The border has produced different kinds of architecture depending on the way that it was interpreted by different people in different eras. The early history of the Basel region shows that many different border demarcations could have been the outcome of antiquity and the middle ages. It was only when the border line was widely accepted as a part of everyday life, through the increasing influence of monarchies and later on, the nation states, that the border gained in power as a primary urban element in Basel. This strong position was maintained by historiographical constructions that legitimized the location and importance of the border and made the border generally accepted by the public. This new kind of border initially produced military architecture and pushed away urban centres. When capitalism and industrialization gradually took over from the feudal monarchies, a second type of architecture started to emerge. A dense industrial strip following the border was a consequence of the transition of legal apparatuses that takes place here. Following the world wars, the image of the Rhineland underwent a drastic change in the EU countries, promoting the idea of European unity. In combination with the post war economic prosperity, the deconstruction of the European borders has led to the discovery of vacant land in the middle of the Basel metropolis. The discovery of the possibilities that transnational cooperation gives has laid the foundation for a new ambition: a common international neighbourhood.","AR2A011; borders; Basel","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011","47.589816, 7.589012"

Nowadays these market structures can control the interior climate and provide proper facilities for the hygienic sale of food.

Recent literature, considering relatively deep water conditions (kh 1, with k the wave number and h the water depth), has shown that a wave field propagating over a shallowing depth transition shows an increase in kurtosis. Kurtosis is a measure for the vertical deviation from the commonly applied linear ocean wave model, and therefore describes a higher probability of occurrence of ""rogue"" waves. These ""rogue"" waves are known to the general public from sailors' tales and thrilling videos. Scientifically, rogue waves are described as statistically abnormal waves and are generally classified as waves that exceed twice the significant wave height. Because these waves have an abnormal height, they are associated with extreme forces. Considering the sand ridges at future offshore wind farm locations, and possible increased damages to wind turbines due to rogue waves, this thesis researches if the increased probability of occurrence of rogue waves due to the local bathymetry as observed in the relatively deep water literature also applies to relatively shallow water conditions and the Dutch North Sea. To achieve this objective, physical experiments have been performed in the Hydraulic Engineering laboratory of the Delft University of Technology. Also, an existing statistical model that describes a rogue wave mechanism due to the presence of depth transitions is evaluated. The model describes the rogue wave mechanism as the interaction between the transmitted wave field and second-order components: the free sub- and super-harmonic components generated by the depth transition. As the model assigns a prominent role to these sub- and super-harmonics, it was ensured that these components are generated correctly during the physical experiments. Following, this thesis also assesses and contributes to the second-order wave generation at the TU Delft laboratory facility.","Rogue Waves; Second-order wave generation; North Sea; Wave phenomena; Physical experiments; Depth transition; Sand ridges; Extreme waves; Monster freak waves; wind farm; Laboratory; AUKE/PC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","52.57,3.71"

The province of South-Holland has economically evolved around the unique triple delta landscape. In order to keep its economically competitive position and take environmental responsibility, the province aims to be circular by 2050. However, the province is facing a number of environmental challenges, such as salinization, soil subsidence and the risk of flooding, that are further aggravated by the intensification of land use and climate change. At the same time, however, the region faces an enormous housing demand. Therefore, this strategic vision was created with the aim to propose a way to answer the high demand for space in South-Holland while preserving the delta environment. Three themes were identified as key drivers to reach the use of adaptive delta water management, the transformation to sponge cities and a shift towards water circularity were identified as key drivers. Implementing interventions along these themes will preserve and redefine both the natural and the urban environment. This strategic vision provides the roadmap towards a circular delta environment in 2050. This vision involves the transformation of export-oriented agricultural land into wetland area, the densification and expansion of urban areas and a shift towards a biobased port. The strategic pathway towards 2050 starts by involving a wide range of stakeholders. Water boards were identified as a fundamental partner. Besides, local stakeholders, such as farmers and citizens, are empowered in order to secure social justice and to increase impact. The interventions are then being implemented in collaboration with these stakeholders. Pilot projects are the first step of implementation, after which the interventions are being implemented on a larger scale. The main interventions are: implementing wetlands and blue-green networks, implementing a separated water system and water retaining structures within urban areas, executing urban development projects and the development of a blue-green hydrogen network. Finally, these implemented interventions are connected to create a circular system. Based on this projects the main recommendations to foster the shift towards circular water flows are: the implementation of a separated water system as an aspect in the shift towards sponge cities, the implementation of large scale wetland areas that are connected to the water system and finally the implementation of water reuse technologies within the port, greenports and agriculture.","reinforced delta; water circularity; climate adaptation; urban liveability; socio-environmental justice","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","AR2U086 R&D Studio – Spatial Strategies for the Global Metropolis",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","class=""MsoNormal"">Since 2017, Dutch flood defences are assessed according to new safety standards. These standards are based on flooding probabilities and rely on several assumptions and approximations. There are concerns that the combination of these assumptions leads to conservative results. Recently computed probabilities of failure are often much higher than expected by dike managers and the outcomes of former assessment methods. This conservative bias results in a large and expensive reinforcement task in the coming years which can be reduced by improving the current assessment procedure.  One of the reasons for the current conservatism is the assumption of mutual independence of dike sections and failure mechanisms. Currently, the different elements are assessed independently, while failure mechanisms and failure at different dike sections are likely to occur during the same extreme load event. Furthermore, correlations in space and between different parameters are present within the subsoil characteristics. Neglecting these correlations results in rather high estimations of the failure probabilities.  The aim of this thesis is to investigate how correlations affect the reliability assessment of a dike trajectory. To achieve this, an integral, full probabilistic model is developed that enables simultaneous assessment of dike sections and failure mechanisms while accounting for uncertainties and (spatial) correlations within the model input. The model is based on Monte Carlo simulation. The failure probability of a dike trajectory is computed by counting failure if one or more limit state function 푍푗,푘 for failure mechanism 푗 of dike section 푘 returns a negative realisation. Correlations between the model input parameters are provided by means of a Gaussian copula. A particular aspect of the model is the implementation of metamodeling for the assessment of macrostability. This failure mechanism cannot be described by an analytical limit state function that is easily implemented in the Monte Carlo framework. Therefore, metamodels are created by means of Gaussian process regression. This method makes it possible to assess macrostability within an integral, full-probabilistic framework that is able to include interdependencies between e.g. macrostability and piping, within acceptable computation costs. The model is applied to a case study of dike trajectory 43-4, which is located along the Waal between Sprok and Sterreschans, in the east of the Netherlands.  The effects of different plausible correlations have been studied. This research shows that including certain correlations can significantly reduce the assessed failure probabilities, by a factor ten or more in some situations. However, the impact of correlation strongly depends on the situation. The most significant reduction can be achieved for cases in which (1) parameters that play a dominant role in failure of the corresponding mechanism are correlated; (2) the failure probabilities of the different elements are similar, i.e. for a flood defence where failure is not dominated by one dike section or one failure mechanism; and (3) the failure probabilities of the corresponding elements are smaller than approximately 10−3. The model forms a solid, flexible basis that can easily be adapted or extended to improve the understanding about interactions between failure mechanisms, even though some aspects are simplified or neglected. All in all, the conservatism in current safety assessments can be partly solved by considering the interdependencies between mechanisms and dike sections and by approaching a dike trajectory as an integral system.","Reliability analysis; dike assessment; Correlations; Monte Carlo simulation; Probabilisitic analysis; Meta-modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","",""

One of the causes is plastic, namely not only the production and transportation of plastic, but also the spillage is extremely damaging for the environment. Some awareness has already been raised and some actions have been taken but this is not enough to turn the tide, a change in the plastic chain is needed. Therefore, the following research question was raised: How can regional planning and design stimulate circularity throughout the plastic network in Zuid-Holland? Fantastic Plastic is a project that articulates a framework for this sustainable future with plastics. We relied on an integrated framework that combines spatial interventions with circularity and the plastic network. <br/>Vision<br/>We envision that by 2050, the way we use plastics within the province of South-Holland has changed drastically. The plastics industry, which is primarily linear at the moment, will shift to a circular model. The province will no longer rely on the import of non-renewable resources as raw materials for this industry, or rely on the export of excess plastic waste as an end of pipe solution - to plastic waste issues. Consumption has been limited to a minimum through socioeconomically fair and viable alternatives. End-of-pipe solutions shift to recycling and, perhaps, composting - diminishing the environmental impacts and closing the loop of the plastic cycle. In thirty years, the circular model will entail fair and viable solutions throughout the plastic lifecycle. <br/>Strategy <br/>This report identified four different spatial interventions that are crucial for making the plastic chain circulair, namely: The HUB centre, the HUB industry, the Park and the Port. These spatial interventions coexist and are integrated in people's daily life. They keep plastic flows at the lowest scale possible and make people actively interact with plastic on different levels. These interventions can accelerate the transition towards a sustainable future so that in 2050 plastic is transformed into Fantastic Plastic.","Plastic network; circularity; cooperation; responsibility; spatial intervention","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","AR2U086 R&D Studio – Spatial Strategies for the Global Metropolis",""

Longer ongoing processes, such as moraine dam degradation, or instantaneous events, such as landslides, can trigger dam failure. GLOFs have a catastrophic downstream impact leading to significant economic damages and more than 12000 casualties worldwide until 2015, with Bhutan and Nepal being impacted the most. Climate change causes increasing temperature and precipitation, leading to the expansion of glacial lakes and the destabilisation of glaciers, slopes and moraine dams. Consequently, GLOFs are likely to become more frequent, and glacial lakes require continuous monitoring and analysis to understand and predict GLOF-related hazards. <br/><br/>Since glacial lakes often lie in inaccessible mountainous regions, on-site monitoring is challenging and remote sensing proposes a safe and cost-effective solution. Satellite radar is unaffected by nighttime and clouds, enabling continuous displacement measurements. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) using Sentinel-1 data from 2014 to 2021 was applied at six Himalayan glacial lake areas (Imja, Lunana, Barun, Rolpa, Thulagi and Lumding) to identify potential GLOF hazards and to investigate InSAR's capability as a monitoring tool. Optical, meteorological and topographical data were used to aid in interpreting the InSAR observations; linking displacements to potential hazards and evaluating the limitations of an InSAR-based analysis. <br/><br/>Significant deformation was detected at the terminal moraines of Imja, Thulagi, Rolpa, Lunana and Barun Lakes; on lateral moraines at Rolpa and Lunana Lakes; and on rock glaciers at Imja, Rolpa, Barun and Lunana Lakes. In addition, significant seasonal variation could be distinguished, showing the impact of temperature and precipitation on geomorphological processes and potential hazard developments at glacial lakes. InSAR-related limitations arose in regions with significant topographic variations, extant snow or vegetation covers, and rapid displacements. <br/><br/>This study demonstrates the capability of satellite InSAR as a glacial lake monitoring tool. An InSAR-based analysis is instrumental in highlighting areas from where GLOFs could originate, requiring mitigation measures or further investigation to map the impact of failure. By extending the research frame over multiple years, continuous and long-term monitoring could demonstrate the climatic influence on displacements and GLOF trigger developments.","InSAR; GLOF; Himalaya; PSI; Sentinel-1; glacial lake monitoring; outburst susceptibility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-04-25","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

Decision-tree models are shown to be helpful in classifying instances of fraud, malware, or diseases and can be used to make dynamic, flexible access decisions within an access-control system. These applications often require sensitive data of more than one party, like financial or health-related records. It is important to keep this data private, especially when the decision-tree evaluation is done in a collaborative manner where more than one party provides sensitive input data. Current privacy-preserving solutions only consider scenarios in which input data originates from a single source. However, collaboration for decision-tree evaluation tasks is needed more and more since these collaborations often bear fruit. Therefore, in this work we address Private Decision-Tree Evaluation in a collaborative setting. We assume one entity, called the server, that holds the decision tree and multiple users that provide private data on which the decision tree is evaluated. The focus of our research lies on solutions that make use of homomorphic encryption. We give ten different protocols that each take place in a different setting; either the holder of the decision tree receives the evaluation result or the users that provide the input. The protocols use Multi-Key Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) or normal FHE with a Semi-Trusted Third Party (STTP). Additionally, we introduce a novel key-switching method within two of the STTP protocols such that the dependency on the STTP is greatly reduced. All protocols are proven to be secure in the semi-honest model and compared in terms of run-time complexity and communication costs. Due to the high computational overhead for the Multi-Key FHE schemes, the protocols that make use of these schemes are not yet feasible. Therefore, the protocols that use an STTP are the most promising. All protocols take no more than 4 communication rounds. Assuming that the implementation can be parallelized and given an input bit length of 4, the decision-tree evaluation in our protocols takes in the worst case between 60 and 160 hours, executed on an Intel Core Processor at 2.4 GHz with 16 GB memory.","Decision Trees; Fully Homomorphic Encryption; Private Decision-Tree Evaluation; Secure multi-party computation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Guerreiro Goncalves, M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","New approaches to overcome complex societal problems of today are the need of the hour, especially to enable the transition to a sustainable future (Concilio &amp; Tosoni, 2019). Here, social innovations present new ways to tackle global problems on a local scale; that when put together, can create a transformation on a systemic level while shaping societal beliefs, routines and behaviours. Scaling these social innovations is important to enable the requisite large-scale transformations. This project builds on a specific scaling strategy that aims to shift cultural values, mindsets and beliefs- namely, scaling deep. Given that scaling deep is an abstract and intangible concept, the project aims to develop an actionable strategy that supports social innovators in their scaling journey. The key research question being: How can design be used to transform the abstract and theoretical concept of scaling deep into something more tangible and implementable in order to make it usable for social innovations? In the first phase of the project and this report, the phenomenon of scaling deep is explored from a theoretical and practical perspective. Qualitative research (carried out by using a research through design approach) reveals that engaging new stakeholders is one of the biggest hurdles for social innovators wanting to scale their innovation into a new context. Here, scaling deep is a means to overcome this hurdle. Literature review highlights ‘common ground’ and ‘community building’ as two key conditions for social innovators to achieve impact at a larger scale (Yee &amp; White, 2016; Beers et al., 2006). However, at the individual or micro level, a change in mindsets (and frames) is necessary which starts with the awareness and articulation about these implicit concepts (Gupta &amp; Govindarajan, 2002; Buchanan &amp; Kern, 2017; Hay et al., 2007; Dorst 2011). Building upon these insights, scaling deep is further defined as an internal transformation process as well as a social process that focuses on alignment rather than forcing perspectives onto someone. In addition, friction, in the sense of realising conflicting frames, is seen as an enabler for change. This phenomenon is called fruitful friction. Here, friction is the notion of becoming aware of your implicit frame and realising the difference to other peoples’ frames, which is seen as a first step to create openness for change. These characteristics are captured in a conceptual framework, ‘Fruitful friction towards common ground’, in order to use fruitful friction as a strategy to scale deep. The framework proposes to deliberately trigger friction fruitfully as a lever for change to enable the emergence of common ground and allow social innovators to scale deep. In the second and third phase of the project and the last part of this report, the conceptual framework is translated into a design toolkit ‘Are we on the same page?’, making the strategy of scaling deep actionable. It triggers people to express their tacit perspective (frames) which facilitates the emergence and capturing of common ground. ‘Are we on the same page?’ is a process enabling toolkit that helps social innovators to conduct an online workshop using fruitful friction to reach a shared understanding with new stakeholders. In sum, this thesis unveils the potential of fruitful friction as a strategy to scale deep, allowing social innovators and their stakeholders to reach a common ground. The framework makes the abstract and theoretical concept of scaling deep more tangible; while the toolkit, helps social innovators to practically implement scaling deep into their projects.","Participatory City Making; Delft Design Labs; Designscapes; Social Innovation; Scaling Social Innovations; Scaling Toolkit; Fruitful friction; Design Enabled Innovation; Scaling Framework; Social impact; Mindsets; Frames","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Molin, E.J.E. (mentor); Maat, C. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 seriously impacted the world. Some previous researches suggest that global incidents could strongly influence the demand for passenger air transport services (Sobieralski, 2020). And the impacts on the demand can be ascribed to the change in the air travel behaviour of travellers (Ito &amp; Lee, 2005). However, the influence of a pandemic on passengers’ air travel behaviour has been rarely studied. This thesis studies the differences in air travel behaviour between the COVID-19 period and the non-pandemic period, in order to benefit the decision-making of policy-makers.In this thesis, it is assumed that the COVID-19 pandemic influences air travel behaviour through changing the air transport context. Three context aspects are found to influence how air travellers behave during the pandemic. Firstly, the policies including travel restrictions and travel recommendations imposed by the government discourage travel motivation. Secondly, the rise in public risk perception triggers their health-protective behaviour which leads to low willingness to fly or changes in travel choice decision-making. The operation adjustments of the airlines in response to the COVID-19 pandemic also influence the offered flight options in the market which could change flight choice behaviour.Two important air travel choice behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic are further studied, which are the choice between flying and not flying (willingness to fly) and the choice between flight alternatives. Stated choice data is used since it avoids the bias of revealed choice data in studying willingness to fly. Discrete choice modelling is used because of its advantage in studying individual choice.Air travel convenience and airborne health safety are considered important to air travel choice-making during the pandemic. Therefore, they are added as two attributes in the stated choice experiment. The perception of them is scaled by the perception rating experiment using the Hierarchical Information Integration theory. The results show that the perception of air travel convenience is influenced by the requirement of health-related paperwork, such as health statement and virus test result, for travelling and the travel flexibility, such as change and return policy given, by the airlines. The perceived health safety is influenced by the intensity of the virus precautionary measures implemented in the cabin.The results of the stated choice experiment show a considerable change in the attribute trade-off between flight alternatives made by air travellers during the pandemic. Perceived health safety is the foremost factor that air travellers consider. If an intermediate serious pandemic is assumed, air travellers are willing to pay at least 100% more money to improve the virus precautionary measures by 1 level compared to the non-pandemic situation. This percentage difference becomes larger when the safety level Increases to a higher level, which means that air travellers are more willing to take the safest flight during the pandemic. Transfer and flying time are considered as other two important attribute during the pandemic because they indicate the chance of the exposure to the risky environment. Therefore, travellers are willing to pay 87.9 euro during a serious pandemic to reduce 1 transfer, while they would only pay 42.6 euro during the non-pandemic period. Correspondingly, the ticket price of the flight becomes less important in the exchange for a better performance of other attributes.The willingness to fly is significantly deteriorated by the COVID-19 pandemic. In the case of a serious pandemic, the willingness to fly reduces from 83.5% to 37.6% if the flights in the market have a medium attribute performance. Although improving several flight attributes including price, transfer, travel convenience and health safety can pull up the willingness to fly, however, the negative impact of the pandemic is so strong that even the most extreme attribute improvement, ignoring the profitability and sustainability, still cannot totally offset the willingness to fly reduction because of the COVID-19.The following recommendations are given to policy-makers. Firstly, meeting the customers’ expectation of health safety is the best way for airlines to compete during the COVID-19 pandemic. Two methods to do so include providing non-stop flights as much as possible and improving the intensity of virus precautionary measures in the cabin. Reducing the price is still effective in attracting customers, but less than during the non-pandemic period. Secondly, airlines can increase their load factor by improving flight attributes. But the negative impact of the virus cannot be fully compensated. Thirdly, because the willingness to fly is strongly related to the seriousness of the pandemic, the government should never underestimate the rebound of travel motivation in order to avoid the uncontrollability of the pandemic when the situation gets better. Fourthly, as the COVID-19 is unlikely to disappear soon, the low willingness to fly will remain and threaten the survival of airlines. The governments should work out a sustainable financial aid plan with airlines that can also balance the other goals for the society including economic growth and environmental protection.","Air travel behaviour; Stated choice experiment; Willingness to fly; Flight Choice behaviour; COVID-19","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

In order to do so, this project prioritizes an approach that addresses preparedness towards anticipating change as well as the scale- and temporal variability of the changing conditions and their impacts. This project uses Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP) as a methodology to explore alternative future narratives that are geared towards mitigating and adapting to changing climate conditions. It defines concentrations of social- and locational vulnerability as a proxy to anticipate potential migration flows, displacement or trapped population. It then explores potentials for adaptation across scales, which are then used to formulate spatial- and policy actions. In doing this, the project looks specifically for synergies of actions that address the before defined vulnerabilities. The formulated actions are then sequenced into alternative narratives to show their impact for two different IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP’s). Finally, they are evaluated for their performance in addressing vulnerabilities related to climate-induced migration and for their applicability to the existing multi-scalar planning framework.","climate-induced migration; vulnerability; adaptation; preparedness; Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Complex Cities","","32.664874, -115.499891"

Agile, more digital-driven competitors enter the consulting market (Nissen, 2017a, p. 33). Furthermore, clients are becoming more digital and seek more digital and agile consulting services. The company of this project, a professional service network, is part of this changing market. To answer to the changing client needs and to stay competitive, they need to rethink their way of their ‘traditional personnel-intensive ‘face-to-face’ delivery model of consulting’ (Bieler, 2017). And thus, they need to re-design their client relationship that serves the changing demands of their clients. An in-house product of this professional service network focuses on bringing their client relationship into the digital age. This project aims to deliver a product positioning and strategy for this in-house product to support the future client relationship. The project approach is both systemic (Jones, 2020) and iterative. This means the author has a system view on the future client relationship integrating multiple factors that are influencing this system. Furthermore, the author has committed to an iterative design approach involving company stakeholders throughout the research and design phases with the use of co-reflection (Yukawa, 2006). Thorough research on the future of consulting, in addition to internal interviews and three different co-reflection sessions with multiple stakeholders have lead to a design for a future client relationship: The future client relationship will be humanly digital. A relationship that is characterized by co-created touch-points and a digital infrastructure that facilitates the people of the firm to use their knowledge and experience to offer clients personalized services. Three different digital experiences are driving this humanly digital relationship: pro-active selling solutions, interactive project experiences and digital business solutions. Design reflection sessions with internal stakeholders suggest: the product should facilitate these three digital experiences and should be positioned as a client-experience expert. This project gives a view on a potential future for the digital client relationship. Moreover, it provides the client of this project with a strategy and future vision on how to position their in-house product in the future.","Digital transformation; Consultant-Client; Digital relationship; Strategy; Digital Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

As the low-lying Netherlands will be one of the first to witness the consequenses of rising sea levelsa and increasing river water discharge, alternatives for its built environment will have to be explored in order to be able to adapt in time. As the Netherlands has been successfully holding off the water for decades, the country is globally seen as a pioneer in water management solutions. Therefore the Dutch are in the position to lead by example. However, the phenomenon of rapidly accellerating sea level rise is something Dutch water management has never dealt with before. Uncertainty and rapidly changing predictions make it difficult to decide on drastic and costly measures in time. In order to facilitate a transition from the established defensive landscape towards living with water instead, a new flood resilient building type can facilitate in adapting to near future predictions, while also raising awareness for the urgency of rising water levels and contributing to the current housing shortage. In order to achieve this it is necessary to step away from the defensive landscape and outdated water management strategies. This research will elaborate on predictions regarding sea level rise and changing weather conditions in the densifying outer dike area of the urban center of Rotterdam. Contemporary approaches towards building dikes, the importance of engaging private parties in generating flood resilient solutions and the possibility to utilize water and flood defence barriers as a flexible building ground in densifying urban areas will be discussed.

Methods that predict impacts loads for structural design often assume the water as incompressible. These predictions can be inaccurate during impacts where air is entrained in water, as that greatly increases its compressibility. Initial impact forces may decrease due to a cushioning effect. However, the total severity of the impact may increase due to temporal spreading and oscillations of impact pressure. Previous research on aerated water impacts covers breaking waves against fixed structures, flat water slamming or green water events, but not the interactive motion of rigid marine structures in free surface waves. This work aims to evaluate the effect of aerated water impacts on the dynamics of floating rigid bodies in irregular waves. As a part of this work, a state-of-the-art numerical simulation method for aerated water impacts is extended with a monolithic coupling for rigid body motion. Additionally, boundary conditions for wave generation were implemented for a validation of the method during breaking wave impact. Results of the verification of both extensions compare well to other literature. It can be concluded from this thesis that the compressibility effects of aeration on penetration depth after cylinder slamming can be neglected for entry Mach numbers below 0.1.

One example is the time-optimal flight of Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs), where strict computational requirements fail to resolve such algorithms onboard. Recent work on the use of deep neural networks for guidance and control (G&amp;CNets) has shown that these biologically inspired models approximate well the optimal control solution while requiring a fraction of the computational cost. Although previous attempts resulted in successful flight tests, training occurred on large-scale datasets based on a 3-DoF model. Since model refinement leads to higher generation time, in this work, we show that G&amp;CNets trained on small-sized datasets can mimic the optimal control solution of a full 6-DoF quadrotor model. The cost function used in the generation process penalizes the altitude error and mixes both time and power-optimal objectives weighted by a varying homotopy parameter. Trained networks output the vertical thrust command and body rates based on the vehicle's position, velocity, and attitude. The proposed controller transfers well onboard for different flight scenarios: (i) longitudinal, lateral and diagonal flight; (ii) hovering with and without the effect of disturbances and (iii) waypoint tracking experiment. Through a Monte-Carlo test campaign, it is demonstrated that G&amp;CNets trained on small datasets provide similar results to those with 100 times more samples.

Although there is an increasing attention for the transition towards sustainability, this sector seems to struggle in realising this transition. As a result, environmental conditions are still exceeding (some of the) planetary boundaries. Moreover, for engineering organisations it is important to integrate sustainability into the project approach, in order to continue their business activities in the future. In order to improve the sustainable performance and stimulate the transition towards a zero-emission economy, literature suggests to study the missing link between formulation of corporate sustainable ambitions and vision (sustainability strategy) and the implementation on project level. This research responds to this suggestion, as it identifies the main barriers that hamper the implementation of sustainability strategy in engineering and consultancy organisations, and derive factors and activities that stimulate the application. As industrial ecology is described as the ‘toolbox’ for sustainability issues, this research considers this discipline and evaluates its application for the implementation of sustainability strategy. Besides the insights in the barriers, this research includes the results into a framework: the VOC framework. This framework stimulates the incorporation of sustainability (understood as implementation of sustainability strategy in this research) within construction project development. The starting point of the research is a background study, including literature on businesses, corporate strategy and sustainability in the building environment. Next to these aspects, a specific chapter will review the relevance of industrial ecology for the incorporation of sustainability, by focusing on three industrial ecology tools: Life Cycle Assessment, Industrial Symbiosis and Supply Chain Positioning. For the structure of this research, the methodology was divided into three phases: exploration, design and evaluation. Before the implementation of sustainability strategy in practice is investigated, the sustainable elements in the corporate sustainability strategy should be clear. Next, primary data is collected via case analysis. Within these cases, semi-structured interviews were conducted. In this way, both primary and secondary data is included in the analysis. The data analysis is part of the exploration phase. Within the design phase, barriers and stimulations together with perceptions of professionals were included in the VOC framework. As part of the evaluation phase, the conceptual framework was tested in a online focus group. The main barriers that are considered the starting point for implementation of sustainability are (1) communication with the internal project teams, (2) organisational support and (3) value creation out of sustainability. The results show how the three barriers on the corporate level are influencing all indirect limiting factors on the project level. On the project level, sustainability is in many cases considered a cost, without thinking about the value that is captured by sustainable interventions. To enhance this value creation, Life Cycle Assessment, Industrial Symbiosis and Supply Chain Positioning are integrated in the VOC framework as industrial ecology tools. VOC framework is not about applying the specific IE tools directly, but use the tools to inspire and convince the project owner on sustainable options in the project concept. In addition, sharing of experiences and best practices needed to be emphasised as crucial actions for the incorporation.","Incorporation of sustainbility; Sustainability strategy; Construction sector; Case analysis; Framework development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

In order to improve helicopter handling qualities, this paper investigates whether linear and nonlinear MPC are suitable for online application to helicopters to reduce cross-coupling effects. This was investigated by evaluating its performance on the cross-coupling requirements of the ADS-33 handling quality document. It was found that both linear and nonlinear MPC are very effective to reduce cross-coupling effects even when disturbances or prediction model errors are present. The model predictive controller could reduce the off-axis coupling response by around 99% compared to the uncontrolled helicopter. Furthermore, it performed 90% to 99% better than a PID controller in most coupling cases.","cross-coupling effects; flight control; Handling Qualities; helicopters; Model Predictive Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Control & Simulation","","51.990279, 4.375461"

People can have packages delivered to their doorstep within two days of ordering. The e-commerce market is flourishing and customers are happy with speedy delivery without extra cost. The high demand causes logistics companies to push themselves to the limit. Therefore, the number of delivery vehicles increases which is causing some problems. The large vans and trucks are cluttering European city centers and are causing dangerous situations. Commercial vehicles are seen as blunt and annoying in traffic.<br/><br/>Meanwhile BYD, a Chinese automotive company that specializes in electric technology, wants to launch commercial vehicles in Europe. The challenge is to design the commercial vehicles in such a way that they have a positive impact. This thesis is a styling strategy for electric commercial vehicles in a European context. It is part of the master Strategic Product Design at the Delft University of Technology.<br/><br/>BYD is a Chinese company that started as a manufacturer of batteries. In 2003 BYD entered the automotive industry, specializing in electric vehicles. The corporate identity of BYD is pioneering in electric technology and guiding the world towards a green future. BYD’s product portfolio consists of cars, trucks, buses, trains, batteries and electronics. In China BYD is well known, in Europe there is no significant brand awareness. A successful launch of commercial vehicles in Europe will help to create a positive brand image for BYD. <br/><br/>From research it was found that there is a need for smaller electric commercial vehicles in Europe. This is due to the increased need for last mile delivery vehicles in e-commerce and more governmental regulations to protect city centers by imposing emission, weight and size limits for certain areas. The logistics industry is facing a driver shortage. For making this profession more appealing companies are increasingly involving drivers during the procurement process listening to their input about comfort, safety AND styling.<br/><br/>For determining the right styling strategy for BYD commercial vehicles in Europe, the European context was mapped. Trend research and interviews revealed the underlaying themes that are important and resulted in a set of three desired product qualities which the product must have: Lightness, Wholesomeness and Professionalism. The Styling strategy should be easily explained and the best way to do that is by using a theme. The theme connects the desired product qualities with the BYD brand identity and helps to translate that to a tangible design. <br/><br/>The Theme for the styling strategy is Dragonfly. Just like a dragonfly BYD commercial vehicles move silently and nimbly from location to location. They are lightweight, agile, effective and harmless. According to Chinese folklore when a dragonfly arrives at your doorstep it is said to bring prosperity and good luck. People should say the same thing about BYD’s commercial vehicles. <br/><br","Styling; Strategy; Automotive; Commercial; Vehicles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

To minimise the spread of the virus and to gain trust from the public in the airport operations' safety, airports implemented measures, e.g., physical distancing, entry/exit temperature screening and more. However, airports do not know what the impact of these measures will be on the operations' performance and the passengers' safety when passenger demand increases back. The goal of this research is twofold. Firstly, to analyse the impact of current (COVID-19) and future pandemic-related measures on airport terminal operations. Secondly, to identify plans that airport management agents can take to control passengers' flow in a safe, efficient, secure and resilient way. To model and simulate airport operations, an agent-based model was developed. The proposed model covers the main airport's handling processes and simulates local interactions, such as physical distancing between passengers. The obtained results show that COVID-19 measures can significantly affect the passenger throughput of the handling processes and the average time passengers are in contact with each other. For instance, a 20% increase in check-in time (due to additional COVID-19 related paperwork at the check-in desk) can decrease passenger throughput by 16% and increase the time that passengers are in contact by 23%.","Multi-Agent System; Airport Operations; COVID-19; Physical Distancing; Walking Behaviour","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-04-12","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Paralympic sports are growing more popular. Besides the dedicated training of the athlete, technology is crucial to empower amputees to perform at their highest level. The recent carbon fibre Running-Specific- Prosthesis (RSP) have energy stored and return capabilities that allow runners with amputations to perform almost as able-bodied. However, due to the difference in power output between a biological ankle and a RSP, unilateral transtibial (UTT) amputees need to adjust their biomechanics to an asymmetric pattern. It is known that the stiffness of the blade has a great influence on the performance of the athlete. The main challenge was to find a method to prescribe the optimal stiffness for a particular athlete, that allows him/her to performthe best in a race. The current approach to advice a RSP is based on the bodyweight of the athlete and the coaches and athletes wishes. Nevertheless, as a result of the insufficient number of subjects and the difficulty to performa randomised control trial, there is limited evidence about the UTT athlete capability of adapting their muscle activity to different prosthesis stiffness and the optimal RSP stiffness for them. In order to investigate this, two main goals for this master thesis project were raised: to implement a musculoskeletal model of an UTT amputee athlete wearing a RSP and predict its optimal running biomechanics through predictive forward dynamic simulations; to find the optimal athlete-RSP stiffness combination that maximizes the running performance. Five different stiffness of a Flex-Run ¨Ossur (Reykjavík, Island) RSP were modelled and simulated for the maximumvelocity the model could reach. Results: firstly, the model could perform better with a middle-class RSP category. It enhanced the hip muscles to exert more power in the blade during the first part of the stance phase. However, the prosthetic leg generated 41.2% lower total average power, including the RSP power, than the intact leg. The RSP made up 24.8% of the total prosthetic leg power. Secondly, the intact leg benefited from an improved push-off of the prosthetic leg having a favourable landing that allowed to exert more power and propel the body into longer flight time than with low-class RSP categories. Still, the top speed of the model was far from what athlete can achieve, but the motion and kinetic data were comparable for low running speeds. Therefore, it could be concluded that a reasonable prediction of the optimal RSP stiffness for running at about 4.6 m/s was achieved. The presented biomechanical model could potentially be used to assist coaches and athletes to have a better idea of themost suitable RSP stiffness.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Boelhouwer, P.J. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The Netherlands faces the challenge of a rapidly ageing population, which demands more diverse housing concepts for seniors. Collaborative housing (CH) concepts are a promising solution to promote contact and mutual support, counteract loneliness, and reduce public health expenses. Professional-led CH concepts is an emerging phenomenon that could allow a faster and more accessible supply of senior dwellings than resident-led projects. However, little is known about the perceived value of use by the residents. This study raises the question: How do professional collaborative housing concepts for seniors satisfy the end user's demand? CH concepts for seniors are defined as a differentiated housing solution that focuses on promoting togetherness, provide at least one shared space, and targets the over-55s. Three professional-led CH projects are in-depth by performing mixed-method research. A thorough analysis of the cases showed that most respondents experienced benefits compared to their former dwelling, like more contact with neighbours, live with like-minded people and enjoy life more. Two types of initiators can be distinguished. The commercial-oriented initiators are the most skilled in a lean and mean development process. They deliver dwellings with high use value by emphasising smart technology and communality as an outsourced service for the resident. The ethos-oriented initiators use a custom-fit approach to assemble a motivated group of residents that form a strong foundation based on shared social values. In this development process, the communal organisation is led by the residents, in which social values could thrive. This study shows that the professionalisation of CH for seniors is promising when the initiators stay close to the end-users' needs, which asks for design disruption. However, caution is necessary because commercialising communality can cause residents' responsibility towards each other to disappear. Cases showed how financial objectives could clash with the three fundaments of CH by 1) as additional selection for an intentional community raises vacancy risk; 2) allowing for user involvement in the design and maintenance asks for intensive guidance and; 3) legal, financial and organisational challenges in delivering a common area causes extra effort and time. Caution is needed for the commercialisation of communality, as responsibility towards each other disappears, diffusing both the concepts and the communal benefits. CH concepts will have little chance without additional organisational and financial support in a scarce housing market ruled by financial interests. Governments and societal initiatives can play an important role in shifting the boundary to demand-driven developments, looking beyond profit and risk minimisation.","Collaborative housing; seniors; Residential satisfaction; Ageing in place; Professionalization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

To this end, two stated choice experiments were conducted and the data was analysed using extended multinomial logit models. The results showed that the shared e-car is preferred to the private car for commuting trips if the walking times and operational costs are attractive. The operational costs of shared mobility services and the walking distances to mobility hubs were found to be important factors for the use of shared mobility services. These two factors were also found to be important for the willingness to give up the private car and thus the choice for shared mobility services offered in mobility hubs for all trips. Sensitivity to operational costs was found to be higher for the shared e-car than for the shared e-moped and e-bike. Car owners preferred full e-car sharing if the private car was given up. Car owners had little preference for the use of shared e-mopeds and e-bikes. The density of mobility hubs in a residential area was found to have a strong impact on reducing car use and car ownership. Moreover, lowering the current operating costs was found to make the use of shared mobility services more attractive. The effects of mobility hubs on car use and car ownership were highest in the city centre, followed by the suburban area and lowest in a rural area.","Mobility hubs; Car use; Car ownership; Shared mobility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

These particles will experience growth via settlement and coagulation, radial drift before acting as reservoir for planet cores to accrete and grow from.

During these thirty minutes of extreme weather conditions, the skyline had lost most of its church towers, spires and roofs. Since the city was poor, most of the churches were rebuilt in a simple way. This was completely in contrast to the majestic potential to have all churches at the ends of the cross built monumentally with two towers and needle spires, generating a great symmetry with the tallest tower, the Domtoren, in the middle. This would have made the invisible cross plan to be unmistakable in the skyline. On street level, the Domkerk lost the entire nave, and the Pieterskerk’s front facade, including the two towers, collapsed. The latter created a beautiful opening straight towards the Dom, but after renovations the design of the Pieterskerk didn’t make sense anymore on a larger scale. The storm and the following actions made it impossible for the city to make use of the architectural potential, resulting in the invisible enigma the cross forms in Utrecht today.","AR2A011; Utrecht; Church cross; Storm; 1674","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011","52.052634, 5.071672"

It is about creating awareness and it seeks to design and improve spaces to be functional for the deaf and hard-of-hearing.

Firstly, Mies’ short stay in the Netherlands in the summer of 1912 when he was dealing with the Kröller-Müller project is represented in a detailed manner, with a series of details given, to show extensively Mies’ activities and some events during this certain period which are closely associated with Mies. Mrs. Kröller-Müller played a critical role in the whole Kröller-Müller project, because she was the one who shifted the whole commission from Peter Behrens to Mies. Secondly, the significance of the Kröller-Müller project to Mies is explained, from the aspect of Mies’ own attitudes, and more importantly the whole case as the trigger of Mies’ further dedication to Berlage’s thoughts and works. Some letters of Mies and related people are given as evidences of Mies’ huge investment in the project. Finally, an analysis of Mies’ Berlagian origin is carried out by comparing Berlage’s thoughts and architecture to the counterpart of Mies’. This analysis is divided into two categories, first the European period of Mies and from the tectonics he learned from Berlage, and second the American period and what he learned from Berlage’s theories. After this analysis, it is clear that Mies could have been inspired greatly by Berlage, and based the frame of his own architectural philosophy on Berlage’s argument where he emphasized a style - ‘unity in diversity’, or the existence of a universal principle, which is very consistent with Mies’ homogeneous grid system.","Kröller-Müller; Mies van Der Rohe; Berlage","en","student report","","","","","","Berlage, Hendrik Petrus.

De rol van de openluchtscholen veranderde echter toen na de Tweede Wereldoorlog antibiotica op de markt kwam, waarmee tuberculose gericht behandeld kon worden. In deze thesis wordt onderzoek verricht naar de openluchtschoolbeweging tijdens de wederopbouw, toen de focus van tuberculose naar andere aandoeningen verschoof. Aan de hand van medisch-architectonisch literatuuronderzoek en een uitgebreide toetsing van de casusprojecten Buitenschool Appèlbergen in Glimmen en Openluchtschool San Domenico Savio in Goirle, wordt gepoogd een antwoord te geven op de onderzoeksvraag “Hoe relateren de Nederlandse openluchtscholen uit de wederopbouwperiode zich aan de principes van de openluchtkuur?”. Ondanks het losweken van de tuberculosebeweging blijken de basisprincipes van de openluchtkuur ook in de wederopbouwperiode expliciet aanwezig te zijn. Waar de principes enerzijds invloed hebben op de dagindeling van de scholen, onder andere met warme maaltijden of verplichte bedrust, beïnvloedden ze anderzijds ook de architectuur van de scholen: de focus op gezonde lucht en een overvloed aan zonlicht stond aan de basis van een scholenbouwtypologie waar geëxperimenteerd werd met innovaties als airconditioning en verplaatsbaar schoolmeubilair. Er wordt beargumenteerd dat de scholen een faciliterende en didactische rol in de opvoeding en behandeling van kinderen vervulden, gebaseerd op de oorspronkelijke openluchtkuur.","AR2A011; openluchtkuur; openluchtscholen; tuberculose; Wederopbouw; San Domenico Savio; Appèlbergen; Bedaux; Wilhelm; buitenscholen","nl","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011","53.132333860202316, 6.64415656320309"

It can work. It can be emphatic, effective, and more equal. However, there is a deeply embedded history of colonialism involving power asymmetries that give rise to the dismissal of value systems, which pervert this type of collaboration from being truly realised. Hence, within an architectural education framework, this thesis aimed to examine how TU Delft’s Global Housing studio addresses or perpetuates colonialism and neo-colonialism while practicing in the Global South. The book, Race and Modern Architecture: A Critical History from the Enlightenment to the Present, edited by Irene Cheng, Charles L. Davis II and Mabel O. Wilson helped illuminate the historical context as it concerned the relationship between architecture and race. Additionally, Isabel Wilkerson’s book, Caste: The Lies That Divide Us, provided a framework from which a stakeholder power dynamic analysis could be conducted. The thesis’ conclusions illuminate how the studio addresses colonialism and neo-colonialism in their communication of intent and some of their actions. Contrastingly, the studio sustains elements of colonialism and neo-colonialism. For example, their definition of success is one-sided in terms of who benefits, while despite their intentions to be collaborative their use of language and approaches continue to communicate a “them versus us” narrative. This thesis is, however, an introduction to the continued work that is needed to address colonialism and neo-colonialism in architectural education.","Global Housing Studio; Colonialism; Neo-colonialism; Caste; Power dynamics; Asymmetries","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2A011",""

One important aspect of investigation on contrast agents in general, and Mn(II) complexes in particular, is an accurate determination of their concentrations in solution. Therefore, in this study a known approach of determining the concentration of paramagnetic species in solution, via the Bulk Magnetic Susceptibility (BMS) shift, is applied for Mn(II) and the feasibility of the method is evaluated. A proof of principle using Gd-DOTP concentrations in the range 0.7 – 6.6 mM Gd(III) to verify the applied BMS method was successfully performed. Subsequently, BMS measurements were performed with MnDOTA as well as free Mn(II) and the obtained concentrations were verified with ICP-OES. A good agreement between the two methods was found within the concentration range of 0.4 - 15.1 mM Mn(II) for both MnDOTA and free Mn(II). Although, BMS measurements showed slightly higher concentrations than those found by ICP-OES for both Mn-DOTA and free Mn(II). Additionally, the deviations between ICP-OES and BMS were greater for free Mn(II) compared to Mn-DOTA. Experiments for determining the accuracy of the BMS method showed a 2.5% upward systematic error. The random error decreased from 20% for 0.27 mM Mn(II) to almost 0% for 4.0 mM Mn(II) and higher concentrations. In conclusion, the BMS method proved to be accurate for determining Mn(II) concentrations and has<br/>promising prospects for future research into Mn(II) complexes.

(graduation committee); Seelen, Niki (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","The role of data in the strategic design field is unquestionable and essential, being a catalyst for creativity and decision making. Design teams gather large amounts of data at the beginning of projects, to understand how the context of the problem looks like and how they can get inspired for the ideation of the outcomes. In the context of this Master thesis, data is the first pillar of an input-output processing system, which is used in the field of strategic design (process) and can result in new business models (output). Until now, design practitioners have relied highly on manual data saving (whiteboards, post-its and notebooks). Digital data saving, on the other hand, can ensure that data and the embedded knowledge are not lost or damaged and that can be easily retrieved. Especially within bigger teams where there are multiple data and knowledge creators, it so happens that the knowledge gap between novice and expert designers is large. This typically results in the hindering of quality of the outcomes of design projects, as team members are limited to their own data and knowledge accessible to them, as opposed to the entirety of the team. The second pillar is the process, referred to as strategic design. Business Models Inc. (BMI), a design consultancy for strategy and innovation in Amsterdam, makes use of a variant of strategic design, which is known as Business Design. At BMI, data is used extensively in the understanding phase of the design project and ideation, where the goal is not only to get the Business Design team inspired but also the client, who co-creates with them. The type of data that they make use of is, therefore, a combination of quantitative (e.g. consumer surveys, market outlooks, financial statements of the client) and qualitative (e.g. their curated collection of business models, SWOT analysis, customer interviews and co-creation sessions). This type of data helps the team create new business models and value propositions, which are the output of the input-output processing system. There is an increasing trend in the design industry to start incorporating data science practices, allowing designers to have access to new insights which are up to date and can be shared among team members. This has been proposed in literature and applied already in the design industry, for instance, design consultancies already combining data science with design thinking tools. The premise of this project starts with wondering how the ideation of new business models and value propositions could be further enriched if a data science approach would continue to be welcomed in the design field. The outcome of this project has explored what the best utilization of data would be within the design process, hinting at an exploited usage of data in ideation. The final concept is a 3-horizon roadmap that exposes how BMI could firstly, organize their data; secondly, find it as efficiently as possible, and thirdly, inspire a new customer segment in the creation of new business models and value propositions.","Data; creativity; Business Model; Strategic Design; external stimuli; Digital transformation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

The Flying-V is a V-shaped flying wing with an oval cabin and engines over the trailing edge. The aircraft does not have high-lift devices, and fins and elevons provide stability and control. The Flying-V has been studied on several aspects such as aerodynamics and structures, confirming its large potential fuel burn reduction. This study focuses on the feasibility of developing a family of Flying-V aircraft, which is a crucial step in passenger aircraft development offering multiple aircraft variants at limited development and production cost. The ability to design a family of Flying-V aircraft can be a large advantage with respect to blended wing body designs, of which earlier research suggests that developing a family is difficult due to its lack of a constant cross-section. On a higher level, this research is one of the few focusing on family design of an unconventional aircraft configuration in the conceptual design phase. The Flying-V family is optimised for minimal fuel burn, ensuring commonality in terms of common variables and common components between family members. Fuel burn is calculated using fuel fractions and the Breguet range equation. A vortex-lattice method is employed to study the aerodynamic characteristics of the aircraft, enhanced with a viscous module to estimate its lift-to-drag ratio. The weight of the aircraft is estimated using empirical relations, a semi-analytical oval fuselage weight estimation method and a quasi-analytical conventional aircraft wing weight estimation method. The fuel burn model is validated using the reference aircraft family, resulting in a fuel burn within 0.9% of the data provided by the aircraft manufacturer. Feasibility of the Flying-V family design is ensured by including a range of top-level aircraft requirements on payload, range, cruise speed and altitude, low-speed performance, stability and control and airport regulations. The complete model is built within a ParaPy framework, which is a Knowledge-Based Engineering environment programmed in Python. Optimisation of the Flying-V aircraft family is performed using an iterative procedure, optimising variables that describe the planform and cross-section of the aircraft. The only unique variable for each aircraft variant is the length of the untapered part of the cabin, maximising commonality in the aircraft family. The optimised Flying-V (FV) family consists of three aircraft with a passenger capacity of 293, 328 and 361 for the FV-800, FV-900 and FV-1000 respectively. The design ranges of the Flying-V family members at maximum passenger capacity are 11.2x103 km, 14.8x103 km and 15.4x103 km. The range of the FV-800 is smaller than the other two aircraft family members because no requirement was imposed on this range, determining the range implicitly from the available fuel volume resulting from optimisation of a two-member aircraft family. The optimised design suggests a 20% and 22% lower fuel burn than the modelled reference aircraft family for the FV-900 and FV-1000 on the design mission, proving the feasibility in terms of fuel burn of a Flying-V aircraft family. The penalty in fuel burn compared to individually optimised aircraft is 8.9%, 7.1% and 4.2% for the FV-800, FV-900 and FV-1000 respectively. The takeoff mass of the Flying-V family members is 185x103 kg, 234x103 kg and 266x103 kg respectively. With respect to the modelled A350 family, this is a reduction of 17% and 15% for the -900 and -1000 variant. The approach speed of the FV-900 and FV-1000 is estimated at 136 and 137 kts, much lower than the specified approach speed of the reference aircraft of 140 and 147 kts. Besides constraints on payload and commonality, driving requirements in Flying-V family design are the shift in centre of gravity during flight, the wingspan and the fuel tank volume. Feasibility of the design is ensured by drawing a floor plan of the aircraft fitting its payload and furnishing. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis on the obtained design vector confirms its optimality.","Aircraft family; Flying-V; Commonality","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flying V",""

To do so, a 1GW electrolyser is expected to be built by 2030. The gas produced, which will have the same production profile as the solar irradiance, can be injected in the gas grid, distributed by truck or shipped to the Netherlands. Due to hydrogen’s high volumetric energy density, ammonia is considered a suitable energy carrier for the ship­ping option. However, ammonia production requires a stable hydrogen supply ­ which is not compatible with a profile dependant on solar irradiance. To face this issue, a technological option that stands out is using the existing Carriço salt caverns, located 280km north of Sines and connected by pipeline, as a buffer to store the hydrogen during the day and supply it back to Sines at night. This research aims to calculate the levelized cost of hydrogen transmission by pipeline from Sines to Carriço, storage in the Carriço salt caverns and transmission back to Sines. Based on the stabilized hydrogen production, a model is developed and 4 pathways are considered for each of the possible infrastructure combinations: new or retrofitted transmis­sion and new or retrofitted storage. Dependant on the infrastructure selected, the cost model developed found a total levelized cost of hydrogen transmission and storage of: 0.17­-0.25 [€ ⋅ kg(H2)−1]. By considering a competitive green hydrogen production cost of 1­-1.5[€ ⋅ kg(H2)−1], the transmission &amp; storage costs along with the rest of the direct hydrogen supply, will translate into an added 10% expense ­ on top of production ­ to provide a stable hydrogen supply to the ammonia plant. The result, which is aligned with literature, is expected to provide solid input in assessing hydrogen’s price competitiveness and contribute to the decision process of using retrofitted or new infrastructure.","Green hydrogen; Cost analysis; Sines Hub; Salt caverns storage; Pipeline transmission","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","Green Flamingo","37.957430, -8.881993"

The application of a chromium layer to packaging steel is essential for providing a protective layer on the steel packaging’s external surface area, which prevents corrosion during its use. However, the deposition process of Cr-metal from Cr(III) solution cannot produce a deposit thicker than 10 μm with sufficient corrosion and wear resistance without the application of a complexing agent. This study provides both an experimental research as an comparative computational model. Experiments are set up to analyse the effect of the formate ion HCOO(-) concentration as a complexing agent in Cr_2(SO_4)_3 electrolytes, which results are compared to the output of the used computational model. The results provide insights into the initial composition of species in plating electrolytes, which is essential for the determination of the deposition mechanism from Cr(III) electrolytes to improve the electroplating process. Ligand exchange and bonding with HCOO(-) in chromium complexes is studied with Ultraviolet-visible light (UV-VIS) spectroscopy and Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier InfraRed spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) at various concentrations of HCOO(-). Additionally, computational modelling is performed with Density functional theory (DFT) to predict the spontaneous character of various ligand substitutions, and simulations of spectroscopic spectra are performed as a reference to mimic the experimentally observed data. It was found that ligand exchange with HCOO(-) in Cr_2(SO_4)_3 solutions occurs spontaneously within two days at elevated temperatures at the analysed concentrations. The experimental data shows, there is a transition point in the complex formation between the ratio of [Cr(3+)]:[ HCOO(-)] is respectively [1]:[1.61] and [1]:[3.32]. This indicates that the complex formation decreases past the ratio of [Cr(3+)]:[ HCOO(-) ] = c.a.[1]:[3] and that the concentration at which the most chromium-formate complexes can be observed is within the range of [Cr(3+)]:[ HCOO(-) ] = [1]:[1.61] to [Cr(3+)]:[ HCOO(-) ]= [1]:[3.32]. The formation of chromium-formate complexes is beneficial for the deposition process, as the addition of formate increases the amount of chromium deposited on the steel surface. Furthermore, it is found that the presence of SO_4(-2), originating from the chromium salt, is beneficial for the ligand exchange of HCOO(-). Also, the bonding of formate to chromium is found to be as monodentate binding.","Trivalent chromium; formate; complexation; UV-Vis; ATR-FTIR; Density Functional Theory; concentration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

In the last century, linear control theory has matured to a level where scalable algorithms are widely available that are able to synthesize controllers with stability and optimality guarantee. However, the synthesis of safe controllers largely remains an open question. Furthermore, when nonlinear systems are considered, these methods often result in sub-optimal performance, or fail to provide a stabilizing solution at all. Current nonlinear controller synthesis methods typically lack stability, safety and/or optimality guarantee, or require computationally expensive online optimization. This thesis presents a novel method that is able to overcome these limitations. The presented controller synthesis method combines techniques from Approximate Dynamic Programming, Lyapunov theory and barrier theory, to synthesize an optimal controller in the form of a Neural Network. Alongside the controller a second Neural Network is deployed, which is trained to serve as a certificate function to provide stability and/or safety guarantee. To assure the correctness of the procedure, Satisfiability Modulo Theory and Counterexample-Guided Inductive Synthesis are utilized. We subject the method to a number of case studies, through which the versatility of the method is demonstrated. We show the method is able to work with linear and nonlinear systems, as well as systems with input and state constraints. Furthermore, we show the method yields controllers that are able to outperform linear controllers in terms of cost minimization.","Formal Controller Synthesis; Optimal Control; Lyapunov Theory; Satisfiability Modulo Theory; Counterexample-Guided Inductive Synthesis; Neural Networks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

A decade before the change, the city rejected high-rise buildings. But since this new vision, called ‘Nieuw Rotterdam’, got approved, Rotterdam implemented a high-rise vision which made the city as it is today; defined by a modern character and full of high-rise buildings, at least for Dutch standards. Yet, this high-rise implementation is only a small attribution of the conducted vision that was established in the late previous century. Neoliberal implementation goes further than merely implementing American-like high-rise buildings. It concerns the economics; particularly the liberation of the market and the multinational business trend that defines the contemporary economical appearances of both city and country. Since the drastic changes in city vision, Rotterdam opened up its borders and adopted a desire for foreign business, to upgrade their economical game and compete against the economic prosperity of other cities. Rotterdam therefore changed quite radically since Nieuw Rotterdam was practically implemented. Its buildings grew, its habitants grew and it became a popular place for tourists. In the Netherlands, Rotterdam is known today for their rich modern architecture and its modern appearance. However, the aspect of business, is less thriving. While it started to aim at welcoming more foreign business about thirty years ago, Rotterdam today is still struggling to find and welcome foreign companies and multinational business into its city. One of the primary reasons for this, is that both the city centre and its economical heart of the RCD, lacks an economical identity. Rotterdam did have its identity of the industry and the port, yet the neoliberal growth and privatization of those instances led to the translocation outside the city centre.

The purpose of the results of this research is an application in computer-aided diagnostics and treatment planning in the field of neurosurgery. Spinal degeneration can be described as the gradual loss of spinal structure and a decreased functioning of the spine over time. Before the diagnosis of spine degeneration can be made, a sagittal X-ray analysis of the spine is very important. With the current ageing population and the relatively high prevalence of neck pain and spinal complaints of approximately 30%, there is a great demand on MRI and X-ray analysis in healthcare. Machine learning techniques, and especially convolutional neural networks, seem promising for the application of X-ray image analysis. This research was preceded by a literature study about cervical degeneration and the implementation of ML in spine research. Of the available machine learning techniques, artificial neural networks show the best classification accuracy when it comes to image classification. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in particular are applicable for the computer vision classification task of this study. That is why, in consultation with the neurosurgery department of the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC), it was decided to focus on the development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to perform the binary classification task. The final configuration of the convolutional neural network (CNN) consists of four convolutional layers with ReLU activation function and a maximal pooling function. Batch normalization was applied after the first convolutional layer of the model in order to create a more stable training environment. The false positive rate (FPR) is 19% on average and 15% during the best performing run. The ROC curve shows an AUC during the best performing run of 0.91 and 0.86 on average, whereby 1.0 would be a perfect classifier. It can be concluded that this classification task could be performed by a convolutional neural network (CNN), adapted to the specific classification task. The lowest achieved false positive rate of the model was 15%, which shows a major improvement compared to the current clinical situation at the department of neurosurgery in the Leiden University Medical Center, where about 25% of invasive spinal surgical operations, involving cervical degeneration, are of no benefit to the patient.","CNN; Convolutional Neural Network; Cervical Spine; Machine Learning; Degeneration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-03-01","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Desalination, the process in which salt water is converted into freshwater, is a sensible option to expand the drinking water supply by accessing the vast salt water resources on Earth. Capacitive deionization (CDI) is a novel desalination technology that is based on separating salt ions from aqueous solutions in an electrical double layer. An electrostatic potential difference is applied between two high surface area electrodes, the two oppositely charged electrodes attract and adsorb salt ions onto the electrode surface, as such producing a purified stream of water. In time, the electrodes become saturated with ions. To regenerate the electrodes the applied potential is removed or reversed, producing a concentrated stream of water. For brackish water, this new fundamental method of desalination has advantages over conventional desalination technologies. CDI can be operated with minimal energy requirement in ambient pressures and temperatures, delivering easy operable systems. This thesis investigates manufacturing of activated carbon electrodes purposed for multi-channel CDI. Current CDI systems operate by desalinating one channel and concentrating the same channel periodically. Multi-channel CDI operates a charging scheme, utilizing more than two electrodes, to desalinate one channel into another channel, circumventing the need to separate desalinated water from concentrated water downstream. Due to the different mode of separation are currently available CDI electrodes not tailored to, or not usable at all, in multi-channel CDI.In this project six successful different types of electrodes have been manufactured by dip coating. The coating compositions applied are 80:10:10, 70:10:20 and 40:40:20 using activated carbon powder (ACP), carbon black and PVDF binder respectively. The in-house build electrodes are analyzed with cyclic voltammetry, desalination measurements and a surface and pore size analyzer. Two-dimensional electrosorption simulations are performed to explore the effect of electrode resistance, micropore porosity and electrode thickness. The dip coated electrodes resulted in permeable smooth uniform electrodes. The electrodes with the most amount of ACP displayed largest capacitance and salt adsorption capacity. Electrosorption modelling shows that thin, highly electrical conductive electrodes are desired in multi-channel CDI operation.","Capacitive Deionization; Multi-Channel Deionization; Activated carbon electrodes; Dip coating; Manufacturing; Cyclic voltammetry; Electrosorption modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-10-15","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

By 2040 South Holland aims to have built 210.000 new dwellings to meet the rapidly growing housing demand. This transition in the built environment should align with current climate agreements and be as energy neutral as possible. To meet these goals, a lot of material and renewable energy are needed. However, the current linear economy creates inequalities for current and future generations. Therefore, radical changes towards circular construction and the demolition sector are needed. At the same time, energy poverty is an issue that calls for immediate actions in order to make the much-needed transition truly sustainable. Nevertheless, the country lacks a comprehensive measurement framework that considers social aspects to address the phenomenon. The main research question is how to manage the transition in South Holland towards a circular built environment while ensuring that this transition is done in a fair way. In order to make this possible, a tremendous change in organisational structures is required. An interscalar approach is needed to create a symbiosis betweenthe regional scale and the actions needed at a local level. In this work, bottom-up initiatives are encouraged and embraced within a bigger top-down mainframe. Through an assessment analysis, the goals towards a sustainable built environment are classified into three categories: materials, energy and knowledge. These goals will strengthen the social foundation of our report and fit the ecological ceiling that all development must respect. In our work, phasing of interventions is based onthe urgency needed. In that sense, actions are prioritisedin the most vulnerable areas while pilot projects serve as the research ground for testing feasibility and potential upscaling. The most urgent areas will be addressed first according to the criteria of low liveability, building energy performance, low income and ownership status.The overall goal of this strategy is to create a just sustainable built environment characterised by circular material flows and fair energy transition. More precisely, the aim is to strive for affordable and adequate housing for all, a regenerative and stable labour market and knowledge exchange. Concerning material flows, the target of closed material loops is achieved through renewable raw materials used, upcycling of wasteflows and optimal use. Finally, democratisation of energy has become a key theme. Supply and demand for renewable energy sources is controlled to minimise energy losses. A decentralised energy system enables every citizen to become a prosumer of energy leading thus to democratisation of energy.","circular economy (CE); social justice; inclusive energy transition; Material Flow; South Holland","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","AR2U086 R&D Studio – Spatial Strategies for the Global Metropolis",""

This, together with the increasing global need for circularity, is why the province has an important task in the near future to take steps towards a circular economy. To address this task, this report has chosen to look into the agri-food sector, because of their high economical significance in South Holland, and the construction sector, because of the current and future high demand for housing. Both sectors also create large residual material flows. Minimizing the high amount of waste from both sectors is essential in order to reach a circular region. The existing approach in creating a circular economy is to often look at individual sectors and their material flows. This is logical, but adverse with the idea of circularity, where all chains are closed. We believe, however, that these problems don’t have to be solved within ‘their’ sector. Our vision to solve this problem is as follows: “In 2050, the material flow of the agri-food sector will be closed. All before-known waste is now used as a resource for the construction sector. Because of this, the waste of the construction sector is reduced. Because of the collaborative sector chains, they could now be seen as one interlinked sector. The South Holland agriculture sector is now a leading example for a symbiotic and self sufficient interlinked chain.” Our ambition is to create a new movement within the circular economy. Bottom-up initiatives show that it is possible to create interlinked sectors. This project will be a pilot in upscaling this idea, and proving this is possible and has greatly beneficial outcomes. The pilot focuses on using agri-food residual flows as a resource for the construction industry of South Holland, but can be an inspiration to interlinking other sectors. To approach the interlinking of sectors, we envision a few strategies. We will be bringing the pieces of different policies together, use education and knowledge as glue between the sectors, and use transport and infrastructure to support the connection. Spatially, this results in four types of transition areas, a new living environment where the two sectors come together, also impacting the surrounding areas. This also impacts citizens from a socio-economic perspective, because more cross-sector jobs will be created and competition between businesses will be stimulated, which drives them to become more circular.","circular economy (CE); South Holland; agri-food sector; construction; Symbiosis","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","AR2U086 R&D Studio – Spatial Strategies for the Global Metropolis",""

This method uses the dimensions of the ship, its speed and the waterway characteristics to estimate the energy consumption and corresponding emissions of a vessel. This method can be used in the support of development and evaluation of emission reduction policies. To illustrate the potential of this method, it is applied to a case study: the inland fleet on the Rotterdam-Antwerp corridor, one of the main transport axes in the Netherlands. The developed method is applied to observed AIS data, to map the current potential emission patterns (‘t0 emission scenario’). In addition, a model has been developed that simulates the ‘t0’ case.

The coastal zone is a rich environment with multiple stakeholders. These stakeholders use the coastal zone for a range of functions such as safety, nature, business, and recreation. Coastal dunes have been the first line of defense against the sea for many years. On decadal and intercentennial time scale, climate change (e.g. sea level rise) and human intervention (e.g. nourishment), affect the variability of the coastline in different ways. Reports have shown an increase of the mean sea level, which is expected to increase even after the year 2100. Bruun was one of the first researchers, who found a relation between sea level rise and shoreline recession. While Bruuns findings contain the fundamental adaption of the coastline due to sea level rise, the coastline remains a highly complex system. Morphological data has been collected yearly of the Dutch coast as part of the JarKus program. Meanwhile, the data collection and computational power have increased exponentially, while the computational cost has gone down. Combining the newly computational power with the extensive JarKus data set, provides new insight into the complex coastal system. The derived variables from the JarKus data set range from widths, gradients, volumes to heights. These derived variables are combined with nourishment into a high-dimensional data set. Clusters of comparable coastal profiles in the Hoogheemraadschap Hollands Noorderkwartier area, have been made using machine learning techniques. Machine learning techniques such as K-means and the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) contain an intelligence, with the capability of clustering similar high-dimensional objects or data, without knowing the desired output. While both methods have the same goal, K-means moves its centroids inside the data and the SOM moves the data to its centroids (BMU). The advantage of combining both methods, is to keep the topological preservation while having the 'hard' clustering advantage of the K-means, which provides easy interpretation and therefore computations. The coastline of the Noorderkwartier can be broken up into nine clusters. Five of these clusters are classified as main-clusters, having a large number of transects. Four clusters are classified as sub-clusters, having just a few transects. Each of the clusters contains its own characteristic variables. Each of these characteristics originates from its own long-term natural and human-induced causes. The variable dominating the general clustering, is the active profile of the coastline. The lesser dominating variables are the foreshore nourishment, depth of closure and increase in foreshore volume. Meaning that the high-dimensional data set, find their similarities due to these dominant variables. Upon further investigation, the clusters containing the highest active profiles, were also the clusters containing historical larger nourishments. Comparing the yearly change of the standard deviation, shows that the clusters containing larger historical nourishment, have a shifting depth of closure. With respect to the dunes, correlations are found between the dune foot, y-coordinate of the boundary between marine and aeolian transport, dune volume and active width of the dune. While the exact reason for this correlation is still unknown, it shows potential for further research. The results of this research contribute to another step in understanding the complex coastal zone. Hoogheemraadschap Hollands Noorderkwartier can now adjust its policy and approach for each cluster based on the results of this research. For further research, it is now possible to focus on specific clusters with their unique characteristics. Lastly, results highlight the importance of the effect of nourishment on the active profile and with this the future dynamic equilibrium of the coastline.","Hollands Noorderkwartier; JarKus; Clustering techniques; Self-Organizing Map","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","52.0126341,4.3555860"

Researching them is difficult, since they are many light-years away. As a result of this, we can only observe them from one viewpoint: Earth. The appearance of nebulae is almost always unique, because of the many factors that influence it. Still, there exist a class of nebulae with a pronounced axial-symmetry in their appearance. The axial-symmetry in these nebulae gives us an indication on how particles in the nebulae will be distributed. We can exploit this symmetry and represent the 3D volume of such a nebulae using a 2D map that is rotated around the symmetry axis. Previous methods converted the 2D map into a 3D volume before rendering, but we propose a novel visualization technique whereby only the 2D map is used. A benefit of representing the nebula using a 2D map is that it is easier to modify than a 3D volume, making it easy to model plausible looking nebulae. We also propose new techniques for reconstructing the 2D map of existing nebulae from telescope images. Combining our achievements in visualization and reconstruction makes it possible to view real axial-symmetrical nebulae from novel viewpoints. Finally, we propose methods to reintroduce asymmetries in volumes of the axial-symmetrical nebulae. These irregularities are also found in real axial-symmetrical nebulae and make the visualizations appear even more realistic.","Nebulae; Visualization; Reconstruction; Axial-Symmetrical","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The international market in which Dutch farmers operate has elongated the path from farm to fork and created an anonymous food chain. Food production has been intensified over the years with agriculture practices evolving with a focus on efficiency and high yields. This has resulted in a highly polluting sector that is responsible for 34% of human caused greenhouse gas emissions (Crippa et al., 2021). The current agri-food system is therefore environmentally and socially unsustainable. Alternative food systems are being explored which might offer a solution to these challenges. The implementation of nature inclusive farming focuses on realizing an agriculture sector that integrates food production and nature preservation. Project client Caring Farmers aims to stimulate nature inclusive farming in order to tackle the environmental and societal challenges of the agri-food system. The design challenge of this project was: How can the transition towards a nature inclusive agri-food sector in the Netherlands be accelerated through the enhancement of the relation between farmer and consumer? With a systemic design approach and qualitative research, it was concluded that the role of the agri-food sector is changing. An opportunity exists to reintegrate farming in society and create a system that expands its focus for farming beyond economic production towards its societal relevance. The environmental and societal services that farmers deliver to society should be valued to ensure a fair income for them and for the sector to become more sustainable. The thesis proposes a three-horizon strategy on how to create value for the ecosystem services that farms can deliver to society. By implementing a system that monitors ecosystem services like biodiversity, soil quality, and carbon sequestration, these values can be quantified. In the first horizon, a product-service system is designed to make farms more accessible for citizens. With an application, citizens can visit farms and learn about sustainable agriculture. The second horizon embeds this application in a platform that enables farmers and citizens to monitor the ecosystem services on farms. Through citizen science projects, visitors help farmers to collect data about these services. This facilitates research about the impact of sustainable farming on the environment so that the vision of the third horizon can be realized. This vision shows a societal system in which farmers and citizens collaboratively work towards a sustainable agri-food sector where ecosystem services are valued and appreciated. The strategic roadmap is supported by visualisations of the application and platform. Furthermore, an implementation roadmap was created to support the organisation in the implementation of the strategic advice and design products. This project provides a different view on the role of agriculture in the Netherlands by looking beyond the need for fair food prices. It provides a vision where the appreciation for the work of farmers is divided into multiple services instead of embedded in the price of a carton of milk. <br","Strategic Design; Roadmap; systemic design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Introduction: This research aims to develop a 3D-printed ergonomic handle design for a steerable laparoscopic instrument with minimised part assembly. Steerable laparoscopic instruments are used in minimally invasive surgery (MIS). MIS is a technique where surgeons insert long slender surgical instruments through small incisions of five to ten millimetres in the abdominal wall. According to various studies regarding the ergonomics of laparoscopic instruments, improvements in the control and handle design are necessary. Non-ergonomic design and control, combined with extensive surgery, can cause physical discomfort, muscle fatigue, mental stress, and other complications to the surgeon that can adversely affect the patient. Improvements in the design can overcome inconvenient and uncomfortable movements of laparoscopic instruments to make MIS safer for surgeons and patients. In addition to the improvements in ergonomics, a reduction in assembled parts in current laparoscopic instruments can shorten the assembly time, resulting in lower manufacturing costs. 3D-printing offers design freedom to enable complex structures with minimised part assembly and has the potential to customise the instrument specifically to the surgeon. Methods: The working principles and ergonomics of sixteen steerable laparoscopic instruments were analysed. Requirements were set up from the analysed laparoscopic instruments, handle design ergonomics and control ergonomics to develop an ergonomic handle design. Concepts have emerged from the requirements, and the most promising concept has been developed towards a final design. From the final proposed handle design emerged a working prototype, The LapaJoy. The 3D-printing technique of stereolithography was used to manufacture the LapaJoy. Steering, grasping, bending and locking tests were conducted to compare the retrieved data with the requirements to validate and evaluate the working principle and performance of the LapaJoy. Results: The LapaJoy consists of five assembled parts and allows the surgeon to control the four different functions of the instrument. The surgeon can control the end-effector in two degrees of freedom, lock the end-effector's position, open and close the grasping forceps, and lock the grasping forceps in place. All four functions of the LapaJoy can be performed by a novel two-finger control system using the index finger and thumb. The results show that the LapaJoy can manipulate the end-effector in two degrees of freedom by 20 degrees and lock the end-effector in any desired position. The instrument's grasper is functional, and the grasping forceps can be locked in place upon release of the grasper trigger. However, an analysation showed a reduction in the opening range of the grasping forceps with each opening and closing cycle. Furthermore, a material response wherein deformation of the steering segment's flexure occurred. The steering segment's flexure was deformed by 9.9 degrees after applying almost 1 N to the grasping forceps in the vertical direction. In addition, fatigue and failure of the grasper and joystick design occurred during extensive use and testing. Conclusion: By developing the 3D-printed ergonomic handle design with minimised part assembly, new knowledge was acquired in the possibilities of 3D-printing as a manufacturing technique for laparoscopic instruments. Future research is recommended to increase the steering angle and use more durable materials to create a more reliable product. The instrument's performance showed excellent potential in 3D printable laparoscopic instruments with minimised part assembly. The LapaJoy has the prospect of being an ergonomic, low cost, disposable MIS instrument.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies into perceived responsibility were mostly conducted in traded control systems, in which either the vehicle or the driver was performing the task, and tasks were shifted between them. In haptic shared control systems the automation and human driver cooperate continuously. The Level of Haptic Authority (LoHA) determines how strong the controller enforces its guidance. We examine how this LoHA impacts the driver's own perceived outcome responsibility, as well as that attributed to the automation when the automation makes a mistake. We found that when authority is shifted towards the car, the human driver feels less responsible, and attributes more responsibility to the automation, but only to a certain degree. Our findings correspond with previous research and with our own hypothesis. They add a new perspective to the current literature, as this is the first research-paper to examine responsibility perception in haptic shared driving from the drivers perspective.

Most MPC schemes that are used nowadays lack in the application for systems with high sampling frequencies because of their high computational time, especially when the system is nonlinear. This is, for example, the case for most of the power electronic systems. Recently, a new approach of MPC control is proposed which is based on sampling control inputs from the input space. In contrast with other MPC approaches, this approach is focused on suboptimal control instead of the optimal control in other MPC approaches which usually results in a less optimal control sequence, but, furthermore, it still benefits from all the advantages of the MPC control method. This thesis describes several efficient and fast methods to determine the offline part of the SD-NMPC controller, which are the local controller with corresponding DOA and the initial control sequence steering the system into this DOA, using only linear optimization tools. Among all these methods, we determined the best option for the buck-boost converter with resistive load and the VSI controlling a PMSM. Besides the offline part, we also improved the online part of the SD-NMPC control method which resulted in a fast and optimal controller for these systems. This method has shown all the benefits of the implementation of an MPC controller. Based on the results, we could conclude that the SD-NMPC control method is a fast and efficient way to apply an MPC method to power electronic converters.","MPC; sampling-driven MPC; buck-boost converter; power converters; PMSM; three-phase VSI; PID; field oriented control; nonlinear MPC control","en","master thesis","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.4121/14223062.v1 Matlab code supplementary to this MSc thesis","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Because of the very cold temperatures, the water molecules accreting onto dust are expected to form highly porous ice, as it occurs in the laboratory simulations. The icy grains encountering each other will form larger bodies, such as comets, and the porous ices plus the coagulation of icy grains leads to a fluffy cometary ice structure. This study explores the feasibility of porosity measurements by means of ultrasonicmeasurements in these ices. A new, small liquid N2 cooled vacuum chamber was used to perform the experiments with different type of ices. strophysical ices were grown on a methacrylate substrate on which an ultrasonic transducer was mounted that sent and received ultrasonic signals. Experiments with H2O (water) and CH3OH (methanol) were done by deposition from a gas phase while also H2O (water) and C2H5OH (ethanol) were frozen on top of the methacrylate from their liquid phase. These two type of experiments required an adapted version of the setup that allowed for experiments that can freeze ice from its liquid state at atmospheric pressure after which the rest of the experiment could take place in the vacuum chamber. From this experiment, the speed of sound in water ice could be determined as a function of temperature. A linear trend for a decreasing temperature in water ice was found with slope 2.5494m/(s°C) and an offset at 0°C of 3616.86m/s for a temperature range from 0°C to -100°C. Results show that propagation of ultrasonic waves in vacuum chamber-grown ice encounters too much attenuation that prevented a distinct signal to be detectable by the transducer.","Ultrasound; Planetary Ices; porosity; vacuum chamber; Comets; speed of sound; Methacrylate; experimental thesis; Water; Methanol; Ethanol; Pulse Echo; Attenuation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Serving as storage space after the 1920's for the emigrants of the country, and as industrial storage after the 1950's, it becomes today part of the modern redevelopments of the peninsula. The urban transformation taking place in the peninsula of Katendrecht poses a serious question to the Fenix II building about its urban character and its role in the city. Its relation to the surroundings and the multiple urban characters around it are important for the future function and can be used to position the building inside the urban network of the city, making it part of the ongoing route among the city’s monumental architecture. The strong connection to the memories of the past and the spacious interior form a perfect background for a new cultural use which in combination with other functions can support a durable future use. The existing facade’s and structure can be easily utilized to house modern functions with the addition of installations, while allowing its open floor plan to be experienced. Part of the building’s footprint can be returned to the public realm with the use of green areas and connect the two sides of its long form.

This study aims to find the added value of river run-off data for regularizing GRACE mascon solution, from which TWSV can be estimated. Most subbasins of the Mississippi Basin show an exponential relationship between run-off and TWSV with moderate to good predictive value. The mean value of the explained variance (R^2) for the models is 0.4, when excluding the Lower Mississippi and Middle Missouri subbasins the mean value increases to 0.5. The Lower Mississippi and Middle Missouri subbasins are the only subbasins with no clear correlation between run-off and storage, most likely due to aquifer depletion. <br/><br/>Since ready-to-used GRACE mascon solutions cannot be modified, the mascon method developed at the Geoscience and Remote Sensing Department of the Delft University of Technology is used in this study. This study proposes modifications to tailor this method to the Mississippi Basin and mass anomalies of hydrological origin. After applying standard Tikhonov regularization, the exponential relationship is used to determine the most probable model outcome for each subbasin, adding a new term to the estimator. The resulting GRACE mascon solutions (Tikhonov and run-off regularized solutions) have a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of around 3.5 cm when compared to ready-to-use mascon solutions from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Goddard Space Flight Center. The run-off regularized solutions show smaller deviation (on average 7 %) than the Tikhonov regularized solutions with respect to an independent validation data set. The largest difference between the Tikhonov and run-off regularized solutions occur in the dryer subbasins (Platte, Middle, and Upper Missouri, and Upper Mississippi subbasin). These areas show a stronger inter-annual trend in TWSV, these trends are captured better by the run-off regularized solutions. Additional research, co-estimating the regularization bias, shows that the run-off regularized solutions induce less bias into the solutions. This study shows that using run-off data when processing GRACE data could be of added value, especially in semi-humid to arid areas, since the TWSV in these areas is more susceptible to inter-annual variations.","GRACE; terrestrial water storage variations; river run-off; regularization; mascon approach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","",""

The building and demolition industry was, and still is, the most significant contributor. The estimation is made that in 2017 23% of this wood, 370 million kg, consisted of solid waste wood. This solid waste wood has the potential to be reused as a building material without having to shred it. The current commonly used timber frame construction methods in the Netherlands are not suitable for construction with waste wood. Waste wood has certain characteristics that differ from regular wood for construction on a larger scale. It is possible to create an exterior wall element from waste wood, but this is a time-consuming process. Manual labor is expensive in the Netherlands. Therefore, it will probably not be an economically feasible solution to construct the wall element. A carpenter that needs to modify every piece by hand to get everything in the correct dimensions will probably be more expensive than buying new wood. Using digital fabrication combined with a parametric model can offer a solution to the challenges of constructing an exterior wall element with waste wood. The characteristics of the waste wood are obtained and digitally stored in a database. This database can communicate with a parametric model and generate all the separate 3dm files required for digital manufacturing. The final design was made parametric so that it could communicate with the database. Using Rhino, Grasshopper and Python, a prototype of the exterior wall element tool was made that bridged the parametric model with a waste wood database and gave the user some insight into the waste wood statistics of the design. Python scripts were used for an efficient selection procedure whereby additional material waste could be minimized in the exterior wall element. With the exterior wall element tool, it is possible to create a national database with waste wood. The sellers of waste wood can be the demolishing companies but also the waste wood processors. A contractor can use the exterior wall element tool online to create an exterior wall element from waste wood. Here the user, in this case the contractor, gives the desired dimensions of the wall, and the tool generates a design of an exterior wall element. Additional information is given about the cost, the amount of wood required and where the wood is located. The contractor can adjust the parameters of the model and choose, for example, the cheapest option or the option where all the wood is closest to the building side. In the end the tool generates a list with 3dm files for every piece of wood that has to be modified. These 3dm files can be used for digital fabrication.","Reusing waste wood; Parametric model; Parametric design; Circular","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

People that know how to innovate. For engineers, it is not always easy to do that. They know a lot about technology (feasibility) but could lack knowledge about the business (viability) and the market (desirability). This report aims to help engineers create a more innovative mindset and thereby boost the innovation output of their organization.A case study into Croonwolter&amp;dros (CWD) explores the problems they encounter with innovation. CWD is a system integrator specializing in engineering and installing technical systems. They have over 140 years of experience in this field and aim to launch three new product-market combinations (PMC’s) a year. Currently, they are working hard to achieve this but have not managed to do so.From several interviews with stakeholders, I learned that knowledge sharing between divisions and colleagues is one of CWD’s issues. CWD is divided into three divisions: Infrastructure, Utility, and Industry. All these divisions have to develop their own business. This causes them to form silos where there is little to no cross-departmental collaboration. Therefore this case study focuses on addressing the lack of knowledge sharing to boost the innovation output of CWD.To understand what knowledge is needed in the organization, I analyzed innovations that are under development at CWD. This analysis showed that CWD employees mainly focus on the feasibility of their innovations and do not pay as much attention to the viability and desirability of their innovations. Because of that, they fail to fully convince essential stakeholders of their innovations’ potential.To tackle this problem, I organized three ideation sessions with innovators to brainstorm ideas that could create a more complete story around their innovations. Three different concepts resulted from these brainstorms. All with the potential to boost the innovation output of CWD. I needed a clear reference frame to compare and decide between the three concepts. The initial plan was to see which concept fitted best to the innovation strategy of CWD, but the innovation strategy was, at that point, too vague andambiguous to decide between the concepts. Therefore I chose to set a clear starting point for innovation at CWD. This resulted in the six principles for innovation at CWD. Based on these principles, I decided to combine two concepts. These concepts are the foundations of IVI.IVI (Iedereen Voor Innovatie) is an approach to boost the innovation output of CWD by improving the innovative mindset of CWD’s innovators. IVI consist of a business development team that helps the innovators. Everyone at CWD with an idea can go to the development team and ask for help. Together they will make a smoke test. This smoke shows the idea to a broad audience via a web page. Everyone can leave comments, questions, or suggestions on this web page. The innovator can use this data to improve his or her innovation. The development team also collects this data for further analysis. From the data, the best performing innovations are invited to the innovation fair. All fair visitors can invest a number of hours into innovations they see potential in. The innovators can use these hours to progress their innovations. If the innovators fail to get enough engagement on their smoke test or to convince enough investors, they know they have to improve their innovation’s viability, desirability, and feasibility. The development team can help them with that.IVI was received positively in an early validation session, both by several stakeholders as well as by the CWD board. Further testing is needed to validate additional assumptions around IVI, but there are no major game stoppers at this time. IVI could be implemented by first putting together the development team. They can become the product owners of IVI and continue implementing IVI. The team should start by actively approaching CWD employees that have an idea to get the ball rolling and create the first smoke tests. From there, they can move on the organizing the first innovation fair. After a significant period, they can organize training and coaching sessions to further boost the innovative mindset of CWD’s innovators and engineers. This completes the implementation of IVI and should, in theory, help CWD to reach its goal of launching three new product- market combinations a year. IVI partly democratizes innovation, and future research might even find applications for this concept in a broader context.","Innovation; Construction; Innovation mindset; Entrepreneurship; Engineers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Given these problems, the following research question is chosen: can improving ecological conditions and livability in South Holland be accomplished by creating a circular agricultural system where livestock farming is severely limited? The goal of this project is to respect and work with the underlying landscape system to con-struct a new circular agricultural system which is beneficial for the ecological system and livability in South Holland. This will be achieved by reducing livestock farming by over 90%, which will still leave us with the right number of animals needed for sufficient manure production. On the remaining land, new types of protein rich, eco-friendly agriculture will be introduced. Furthermore, ground remediation will be done, in peat areas the ground water level is increased to battle subsidence and double dikes will be realized to limit the long-term flood risk in a natural way while producing seaweed at the same time. To create a stronger economy, knowledge on the new forms of farming and producing meat replacements in the newly introduced meat replacement hub will be created and exported. Lastly an ecological network will be created to strengthen the ecosystem and increase biodiversity. By these interventions, a stronger ecosystem is created that will be integrated into people’s lives. To make these interventions happen, scientists need to work together with policy makers and designers to discuss the details of the projects. They will initiate the processes, and then give nature time to heal and achieve the sought-after ecological results. Overall, the following recommendations are given to the province of South Holland: •Initiate natural changes that will lead to a stronger ecology and underlying landscape •Give strong incentives for entrepreneurs to be circular: facilitate, stimulate but also regulate. •Take externalities into account when making economic calculations, then a sustainable way is likely to also be the most profitable way. This report is interesting for policy makers and spatial planners at a national, regional and city scale level looking for spatial solutions to problems with a linear agricultural system as well as policy makers wanting to improve the subsoil conditions. The report is specifically interesting when one is interested in south holland but can also be applied broader to the Netherlands and countries with similar climates, soil types and ecosystems.","circular agriculture; livestock farming reduction; Ecological system; landscape-based agriculture; Water management","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","AR2U086 R&D Studio – Spatial Strategies for the Global Metropolis",""

These images contain valuable information for different sectors, such as the agricultural and military sector. Furthermore they can contain important information about the climate and climate change. Sending these images to earth requires a large amount of down-link bandwidth. This results in heavy, large power modules and communication modules, resulting in larger, more expensive (in terms of launch cost as well as in terms of production cost) satellites. This phenomenon already results in satellites not sending all information they gather, with examples of being able to send 2 minutes worth of data per orbit (approx. 90 minutes) not being out of the ordinary. As more and more satellites are transmitting data towards earth the communication is also expected to become even more power-intensive (or even more limited), since the (theoretically) available bandwidth per satellite is reduced. Therefore a shift towards a different approach is necessary. Smarter ways to get the relevant information to earth have to be developed. In contrast with the ""common knowledge"" that is often applied in the field of object detection, using the highest possible image quality does not transfer to the best trained network when gathering a dataset of satellite images, since the main constraint is the bandwidth available for transmitting images, where ""normally"" the largest constraint is the amount of man-hours spent on annotation. Compression of training images with JPEG-XR quality level 2 during the gathering of training images results in a better ""bandwidth-efficiency"", in the dataset used for this research at least up to 30000 images. It was also found that when more bandwidth is available and thus more images can be added to the training set, the optimal amount of compression tends to decrease. This results also lies in line with the result that the ""final accuracy"" (the predicted accuracy of a model trained on an infinite amount of images) of the models tend to improve with better image quality. From this it can be concluded that for the optimal approach the training images should be compressed as far as possible at the start of training, to then decrease the amount of compression as the mission progresses and more cumulative bandwidth is available.","Machine learning; Satellite data processing; Satellite; AI; Computer vision; CNN; Data Compression; Edge Computing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-04-08","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

In this model human decision-makers, a Decision Support Tool, and technical systems are included. The selected case study encompasses the<br/>unexpected diversion of a flight from Amsterdam to London City. The decision-making inherent to the disruption management of this unexpected diversion is studied. In the model, in line with cognitive science literature, the agents are simulated to operate in the scrambled, opportunistic, tactical, and strategic con-<br/>trol modes, which differ in the situation awareness and use of technical systems. In these control modes respectively the plurality voting protocol, Borda voting protocol, Clarke Tax Algorithm, and Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) are implemented as decision-making mechanisms. The agents in the strategic<br/>control mode demonstrated the ability to make adaptive decisions. In the tactical control mode, the agents showed decision-making characterised by adaptive responses and limited anticipation. In the scrambled and opportunistic control modes, the decision-making was characterised by a lack of adaptation and was solely based on experience. The analysis of the decision-making showed that decision-making based on the airline’s cost model results in different decisions than decision-making by the human operations controllers. Due to this, the operations controllers are not eager to decide on the implementation of a proposed solution strategy by the Decision Support Tool. It showed that the decision-makers often have to make compromises to arrive at a collaborative decision. Furthermore, scenarios that are characterised by reserve unavailability do not require anticipation in the decision-making and can be handled in the opportunistic control mode, which is the lowest control mode that resulted in adequate decision-making. However, when anticipation is required the CDM and OrbiFly systems are essential resources. It is recommended that the MCDM decision-making mechanism can be used to improve the consistency of the operational decision-making and enables the AOCC to learn from previous occurrences. Hereby, the capability of the AOCC to deal with disruptions<br/>through resistance instead of resilience can be extended. Overall, the analysis of the different decision-making mechanisms showed that human operations controllers are essential for adaptive decision-making in the AOCC.","Agent-Based Modeling; Socio-technical system; Disruption management; Airline; MCDM; Resilience; Resistance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Areas of railways with considerable variation of track properties encountered near structures such as bridges and tunnels are referred to as transition zones. Degradation rates at these transition zones are higher compared to the remaining railways. These high degradation rates result in high maintenance expenses. In order to come up with solutions that reduce this degradation and thus also the expenses it is needed to have an understanding of the underlying mechanisms in the railway tracks. This is done by formulating a mathematical model of the railway track which can then be analyzed. Researchers have been using different models for this purpose. <br/><br/>The choice is often made to model the railway track an elastically supported beam. This elastic foundation represents the supporting structure of the railway tracks and its stiffness is based on static load cases. This 1D model is often used due to its relative simplicity compared to other more complicated multidimensional models. This model has been thoroughly analyzed and it has turned out to have an important constraint which is its inability to result in a critical velocity that makes sense for railway tracks. The critical velocity of a railway track is that velocity at which waves travel near the surface of the subsoil of the supporting structure. A vehicle that moves with a velocity close to the critical velocity of the railway track causes a strong amplification of the response. Another important constraint of this model is the fact that there is no possibility to directly adjust the stiffness properties of the different components of which the railway track exists individually. <br/><br/>It is opted in this thesis to adjust the previously mentioned 1D model by the addition of a distributed mass and an extra elastic layer. The upper elastic layer represents the pads and the lower elastic layer represents the remaining of the supporting structure. The idea behind the addition of the distributed mass is to include the activated mass of the supporting structure by the moving load. This is done in order to take the dynamical behavior of the supporting structure into account and thus obtain realistic critical velocities. The idea behind the addition of an elastic layer is that it enables to adjust the stiffness of the pads individually. By using this model one can thus modify the stiffness of the pads at transition zones and study whether it is possible to decrease the degradation which is the initial goal of all studies on transition zones. <br/><br/>In this thesis the adjusted model is analyzed thoroughly for different physical phenomena. Such analyses cannot be found in the literature, to the best of the authors knowledge. The system response has been investigated for a uniformly moving load of a constant magnitude. This has been done for homogeneous properties of the elastic layers and for an abrupt jump in the stiffness of the lower layer. Attention has been given to both the displacement fields of the rails and energy propagation in the system. Also a numerical model has been formulated for other load cases and stiffness properties. In order to simulate infinite system behavior non-reflective boundary conditions have been derived and applied to the numerical model. It has been found that indeed a far more realistic critical velocity can be obtained by making use of the adjusted model. It has furthermore turned out that the system response at a transition zone are very similar for both models for the same ratio of load velocity to the critical velocity. The adjusted model has been investigated extensively in this thesis and it can thus be used as a reference work for future researchers that wish to apply the model. The research that should be performed next in the authors view is to investigate the possibility of reducing the degradation at transition zones by adjusting the stiffness of the pads.","Structural Dynamics; Railways; Transition Radiation; Winkler foundation; Critical Velocity; non-reflective boundary condition; infinite structures; One-dimensional","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) are able to support humans in dangerous operations, such as search and rescue operations at night on unknown terrain. These scenes require a great amount of autonomy from the MAV, as they are often radio and GPS-denied. As MAVs have limited computational resources and energy storage, onboard navigation tasks have to be performed efficient and fast. To address this challenge, this research proposes an approach to visual obstacle detection and avoidance onboard an MAV. The algorithmic approach is based on event-based optic flow, using a monocular event-based camera. This camera captures the apparent motion in the scene, has microsecond latency and very low power consumption, therefore a good fit for onboard navigation tasks. Firstly, a literature study is performed to provide theoretical concepts and foundation for the obstacle avoidance approach. A processing pipeline is designed, based on the use of event-based normal optic flow. This pipeline consists of three sections: course estimation, obstacle detection and obstacle avoidance. A novel course estimation method 'FAITH' is proposed which uses optic flow half-planes along with a fast RANSAC scheme. The object detection method is based on DBSCAN clustering of optic flow vectors, using the time-to-contact and vector location as clustering variables. The performance of these methods is experimentally demonstrated by three experiments: in a simulated environment, offline on real sensor data and online onboard an MAV. As currently no event-based obstacle avoidance datasets are publicly available, a dataset is recorded as supplement to this and future research. Approximately 1350 runs of event-based camera, RADAR, IMU and OptiTrack data are recorded, manually avoiding either a single or two poles using an MAV in the flying arena of the TU Delft. This dataset is used in this research to determine the performance of the course estimation method using real sensor data. The course estimation method is shown to have state-of-the-art accuracy and beyond state-of-the-art computation time on both simulated data and the recorded dataset. The final experiment shows the obstacle detection and avoidance approach integrated onboard an MAV in a real-time obstacle avoidance task. The approach is shown to have a success rate of 80% in a frontal obstacle avoidance task on a low-textured 50-cm wide pole. The contribution of this research is an obstacle detection and avoidance approach using a monocular event-based camera onboard an MAV, along with the novel course estimation algorithm 'FAITH'.","Obstacle detection; Obstacle Avoidance; micro air vehicles; Event-based vision; course estimation; optic flow; neuromorphic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","class=""MsoNormal"">Advancements in technology have made commercial unmanned aerial vehicles reliable and readily available, leading to an exponential rise in their market demand over the past few years. COVID-19 has further accelerated this growth through an increase in demand for contact-less delivery and crowd monitoring systems. However, despite these favorable conditions, their limited range, perceived threat, and concerns about noise pollution in urban environments have prevented them from being widely accepted by society. A recent study by NASA found that people perceive UAV noise to be more annoying than cars, and trucks at a similar sound pressure level, which highlights the need to understand the acoustic characteristic of these aircraft. These UAVs are generally powered by electric motors, making their propellers the most dominant source of noise. In the past, researchers have conducted several studies to understand and characterize the noise produced by aircraft propellers. However, these studies were limited to high Reynolds (&gt;1,000,000) and Mach number operations for large commercial aircraft, creating a significant gap in the understanding of the aerodynamic and acoustic characteristics of propellers operating at low Reynolds (&lt;200,000) and Mach number. This thesis aims to address the research gap by performing a high-fidelity computational simulation using Dassault Systèmes PowerFLOW®. The tool uses a lattice Boltzmann very large eddy simulation (LBM-VLES) based approach to compute the aerodynamic results and the Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings (FWH) aeroacoustic analogy to calculate far-field acoustic values. The main objective of the thesis is: “To characterize and quantify the effect of non-axisymmetric inflow conditions on the aerodynamic and acoustic properties of propellers operating at low Reynolds numbers.” To meet the objective, a computational setup consisting of a twin-bladed propeller with a radius of 15 cm is designed in PowerFLOW®. The propeller is analyzed at 0º and 15º AoA, operating at 6000 RPM with a free stream velocity of 12 m/sec and the results validated against experimental data. Aerodynamic measurements and flow analysis revealed that the change in angle of attack (AoA) resulted in a 3.87% increase in the net thrust, and 1.16% increase in the net torque value of the propeller. Operating at an AoA, the propeller blade experiences asymmetric loading around the propeller plane, the loads fluctuate by 35% between the points of maximum and minimum loading. Further analysis of the propeller flow field is carried out by averaging the velocity field and performing a phase-locked analysis to visualize the vortex field. The analysis helps in understanding the effect of AoA on propeller wake and quantifies its a symmetric nature. Far-field acoustic data is acquired by two circular microphone arrays, with a polar angle resolution of 10º. The arrays are placed around the propeller plane and along the axial axis of the propeller. The change in AoA results in a 3 dB higher noise at an azimuthal angle (Ψ) of 90º and reduces by an equal magnitude at Ψ = 270º. The shift is attributed to the change in propeller tip Mach number and local blade AoA as a function of its azimuthal location and propeller AoA. Further analysis of the sound power level (PWL) produced by the propeller is carried out, showing a 1.5 dB increase in the PWL produced by the propeller blade at 15º AoA than 0º.","Propeller noise; Low Reynolds number; UAV","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

As the world tries to minimize the effects of global warming, shipowners are forced to significantly reduce their $CO_2$ emissions. Because alternative fuels are expensive, the interest in wind energy, which has been the single energy source for centuries, is renewed. There is a desire for passive and inexpensive wind-assisted ship propulsion (WASP) systems. The two-element wingsail is a promising option. This combination of a wing with a slotted flap can generate more than one and a half times more lift compared to a one-element alternative. It is used in the aviation industry as a high-lift device and has been applied on board yachts in the America's Cup and other races. Used as WASP system places new requirements as limited deck space and the ability to tack. This report describes the effects of the geometry on the performance of the wingsail and advises an ideal configuration that maximizes the overall thrust contribution. Both fixed design parameters such as the profiles and chord lengths and adjustable settings as the angle of attack and flap angle are examined. This is achieved by doing systematical geometry variations at a Reynolds number of 1.86 $\cdot 10^6$ using 2D CFD simulations. The design goal was to maximize the lift coefficient. The variations show that the lift coefficient is very sensitive to the flap angle. Increasing this angle increases the lift, but requires a well-positioned slot to ensure attachment of the flow along the suction side of the flap. The influence of the profile thickness is small. However, a minimum flap thickness was required to avoid flow separation at low angles of attack. Stall was always observed around the leading edge of the flap. The maximum lift coefficient of 2.73 at an angle of attack of 10 degrees was found for a configuration with a NACA0024 wing and NACA0012 flap profile, equal chord lengths, and a flap angle of 25 degrees. The corresponding slot had an offset of 0.5 and a side placement of 2.5 percent of the total chord length. Using the same method, the effects of adding a steering flap downstream of the wingsail were investigated. This third flap should keep the wingsail stable at a specific angle of attack. This ability is interesting for WASP purposes because it eliminates the need for fast-responding software-based control systems. The simulations show that the steering flap, which had a fixed chord length of 30 percent of the wingsail, can stabilize the system. Compared to the standard configuration the decrease of the lift was approximately 10 percent. The steering flap operates in the wake of the wingsail, which causes a decrease of drag of approximately 5 percent. This is an interesting feature because it reduces the negative effects of the steering flap. Depending on their positions, the interaction between all three elements can further enhance the performance of the whole system.","wind-assisted ship propulsion; WASP; WAP; two-element wingsail; steering flap; stabilizer; CFD","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2026-04-09","","","","Marine Technology","",""

In this thesis a Python-based framework has been developed that can screen flood adaptation measures as an alternative to the existing analytical method of Royal HaskoningDHV. The framework is limited to the costs and effects on the economic flood risk (the benefits) of eleven different measures such as levees, landfills, and flood proofing. First, the existing methods for screening measures were investigated. The resulting strong and missing elements were combined to form the functional requirements of the framework. The underlying script for the framework was elaborated with these requirements. Subsequently, the framework was applied to two case locations, namely Phu Loc (Vietnam) and Waal Eemhaven (Rotterdam, The Netherlands). Because these locations had already been developed by Royal HaskoningDHV, the results could be compared. The existing methods showed that clear results and the possibility for the user to select the measures and location are the main strengths. In addition, an uncertainty analysis and well-organized input table were found to be useful for the framework. The results of the simulations at the case locations were comparable to the results of the existing method of Royal HaskoningDHV for the measures considered. The framework is faster than the existing method and determines the optimal measure(s) and protection level. Therefore, it is a good alternative for screening the eleven considered measures. The framework can be supported with a hydraulic model to include more measures, for example river widening. It is recommended to add an extensive cost database to the framework, so that cost calculations and uncertainty analysis can be performed more easily in future applications.","flood risk; economic optimization; flood measures; cost-benefit analysis; python","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

In the province Zuid-Holland, one of the fastest growing urban areas within the Netherlands, there is a missing link between circular initiatives, knowledge and data. The question that comes up is; how can a symbiosis of stakeholders and resources contribute to a circular construction sector? An analysis of the current situation of stakeholders and flows of resources has been made and potential spatial conflicts were understood. Whereafter the analysis of trends and requirements to transition into a circular construction sector has been made. This results in a new understanding of the spatial structure of the province, focussing on the use of waterways as a backbone to support the transition. This will lead to circular neighbourhoods connected by the water. With Flux we try to reform the current construction sector into a circular one by the year of 2050, while taking into account social and spatial justice. The shift to this new structure, supported by the waterways, can facilitate a change to a circular construction sector. Besides this it will also give the Province a new identity and structural element for future improvements toward a circular economy, lifting the idea of circularity to a territorial level.","construction sector; bio-based materials; Circular Neighbourhood; waterscape; maker industries; Zuid-Holland","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","AR2U086 R&D Studio – Spatial Strategies for the Global Metropolis",""

(mentor); Calderon Gonzalez, A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In the last decades, more and more complex societal and environmental challenges are rising. Social Innovation is an emerging and promising framework to tackle complex global challenges at the local level of urban contexts. These projects are socially, culturally and contextually embedded and highly dependent on the local ecosystem of resources. Due to their reduced size and non-profit driven structure, social innovations lack financial resources and the needed capacity, hindering them from scaling and achieving a larger impact. Hence why these small-scale and hyper-localized projects often struggle to take root in new contexts. Design capabilities are exponentially considered a fundamental enabler of innovation processes (Scott, 2018), and recently the awareness toward design tools in supporting bottom-up, local innovations increased. Initiatives such as the Designscapes project are examples of a design-capability building program aiming to foster innovation through design by helping these small-scale urban initiatives to scale and achieve impact goals. Although design has great potential to enable innovation, the design process stops at the implementation stage, failing to provide innovators with the needed tools to achieve large-size impact. Therefore, the current project explores how design could support social innovations to scale and achieve impact by unfolding the scaling journeys of Designscapes initiatives. In addition to the research goal, understanding the scaling process of social innovations through design, the project aims to develop a framework/tool-kit enabling small-scale urban initiatives to overcome challenges and develop strategies to scale from one context to another. Several design elements have been used to carry research throughout an iterative double-diamond design process to respond to the project goals. Theoretical knowledge has been applied and used as an exploration mean to conduct empirical research within the practice of Designscapes initiatives. The research findings led to the development of the 'Scaling Framework,' which presents the crucial steps and criteria to scale social innovations. Even though scaling is a complex matter and one single solution to scale does not exist, network formation resulted, from research, being an effective strategy to scale. It allows social innovators to mobilize the resources necessary, align demand and supply, to have a desirable and viable solution implemented in the new context. However, to form networks and replicate the project from one context to another, these small-scale social initiatives have to overcome two main challenges, identified as the cognitive and context gap. Therefore, to overcome those challenges, Social Innovators will capture what to scale by acknowledging differences and similarities between the local context conditions, re-framing their value proposition to match the local resources and people's needs, and defining how to scale by articulating impact-driven strategies. The research outcomes have been turned into a 'Scaling Tool-Box' to make the scaling framework and process actionable and operational, hence useful for its intended users (social innovators). The final result of the project, 'a design tool-box to support Social Urban Innovators scaling from one context to another, facilitates small-scale social initiatives bridge the gaps and develop strategies to form local networks. In conclusion, scaling is like a learning process where social innovators have to learn What and How to adapt to the local context conditions. Because of the value of design in building capacity and functioning as a framework guiding a particular thinking process, independently from the domain or stage of application, design demonstrates being a relevant tool enabling innovation to scale. Furthermore, the final result still has opportunities for improvement, and future research is seen as necessary to expand the tools and outcomes beyond the initial steps of scaling. Indeed, the tools focus only on one part of the scaling process identified and defined through the (theoretical) framework. Moreover, because of the small-scale study conducted in this project, further exploration to validate the tool beyond its context scope (Designscapes initiatives) could help open up and generalise the results to a broader audience.","Participatory City Making; Delft Design Labs; Designscapes; Participatory Design; Design Enabled Innovation; Scaling Social Innovations; Scaling Framework; Scaling Toolkit; Design tools; Network Formation; Replication; Empowering Urban Innovators; Social Impact","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

By minimizing this free energy, living systems keep an accurate representation of the world in their internal model (learning), are provided with an optimal way of acting on the world (action selection), and can predict incoming sensory data (perception). Considering the fact that these properties are sought after in artificial intelligence systems as well, active inference has also become an interesting topic from an engineering point of view. The application of active inference can be done with both a continuous and a discrete state-space framework. However, research on discrete state-space active inference has neglected the extension of its applicability to nonstationary environments. This work aims to fill that gap. More specifically, the goal of this research is to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art discrete state-space active inference agents in nonstationary environments, and assess whether forgetting part of the agent's previous experiences can increase its performance. The type of nonstationarity that is used in this work is cyclostationarity, and this nonstationarity will only be manifested in the transition process of the active inference task. Moreover, the specific type of task solved is one of planning and navigation in a gridworld. Since the agent has to deal with a planning and navigation task, performance is quantified by the number of steps the agent needs to take in order to reach its goal. Three methods of forgetting are implemented and compared, inspired by techniques from reinforcement learning, deep learning and time series analysis respectively. These are: (1) the use of a constant forget rate, (2) the use of the updating mechanism of a long short-term memory (LSTM) cell applied to the updating of the generative model in active inference, and (3) the use of a memory window that stores experience only from a certain trial onwards and forgets experience from before this trial by utilizing a rolling summation of the concentration parameters. The results show that forgetting with the use of a memory window can significantly improve performance, provided that the agent can reach the goal state from the initial state in one trial. When this is not the case, the use of a memory window does not (positively or negatively) influence performance. Both the implementation of forgetting based on the updating of an LSTM cell and the use of a constant forget rate have unanimously shown to decrease performance, and thus should not be implemented in active inference.","Active inference; Discrete state-space; Free energy; Generative model; Nonstationarity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

The task was split into three main problems: detection, tracking and error detection. The detection was solved with basic image processing. The first step was background removal, using median filtering. Later, blob detection after some processing was done. Detections were differentiated into cases where mice are together in contact events and where they are alone. Bounding boxes were generated for the contours of lone mice, while the distance transform was employed to detect the joint ones. To track the moving targets, Kalman filtering was used on the bounding boxes of the detector. This approach was based on the Simple Online Realtime Tracking framework, adapting it to the particularities of mice. Other approaches were tried, but SORT was the chosen one. The infrared subcutaneous implants of FlashTrack allow for identity verification through code detections. To process the codes of each track, a Gaussian Mixture Model is trained to be the classifier of the detections. A track handling module was built to monitor the estimated tracks and code detections, and verify correct assignments. Detected erroneous tracks were discarded. Synthetic data was used to evaluate the tool. Artificial datasets were developed in Blender. Common metrics for evaluation of multiple object trackers were gathered and discussed, as well as a comparison with one of the state of the art animal trackers.","Tracking; Neuroscience; Rodent; Kalman; Error Detection; Multiple Object Tracking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-04-15","","","","Computer Science | Software Technology","",""

(mentor); Mazza, F. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","In this M.Sc. thesis project a model is developed and validated that simulates the coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) signal of CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> in the spectral region between 1250cm<sup>-1</sup> and 1680cm<sup>-1</sup>. The aim is to perform temperature and concentration measurements in a typical hydrocarbon-air combustion flame. The project makes use of a two-beam time resolved CARS setup, with ultraboadband generated light from the pump/Stokes beam to excite the Raman transitions in this spectral window. In the 1250-1680cm<sup>-1</sup> region, CARS signatures of both CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> are visible making it possible to perform thermometry on both molecular species, while also offering the option of evaluating relative CO<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub>-CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. The appearance of the oxygen ro-vibrational (O-, S- and Q-branch) spectrum at low temperatures, along with a strong manifestation of the CO<sub>2</sub> Fermi influenced Q-branch (with red-shifted peaks below 1300cm<sup>-1</sup> and blue shifted peaks above 1350cm<sup>-1</sup>) at higher temperatures, makes it possible to perform thermometry in low and high temperature combustion environments on both the reactant and product side. A total of 256 vibrational levels for CO<sub>2</sub> are taken into account for the model to simulate the CO<sub>2</sub> Fermi polyad. From these 256 vibrational levels, 181 Raman transitions are possible that fulfill the criteria of Δv<sub>1</sub>=1, Δv<sub>2</sub>=0, Δv<sub>3</sub>=0, Δl=0 and ΔJ=0 . Three different experiments are performed including an M-flame, a V-flame and two experiments conducted in air for model validation. The temperature analysis using CO<sub>2</sub> provided satisfactory results regarding temperature assessments. Depending on the experiment, standard deviations below 2.3% and mean temperatures to within 1% of the temperatures corresponding to the expected values. The O<sub>2</sub> analysis showed a good correspondence to the CO<sub>2</sub> temperature values, differing by 43-76K. The O<sub>2</sub> analysis showed low standard deviations for the air temperature assessment (3.27%) and reliably predicted the ambient temperature with a difference lower than 2K. The M-flame experiments showed the least correspondence to actual values. These unsatisfactory results can for one part be attributed to the high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and for one part due to the flickering of the flame. In terms of concentration assessment the model closely evaluates O<sub>2</sub>-CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the ambient air and from an exhaled human breath, while the flame assessments had a mediocre correspondence to the predicted ones from \textit{chem1d}. All in all the project shows that CO<sub>2</sub> temperature and concentration measurements in this CARS spectral region is feasible. It offers promise from a combustion perspective due to the possibility of performing simultaneous (O<sub>2</sub>) rotational and (CO<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub>) vibrational thermometry, which makes it possible to perform measurements on both the product and reactant side of the flame front, while including spectral signatures of possibly three major molecular combustion species: CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>. Further improvements to the model and the application of the technique, make more complex combustion studies possible and help achieve the goal to develop a ultrafast, multiplex, state-of-the-art laser diagnostic tool for gas phase combustion measurements.","Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS); Combustion diagnostics; Thermometry; Carbon dioxide; oxygen","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

With eye-tracking, it is possible to infer where developers are putting their attention to that can be utilized to improve the IDE user experience and productivity. Therefore, we present EyeIDEA, an experimental plugin for Intellij IDEA that integrates eye-tracking to provide source code navigation, debugging interactions, and fine-grained information about user habits based on eye-tracking. A user study was conducted with TU Delft students to investigate the perceived usefulness of our eye-tracking IDE.

Moreover, there is a strong preference for eye-tracking interactions that only require a single code element or button as input. Additionally, users perceived that an eye-tracking IDE could substitute a<br/>mouse, especially when suffering from health-related issues or when performing light programming work. However, eye-tracking also brings new challenges, including integrating eye-tracking with keyboard/mouse input and accounting for accuracy and precision issues that influence the overall usability.

The preference list mostly focuses on minimizing noise and it provides a more manageable flow for ATC. However, it does not consider the fuel burn or current demand of flights. This study presents a MILP scheduling model which optimizes for fuel burn and noise disturbance. This is done by a flexible allocation of flights to runways, therefore removing the use of a runway preference list. Furthermore, a separation method is developed to capture the dependencies within a complex runway system such that the model can be easily applied to every airport. The model is tested at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol and it is concluded that flexible scheduling has a positive impact on both objectives, resulting in more efficient airport operations and the possibility to expand operations within the current regulations.","Runway Capacity; MILP; Aircraft Noise; Aircraft Fuel; Schiphol","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The typical approaches for dynamic system identification include fuzzy models, non-linear auto regressive models, state-space models, subspace identification models and many others. In this thesis, artificial neural networks are evaluated, among these, as black-box methods known to be capable of universal approximation. With no essential prior information, the identification problem exhibits more difficult challenges.

The increase in efficiency which still can be made by improving this design, is limited. More researchers have started to investigate new design options that represent a departure from established concepts. The main drivers behind these endeavors are the tightening regulations on emissions and noise as well as the expected profitability for the customer. With the use of scale models for flight testing, it is possible to validate novel aircraft concepts while minimizing investments in terms of costs and time. Novel aircraft often have unproved handling characteristics which is why a quick method to verify these new models would be beneficial. The objective of this research is to investigate the longitudinal handling characteristics of the Skysurfer X8 by assessing whether the criteria for the short period damping, phugoid damping, bandwidth and Control Anticipation Parameter are in accordance with the military standards. Mathematical models for the aircraft's behavior are extracted from the aircraft by performing system identification in the frequency domain. This is done by measuring the aircraft's input and output signals while performing frequency sweeps on one of the control inputs during a flight test. These measurements are used to derive the input-output system. This procedure is followed for every longitudinal control variable of the aircraft. The models derived from the flight test are validated by comparing the handling characteristics (short period damping, phugoid damping and Control Anticipation) to a simulation performed in XFLR5. The frequency identification method described there is validated with frequency sweep data generated from an aircraft’s known state space system and the flight tests are performed with a modified Skysurfer X8 which is equipped with two wing mounted engines. Based on the validation the method proves to be reliable. The experiment shows that the handling characteristics of the Skysurfer X8 are at least at level 2 of the military standards. This level is satisfactory, given the small size of the test aircraft. The method is capable of capturing a model of the pitch angle and pitch speed response relative to elevator deflection, which is used to estimate all handling characteristics. Improvements can be made in the frequency sweep maneuvers for the throttle and the measurement error and resolution should be further investigated.","flight testing; Flight characteristics; Handling Qualities; UAV; Drone; Flight Data Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

They provide silicon surface passivation as well as high carrier selectivity. In this thesis, the bifacial interdigitate back contacted cell concept (bifacial IBC) is combined with the interdigitated back-contacted (IBC) structure with the bifacial concept for the purpose of further improve the solar cell output. It is enabled by poly-SiOX as CSPCs. The main aim of this thesis project is the preparation of proof of concept bifacial IBC cells. In this work, two process flowcharts for bifacial IBC solar cell fabrication are presented: (1) poly-SiOX fingers patterned by ion-implantation through photoresist masking layer, (2) wet chemical patterning of in-situ doped poly-SiOX. In the first process, the optimization of poly-SiOx passivating contact was performed by varying the intrinsic a-SiOx:H layer thickness. The best passivation results obtained from this approach was 646 mV, and 623 mV for the n+ and p+ layer, respectively. In the second process, the thickness of doped p+ and n+ poly-SiOx layers was also optimized for the symmetrical test samples based on the requirement of bifacial IBC solar cell flowchart. As a consequence, a 25 nm thick p+ poly-SiOx layer and a 40 nm thick n+ poly-SiOx layer recorded highest iVOC performance. Next, the hydrogenation treatment is applied to further optimize the samples passivation quality. This results in an overall passivation of 714 and 730 mV for p+ and n+ poly-SiOX symmetrical samples, owed to the fact that the high hydrogen content in SiNX layer boosting the passivation properties of the poly-SiOX passivating contacts.These findings of the optimized poly-SiOX passivation contacts are used to fabricate the bifacial-IBC solar cell. As a result, using the wet-etching patterning of in-situ poly-SiOX CSPC flow chart, a demonstration proof of this cell principle is obtained with VOC of 649 mV, FF of 44,3 %, JSC of 40,7 mA/cm2, and efficiency of 12% for the best solar cell. The losses analysis of such cell performance was also conducted.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Innovation is not the process of finding that one great idea anymore. It is a complex and company-wide endeavor that requires structured, organized, and encouraging processes. Portfolio management aligns the product development activities with the organization's strategy. The literature review in chapter 2 aims to gain a better understanding of the context and the portfolio management process. The three goals of the strategic portfolio management process were defined. First, achieving the right balance, the portfolio can be balanced on several parameters, among others are the lead time, risk, the number of products, and the spread across the funnel. Second, align with strategy, by creating an overview portfolio management allows aligning the research activities with the strategy set by the executive board. And third maximize the value, realize the most value out of the limited available resources. This thesis explores the practice of portfolio management within TNO, an independent research organization in the Netherlands. The focus lies on the usage and transfer of data needed in the portfolio management process, in this case, the strategic meetings and Flightmap, the digital tool used to manage the portfolio data. In chapter 3 a systematic analysis is presented of the implementation and use of portfolio management within TNO, including the reason for implementation, the position of portfolio management in the organization, the governance, and the process activities. To increase the efficiency of data presentation for the decision-making process the field of information transfer is explored in chapter 4. The interactions around and in strategic meetings as well as Flightmap are analyzed. Three problem clusters are identified: the lack of data tracking, the lack of a clear meeting focus, and the poor Flightmap user experience. To explore the solution space a diversity of design generative tools is used. After an ideation phase, a concept was created and improved through three iterative cycles including ideating, prototyping, and testing. Eventually, an integrated solution with three deliverables is presented in the form of a meeting format, an annual plan, and a Flightmap redesign. The solution contributes to four aspects: creating an overview on all levels of TNO’s portfolio management, creating strategic structure and awareness, providing an integrated solution to manage the portfolio on each level and enabling to make informed decisions on the balance, the status, and the impact. Since this solution represents a future vision, an implementation plan is presented to outline the steps towards the realization. The final design is validated through three activities. The solution was discussed in a team of directors meeting where the decision was made to use the status board, the portfolio review meeting, and the meeting format in the coming strategic meetings. Next to this, the Flightmap redesign was validated in two sessions with business developers. The concept was received extremely well. The final design was discussed in two sessions with experts from the strategy department. In the next Flightmap update a first version of the dashboards introduced in this thesis will be implemented.","Portfolio Management; Decision making; User experience; Interface design; Strategic design; Innovation management; Supportive tools; Digital tool","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

This incorrect input has been shown to be caused by a misinterpretation of the horizon symbol on such an attitude indicator. The figure-ground relation of the aircraft symbol and horizon symbol on the attitude indicator has been cited as being a contributing factor to this misinterpretation. A Multi-Layer Display (MLD) is tested as a possible intervention tool for these interpretation errors. With this display type, the horizon symbol is presented on a physically deeper layer, making it possibly more easily interpreted as being in the background, and the aircraft symbol is presented on a second layer on the foreground. A group of 23 non-pilots and 18 pilots were tasked to perform a recovery task on a desktop-based simulator without outside visuals and only an Attitude indicator on both a MLD as well as a conventional Single Layer Display for repeated-measures. Although roll reversal errors were observed at a comparable level to previous research, no significant difference were observed on the error rate between the two display types. A possible explanation is that the stereoscopic depth of the MLD dissipates when the subject sits still and remains exactly in front of the display. This leaves open the possibility that other types of depth cues, such as monocular cues, can be added and used to enhance the figure-ground relation in displays.","Multi-Layer Display; RRE; Roll Reversal Error; Display Layering; Depth Perception","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-04-30","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Lindemann, Felix (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2021","Dawn Aerospace is developing a small launch vehicle in the form of a spaceplane, which is powered by a turbopump driven rocket. To reach higher engine efficiency and save weight, there is a need for a small highly-power dense turbine. The efficiency of small turbines strongly depends on the tip gap sizes compared to the blade height. Existing turbine loss models predict large efficiency penalties due to excessive clearance losses, caused by the relatively large tip gap over blade height ratio. To build a competitive small launch vehicle, it is necessary to develop a highly efficient turbine.The objective of the work presented here is to first analyse and then minimize the clearance losses occurring in a representative small turbine for the spaceplane by applying seals on top of the shroud. Turbine loss models presented in the literature are limited to predicting losses for labyrinth seals only. As more advanced seals, like the brush seal, are being used more regularly there is a need for more accurate modelling of clearance losses in shrouded rotors.In order to calculate the leakage through seals, first bulk flow models (BFM) were developed for the labyrinth, annular and brush seal. BFMs use the zeroth-order of a perturbation equation to calculate leakage. Two- and three-dimensional numerical models were developed to simulate the mass flow rate through the seals with the help of commercially available software. Next, the BFMs and numerical models were validated against experimental data obtained from literature. BFMs could predict leakage rates through seals with an accuracy up to 15\%, when suitable empirically determined constants/equations were used. The numerical models performed slightly worse for the annular seals with a minimum accuracy of 25\%, while good predictions were obtained for labyrinth seals and brush seals. Little difference could be seen between 2D and 3D CFD when assessing leakage through shaft seals.The turbine design of Dawn Aerospace was evaluated in CFD and compared to the loss model of Dunham\&amp;Came. First, an unshrouded case was designed to assess the profile and secondary losses arising in the turbine. In the unshrouded case the loss model agreed with CFD. In the case of the shrouded turbine a large discrepancy existed between CFD and the loss model. The difference in loss was attributed to the fact that the loss model massively over predicted the clearance loss of the turbine, by over predicting the leakage over the shroud. A new loss model has been developed which can be used to more accurately predict the clearance loss of a turbine. This improvement is achieved by using Denton's equation for clearance loss and Dunham\&amp;Came's equations for profile and secondary loss. Denton requires the determination of the leakage mass flow rate through the shroud. The leakage mass flow rate is dependent on the inlet, the seal and the outlet. The leakage through the shroud can be calculated with the usage of BFMs. The inlet and outlets of the shrouds are modelled as labyrinth seals while placing the actual sealing system in between. This means that now not only simple labyrinth seals can be predicted, but brush seals as well and possible other seals for which leakage equations are available. It has been shown that the model can accurately predict losses for a range of turbines. The efficiency predictions of the loss model for a range of designed turbines were within 5.6\% when compared to CFD.During the sensitivity analysis on the model it was found that the influence of the inlet and outlet cavity width on the mass flow rate is significant in small turbines. Especially if the sealing mechanism on top of the shroud is simple, which is the case for an annular seal or a single finned labyrinth seal. Whenever multiple fins were adopted or the brush seal is used the inlet and outlet width become less important in the sealing system for reducing leakage rate over shrouds in small axial turbines.","turbine design methodology; Shroud Leakage; Small Turbine; Numerical Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-04-01","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""
