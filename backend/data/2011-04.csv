(mentor)","2011","The integration of forecasting and decision-making in real-time Decision-Support Systems (DSS) provides a powerful tool to operators of water resources systems for evaluating the future control of hydraulic structures. Decisions may be supported by presenting information about predicted disturbances, e.g. inflows into the water system, enabling the operator to try out future trajectories of structure control, or suggesting an optimum control based on predictive controllers. Ongoing work is undertaken under the programme Flood Control 2015 (FC2015) with respect to the management of flood events. This MSc thesis research was supervised jointly by the Operational Water Management research group of Delft University of Technology and the research institute Deltares. The aim of the MSc project is the transfer and extension of real-time DSS knowledge and techniques to a typical Dutch canal system such as Twentekanalen using simulation tools in development at Deltares. The main research objective is to assess the potential of DSS in this context and to investigate and verify a robust concept for applying Model Predictive Control on canal systems, taking into account missing or wrong data by applying Data Assimilation techniques. The main system characteristics and relevant processes of the Twentekanalen system are the following:  3 Canals connected by locks in which the water level needs to be controlled.  The water level is chiefly governed by the operation of locks, which need to turn in order for ships to pass, discharging a large quantity of water each time in comparison to other water flows in the system. Measurements of water level and flows at the locks are relatively complete.  The water level is regulated by pumps and discharge structures at the locks  Other water flows that occur in the system are lateral inflow and outflow. The measurements of these flows are relatively incomplete. At the start of the research a set of tools was available at Deltares. FEWS, a data management system, and RTC Tools, a reservoir routing model in development which was later extended with Data Assimilation capabilities. Near the end of the research a detailed model of the system in Sobek, a 1D and 2D water flow model, became available. A model framework has been designed to assess the potential of applying MPC and DA in a DSS for such a system. The incremental design and verification of this model framework has been the core of this research. The novel research is the addition of Data Assimilation techniques to Model Predictive Control. In order to show the added value of DA and verify its implementation a verification approach is needed to address the other components in the framework as well. The first method taken to achieve this was to set-up the MPC for Twentekanalen and integrate it into Delft-FEWS in hindcast mode assuming a perfect forecast. When the data set was made available it became clear that it contained large water balance errors. Adding DA showed improvements in the forecast, but while using realistic values for the DA, the forecasts were still far from accurate. By creating a workaround in the DA module it was shown that especially the Eefde-Delden reach had a large balance error that did not have a high correlation with the known lateral flows. Considering the low quality of the data set it was decided to expand the scope of the research and replace the data set by an accurate hydraulic model that became available near the end of this research. This model still uses measurements from the Twentekanalen system as input, but with internal controllers to regulate the pump and spill structures the water balance is maintained. With an extra expansion to inject known errors in the system, a thorough investigation of the effects of Data Assimilation and Model Predictive Control can be executed. First results from this expanded approach show promising results, but because of practical implementation issues of conflicting software modules, the full results will not be available within this research. Conclusions: From a theoretical point of view DA has a lot of potential. State updating solves an important issue of real time control; keeping the model state as close as possible to the real system state. Model training by parameter updating can be a good way to increase model forecasting performance. Online Parameter Updating can be very effective in systems were a high correlation occurs between measurements and unmeasured processes. These elements will make the model more robust, it can adapt to changing conditions. This also provides the model developer with interesting feedback on the workings of the modeled water system. From a practical point of view DA has shown improvements in the performance of the DSS as designed within this thesis project. But because of the large errors in the measurements it is difficult to translate these improvements to the effects in other systems. Implementation of the designed model framework gives a more satisfactory answer to that question. Recommendations have been made for improvements of the RTC Tools module, the development of prediction modules for the Twentekanalen system and further research using the developed framework with the models, scripts and programs written for this research. Most importantly getting predictions and real-time measurements on lock turning in the Twentekanalen system, and increasing the flexibility of model design in RTC Tools.","Decision-Support System; Real Time Control; Data Assimilation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-05-04","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Watermanagement","","Water Resources","",""

(mentor); Jellema, A.H. (mentor)","2011","This final graduation project is done at Handicare Bathroom Safety BV at Pijnacker. Like their name says, they are a manufacturer of safety products in and around the toilet-, shower- and bath environment. These products have a good balance between comfort, safety and design. With 70 years of experience, they are considered specialists in this field all over the world. For this project the main aim is to design a next generation shower seat for the product portfolio of Handicare; LinidoSolutions. The shower seat must be applicable all over the world, therefore apart from the Dutch market, the United Kingdom and Southern Europe (Spain) is taken into account. The “old” shower seat as it is now provides support in a seated posture while showering. Based on the needs of the user, this seat is also foldable and available with/or without backrest and armrests. This seat was introduced in 2003 and was one of the first shower seats produced entirely out of plastic. This has great benefits for the design, ergonomics, costs and production. Nevertheless, feedback has shown frequently arising problems in production methods and procedures. One of the main concerns of this seat is premature tumbling of the seat surface and fractures near the mount and its connections. The folding mechanism is unreliable and the connection is not solid and strong enough for all situations e.g. a transfer from wheelchair is very critical. This results in a large amount of complaints. With the next generation shower seat these problems have to be resolved. Further research shows that users have specific needs and requirements while showering on a shower seat. This has resulted in several project directions whereof the most promising direction is chosen. From the user research it shows that standing up, cleaning of the buttocks area, cleaning of the lower legs/feet and a transfer from wheelchair to seat is very hard to accomplish. This has to do with the disabilities of these users. Based on the chosen target group, the project direction “improvement of the buttocks area” is chosen. Research shows that cleaning of the buttocks area is not possible and very hard in a seated posture. Users have to stand up to properly clean this area. However standing up is an intensive activity for these people. Current products provide hygiene openings, but are still not optimal and very uncomfortable to sit on. From this perspective the main target group is chosen, which is based on the mobility classification of the user. The user can be divided into five categories; scaled from group A with the most mobile people to group E with the lowest degree of mobility. Target group B is chosen as the main target group for the shower seat. This group can be characterized on performing their daily activities in combination with a little help. This help can be provided by a walking aid and/or home care. This group often uses a shower seat, because they are not able to stand for longer periods of time or have an unstable posture. From this perspective the hypothesis of the final researches is defined: the smaller the seat surface, the larger the accessibility will be”. This means that a user can get enough support by providing a seat surface around the sit bones. Because of this principle an opening is made in the back and front. By supporting the sit bones a better and stable posture is provided, which can increases the comfort and based on this hypothesis two researches are accomplished. First the minimum seat surface is determined and these dimensions are evaluated according to access around the buttocks. Based on the hypothesis three dimensions can be determined: the opening between the sit bones, the length around the sit bones and the width of the seat. The first research elaborates on the minimum dimensions that are necessary to provide a stable and safe posture. 24 Participants evaluate different models and eventually the minimum dimensions are defined. During this research differences between gender and active and passive postures are noticed. Some of these aspects are of great influence to the final dimensions. The passive posture is defining for the length around the sit bones and the active posture in combination with male participants for defining the maximum opening. With the results of the first researches, ideas and sub-solutions are generated to improve the accessibility around the buttocks. On top of this, product improvement is considered. Five focus points are taken into account: the seat surface (improvement of accessibility), the folding construction, height adjustment, forces on the wall and the mounting construction. Eventually this leads to three concept proposals. In cooperation with Handicare the most promising concept is chosen. The final research elaborates on the accessibility of the chosen concept and the defined minimum dimensions. In this research the accessibility around the buttocks, private parts and legs is evaluated. This research shows a significant improvement of accessibility. Most improved is the access of the private parts, participant are very enthusiastic about the hygiene opening in the front. Furthermore, the accessibility of the buttocks area has been improved as well. Although, further research must prove that the opening in the back significantly improves the access of the buttocks for actual end-users as well. Nevertheless, this first research shows potential for implementation in the final design and has great potential in comparison with competitive products. Based on the last research, BILLY is developed and is now the next generation shower seat of Handicare. BILLY is a combination of a regular seat combined with the ease of a hygiene opening. Because the user is now supported on the sit bones, he no longer experiences the hygiene opening as uncomfortable, but enjoys the full range of its conveniences. Furthermore, an extra hygiene opening for private parts is included, which increases the accessibility even more. From this final design a prototype is made to eventually evaluate the product in an actual user context.","shower seat; sit bones; elderly; hygiene opening; disabled","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-04-29","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design (Medisign)","",""

(mentor); Minnoye, S. (mentor); Rutgrink, R. (mentor)","2011","Riding a bicycle is common for many people. Bicycle ergonomics on the other hand are less common for most of use, while it is very important for the overall experience of the bicycle. The knowledge of these ergonomics ends with frame size and saddle height. Santos, a Dutch bicycle manufacturer, strives for high quality bicycles and therefore acknowledges the importance of bicycle ergonomics. They pointed out the opportunities within the field of the bicycle handlebars to support ergonomics and differentiate from competitors. Goals of the graduation project is to come up with an ergonomics set of handlebars that match the different bicycles sold by Santos and fits the ‘custom build’ philosophy at the same time. Bicycle ergonomics In the literature bicycle ergonomics are categorized in two main groups; posture height and posture length. The first, poster height, describe the bicycle variables that are related to the lower extremities and lower back. Most important variable within the posture height is the position of the saddle. The posture length describes the variables related to the back, neck and upper extremities, with the position of the handlebar as most important variable. In this theory ‘position of the handlebar’ actual means the position of the grips, since these determine the position of the hands and thereby the position of the arms and the upper body. Handlebar ergonomics Handlebars are minimized elements of the bicycle that serve maximal purpose. Of course they are used for steering the bicycle, but at the same time the handlebar houses many other elements like break handles and shifters. Most important is that they determine the position of the grips. This aspect determines the overall shape of the product, but how is this position determined. Essential is that the suite the so called neutral position on the arm and wrist. The two most common non-traumatic overuse injuries in cycling are Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) and Ulnar Nerve Syndrome (UCT), both are the result of nerve compression in the hands, wrist or forearm. These injuries come from repetitive movements, vibrations, extreme hand positions or direct pressure to the carpal or ulnar nerves. The risk to these overuse injuries can be minimized by the neutral wrist position (7°-9° extension, 5°-7° ulnar deviation and 30° pronation from the thumb up position). Knowing the neutral positions does not automatically lead to just one handlebar that is the ergonomic solution, because the cycling posture depends from the purpose of cycling. An MTB asks for a different posture than a city bicycle. All information is concluded in a graph that shows grip positions for different purposes of cycling. The gathered insights in ergonomics are translated to four handlebars that fit the Santos portfolio. The S-6, T-18 and T-38 fulfill the theory of ergonomics, where the M-10 is a variation to the S-6 that increases the grip angle without changing the overall cycling posture. Adjustable bar-ends The literature points out that, in endurance cycling, it is important to change hand positions to bring back static pressure and to minimize the risk on CTS and UCT. Bar-ends are a useful addition to normal handlebars for a second or even third hand position. However, normal bar-ends form a set angle with the handlebars. As an extension of the ergonomic handlebars, a set of adjustable bar-ends are developed to create an optimal second hand position for each individual.","bicycle ergonomics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","IDE","","","",""

(mentor); Wiggenraad, P.B.L. (mentor); Baggen, J.H. (mentor); Verweijen, C.C.M. (mentor)","2011","Het aandeel van openbaar vervoer in het totaal aantal verplaatsingen in de Randstad is relatief laag, doordat de kwaliteit niet voldoende hoogwaardig is en niet gelijkwaardig is tussen regio’s. In dit rapport zijn twee behoeftes van het Randstedelijk openbaar vervoer onderzocht: het opwaarderen van regionale openbaarvervoerverbindingen en het reorganiseren van het beheer van het Randstedelijk OV. Deze hebben geresulteerd in resp. een verkeerskundig en een institutioneel ontwerp. Ten eerste bestaat er behoefte aan een hoogwaardig openbaarvervoersysteem voor regionale relaties. Een vergelijking van vigerende beleidsvisies van de Randstedelijke overheden en vergelijkbare regio’s in het buitenland heeft een set kenmerken opgeleverd, waaraan hoogwaardige verbindingen in vervoerkundige termen tenminste moeten voldoen. De belangrijkste zijn een frequentie van 6 ritten per uur per richting en een trajectsnelheid van minimaal 25 km/u in de bebouwde kom. De vigerende visies op personenvervoer zijn veelal gericht op unimodale reizen: of met eigen vervoer of met openbaar vervoer. Er ontstaan vele initiatieven om beide stromen te integreren, welke in dit rapport gevat zijn in de term “intermobiliteit”. Hierbij wordt elke vorm van vervoer toegepast op het ruimtelijk niveau en voor het aantal reizigers per relatie, waar deze het best bij past, om te komen tot een intermodale netwerkvisie voor het personenvervoer. Beide bovenstaande onderdelen van een hoogwaardig OV-systeem zijn toegepast in een vervoerkundig ontwerp voor vier regionale relaties binnen Stadsgewest Haaglanden en de regio Leiden. Gezien de huidige vervoerstromen per OV kan de dienstverlening op deze verbindingen niet ongezien opgewaardeerd worden. Met LiRa-2, een simulatieprogramma voor openbaarvervoergebruik, zijn voorspellingen gemaakt voor de jaren 2020 en 2030. De uitkomst is dat relaties tussen middelgrote steden, zoals Delft – Zoetermeer en Den Haag – Leiden toch kunnen profiteren van opwaardering van een reguliere buslijn tot een hoogwaardige buslijn. Het aantal instappers stijgt met meer dan een derde door de betere bediening en het bieden van een beter alternatief voor omreizen per trein of het met eigen vervoer reizen. De hogere exploitatiekosten worden in alle gevallen goedgemaakt. Door de lijn een bestaande infrequente stadsdienst te laten overnemen kan een groter gebied vaker en sneller bediend worden en daalt het exploitatietekort verder. Met gegevens uit het Nieuw Regionaal Model van Rijkswaterstaat is bepaald hoeveel mensen per corridor mogelijk willen overstappen vanuit de auto op het OV. Het toegevoegde aantal reizigerskilometers zorgt wel voor betere exploitatieresultaten. Het is echter telkens onvoldoende gebleken om de OV-kwaliteit verder te vergroten, zonder dat het exploitatietekort toeneemt. Ten tweede is er de behoefte aan een andere aansturing van het Randstedelijk OV om daarmee een effectiever en efficiënter OV-beleid te kunnen maken en concessies beter te kunnen beheren. Deze behoefte blijkt o.a. uit het kwaliteitsverschil tussen concessies, de verschillende contractvormen, de drie verschillende aansturingsvormen voor spoorvervoer, streekvervoer en stadsvervoer en de ontwikkeling van een concessieoverstijgend hoogwaardig Randstadnet. De acht huidige OV-autoriteiten beheren elk maar een handvol OV-concessies. Door het formaliseren van de bestaande overlegstructuur van de Zuidvleugel en Metropoolregio Amsterdam met Utrecht ontstaan twee OV-autoriteiten die meer ervaring kunnen opbouwen met concessieverlening en concessiebeheer. Tevens krijgen zij inzicht in de kwaliteit van meer concessies, waardoor verbeteringen sneller in een groter gebied toegepast kunnen worden. Tenslotte neemt de externe afstemming met andere OV-autoriteiten af. Het principe van concessies uitgeven blijft voor het regionaal vervoer gelijk. Vrijwel alle concessies in de Randstad hebben qua benodigd materieelpark een efficiënte omvang, dus daar is nauwelijks behoefte aan verandering. De looptijd en ingangsdatum kunnen wel beter op elkaar afgestemd worden om een eenduidige boodschap naar de reiziger en één moment voor aanpassingen aan de dienstregeling te hebben. Het stadsvervoer wordt nu nog inbesteed, maar kan op termijn in een managementconcessie uitgegeven worden. Hiermee wordt de tucht van de markt wel toegepast, maar blijft de uitvoerende organisatie als één geheel behouden. Voor het personenvervoer over het hoofdrailnet hebben Randstedelijke OV-autoriteiten tot 2030 waarschijnlijk formeel geen invloed. Echter, als op dat moment het netwerk opgeknipt wordt en er een Randstedelijk Sprinternetwerk komt, kan dat wel in beheer komen van de twee afzonderlijke of daarvoor samenwerkende Randstedelijke OV-autoriteiten.","","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

Alliander, as a holding, owns network operator Liander. Alliander strives for a more social role in helping society achieve its (sustainable) goals, and thus asked itself how to facilitate an increase of green gas production in the Dutch gas distribution grid. The underlying question is whether Liander hampers actions of producers in these projects and how Alliander could facilitate a successful increase in green gas production. Before this research, it was unclear which specific problems existed for green gas production and which role Alliander could play in facilitating green gas. The main objective of this study is to define solutions for Alliander to facilitate a green gas injection increase based on empirical research on current hurdles. The study also briefly analyzes the implications of such solutions and presents a list of recommendations. The research was demarcated to the physical production, injection and distribution of green gas by Liander, excluding the marketing of green gas. The following main research question was posed: How can Alliander facilitate an increase of green gas production in the Dutch gas distribution grid? The research is an exploratory, qualitative study which attempts to present the current issues that hinder an increase in green gas injection in a transparent manner, and proposes possible solutions for Alliander to overcome these issues. To identify obstacles in the increase of green gas injection, semi-structured interviews were conducted with entrepreneurs who initiated green gas projects (mostly waste processing companies and farmers). In an attempt to structure and overcome complexity, simple frameworks were constructed to separate different problem areas in green gas increase. The results of the analysis of current obstacles were used to design solutions for Alliander. A systematic analysis was conducted on how Alliander could help prevent, surpass or overcome these obstacles against an increase of green gas injection. The above method led to an answer to the main research question by means of a list of plausible solutions for Alliander to remove identified obstacles against an increase of green gas production and the organizational implications (process) stemming from implementing these solutions. Conclusively, the results provide several remarks to take into account when designing solutions for stimulating the development of green gas production in the Dutch gas distribution grid.","green gas; distribution; injection; DSO","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy & Industry","","SEPAM","",""

(mentor)","2011","In this thesis we consider the application of multi-cores in safety critical real-time systems, especially avionics. In our literature study we extract two major challenges. Firstly the unpredictability that comes from the concurrent access of shared resources (especially the on-chip interconnect) must be dealt with. To address this we propose to extend the concept of partitioning which provides fault containment, in combination with resource reservation at design time. The second challenge is to optimize the hardware usage without compromising on the determinism inherent to static mapping and scheduling. We propose mode-based mapping to deal with this, which allows to switch between multiple static schemes. We capture these concepts in a simple formal model. Mode-based mapping is enabled by task migration. The transfer time of tasks must be bounded, which requires guarantees on the Quality-of-Service (QoS) offered by the interconnect. Modern multi-cores feature Networks-on-Chip (NoC), which are packet-switching interconnects consisting of links and routers. Key to deterministic behaviour of NoCs this is avoiding contention, this can be achieved with flow control and buffering strategies based on resource reservation. We propose the use of transient modes to control the changes between the different modes in a NoC. To evaluate different transfer methods we conducted a number of experiments on a 64-core processor that features a NoC. The experiments show that both data prefetching from the shared cache and the programmer accessible networks are suitable for deterministic task transfer. The former is twice as fast but the number and size of shared data objects must be limited because timing analysis of large coherent shared caches is not feasible. For all methods the maximum deviation from the mean values is constant (0,4 us), and the standard deviation is under 1/2 % of the total transfer time. This shows that these methods are deterministic and that a tight bound on the transfer time can be determined. We conclude that private caches and scratchpads are suitable memory architectures for real-time systems, which can be supported by message passing and explicit communication through small shared memory regions. Mapping traffic at design time avoids contention, and isolation of traffic at the transfer level offers additional fault-tolerance. We propose a number of improvements for the transfer methods considered in our experiments that will enable guarantees on QoS. Our experiments confirm the feasibility of the proposed concepts.","task migration; Networks-on-Chip; real-time; multi-core; avionics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-06-10","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Computer Engineering Research Group","",""

(mentor); Van Mourik, F. (mentor); Kets, A. (mentor)","2011","Interventional radiology uses X-Ray imaging to help guide the physician when inserting catheters, wires, and other small instruments and tools into the body. The physician uses this technology to diagnose and/or treat conditions in almost any part of the body. To visualize vessels and to improve the quality of the images made using X-Ray images, contrast materials (often in the form of fluids) are used. Contrast fluid can cause allergic reactions and kidney failure for the patient and X-Ray radiation brings a chance of developing cancer or damaging ovarian or sperm cells. Not only for the patient, but also for the medical staff which has to work with the equipment. Goal is to use as less contrast fluid and X-Ray radiation as possible. The contrast fluid can be injected by a manually controlled device, called a contrast fluid injector. Research shows that using a contrast fluid injector reduces the amount of contrast fluid being used on a patient with a reduction of about 21% in comparison with manual injection, while image quality is improved. Besides, fluoroscopy time (time in which real-time moving images of the internal structures of a patient are being made whilst the physician inserts catheters etc.) can be reduced significantly with 57% due to shortening of fluoroscopy shots and a lower need for repetitions. This master thesis describes the development process of the user interface design for control of contrast fluid, integrated with the (next generation) X-Ray system user interface, which was executed in service of Philips Healthcare, business unit Interventional X-Ray. After a thorough analysis of the workflow and usability problems, a concept was developed. This concept was evaluated with end users (laboratory assistants) and applicants within Philips Healthcare, who have worked as laboratory assistants in the past. Results of this evaluation were translated into adjustments to the concept. Recommendations were written for further development within Philips Healthcare.","User Interface; Contrast Fluid; Injector; Interventional X-Ray; Healthcare","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

This however is a delicate task in the sense that it is not merely concerned with the current state of the business. It is well established that any successful management strategy should treat the business as a sustainable long term commitment. The challenge here is doubled when we take into account the fast moving changes in the market as well as in customers’ needs and expectations. It is therefore no surprise that there is tremendous amount of work in the literature aiming to correctly understand the dynamics of this commitment. An important part of this literature is concerned with the notion of ambidexterity. This is one approach for organizations to adopt to changing environments. However, although there has been many studies on the ambidexterity in the structural level, there is but scarce literature available on this notion in the individual level. Furthermore most of these scarce literature is naturally dedicated to individual ambidexterity in the management. “Naturally”, because the managements ‘ attitude has the highest influence on the strategies of a firm. These studies have come up with important characteristics that distinguish ambidextrous managers as well measures to provide comparison in the level of ambidexterity. We believe, however, that there are other individuals in the company for whom the same characteristics can be identified and studied. The aim of this research is to contribute to the literature by examining senior designers as individuals with high capacity to achieve ambidexterity. We will study different approaches to ambidexterity and show that they can be efficiently applied to experienced designers. We shall study how ambidexterity in designers can influence the future of a firm.","portfolio management; ambidexterity; strategic; senior industrial designers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

The water is recycled in the hot-water process and the solids are used for land reclamation in the mine site areas that have been mined out. The fine particles in the tailings settle very slowly so companies are trying to find ways to accelerate the dewatering process. A dewatering process consists of three phases: sedimentation, consolidation and ripening when the sediment layer is exposed to air. Samples of the tailings were shipped to Delft University of Technology to perform dewatering experiments. From one of the first experiments it was suspected that the moisture content of the samples was already too low for the sedimentation phase to precede the consolidation phase. The goal of this project was to find out if there is a relation between the moisture content at the transition between the sedimentation and consolidation phases and the liquid limit and liquidity index of the soil. To be able to compare the results with another type of soil, the same tests were performed on river clay. Three sedimentation columns with different moisture contents were prepared for each of the materials and standard tests (BS 1377) were performed on the soils to determine the liquid and plastic limit from which the liquidity index was derived. To further characterize the materials, hydrometer tests were performed. From the British soil classification chart was deduced that the thickened tailings were to be classified as an intermediate plasticity clay and the river clay as a high plasticity clay. The major conclusion that may be drawn from the test results is that the liquidity index at the boundary between sedimentation and consolidation for both materials is around 18 and 19 for both soils. Furthermore the moisture content at the transition from the sedimentation phase to the consolidation phase is around ten times higher than the liquid limits of the materials. Another conclusion is that the consolidation phase shows no acceleration on a logarithmic time scale when it is preceded by the sedimentation phase, where this acceleration is visible when the sedimentation phase does not occur.","Oil Sands Tailings; Sedimentation; Liquidity Index; Consolidation","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geotechnology","","Geo-engineering Section","",""

(mentor)","2011","The SLOPE3 project investigates the depositional architecture of a Permian age, deep water / complex channelized slope system which is of interest to the oil industry as a potential analogue for real oil / gas reservoirs. This study forms a part of the SLOPE3 project and is focused on an integration of cores and wireline logs from six research boreholes, each forming a 1-D datasets showing a hierarchy of genetic depositional elements: -channels, complexes, complex sets and equivalent hierarchy channel sands, channel margin, levee and overbank deposits. These elements were previously characterized in outcrop by the University of Liverpool in an earlier phase of the SLOPE project. The University of Liverpool presented their data as a high resolution outcrop map / correlation panel some five kilometre long showing a unit truncated by a 120 m deep slope valley (see Figure frontpage). For SLOPE3 a set of six boreholes were drilled along a line sub-parallel and about 300 metres behind that outcrop section. The borehole positions had been picked on the basis of the outcrop correlation panel. All six boreholes were fully cored and five boreholes were logged with GR / Sonic / FMS. The ultimate objective of the project is to provide a set of analogue-based input data for 3D reservoir modelling. The wireline data of GR, Sonic, and FMS borehole images formed the basis for this MSc thesis and was processed and presented as graphics/logs by making use of GeoFrame software. With this software manually dip-picking of planar sedimentary structures was done. With the focus on constraining the 3D architecture of the channelized slope system, bed boundaries as well as the following other dip classes were picked: erosion surfaces, climbing ripples, low-angle cross-bedding, syn-sedimentary faults, and slump folds. By making use of the FMS images and the GR / Sonic log results the following lithofacies associations / genetic sedimentary units were identified in the five logged boreholes: massive sandstone, channel margin, external levee, internal levee, all in a background of shale. All measured sedimentary dip picks were corrected to palaeocurrent / palaeoslope indicators by subtraction of the measured and averaged structural dips. Sedimentary dips were plotted on stereonets for statistical analysis and interpretation in terms of palaeocurrent flow direction / palaeoslope orientation. This combination of a detailed outcrop data set with a suite of boreholes located on the basis of the outcrop data is a near ideal test set for the quality of geological predictions of a 3D reservoir architecture. The different type of architectural reservoir elements each with their specific lithofacies associations, can be characterized by FMS, Sonic, and GR logs when run in boreholes. However in this thesis it is shown that by doing a prediction (‘prognosis’) of the distribution of the lithofacies associations and their thicknessencountered by the boreholes based on an extrapolation from the nearby outcrop, it is rather difficult to predict the ‘actual’ geology away from well control. Moreover the value of palaeocurrent and palaeoslope indicators as identified from the FMS images for the prediction the distribution (orientation and the position) of the different genetic bodies, proved to be surprisingly minor. This is a reflection of the large spread / variation in measured palaeocurrent directions (local variation), and the additional scatter of those indicators away from the boreholes (areal variation). This latter aspect is characteristic for a meandering submarine slope channel complexes. The CD Ridge complex channelized slope system is hence interpreted to be a ‘jig-saw’ to even a ‘labyrinth’ reservoir type. The shale-prone external levee deposits are laterally extensive, thinly bedded sequences have a more layer-cake architecture. Therefore it is suggested to use deterministic modelling for these layer-cake parts, where the ‘jigsaw’ parts require a probabilistic modelling approach. The analysis of borehole images and logs resulted in: A complete input dataset including:  Zonations of the genetic bodies for every well.  A whole bunch of stereonets for 3D analysis. Both could not be achieved without BHI. Value of the use of borehole images is the 3D aspect and to distinguish between different thin-bedded lithofacies associations.","Karoo; Laingsburg; Borehole images; FMS; Slope; Turbidite; Sedimentary","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geotechnology","","Petroleum Engineering and Reservoir Geology","",""

(mentor); Bijl, H. (mentor); Visser, H.G. (mentor); La Rocca, G. (mentor)","2011","Traditionally, the aircraft design process is divided into three phases: conceptual, preliminary and detailed design. In each subsequent phase, the fidelity of the analysis tools increases and more and more details of the design geometry are frozen. In each phase a number of design variants is generated, fully analyzing them with the tools available, and then doing trade studies between important design variables to finally choose the best variant. In the past, this approach has shown good results for 'Kansas city' type aircraft, which could be decomposed into different airframe parts with distinct functions, such as wings, tail, engines and fuselage. Each part needs to fullfill its own set of requirements and could be designed and optimized relatively independently from the others. For the new generation of large transport aircraft, such as the Blended Wing Body (BWB), the traditional design approach is less suited. The Blended Wing-Body - studied by Boeing and many others as a future long-haul transport aircraft concept - is characterized by an integrated airframe, in which the aforementioned parts can no longer be clearly distinguished. The Blended Wing-Body features many and strong interactions between the various design disciplines and airframe subparts. Using the traditional design doctrine, these interactions greatly increase the required time to design. Over the past years,Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) is being considered as an alternative. Nowadays, in industry the MDO approach is mainly used in the detail design phase and for isolated, well-defined design cases. The goal of this project is to create an MDO framework which can aid the designer in optimizing entire aircraft designs in the conceptual phase. This framework is shaped to the Bi-level Integrated System Synthesis (BLISS) strategy. This strategy splits the optimization into two levels: a disciplinary level, and a system one. Before optimization, BLISS performs a sensitivity analysis to obtain linearized global sensitivities of the design objective and constraints to each of the design variables. Validation is done using three cases: two sample problems from literature with known solutions, and the optimization of a simplified Boeing 747 wing for maximum aerodynamic efficiency using an aerodynamic and structural model. All three cases were optimized succesfully. Finally, as a proof-of-concept for MDO, the framework is required to find an conceptual design of the Blended Wing-Body with minimum structural weight and minimum drag across a given mission. Meanwhile, structural, aerodynamic and performance constraints had to be satisfied. The problem features 5 disciplines, 93 constraints, 110 states and in total 92 design variables. Again, BLISS could converge to a solution, requiring 4 hours per cycle. By tuning the design variables, BLISS managed to converge to a final design in 22 cycles. The final design satisfies all constraints, except for the large local Mach number on the outboard wing. Similar problems were identified in several other Blended Wing-Body studies. The results support BLISS as a viable candidate method for introducing MDO in the conceptual design practice.","MDO; multidisciplinary; BLISS; Blended Wing Body; design; optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Design, Integration & Operations","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) is already used for treatment of phobias like fear of flying, heights and small places. It is shown to be effective in these areas prompting research into new phobia treatment possibilities. Current papers concerned with social phobia and the use of VRET do not seem to focus on person to person interaction. One of the problems that might have caused this is the difficulty of automating the interaction between a human and a computer character. In this thesis the focus lies on evaluating a possible technique for automating the interaction between a human and a computer for use in a therapeutic setting. The chosen method used avatars which behaviour was simulated using various artificial intelligence techniques. Some of the techniques used in this thesis were borrowed from research related to chatbots and embodied conversational agents. Because these type of conversational agents are not used in a therapeutic setting, the techniques had to be altered to fit this extra requirement. This produced a semi-scripted dialogue structure that would be executed. The user was asked a question and in return the computer would respond on the given answer. A speech recognizer was used, to figure out what the user had said in his free speech response, to choose a predefined response for the computer to utter. These predefined sentences encapsulated human intelligence in response to the computer to improve the realism of the conversation. The dialogues were developed in an iterative process where the dialogues were used in a chatbot like interaction with a test group. The semi-scripted dialogue was tested with four conditions; (1) using only a speech detector, (2) using a speech recognizer to detect a limited set of words, (3) some keywords added to this list and (4) using a human as the controller. The human controller was used as a benchmark point for the automatic techniques to strive for. The experiment put 24 participants in a situation where they had to give a presentation in front of four avatars after which they asked questions about a specific topic. This was repeated four times with four different dialogues resulting in a within-subject comparison of the four possible conditions. The experiment showed that the realism of the dialogue was influenced by two important factors: (1) the speed of the avatar responses and (2) the correctness of these responses. The automated techniques could not yet compete with the human control but were sufficient enough to make them hard to distinguish from the human control condition. To verify the potential usefulness of the program in a therapeutic setting a case study was conducted with one therapist and two clients. The human control condition has a higher workload than the automated conditions. The therapist therefore preferred the automatic conditions because she could actually spend time observing the clients and work on the therapy. The therapist remarked that the dialogues should be focused more on therapy purposes than correctness of the responses.","social phobia; VRET; case study; conversational agents; dialogue development; free speech interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Department of Mediamatics","","Man-Machine Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2011","The Third Generation Partnership Program's Long-Term Evolution Advanced (3GPP LTE-Advanced) group is developing a new standard for mobile broadband access that will meet the throughput and coverage requirements of a fourth generation cellular technology. The key goals for this evolution are increased data rate, improved spectrum efficiency, improved coverage and reduced latency. The ultimate results of these goals are significantly improving service provisioning and reduction of operator costs for different traffic scenarios. One of the main challenges faced by the developing standard is providing high throughput at the cell edge. Cell edge performance is becoming more important as cellular systems employ higher bandwidths with the same amount of transmit power and use higher carrier frequencies with infrastructure designed for lower carrier frequencies. One solution to improve coverage is to use the fixed relays to transmit data between the Base Stations and the Mobile Stations or User Equipments through multi hop communication. For this reason, relay technologies have been actively studied and considered in the standardization process of next-generation mobile broadband communication system. As a next-generation 3GPP standard, LTE-Advanced exclusively takes the relay technology into account. This thesis focuses the relay technologies for the LTE-Advanced systems and evaluates the performance of the relay-enhanced LTE-Advanced network. The approach for this work is to design several environments for LTE-Advanced networks involving relays. Incorporating the channel model from the Wireless World Initiative New Radio (WINNER) project, four environments were designed among which one environment considers no relay at all and the rest of the environments considered relay deployments. And the performances of all the environments are evaluated in terms of Symbol Error Rate (SER) versus the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), under several different scenarios defined in WINNER project. As an outcome, the simulation results from the simulator show that relay technologies can effectively improve service performance.","LTE; LTE Advanced; WINNER","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Engineering","","Telecommunication","",""

(mentor); Dekker, R. (mentor); Heijnen, P. (mentor)","2011","The euro currency is facing a crisis which raises doubts about Euro-trade area survival (Barber, 2010). Among the European Union member states, Southern European countries (including Ireland), currently face a difficult economic situation (Barber, 2010). There is evidence of a large gap between ‘North’ and ‘South’ Europe in terms of trade balance as Germany and the Netherlands have a strong export surpluses, while the southern countries have faced strong import penetration in the last decade. It is argued that the latter countries should adopt severe austerity measures (Zaidi, 2010), imposed by the EU according to the stability and growth pact of Dublin (Turrini, 2004). The application of austerity measures implies reforms towards making the labour market more flexible and achieving downward wage flexibility (Berthold, 1999). We focus our attention on the relations between labour markets, innovation activity and trade within the EMU (European Monetary union). Investments in Research and Development (R&D) have a positive impact on exports (Kleinknecht, 2002). It is argued that this relation is also valid in the opposite direction; that export drives innovation. There is therefore a mutual link: “winners keep winning”. Conversely, import surpluses have a negative impact on innovation, and limited investments on innovation have a negative impact on export: “losers keep losing”. Against this background, we have doubts about the austerity measures imposed by the European Union. We focus our attention particularly on the effects of export performance influenced by an increase in the flexibilization of the labour market and we assume that an easy ‘hire and fire’ of the employees has several effects in terms of acquiring or losing ‘tacit knowledge’ in an organization (Andriessen, 2005). Tacit knowledge and innovation activity are strictly intertwined (Senker, 2008) and we address innovation activity from a Schumpeterian perspective (Breschi, Malerba et al. 2000). The two Schumpeterian innovation models (small entrepreneurial firms and large organizations) will be defined and a taxonomy aimed to classify the innovation activity of an organization is developed. We argue that an increase in labour flexibility has opposite effects on the two Schumpeterian innovation models, and there is evidence of this relation in the taxonomy tables, showing a link between the degree of labour turnover inside an organization and the Schumpeterian taxonomy. We argue that governmental reforms related to the labour market at the macro-level, might have opposite effects at the firm-level in terms of export performance, depending on whether a firm shows typical Schumpeter I or Schumpeter II characteristics. In order to investigate the validity of our theory, ten hypotheses have been formulated and tested through the data analysis of the OSA database, a collection of data from 1300 Dutch companies collected over the last two decades. Four econometric models are formulated with particular attention addressed to the impact of variables indicating labour flexibility or labour turnover and their interaction with the two Schumpeterian innovation models on export performance. This research is aimed at investigating the relations between export performance and its determinants, such as R&D intensity and labour flexibility as key determinants. The determinants of export performance are derived from a survey of the theoretical and empirical literature. According to the observations and the empirical analysis of the results, significant determinants of export performance are addressed as well as recommendations and limitations for firms. The main result of the data analysis is the positive relation between a high level of flexible labour and export performance in typical Schumpeter I firms. In other words, firms showing typical Schumpeter I characteristics and adopting a high level of labour flexibility are more successful exporters. On the other hand we find a negative relation between a high level of flexible labour and export performance in typical Schumpeter II firms. In other words, firms showing typical Schumpeter II characteristics that adopt a high level of labour flexibility, are less successful exporters. This raises some doubts about the effectiveness of the austerity measures imposed by the EU. Such reforms could paradoxically have harmful consequences for the long-term export performance of Mediterranean countries and cause even deeper problems.","export performance; labour flexibility; innovation; Schumpeter; OSA longitudinal data","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Economics of Innovation","","Management of Technology","",""

To anticipate the future demands on WiMAX technology, we proposed an ADPLL (all-digital phase locked loop) solution for the WiMAX system. The developed ADPLL system has targeted frequencies from 2.3 GHz to 2.7 GHz and from 3.3 GHz to 3.8 GHz for low band and high band, respectively. In this approach, an ADPLL replaces the conventional RF synthesizer based on charge-pump architecture. There are three main components of the ADPLL system. One of them is the time-to-digital converter (TDC) system. A TDC in state-of-the-art 40 nm CMOS technology for WiMAX ADPLL system is chosen and presented in this thesis. The TDC architecture is based on a pseudo-differential structure. This architecture utilizes an inverter as a delay element and a sense amplifier flip-flop as a time comparator. In comparison, the two other TDC architectures evaluated in this thesis (two-dimensional Vernier algorithm TDC and time-windowed TDC) have very complex architectures and complex calibration methods, while the chosen TDC architecture has a simple calibration method. Moreover, this pseudo-differential TDC can meet the time resolution required by the WiMAX ADPLL system. The TDC system has been tested on a 1.2 V power supply, 33.868 MHz frequency reference clock FREF and with 4.25 GHz frequency of CKV. It is found that the power consumption is about 2.99 mW without a clock gating scheme. Moreover, it is expected that the power consumption can be reduced to 0.78 mW with a clock gating scheme. The INL and DNL of the TDC are lower than 0.4 LSB. The measured TDC resolution is around 10.84 ps - 12.55 ps. In the worst case condition, the TDC resolution of 12.55 ps will give an in-band phase noise better than the limit , which is -95 dBc/Hz as required by the WiMAX ADPLL System.

In proximity of the quay wall two sewage pipes lay on the bottom of the Venta River’s bed, which need to be combined into one single conduit with a diameter of 900 mm. In proximity of the quay wall the already existing movable Bridge on the River Venta is positioned perpendicularly to the quay wall’s center line. The final project is composed mostly of three parts: the design of the berth and of the pipeline, the analysis of the interaction between the quay wall and the conduit, the analysis of the interaction between the quay wall and the bridge’s foundation. Chapters 2, reports all boundary conditions such as water and ground levels, design vessels, hydraulic and morphological conditions, topographic and meteorological boundaries. Chapter 3 deals with the soil interpretation procedure, showing different available methods and adopted ones. The soil parameters such as angle of internal friction, dry and saturated weight and soil stiffness are obtained. Chapter 4 and 5, present different types of quay walls such as gravity walls, piles quay walls and open berth structures. By performing a Multi Criteria Analysis a choice of the most suitable berth is obtained. Chapter 6 - 8, deal with the load analysis of the quay wall. In particular chapter 6 deals with the estimation of the quay wall’s foundation reaction forces due to loads such as the concrete weight, soil weight, traffic and cargo yard load, crane, fender and ice load. Chapter 7 analyzes in particular the spreading pattern of the movable crane load on the quay wall. Chapter 8 considers the load combination on the quay wall. The design of the foundation elements of the quay wall such as the steel Combi-wall and the concrete bearing piles is performed according to different methods in chapter 9 and 10. The most suitable and most conservative one is found to be the Koppejan method. Negative skin friction effects are also included in the design of the bearing piles. The design of the Combi-wall is determined by adopting Blum’s method of fixed point. Chapter 11 deals with the design of the anchor wall and of the anchor rods. Chapter 12 estimates the construction costs of the quay wall, which amount to ca. 30.000 Euros per running meter. The overall stability of the quay wall is determined by adopting a 2D Plaxis model of the berth as reported in Chapter 13. Chapter 14 deals with the design of the pipeline and interaction between the quay wall’s foundation elements and the pipe. By means of a 2D Plaxis analysis, the soil stress increment on the pile is determined. The effects of the quay wall’s deformations on the pipe are found to generate an increase of soil stresses around the pipe’s shell of ca. 25 KPa. Least but not last the interaction between the quay wall and the Bridge’s foundation is determined.

(mentor); Tassoul, M. (mentor); Velasquez, M. (mentor)","2011","Aiming to boost the artisanal work and legal mining in Colombia, this project is focused on the creation of a brand for sustainable handmade jewelry, the collaborative work between Dutch and Colombian designers, and the strategy to successfully implemente it in the Netherlands. The first phase is the conception, which analyses both the Colombian and Dutch jewelry industry in order to define the project scope. As a result of the Colombian analysis, the need for a strong image that express the quality of the artisanal work is needed to enter into new markets. From the Dutch analysis, the increasing interest in jewelry and its awareness on sustainability seems to be a good opportunity to work on for the Colombian jewelry as a brand. Therefore, during the second phase, the mission of the company was established in order to create an image for the sustainable handmade Jewelry. The resulting brand name “ENNAKA” was invented and the design of its logo was developed as well. After the Dutch market analysis, the Dutch women between 25 to 65 years old were selected as a target market. The SWOT analysis was done in the third phase, to evaluate ENNAKA’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, in order to generate the strategy and the direction to go for the company. This analysis leads to the positioning concept and differential advantage of sustainability in jewelry, the co-design within the design process and the business model generation. Through the business model creation, important decisions were made such as the key partners, key activities, resources, channel revenue streams and so on to make this project work. The result of it is the creation of the ENNAKA Latin American Gallery Shop, which besides sustainable jewelry from Colombia, will offer other products and cultural activities from Latino America preserving always its sustainable and cross cultural concept. The final phase of the project consists of the strategy and plan implementation to reach the market in the Netherlands. The non-price strategy will be followed by ENNAKA and the main message to communicate will be the sustainable handmade jewelry; the exclusivity, high quality, innovative design, and the fair trade support. Within ENNAKA’s marketing strategies, special events such as the launch of each collection (summer and winter), the participation on fairs and the sponsorship of social change campaigns will be of vital importance to its image creation. However, one of the most important elements of the communication mix will be the gallery store, its design and the complete buying experience generated for ENNAKA’s clients. Therefore the shop keeper should be specially selected and trained. This report finishes with conclusions and recommendations for the project continuity and realization.","Co-design; BOP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Strategic Product Design (SPD)","",""

The main goals are to represent the Flemish arts in the Netherlands and to offer facilities for international exchange, cooperation and gathering. The building was originally built as a monastery in 1406 and underwent many transformations since then. The architect Arthur Staal gave the building its present appearance in 1981. The emphasis lies on the theatre and leaves little room for activities such as exhibitions and gathering. Starting point for the new ‘Brakke Grond’ was the ‘grond’, the ground on which it is built, where the plot can be seen as one entire block as part of the town. From this block public spaces are being ‘excavated’ out of the private and facility functions. The spaces and functions created this way find expression by playing with light and proportions, and by the use of different materials, thus making an easy transition from public to private. This variety of spaces each have their own identity, functioning separately, yet interconnecting. There is an interaction between the different materials, between light and dark, between inside and outside, between building and city. This ‘Brakke Grond’ is a place to meet people, to exchange ideas, to develop ambitions, to interconnect with others, and above all to be oneself, embraced by solid ground.","Interiors; buildings and cities","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-04-18","Architecture","Architecture","","Interiors, buildings and cities","",""

(mentor); Dekker, M.C. (mentor)","2011","Weight Management:Many people in the world are dealing with overweight and this amount is still growing each year. Most people are not aware of their food intake. Literature indicates that people estimate their food intake 20% less then it actually is. To lose weight without a lot of effort, a simple awareness of what you eat is enough. A well used method for this is a self reporting daily food diary. However, this method has some disadvantages. It requires big effort of the user and underreporting of the daily intake is high. Graduation Project:Literature indicates that state of the art sensor technology is able to detect food intake. Based on this literature and several user studies, a product concept is developed, called ‘The Energy Balancer’. This product makes the user more aware of his/her food intake while it is more user friendly than a food diary. Product Concept:The product consists of a weight scale and on-body sensor. The on-body sensor should be worn on the belly in an elastic band. It measures the timing of consumed food/liquids as well as the portion sizes of it (based on bowel sounds, heart rate & skin temperature). At the end of the day, the sensor should be plugged into the weight scale. Then, the user should assign the food type category to the detected food/liquid consumptions. Three food type categories are determined (by the Voedingscentrum); GO - SLOW - WHOA! ‘GO’ means a healthy food choice, ‘WHOA!’ an unhealthy food choice and ‘SLOW’ is somewhere in between. To which category a food product belongs can be looked up in a table provided by the Voedingscentrum. When confronting the user with the categories, he/ she will be more aware of his/her food choices (mindful eating). Based on the measured portion size and food type category a rough estimation of the energy intake can be made. Next to the energy intake, the on-body sensor also detects energy expenditure through physical activity (and body processes). By means of an acceleration meter, a rough estimation of energy expenditure can be made. By comparing the energy intake with the energy expenditure, the energy balance can be calculated and shown to the user. This balance is seen as a useful information since it determines whether a person loses or gains weight.","energy intake; energy expenditure; weight management; mindful eating; user studies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-04-15","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Sleeswijk Visser, F. (mentor); Donovan, J. (mentor)","2011","This report is about my final Design for Interaction master’s project I did at SPIRE research centre in Sønderborg about provotyping. This work is part of PhD candidate Laurens Boer’s promotion. Provotypes are provocative prototypes that are used at the fuzzy frontend of an innovation project to understand how people experience phenomena they earlier took for granted. Providing them with tools to interact with the phenomenon gives them a new experience. The difference with other methods that achieve user insight through artefacts is that in the provotype method people are made to reflect on a new experience they get with the provotype itself. The main research question is: what are the most important factors when creating a provotype that makes people reflect on an intangible phenomenon that was formerly taken for granted? Hypotheses are generated based on literature and earlier work: sensing, feedback, interaction, shape, time, ambiguity and reflection. The playground to test these hypotheses regarding provotyping as a method is the indoor climate and quality of life project. This project is a participatory design project that involves 2 universities and 5 business partners interested in acquiring a good insight of indoor climate comfort. The indoor climate project has been going on since August 2008. In this period ethnographic studies are done which resulted in comfort themes that may lead to innovation tracks. Based on these themes the direction for the project is decided. Bridging feeling and understanding is the one that showed to have to most opportunities to test the hypotheses. A range of provotypes is generated that aim to make people reflect on their indoor climate. These provotypes are made into scenarios for reviewing. From these reviews one final provotype is developed. The dominant indoor climate variables are combined in a lamp that shows the state of the indoor climate. Participants are asked to generate material during a review session to connect the state of the lamp to the activity that was going and how they felt at the time. By creating this material they get back to that moment and can reflect to connect feeling and understanding. Field studies have been performed with three families that were interested in their indoor climate: One Danish family that received an earlier vase provotype as a pilot test. One Danish family received the lamp provotype and one Dutch family also received the lamp provotype. From the studies it can be concluded that the lamp succeeded in giving people insight in their indoor climate by letting them explore their home environment, but failed in getting information about what people experienced as comfort. This failure leads to research opportunities to improve how to bridge this experience of the phenomenon with what is experienced with the provotype. When looking at the hypotheses, the only conclusion that can be drawn from the field studies is that a minimalistic shape works better for engaging with the provotype. The rest of the hypotheses are only pointers that had a positive effect. An output that encompasses multiple variables and showing them into one whole makes people aware that the bigger phenomenon consists of different smaller parts that are interconnected. Active participation and ability to change the output in real time helps to reflect on the phenomenon.","provotyping; prototype; interactive; technology; Denmark; user; research","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2011","Eeuwenlang draaide de architectuur van de woningbouw om de grote landhuizen van de aristocratie. De negentiende eeuwse bouwopgave bestond er uit om een deftig en imponerend gebouw te creëren, gebaseerd op een streng symmetrische plattegrond naar klassiek Italiaans voorbeeld. Omstreeks 1860-’70 vond hierin een omslag plaats toen de middenklasse zich voor het eerst in Engeland als nieuwe opdrachtgever aandiende. Het huis wordt vanaf dan afgestemd op de gebruikers en het klassieke schema los gelaten. Een meer burgerlijkere inslag ontstaat. Hierin bevindt zich de oorsprong van het moderne landhuis en ook de aanleiding voor het woonhuis zoals wij dat nu kennen. Echter de negentiende eeuwse architectuur is, alle technische, sociale en economische ontwikkelingen ten spijt, in eerste instantie toch traditioneel in materiaal en vormgeving. Pas in de twintigste eeuw wordt de weg bereid voor het moderne als vormgevingsprincipe. Het Nieuwe Bouwen is de Nederlandse benaming van de moderne ontwikkeling in de architectuur die op diverse plaatsen in Europa in de jaren 1920 – 1930 op gang komt en die een strenge functionele architectuur voorschreef. Kritiekloze bewondering in brede kring voor het moderne als stijl dateert echter pas van na 1945. In de Nederlandse politiek en samenleving heerst de “doorbraakgedachte”, waarbij de massaproductie van de wederopbouw simpelweg vraagt om een sobere, zakelijke architectuur. De dogmatische idealen van het modernisme verdwijnen met de brede naoorlogse toepassing. Het nogal rechtlijnige functionalisme van het Nieuwe Bouwen maakt plaats voor een vrijer en expressiever gebruik van de modernistische principes. Het nogal beperkte repertoire aan materialen (oorspronkelijk staal, beton, glas) wordt uitgebreid. Esthetische motieven winnen aan belang ten opzichte van ideologische in het bijzonder geldt dit voor het landhuis. De architect wordt naast als bouwkundige erkent als vormgevend kunstenaar. Bij het naoorlogse huis geldt als eerste prioriteit dat het huishouden makkelijk is te organiseren omdat de beschikbaarheid van dienstdoend personeel gewoonlijk verdwijnt. Waar voor de oorlog iedere functie een eigen gebruiksruimte kreeg in de woning, waardoor er een veelheid aan, meestal kleine, kamers bestond konden na de oorlog diverse functies samengaan in één ruimte. Het vooroorlogse huis was compact, zowel in de plattegronden als in de opbouw van de massa terwijl het naoorlogse moderne werd open gewerkt. Het huis werd daarbij verbonden met de buitenomgeving. Imponerend was het moderne huis over het algemeen allerminst. Comfortabel en voorzien van de nieuwste comfort en luxe was het welliswaar, maar in het naoorlogse Nederland vroeg de maatschappij vooral om bescheidenheid. Welvaart werd niet geëtaleerd. Liever gaat het naoorlogse landhuis daarom qua architectuur op in de overige bouwproductie. De motivatie voor de bouw van het kleine naoorlogse landhuis is doorgaans anders als in de periode daarvoor. Er werd voorzien in de behoefte aan een natuurlijke omgeving, de afkeer van het chaotische stadsleven, de behoefte aan rust en eenzaamheid, en het zich niet kunnen schikken in de beperkingen van de confectieplattegrond die regel was geworden als gevolg van de massawoningbouw. De bouwopgave was meer dan een technisch probleem. Men hechtte belang aan het contact en geestelijke belangstelling van de architect ten opzichte van de opdrachtgever. Het huis moet een harmonisch geheel zijn, waarin materiële en geestelijke behoeften tegen elkaar afgewogen zijn.","wederopbouw; landhuizen; villa; modernisme; opdrachtgeverschap; huishouden; woonhuis","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Architectuurgeschiedenis","",""

(mentor); Zandbelt, D.D. (mentor)","2011","Because of the construction of the second Maasvlakte the harbours in Rotterdam will shift towards the west. This movement will create open spaces in the most eastern harbour of Rotterdam; The Stadshavens. This harbour is the only active harbour left which have a physical relation with the city of Rotterdam. The open spaces in these harbours can be used and redeveloped for other functions, like living, working and leisure. Rotterdam has a history of redeveloping old harbours; some were developed a long time ago, like the Oude Haven (Old Harbour) and others more recently, Kop van Zuid (Southbank). These harbours acted as holes in the fabric of Rotterdam. All companies in these harbours relocated to other bigger and newer harbour area which were constructed in the west. By this movement of companies the Oude Haven and Kop van Zuid became “Brownfields” “Brownfield’s are abandoned, idle or underused industrial or commercial where expansion or redevelopment is complicated by real or perceived environmental contamination that can add cost, time or uncertainty to a redevelopment project.” (Davis, 2002) As stated above, the Stadshavens will continue to function while certain functions in this harbour will be moved; this is the big difference between the Stadhavens and harbours like Oude Haven and Kop van Zuid. The challenge in this project is how to fit new functions into a partially functioning harbour. What are the steps that must be taken first before a harbour area can function in such a way that people are willing to live in it? The needs and demand of the municipality of Rotterdam must be factored in as well. The Stadshavens might provide a answer for the urgent needs of the city. Besides the needs and demands, a look has to be taken at the current problems in Rotterdam and if the Stadshavens can be used too solve these problems. The main question in this research is: “How to redefine the relation between the Stadshavens and the city of Rotterdam by using the gradually available space in Stadshavens and a unique location in Rotterdam?”","Regeneration; Rotterdam; Stadshavens; Connecting; Multifunctional","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-04-21","Architecture","Urbanism","","Urban Acupuncture","",""

(mentor)","2011","This thesis deals with separation of freeway traffic using dynamic lane assignment, based on ones destination; either or not to the next downstream exit. At freeway exits a high amount of lane changes lead to capacity reduction. Furthermore, when the flow to the exit exceeds the exit capacity (like at an IKEA on Sundays) a queue will form that spills back to the freeway. In case no measures are taken, congestion spreads out over all freeway lanes. Traffic flow theory shows that separating exiting traffic from through-going traffic can prevent this total roadway blockage in case increasing the exit capacity is not possible. Compared with existing measures, this study explores chances and drawbacks of dynamic flow separation on one roadway. Here dynamic means variable in time and space, so no physical or static separation is used. The goal of this type of separation is to improve outflows for through-going traffic near oversaturated off-ramps. Therefore two traffic controllers have been designed in this study. Through-going vehicles are guided away from the rightmost lane while exiting vehicles are guided to the rightmost lane. The dynamic aspect is that the length of this separation measure is based on the location of the tail of the queue. Both controllers switch on when the vehicle speeds drop below a threshold value at a specified location. In the first control strategy (a feedback controller) the length of the dynamic separation upstream of the exit is determined by a fixed offset distance upstream of the measured tail. In the second control strategy (a feed forward controller) the location of the tail is predicted using shockwave estimation. The separation length is now determined by the shockwave speed and direction. Both controllers have been tested in an adapted version of FOSIM for different flow/capacity ratios by altering controller parameters like intervention location and (initial) offsets. The simple feedback controller mostly improves the outflow for through-going traffic. The advanced feed forward controller works as well, but the control behavior is very unstable due to measurement errors of many variables. The benefit in outflow can grow to 30% with a well specified intervention location, offsets around 1000 m and compliances from 80%. The results show a more uniform traffic situation near the exit, reduction of congestion spillback and no total roadway congestion after implementing a controller. A clear separation in flows can be seen resulting in higher speeds on the leftmost lane. The results are suboptimal however, because the speeds and flows on the lane adjacent to the exit queue are low. This is due to the legal and safety aspects related to the maximum speed difference between non-physically separated lanes.","dynamisch; ontvlechten; dynamic; separation; lane; assignment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

Especially at the end-of-life of the building it causes an enormous impact on the environment. Waste will be reduced by extending the lifetime of the short term buildings, and therefore the façade replacement for the commercial buildings must be encouraged. Though the result of waste due to the mixture of materials remains a problem during the end-of-life process, this barrier mainly comes from current construction practices that view the assembly as a unidirectional practice with an end goal of producing a final façade/building. A more cyclic or closed-loop view recognizes the need to consider, at the design stage, the disassembly process as well as the assembly process. Design for disassembly expresses such need. These strategies, which are in this thesis applied to an example facade of Arup, show possibilities to reduce waste by redesign.","waste","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-04-22","Architecture","Building Technology","","International Facade Master","",""

If one takes a closer look at these projects, one can see that the projects are often cumbersome and difficult adaptable to changes in the process environment.

(mentor); Bokel, R.M.J. (mentor); Van den Heuvel, D. (mentor)","2011","The requirements, comfort needs and expectations for facades have increased, so has the need for energy efficient design. Present climate systems are using a lot of energy, especially to control heat and cooling loads. The cool load and solar power often occur at the same time and an increase of solar power often increases the cool load of a building. In the development of solar harvesting plants the Stirling engine is used as a clean, low maintenance and efficient engine to create electricity. In this research the possibilities are explored for a Stirling system driven by solar energy, the consequences of integrating such a system into the facade and the possible performance. In this system the increase of solar power can increase the cooling power. This leads to an increase of a free source of energy when the cool load is increasing. The development and research on the Stirling engine is still in progress and is not yet been integrated in a system in the facade for the purpose of cooling an office building. This causes the calculations on performance and comparison to other system to be an estimation which in time could be revised and updated. A system powered by solar power harvested from an office facade and put into cooling power is considered likely to work. It is feasible that this system can contribute to the reduction of the annual cooling load of an office building. For an office building this system will always need an additional climate system and therefore additional costs.","Stirling Engine; Integrated facade system; Duplex Stirling; Solar cooling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-04-20","Architecture","Building Technology","","Facade Design","",""

(mentor); Roscam Abbing, E. (mentor)","2011","This project was inspired by my personal interest in starting a company based on the idea of connecting the customer with the origins of a food product. Coming from a family of dairy farmers and having grown up on a dairy farm myself, dairy products provided an interesting (and obvious...) case study. The topic of experiential retailing was inspired by seeing the emerging trend of it being incorporated more and more to retail products. This field of retailing is still relatively new and research on practical implementation still has much room for broadening of knowledge. In addition, customers are increasingly demanding high-quality, unique products with a story. Local production is gaining recognition and initiatives such as the Slow Food movement are promoting looking closer to home for culinary inspiration. This project looks at various ways this can be achieved. Literature research on the subject was conducted to see how aspects of experiential retailing can be used. Also, interviews with Dutch artisan food retailers were done to gather practical insights into the industry. With the goal in mind – setting up a dairy store franchise – findings from the research were used to determine which aspects were interesting to explore further and incorporate into a conceptual store design. The final concept considers both design and strategic aspects of setting up a dairy store franchise in the Netherlands. A concept for the Alfalfa company is presented. This company will compete in the high-end dairy food industry with a retailing concept that sets itself apart from the competition. Differentiation will be achieved by focusing on one category – dairy – and providing high quality, locally unique products. The company will work together with local dairy farmers to bring these products to the market. This aspect will be used to establish the brand in the market: the fact that the company has close, personal business relationships with local farmers and that this allows them to share the dairy experience with customers. Overall, the Alfalfa dairy retail concept presented in this report provides a unique business strategy that plays into current market trends, both from customer and farmer perspectives. While customers increasingly demand knowing more about quality products, farmers are looking for additional channels of generating revenue. The Alfalfa business concept provides value to all parties involved.","dairy; experiential; retailing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-04-14","Industrial Design Engineering","Strategic Product Design","","","",""

The railway station area of Leiden Central must be redeveloped to incorporate a new light rail line. Therefore the station is changing, both as a node in the network of public transport and as a place in the city next to the historical centre. In this light Bertolini (Bertolini and Spit, 1998) has developed the node-place model. A balance between node and place-elements create a good working urban transport and land use system. Peek (2006) elaborates this with the types Transportation node, Connector, Urban centre and Meeting place. These perspectives equally balanced contribute to creating a coherence of node and place-elements which can lead to an increase in value. (Peek, 2006, Location synergy) The Master Thesis focuses on these four perspectives to redesign the station area in its urban layout. First they are used to compare similar station area in the network of High Speed Trains in the form of a case study and than it gives a vision to the station area of Leiden in a design as a strong urban place with a lively public space.","railway station; network city; station area redevelopment; RijnGouweLijn","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Urbanism","","","",""

One of the components used to manufacture LED’s is made at the component manufacturer that is subject to this thesis. The objective of improving service levels at the lowest possible cost can be enabled by supply chain control. Of course superior service levels can be realized with excessive inventory levels. However that ignores the objective of lowest costs, because inventory cost money. Therefore an optimal balance between service level and inventory must be achieved. This balance depends on a number of different drivers like lead-time, lead-time variability, manufacturing quality and demand pattern.

(mentor); Heurkens, E.W.T.M. (mentor)","2011","This research sets out to study the leadership styles that public development authorities adopt in the process from initiation to realization of strategic projects. In a broad sense the aim of this study is to gain a better understanding in how urban planners convert a vision to delivery of it. In this study the transformation will be referred to as the process of realizing strategic projects. This study focuses on the urban planning authority responsible for executing strategic projects, taking into account the increase of development complexity in recent decades. In a narrower sense the leadership style - also referred to as attitude or role - of the public development authority is assessed. The aim is to get an understanding of how public leadership styles affect the realization of a strategic project. The research question is: How can public leadership affect the realization of strategic projects in urban development? The motivation for this study is the increase of the dynamics and the unpredictable nature of the market environment in which cities act. Neoliberal concepts have changed the urban planning profession over the past 20 years to the extent it is no longer possible to claim that it is founded on the assumption that “only rationally acting individual actors operate in the urban development arena”. As a result the development of the urban environment has become increasingly complex. An increase of specialized actors (professionalization), changing circumstances (policy, law, economics, and environment), financing constraints and mixed interests (inter and multi-organizational interests) result in a decrease of steering possibilities by urban professionals. Healey (2006) confirms this as she states ‘the development of urban areas [...] cannot be “planned” by government action in a linear way, from intention to plan, to action, to outcome as planned.’ The transforming urban conditions have resulted in a changing role for urban planners in realizing their spatial aspirations. Collaboration and participation with community and market stakeholders have become more important. It is therefore interesting to identify the leadership styles of urban development authorities.","Public Leadership; Leadership styles; Urban Development; Development authority; Strategic Projects; Planning; Public Administration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-04-27","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","Urban Area Development","",""

(mentor); Hubers, H. (mentor)","2011","In this research I explore the use of a Building Information Model (BIM) to generate 3D visualisations for design evaluation in the hospital design process. I measure what effects information abstraction in the visualisation has on design evaluation by the medical specialist. BIM is a concept for integral management of design information during a building process by connecting all information to a virtual 3D model. In the current application of BIM is few use of the 3D information for generating 3D visualisations. Therefor the use of BIM does not provide additional advantage to the user of the building during the design process. Correct use of these 3D visualisations however provides a solution to the following problems the medical specialist faces as a user in the designprocess. * The medical specialist does not oversee the relation between his initial demands and the design to be reviewed, because he has to interpret much design information because of the limited amount of evaluation moments. * The design consequences of his demands are difficult to understand by the medical specialist, because of the lack of experience in interpreting architectural design documents. * The demands of the medical specialist are very specific and the consequences of design decisions have to be reviewed against the specific demands in an early design stage. To investigate the application of 3D visualisation for design review by the user, I ask the following question: “What information output from a Building Information Model is required to produce visualizations that enable medical specialists to generate useful feedback in order to interact with the architect and actively control the quality of the design consequences of their initial information input?” The research is divided into two parts. The first part is an investigation of the design evaluation process of the new hospital design for the Meander Medisch Centrum in Amersfoort with the use of interviews. I use the obtained information as input for the setup of the experiments that form the second part of the research. The design of the new Meander Medisch Centrum is in final design stage at the time of this research. They use BIM in the design process to manage the design information. Though BIM is just used to generate 2D visualisations of the design in the form of technical drawings. With the use of six experiments I investigate the influence of information abstraction on the design evaluation with 3D visualisation from BIM. By the use of five elements from the design brief I simulate design evaluation with the medical specialist in these experiments. These elements are: surface area, inventory, athmosphere for the specialist, athmosphere for the client and hygiene. In the experiment the medical specialist is shown Virtual Reality 3D visualisations with variants of a room in which the abstraction level of the information differs. The abstraction of the information is divided in three levels for the two variables spatial information and material information. With these variants I measure how well the medical specialist is able to evaluate the design with each abstraction level. For the result I can get the following findings for the evaluation of each of the elements from the design brief: * There are no significant differences for the evaluation of spatial dimensions between the different abstraction levels. * De surface area is underestimated in all cases. * A medium detail is the optimal level for information concerning the inventory that is the addition to the BIM. * The high detail level for material information is important for the evaluation of the athmosphere. The detail level of spatial information does not play any role. * For the evaluation of the athmosphere for the patient, the medical specialist uses more mental imagination at lower detail levels than for the evaluation of other elements from the design brief. * The low spatial detail level is not suitable for the evaluation of the hygiene. Material detail levels are not relevant for the evaluation of of the hygiene. In general the two main conclusions of this research are: * The highest detail level for both spatial and material information is not required. The medium detail levels provide similar results during design evaluation in the hospital design process. * The low detail level meets the demands for evaluation of spatial aspects that are now correctly reviewed at later design stages. The restrictions that are applied to the control of the virtual camera have proved to be too strong. The specialists have indicated that this might have a negative effect on the evaluation at all detail levels. This should be considered when the results of this research are used in practise. Also the influence of the interaction between specialists on the interpretation ability during the design evaluation in the user groups is not taken into account. What the effects of this interaction may be should be investigated in followup research.","BIM; 3D; visualisatie; ziekenhuis","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-04-20","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","Architectural Design Management","",""

Visuals are commonly managed through light consoles and media-servers. However, the control of these devices is complex and not suitable in `live´ situations. `Live´ environments are characterized by the fact that visual compositions are created in real time. The visual artist reacts to the environmental inputs by expression the mood and feelings visually on the stage. Midiator Pulsar is the new generation visual console for `live´ environments. It simplifies and provides a more user-friendly control of light consoles and media-servers. In this way, the new interface enables visual artists to create more appealing compositions in `live ‘situations. The software integrated in the system enables the user to manage all aspects (light and video technologies) of a visual show from a single point of control. Furthermore, the new working principle assists the visual artist by analyzing the environmental inputs and providing visual information.

(mentor); Abspoel, R. (mentor); Twilt, L. (mentor); Hoogenboom, P.C.J. (mentor); Vambersky, J.N.J.A. (mentor)","2011","Een stalen plaatligger is een hoog I-profiel samengesteld uit stalen platen die aan elkaar worden gelast of gebout. Stalen plaatliggers kunnen geplaatst worden als dakligger in industriehallen. Het toepassen van een stalen plaatligger in plaats van een raatligger of vakwerkligger kan in economisch opzicht de optimale keuze zijn. Door het verhogen van de maximale lijfslankheid van liggers kan het staal efficiënter in de doorsnede worden geplaatst. Er zijn echter redenen om kritisch naar de brandwerendheid van slanke plaatliggers te kijken. De redenen waarom aangenomen mag worden dat een ligger met hogere lijfslankheid negatieve gevolgen heeft voor de brandwerendheid zijn:  De profielfactor van de stalen plaatligger zal worden verhoogd. Door een snellere opwarming zal de kritieke staaltemperatuur eerder worden bereikt waardoor de ligger relatief snel zal bezwijken;  Vanwege stabiliteitsproblemen is het aannemelijk dat de kritieke staaltemperatuur van plaatliggers met hoge lijfslankheid tijdens een brand snel zal worden bereikt. In dit afstudeeronderzoek zijn de gevolgen van het slanker maken van het lijf van stalen plaatliggers voor de brandwerendheid onderzocht. In het kader van dit onderzoek is gekeken naar een stalen plaatligger toegepast als dakligger in een industriehal. Een hoge lijfslankheid zal, zoals is aangetoond in dit onderzoek, veelal leiden tot een hoge profielfactor (Am/V). De standaard-brandwerendheid van stalen plaatliggers met een profielfactor groter dan 250 m-1 is minder dan 10 minuten (en volgens de werkhypothese zoals gesteld in het verslag onvoldoende). Voor zeer slanke plaatliggers kan een profielfactor groter dan 350 m-1 worden verwacht. Dit is dus onvoldoende om zonder aanvullende voorzieningen veilig te kunnen worden toegepast in een industriehal. Het is noodzakelijk om kritisch te kijken naar de brandwerendheid van stalen plaatliggers met hoge lijfslankheid. Door een model op te stellen van een meer realistisch verloop van de temperatuur in een brandcompartiment is vast gesteld welke tijd de staaltemperatuur onder de kritieke staaltemperatuur van doorsnedeklasse 4 profielen zal blijven. In dit onderzoek is het verloop onderzocht van de temperatuur in een groot brandcompartiment (35m breed, 40m lang, 8m hoog). Aangetoond is dat de tijd voor het bereiken van de kritieke staaltemperatuur sterk afhankelijk is van de uitbreidingsnelheid van de brand. De branduitbreidingssnelheid wordt gekarakteriseerd door de tijd waarin de oppervlakte van de brand gegroeid is tot een oppervlakte met een effectieve hoeveelheid warmte afgifte van 1 MW, de zogenaamde tijdconstante (t?). Een lage tijdconstante betekent een snelle branduitbreiding. In het gekozen brandcompartiment wordt de kritieke staaltemperatuur (van 350 °C) bereikt na 20 minuten (na ontsteking) bij een tijdconstante (t?) van 160 seconden. Bij deze tijdconstante hebben de gebruikers (volgens een vastgestelde werkhypothese) voldoende tijd om uit het gebouw te vluchten, en de brandweer het gebouw te doorzoeken. Indien de industriehal wordt gevuld met materialen waarbij een hogere tijdconstante moet worden aangenomen, kan een brandwerendheid worden verwacht van meer dan 20 minuten. Aanbevolen wordt om stalen plaatliggers met grote lijfslankheid in de hoofddraagconstructie van industriegebouwen te accepteren met in achtneming van het volgende. Voor bouwaanvragen van industriehallen waar een t? ? 160 seconden verwacht wordt, dient de ontwerper aan te tonen dat de constructie een minimale standaard-brandwerendheid bezit van 10 minuten.","plaatligger; industriehal; brandwerendheid","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","","",""

Its design tries to accomplish this effect by creating a visual impression of a beacon along the shoreline of the Nieuwe Maas and reconnecting the area with it surroundings. The design concept is inspired by a spiders web and in addition the way how a cocoon like lampion-flower (the Physalis Alkekengi) is build-up. This kind of material translates the visual appearances of weaving into spatial relations based on a tensional setup throughout the building. A veil which covers the total ground floor has an open-closed character and gives the ambience inside more the impression of a marketplace than a culture palace. A combination in relief and transparency for creating the pattern which contains on one hand enough privacy and gives on the other hand a reasonable amount of daylight. The futuristic appearance of the weaved building skin and its leveled anticlastic identity which covers the space inside the building, creates a whole new meaning to the dynamic visual concept in relation to private and public interaction. The aim is to use the museum of contemporary art to revitalize and re-energize the Heijplaat area and by doing so creating a gateway between the village and modern society in Rotterdam. The building will not only accommodate different kind of art collections, but will also be available for other functions within the region of creative industry. Studios where artists can expand their creativity (sculpturing & painting). Workshops will be held to educate and find the creativity within one another. Theater for displaying all sorts of media.

Fore that reason and also because my own interest in art, I’ve tried to learn things about Kumasi via art. Especially crafts are an important heritage for Kumasi. Art is an instrument to express yourself, it’s good for the self-esteem of residents and students and also can create social cohesion. It’s important to conserve this. Not only to tell history, but also to stimulate the new generation and keep the talent. One important way to do this is to improve the existing art school in Kumasi; the Faculty of Art at the KNUST Campus. The prob¬lem of the current accommodation is mainly the lack of space. The challenge is to improve this faculty at the current building plot. Therefore the objective is to make a proposal design for the restoration and renovation of this faculty. The enlargement of education space is mainly necessary for staff accommo¬dation, studio space, lecture rooms, art storage and place for symposia. In this way I try to contribute a little to preserve art and it’s benficial assets. LET'S MEET EACH OTHER The faculty is located in the Northern part of the KNUST Campus. A new entrance will be proposed, so that also residents of surroundings districts, like Ayigya, can visit the faculty and participate for instance painting workshops. At the current building site, there are hardly places to meet. However it could be an opportunity to create those places, where students and tutors can relax in the shadow or spend their lunch break. The current building ensemble exits of several longitudinal pavilions which function as classrooms. In the course of time this area has extended in the same typology. The atmosphere is pleasant and the ensemble appears like a small village. There is a little bit of green, but this could be increased. The concept is to take down some existing classroom pavilions, which have a low building quality. The renewal exits of new pavilions, which will be build in the same architectural typology as the existing ones, but in an innovated way. To shift them in a certain way, meetings places will be created. Only some large trees will cover these areas. When it’s to hot inside the classroom pavilions, lectures and presentations can be held outside now, ADAPTION OF SPACE Because of the water erosion in the area, the building site will be terraced. Terracing will decrease the speed of the water and therefore create water erosion control. The new landscape that will be constructed is the joining component that connects the old and the new pavilions. Because the levels of the landscape are all one step high, it’s also a place where you can sit on. As well some places can function as a podium where lectures can be held. When the landscape is in use, the outside space becomes suited to the needs of the students and tutors, but when it’s not in use, it’s just the green landscape itself. Therefore this new landscape can loan itself perfectly for the adaption of education space. A POINT OF VIEW From the board of deans there was the question to cluster the functions more. For that reason also a reorganization of the functions will take place. The workshops are grouped together now as one big family. Via a bridge this area will be entered. The five new workshop pavilions surround a large terrace on the first floor level. From here you can enter the pavilions on the first floor, but it’s also a communal area where larger events can be held or expositions can be organized. This place gives a great view over the rich vegetated campus area, in the direction of the district Ayigya.","Transformation; Ghana; Kumasi; Art + Culture; Intervention; Faculty","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-04-14","Architecture","RMIT","","Studio Ghana","",""

(mentor)","2011","When analyzing three-dimensional problems with nonlinear finite element analysis (NLFEA) often problems are encountered such as bifurcation and divergence of the solution. In particular, cases subjected to tension softening tend to encourage the emergence of multiple equilibrium paths. In order to overcome these problems the Sequentially Linear Analysis (SLA) method has been developed for three-dimensional solid elements. SLA is an alternative for incremental-iterative solution schemes to model the nonlinear fracture behavior of quasi-brittle materials. It is an attractive method since it avoids the well known convergence and bifurcation problems that are often encountered when using incremental-iterative schemes such as Newton-Raphson. SLA uses a series of linear analyses to model the nonlinear behavior of the structure. By directly specifying a damage increment in each linear analysis, extensive iterations within the load or displacement increment can be avoided. The main objective of this research was to see how the Sequentially Linear Analysis approach could be extended to solid elements, so that it could be used for three-dimensional fracture problems as well. Although three-dimensional geometries such as masonry structures have been analyzed before using SLA, it was always restricted to two-dimensional finite elements only (shell elements). Therefore, first a theoretical constitutive model for three-dimensional stress-strain states has been developed that served as the starting point. Implementation in DIANA was the major second step from which the third and last step could be started: the verification on various fictive and real cases. A single element pull test was used to solve programming errors, whereas the notched beam offered the possibility to check how the newly developed SLA-code would perform for larger models. Both cases showed excellent agreement with the experiment. However, most attention was dedicated to the verification and physical interpretation of a real reinforced concrete slab. The results were critically evaluated, interpreted and compared to results from the experiment and the incremental-iterative Newton-Raphson method. It was concluded that the Sequentially Linear Analysis is able to properly capture the quasi-brittle behavior of the reinforced concrete slab. Especially in comparison to the three-dimensional Newton-Raphson results, SLA turned out to be more robust and accurate.","Sequentially Linear Analysis; Nonlinear; Fracture; Slab; Concrete","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

Firstly the area will become centered around two redesigned axes, where a pedestrian-friendly space is proposed. Then ,on these axes new centralities are developed.

The research?oriented approach has been the consequent of a perceived lack of consolidated – technocratic – planning concepts to confront today’s challenges for the facilitation of legitimate and effective of urban spatial development. In turn, the scientific output which is presented in this thesis adheres to several topical debates on urban spatial development. Particularly, we have addressed the challenge for planners to confront the complexity of decision?making on urban spatial developments. The latter has been captured in the Netherlands under the politically embraced paradigmatic shift towards ‘area development’. This notion poses area developments as the product of an active collaboration between the State, market and civil society. We illustrated our perspective by a topical project - Spoorzone Delft - which exposes a practical manifestation on how Dutch planning deals with a situation in which regional mobility objectives intersect with local inner-city potentials and demands for transformation. We concluded that the embedded 'techocratic' Dutch planning discourse fails to perform in a context which is marked by complexity and dynamics in decision-making. Hence, we recommended on a process-oriented planning perspective. We particularly argued that planners are challenged to facilitate in learning-oriented contexts, by confronting the diversity of (sectoral-based) values in order to reach towards shared commitments and a collective focus for action.","spatial planning; complexity; area development; legitimacy; Spoorzone Delft; argumentative turn; technocratics; learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-04-12","Architecture","Urbanism","","Spatial Planning and Strategy","",""

The first chapter deals with wayfinding, its definitions, how it is related to the city centre of Delft, environmental psychology and urban economy. The aim of the graduation project is to better understand how people navigate in cities in order to develop recommendations for urban planning and design to make city visits more enjoyable, engaging and involving for pedestrians. The main research question for the graduation project is: “Which strategic spatial design interventions can improve public space for the slow traffic network in order to retain city visitors in the city centre of Delft?” This subject will be solved by answering four sub-research questions: (i) What are criteria for successful public spaces looking at pedestrians walking in city centres? (ii) What is the current quality of the streets and built environment in the city centre of Delft? (iii) Do pedestrians (visitors/tourists, city centre inhabitants and neighbourhood residents) use the public space in the city centre of Delft differently? (iv) How can the criteria for successful public spaces, the analysis of the current situation and the conclusions of how people use the city centre be embedded in strategic spatial (navigational) recommendations for the city centre of Delft? Applied methods in order to answer the sub-research questions are: (ad i) Literature review studies (a general study about good public space and a specific wayfinding study). (ad ii) Evaluation of the city centre by mapping urban facilities, making a Three-Step analysis, measuring walking distances from two garages, visibility graph analysis, history of Delft by a morphology analysis, quality analysis perception of the city centre based on participants’ questionnaires and a visual analysis (photographs). (ad iii) Actual pedestrian movement is gathered and mapped by doing two GPS-tracking research pilots in the city centre of Delft (a) November 2009: following visitors/tourists who park their car in the Phoenix or Zuidpoort garage and who continue their journey on foot (b) April/May 2010: following city centre inhabitants and neighbourhood residents of Delft. Results are mapped in ArcGIS and statistics are made in SPSS and Excel. Behaviour of the three different pedestrian groups is compared, where after results and conclusions are noted. (ad iv) All gathered information is put into a self made GPS-flowchart: the model shows a researcher in four steps which strategic interventions are recommended for a project area. To answer the main research question, first a future vision of Delft 2030 is described which is followed by a mission, vision and strategy for the city centre of Delft. Consequently, strategic spatial design interventions are proposed, divided into conservative short term and ambitious long term scenarios. The GPS-flowchart is used to determine a strategy for a specific area in the city centre. Due to the fact that there is an enormous amount of data available, several tips for follow-up research are suggested.","urban environment; historic; city centre; visualisation; pedestrian movement; walking; measuring; understanding; improving; spatial quality; GPS; tracking; good public space; wayfinding; environmental psychology; urban economy; GIS; SPSS; city centre evaluation; urban facilities; three-step analysis; walking distances; visibility graph analysis; quality analysis perception; visual quality analysis; density analysis; used streets; non-used streets; mission; vision; strategy; spatial interventions; BCG-matrix; star; cash cow; question mark; dog","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-05-12","Architecture","Urbanism","","Studio Urban Acupuncture","",""

(mentor); Schouten, A.C. (mentor)","2011","Endpoint stiffness is known to increase in the direction of instability during learning to accurately execute unstable motor tasks. Reflexes might be present in the time interval used for endpoint stiffness calculations suggesting a possible influence of reflexes on endpoint stiffness measurements. In addition, changes of reflexes during motor learning are still unknown. The purpose of this research was to investigate the separate contributions of intrinsic and reflexive stiffness to the observed change in endpoint stiffness during learning to move the hand in unstable force fields. A divergent (unstable) force field (DF) was applied with a two degrees of freedom manipulator (ARMANDA). Subjects performed 100 point-to-point arm movements in a null field and 300 point-to-point arm movements in the divergent force field holding the manipulator with their right hand. In random (catch) trials a minimum jerk position perturbation was applied in the middle of the movement. Force and EMG responses to the perturbation were used to examine endpoint stiffness and reflexes. Endpoint stiffness is defined as the force response to the imposed perturbation (in the interval 160-200 ms after perturbation onset) divided by the position displacement. Unperturbed trials were analyzed to investigate the decrease of errors (deviations from the straight path between start and target) and changes of co-contraction with motor learning. We found that errors decreased in the first 150 movements in the DF and leveled off from then on. Intrinsic, reflexive and endpoint stiffness were rapidly increased before the 35th DF trial. No significant changes of the stiffness parameters were found after this first learning period. An additional investigation of reflex response timing showed variability in the reflex timing between subjects. Reflexes were seen to influence the endpoint stiffness measurements for some subjects. In case of other subjects reflexes were not present in the time interval used for endpoint stiffness calculation and therefore no reflexive contribution to endpoint stiffness was assumed. In conclusion, our results showed a rapid increase of all stiffness parameters during the early phase of learning and suggest the involvement of other (unknown) mechanisms in the later learning phase. Because of the found variations in reflex response timing, we recommend to always include reflex analysis during endpoint stiffness measurements.","motor learning; endpoint stiffness; reflexes; co-contraction; unstable; force fields","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-05-02","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BM","",""

(mentor)","2011","The environmental impacts caused by suspended sediments are an important issue in the environmental impact assessment (EIA) of dredging and reclamation projects. This thesis is restricted to provide insight into the emission of suspended sediment particles due to the release of return water. This water is used to pump dredged material to the disposal area after which the excess water is released. Settling basins can be used to remove fines particles from the return water. The remaining concentration of suspended particles (outflow concentration) is hard to predict due to varying circumstances (e.g. wind, discharge and inflow concentration) and uncertainties in the settling process (e.g. agglomeration of clay particles). A probabilistic approach is a powerful method to incorporate these uncertainties. A probabilistic approach requires an efficient model that takes into account the relevant physical processes in a simplified way. A model is developed to simulated the transport of suspended sediment in the two dimensional vertical plane. Besides the turbulent mixing, processes as flocculation (agglomeration of clay particles) and secondary flow are included. This enables the model to provide realistic predictions of the concentration of suspended sediment in the vertical plane. The model is compared with measurement data and existing solutions which gives promising results. A probabilistic analysis of a case study provides insight into the main sources of uncertainty in the outflow concentration. Wind has a significant impact on the outflow concentration due to turbulent mixing and secondary flows. Furthermore, processes related to the clay particles (minimal settling velocity and flocculation) are very decisive. These parameters are proposed as calibration parameters. There appears to be an optimal basin depth. When the basin is deeper than this optimal basin depth, the positive effect of the longer residence time is eliminated by the larger turbulent mixing that is caused by the increased depth. By expressing the environmental risk of the contractor in a financial risk (fine or downtime), it is possible to determine an economic optimal design of a settling basin. This economic optimum is determined for both the basin depth and the discharge (the latter can be considered as the choice of equipment). The optimal choice of equipment is between the minimal production costs at an acceptable risk. For this risk, time effects and the time period over which the risk can be spread, play an important role. Finally, the profitability of wind protection for settling basins is investigated. This appears to be beneficial for the case study. The availability of a probabilistic model for determining the outflow concentration of settling basins offers interesting possibilities for a probabilistic analysis of environmental impacts of dredging and reclamation projects. This is because not only emissions are quantified but also insight is provided into the uncertainties and the sources of these uncertainties. This also enables the determination of an economically optimal design of a settling basin and provides insight in the associated financial risks.","environment; settling basins; probabilistic design; suspended sediment; return water","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-04-08","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

As complex geometry possibly leads to insurmountable problems or disproportionate high costs, realising a design may be reliant on rationalisation of the geometry. This means that embedding structural, manufacturing and construction aspects early on in the design process is of interest and is largely related to notions of surface rationalisation. A design approach is proposed which takes into account the definitions of rational surfaces with which initial design definitions can be transferred to rationalised designs with the aid of digital tools. Since they contain specific characteristics in relation to the integration of geometric design with manufacturability and constructability, the research focuses on parametric definitions of the rational surface class of developable surfaces. As such, the design approach is concentrated on using analytical logic of this surface class to inform the rationalisation design process whilst providing the designer with a certain design freedom. The digital design tools are developed as custom components for Grasshopper [1], a parametric plug-in of the 3D modelling software Rhinoceros.","developable surface; parametric design; geometry; rationalisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-04-15","Architecture","Building Technology","","Technical Design & Informatics","",""

Energy renovations in their houses are supposed to save money, improve the environment, improve the comfort of the house and the indoor air quality, but these benefits are not yet convincing enough to accept energy renovations. An energy efficient house is an intangible product that is not adopted easily by residents. In this graduation project, the factors behind the decision for energy renovations are explored. A method is made to explore the factors behind the acceptance of energy renovations in a neighborhood; knowledge, attitude and intention of residents.

The modules create easy assembling, maintenance and replacement of components. The two-piece columns are equipped with removable cover panels, which create access to the column spacious cavity. With these feature fasteners, cables and electronics are easily to conceal inside the column. The findings of the internal and external research have led to the list of demands and wishes, a strategy and a design vision for the creative process.

(mentor); Dodou, D. (mentor)","2011","Laparoscopic graspers require a high pinch force to generate sufficient friction force (grip) for tissue manipulation. Excessive or insufficient pinch forces distributed along the small contact area of laparoscopic graspers can cause damage and are one of the reasons why the risk of intraoperative complications during Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) procedures in the abdomen is 2-4 % higher compared to open surgery. The goal of this research was to develop and evaluate an 5 mm laparoscopic grasper, which has the same functionality (generated friction force, grasping time) as a conventional grasper for use on the intestine but which requires lower pinch force due to the use of adhesives. To lower the pinch force the adhesive component of the friction force was enlarged by introducing a muco-adhesive between tissue and grasper. To lower (local) high pressures a flat surface was used. Two experiments were conducted to find out in which direction the friction force generated by the adhesive film was the largest and to find the minimum required area of adhesive film to generate a force of 5 N. Next, a design for the tip and a design for the adhesive film feed mechanism was made. To evaluate the design a prototype was created, which was used to investigate whether the proposed tip design was able to generate a friction force of 5 N using a pinch force lower than 3 N. The prototype of the adhesive grasper was able to generate a friction force of 3.12 ± 0.58 N, while using a pinch force of 2.5 N. The generated friction force did not meet the goal of 5 N, but the concept of lowering the pinch force by introducing an adhesive layer is promising; the pinch force needed by the proposed tip is lower compared to existing graspers and the friction force was independent of the generated pinch force. The friction force can be increased further by developing a new adhesive film or by increasing the contact area.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-05-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

The emergence of such new markets requires the definition of new roles and responsibilities. Such a ‘market model’ describes the market roles (e.g. owner, operator etc) in terms of responsibilities and interactions between roles (processes). However, the development of an abstract market model for a future market is complicated since the dynamics of future markets are difficult to imagine, let alone understand. The use of simulation games is a proven method to deal with such complexities but is never applied on market model design. Here we report the complexity of and challenges to market model design based on expert interviews. Second, the novel E-CITY 2020 simulation game was developed to examine the contribution of gaming simulation to market model design for Dutch energy related markets. The game simulates a preferred market model for the charging infrastructure in a fictive city in 2020. E-CITY 2020 resulted in an increased insight in the dynamics and interactions in a new market from different perspectives (operator, customer, etc) for both designers and participants of the intervention. Second, we found that a gaming simulation creates a shared understanding of the future market model. Finally, we identified requirements for success for implementing the market model. In conclusion we find that simulation games are an effective tool to overcome complexities in market model development.

At the cost of increased wing weight, these devices are included in the wing to ensure safe takeoff and landing.

Therefore, multidisciplinary design considerations should already start in preliminary design phase. Up to now the focus of high-lift flow-physics research has been mainly on the creation of high-fidelity aerodynamic analysis methods which are not applicable to early aircraft design stages. The increase in computational power in the last decade allows both a shift of design methodologies from empirical to computational methods and a more extensive incorporation of disciplines other than aerodynamics. The goal of this thesis is to present an initial solution to the requirement for improved high-lift system representations on preliminary design level. Structural and aerodynamic disciplines are jointly considered in the developed high-lift system analysis tool. First, a literature research is conducted considering high-lift device characteristics, parametric modelling techniques and possible aerodynamic calculation methods. Herewith a theoretical basis for development of the analysis tool is obtained. Based on the outcomes of an existing structural model generator, a link is established to a low-fidelity aerodynamic vortex-lattice calculation method. Obtained wing loads are thereafter applied at the structural wing representation to acquire stress and displacement distributions. Knowing these, an aeroelastic coupling method is established and extended with a structural sizing routine. Aerodynamic results are validated using existing data of the Fokker-100 wing. Finally, an application of the routine is shown by performing initial structural sizing of a forward-swept wing including a trailing edge flap. The aeroelastic analysis tool developed during this thesis provides a solid basis for enhancement of the understanding of interconnections and sensitivities between the aerodynamic and structural disciplines involved in preliminary high-lift device design. Although the initial results of the analysis tool are quite promising, extension of the aerodynamic analysis method, as well as incorporation of additional modelling capabilities are required for the methodology to become generally applicable.","aeroelastic analysis; high-lift devices; parametric modeling; rapid load estimation; vortex-lattice method; structural sizing; preliminary design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Design, Integration & Operations","","","",""

(mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor); Den Heijer, C. (mentor); Maertens, J. (mentor)","2011","In JUMELET [2010] a method with a physical basis (so called “Volume Exchange model”) to determine the ‘notional’ permeability coefficient P was developed. The ‘notional’ permeability coefficient was previously introduced in the stability formula of the armour layer; see VAN DER MEER [1988]. In this latter study this coefficient was empirically based for three different structures. Due to the limited validity it is difficult to apply a coefficient for different breakwater configurations. The Volume Exchange model determines the influence of the core permeability by computing the difference between the surface wave run-up on an impermeable core and a permeable core. The volume of water that flows into the core causes a reduction of the wave run-up. Reduction of the wave run-up is not only caused by infiltration, but also by the slope surface roughness and energy dissipation inside the pores of the armour layer. To investigate the influence of the above three mentioned factors physical model tests have been conducted. The tests were carried out in the wave flume in the water laboratory at Delft University of Technology. On four different configurations (smooth impermeable slopes, rough impermeable slope, armour layer on an impermeable core and permeable core) tests were conducted. In the analysis of the results the influence of the surface roughness, energy dissipation in the pores of the armour layer and the reduction of the surface wave run-up due to the inflow into the core could be determined. Besides, the surface wave run-up also the wave run-up on the core is measured. The results showed that the slope surface roughness has no influence on the wave run-up, when the waves are of the surging breaker type. Also, the surface wave run-up is not reduced by a permeable core. Wave run-up measurements showed the same wave run-up height for armour layers on an impermeable and a permeable core. Wave run-up on the core showed a considerable difference between run-up on an impermeable core and a permeable core. Therefore, in the Volume Exchange model the wave run-up on the core should be considered. The adjusted Volume Exchange model is used to determine a formula for the permeability coefficient. This has led to the conclusion that the permeability coefficient is dependent on the Iribarren number and the structural configurations and /or properties.","breakwater; core permeability; notional permeability; wave run-up; Volume Exchange model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","Lifting patients is a demanding task for care providers. In addition, the number of patients is rising and the number of people with obesity is expanding. Current lifting aids are single purpose and time consuming to use. Exoskeletons can fulfill the demand for a versatile and easy to use lifting aid. A drawback of a typical exoskeleton is that in order to function correctly the axes need to be aligned to the human joints, which is time consuming. Furthermore, an exoskeleton for healthcare must reduce the reaction forces in the user while lifting. It is chosen to design an exoskeleton, which requires no adjustment and can cope with power enhancement. The goal of this paper is to design an exoskeleton that is fast, easy to use and reduces the reaction forces in the user. A design is proposed which easily fits different sized users. In addition the reaction forces in the human skeleton are eliminated. The model is tested by means of a demonstrator. Elastic tension elements are used as a gravity compensator. By reducing the potential energy fluctuation the required external input is reduced. Optimizing a number of design parameters leads to a calculated moment reduction of 98.8% and moment fluctuation reduction of 96.8%. This is the first exoskeleton to combine fast to use design with high-energy efficiency gravity compensation.","exoskeleton; passive adaptation; power enhancement; lifting aid","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-05-31","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

(mentor)","2011","World’s largest urban growth is taking place in Sub Saharan Africa. As a result, the demand for mobility is increasing. However, the supply of urban infrastructure is low. This is causing mobility problems, such as congestion. Improvements are possible by building new infrastructure. This is a long term, complex and expensive solution. A short term solution is to improve the traffic management to maximize the use of existing infrastructure. Intersections can be considered as the bottlenecks of the urban traffic flows. In order to maximize the use of existing infrastructure, it is useful to quantify the influences of the different factors on the intersection flow. Numerous scientists have studied the traffic flow at intersections in both developed countries and developing countries; however, no study about a city in Sub Saharan Africa could be found. The goal of this research is the development of a simulation model that describes the traffic flows at the intersections of Africa Avenue in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The aim of the model is to perform ex ante assessment of different flow improvement strategies. Lanes at three traffic intersections (both officer controlled and signal controlled) were studied during times of congestion. 6573 vehicles were observed, from which 76% were passenger cars, 21% were minibuses and 2% were heavy vehicles. The average queue discharge flow for the straight through traffic was significantly lower than the saturation flow for the same conditions. These were 1358 Passenger Car Units per hour per lane (PCU/h/ln) and 1522 PCU/h/ln respectively. It appeared that the total flow at the studied interfering lanes at the intersection depends on the share of minibuses, the share of slow vehicles, the number of lanes per approach and the productivity of the type of control. An officer controlled intersection was used as a case study for to flow improvement. Installing traffic responsive signals showed the potential to increase the interference flow. To reach a high productivity with signal control, thorough studies by specialists are needed. However, as a result of the chaotic traffic behavior it is not sure whether the signal settings can be tuned such that signal control results in an improvement compared to officer control. Simple, low-cost and effective solutions with a high certainty appears possible to improve the productivity of officer control. The flow at the studied interfering lanes is expected to increase with 6.4% compared to the current 2275 PCU/h. To cope with a large expected growth in traffic demand, maximizing the use of existing infrastructure will not be enough. A combination with broader solutions - such as extra infrastructure and coordinated traffic control - is difficult to realize but essential. Further research is needed to determine what the effects of broader solutions will be and how these measures can be implemented successfully.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and transport technology","","Transporttechnology","",""

(mentor); Bakker, C. (mentor)","2011","One could say that product development is unsustainable by nature. However, during innovation processes there are many opportunities for more sustainable practices. Although enterprises and design agencies might feel the urge to contribute in this field, it is a complex issue to deal with. There is no step-by-step approach, no guideline that is useful for every case, and no method that can be blindly applied to in every innovation process. Many design agencies and enterprises are faced with difficulties in translating their ambitions into clear targets. Making your ambitions explicit by formulating sustainability targets is especially important when other parties are involved in the innovation process. Explicit sustainability targets could be a key element in reaching levels of ambition toward sustainability, for both entrepreneurs as well as designers. So far, only limited research has been done to understand the role of sustainability targets within this field. Not much is known about the process in which sustainability targets are set, the actual formulation, and the way they are used throughout new product development processes. Therefore, the aim of this research is to gain more insight in the translations of sustainability ambitions into workable targets. This research is conducted in cooperation with BNO and Syntens and contributes to the knowledgebase of the ‘Groene Offerte’ - a BNO initiative. The methodology employed in this study is of qualitative nature. The study consists of a literature review and evaluation of twelve sustainable projects executed by Dutch design agencies namely, Bluelarix, BPO, BTM, Butterfly Works, Fabrique, IDEAL&CO, LSDP, Npk design, Spark, Springtime, Waacs, and We Are Perspective. These cases were selected to assure a broad sample, in order to increase diversity of insights. Findings were generated by conducting semi-structured interviews with representatives of these design agencies. For each company one or two representatives were interviewed, with varying roles within their respective agency. The cases were analyzed individually as well as compared to each other to be able to identify themes, and to gain insights into the role of ambition levels of the individual agencies as well as into general tendencies in the design industry. The first research question is a description of the focus area related to sustainable development per individual design agency. Per agency the focus on the challenges linked to people, planet and profit aspects, is explained based on their general strategies and/or by discussing a detailed design process. From these combined individual descriptions insight was generated on the second research question; in what way are design agencies engaged in achieving positive social and environmental impact. In order to describe engagement in sustainability, seven themes were extracted from the data: 1) Employee Commitment, Acquisition & Initiatives, Client-based Projects, Tools & Procedures, Knowledge Network, Resource Investments, External Communication. Throughout the interviews and the analysis of the projects described it became clear that sustainability targets are seldom formulated in a brief. Sustainability targets are developed throughout the design process and are not formalized but are directly considered and evaluated during decision processes. In client-based projects both client and designer can assume a proactive role in emphasizing sustainability targets during the design process. If sustainability ambitions are communicated before the initiation of any innovation project, they are always only giving direction to the focus of the design efforts. Target formulation and securing these targets, is never made explicit. However, on the bright side, due to the open character of the design brief in innovation projects with external design agency involvement, there is much room for the design agency to realize their own sustainability ambition. In the cases analyzed in this research assignment no pattern could be found of either the client or the agency being the dominant force behind addressing sustainability targets.","sustainability; innovation; targets","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Broere, W. (mentor); Dijkstra, J. (mentor); Heeres, O. (mentor)","2011","The last years several offshore wind farms have been completed. Such farms typically consist of a few dozen wind turbines. The majority of these wind turbines is founded on mono-piles with a diameter of 4–5 m and is designed according to standards that use the p-y method for lateral loading conditions. However, this p-y method is not validated for such diameter piles. Full-scale field tests and model pile tests with properly scaled stress conditions subjected to lateral loads are scarce. This Thesis investigates the effect of a diameter increase on the lateral bearing capacity of 2.2 m and 4.4 m diameter mono-piles in dry sand. Static displacement controlled and one-way cyclic force controlled model pile load tests were performed using the Delft University of Technology geotechnical centrifuge. Results show that the smaller 2.2 m diameter pile has a lower secant and tangent soil- pile stiffness when compared to the 4.4 m diameter pile. In all cases the tangent stiffness is about 50% higher than the secant stiffness. Also, a force acting higher above soil surface yields a lower initial system stiffness. Results furthermore show that an increase in pile diameter with a constant slenderness or L/D-ratio, relative density Id and load excentricity e, leads to a significant increase in static lateral capacity. The secant and tangent stiffness also significantly increase with increasing diameter. The accumulation of lateral pile displacements as function of the number of applied one-way cyclic lateral loads has been investigated using 500 force controlled cycles. For an increasing number of load cycles the pile head displacements increase whilst the rate of accumulation decreases. However, additional loading cycles, up to e.g. 100000, are recommended. For static loading conditions experimental results have been compared to the default API formulation for laterally loaded piles. This default formulation shows a significant overestimation of the initial stiffness. However, after incorporating a stress dependent secant stiffness E50, which has been derived from triaxial compression tests on model sand, good agreement is found between the experimental results and the modified API formulation for pile displacements <0.1D. For displacements of about 0.05D the modified p-y method underestimates the lateral bearing capacity of the 4.4 m diameter pile by up to 25. Further research with loading conditions that mimic field loading conditions and a sample with a higher initial density are recommended. It is also recommended to im- prove the current set-up using better load control and a larger strongbox and to perform additional model pile tests on saturated samples.","lateral loads; p-y method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geotechnology","","Geo-Engineering","",""

(mentor); Blom, C.B.M. (mentor); Bakker, K.J. (mentor)","2011","With the introduction of the Eurocode, different formulas are used for shear tests in concrete structures than the previous Dutch standard.These formulas are often used in new building designs. If the result compared with the Dutch standard is either favorable or unfavorable, the design should be modified. It is interesting to research the impact of new formulas applied to existing structures. In certain situations the structural safety has to be reviewed and the use of Eurocode could apply. This research compares four methods of calculation for the shear test in an existing immersed tunnel. The four methods of calculation are based on the Dutch standard, the Eurocode, the IBBC method and a finite element calculation with the program Atena. In addition also the effects of fire on the shear test are considered. The reference project is the Maastunnel, the oldest immersed tunnel in the Netherlands. To compare the different methods properly a unity check is used. The load on the structure is divided by the maximum load that the structure can bear. The construction is safe when the unity check is less than 1. By the results of the unity check it is possible to draw conclusions about the safety of the construction according to the different methods. The most critical parts of the structure are near the corners in the roof. Three methods meet the requirements of the shear test and therefore show that the construction is safe, only the Eurocode does not. Calculations with Atena shows that the construction has a unity check of 0,4 (safe) and more important, shear failure is not dominant. The shear test for the current immersed Maastunnel results in roughly the same safety features for the current Dutch standards, the IBBC formulation and the finite element method in Atena. The shear test by the new Eurocode shows a clearly lower safety. Main reason is that according to Eurocode, the contribution of the strength of concrete and reinforcing steel should not be added. For the authors of the Eurocode, testing of existing structures was not the starting point. The finite element method shows that the vault function has a major influence on the ultimate failure behavior. If an arch can occur, the shear strength would increase significantly. The shear strength is strongly influenced by the geometry of the corner of the roof. A frequently used general formulation for the shear tests, results in the use of tests which are not designed specifically for the type of construction. This may result in an unnecessarily amount of reserve, while construction is actually stronger than predicted by the test. The influence of fire on the shear test is limited if the structure can deform. Even if splashing of concrete occurs, a vault can add significant strength. It is shown that prevented deformation has a major influence on the shear test. For tunnels a certain degree of foreclosure cannot be neglected. The assumption that the tunnel deformation by fire is completely forbidden, will require too conservative results. It is therefore recommended to examine the foreclosure rate in order to calculate the additional internal forces.","shear; fire; immersed tunnel; vault; arc; Atena; Eurocode; IBBC method; Dutch standard","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Hydraulic Structures","",""

(mentor)","2011","In recent years, the embedded pile model has been successfully implemented in PLAXIS 3D. The embedded pile consists of beam elements connecting to the surrounding soil by means of special interfaces (skin interface and foot interface). Although the embedded pile doesn’t take into account volume, a particular elastic region around the pile whose dimension is equivalent to the pile diameter is assumed in which plastic behavior is neglected. This makes the embedded pile almost behave like the volume pile. Therefore, it may be said that the embedded pile model is considered as a ‘simplified’ model of the volume pile. Although the embedded pile is a relatively new feature, it has been validated by comparisons with the volume pile as well as with measurements from real tests. The finding shows that the embedded pile is not only in good agreement with the volume pile, but also able to resemble the real pile behavior. However these validations are only considered in terms of axial loading (compression loading and tension loading). Therefore it’s questionable whether the embedded pile also shows a good performance in the situation of being subjected to lateral loading. In order to answer this question, this thesis is aimed to give a validation of the embedded pile for lateral loading caused by external forces as well as soil movements in embankment applications. This validation is firstly made in PLAXIS imaginary models (a ‘simplified’ model as considered in Chapter 3 and ‘advanced’ models as considered in Chapter 4) and then in a PLAXIS model of a real case study as considered in Chapter 5.","Plaxis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geotechnology","","Geo-Engineering","",""

(mentor); Oey, M.A. (mentor); Kortmann, L.J. (mentor); De Vries, L.J. (mentor)","2011","Technical, social and environmental developments are driving energy system stakeholders to reexamine how their energy needs are met. The conventional method of building large centralized generators to meet a community's energy needs is being questioned as smaller energy sources become more efficient and economical. These smaller sources, commonly referred to as distributed generators (DG), have the potential to transform the structure in which energy is produced, distributed and consumed in a community. The research presented here looks at how the decisions and interactions among diverse household energy consumers shape their community's energy system evolution after DG is introduced. To gain a deeper understanding of this transition a model is designed to explore the relationship that social and environmental factors have on the deployment of DG. The development of the model is approached from the perspective of design science research which forms the structure of this report. Agent-based modeling is the methodology used in the analysis since the nature of the system under study evolves through the interactions among diverse consumers. The model is positioned to be able to explore how factors like demand, product preference and pollution concerns can impact the market share of DG in the next 20 years. It does this by comparing the diffusion of DG technologies in competition with electricity supplied by conventional sources on the grid. The input parameters for the model are throughly grounded in the latest research on energy systems to give relevancy to the results. The consumer agents in the model each have attributes that concern how they satisfy four different needs related to cost, environment, social identity and technology preference. The decision making of an agent is governed by their relative uncertainty surrounding how their energy source is helping to meet these needs. The results demonstrate that there is a relationship between social and environmental criteria on the deployment of DG. This is done by using the model to perform what-if evaluations of energy system developments across uncertain futures and to explore the drivers behind the changes. Factors like peer group size are shown to influence rates of adoption. Consumers with strong product preferences or environmental concerns are found to be unswayed by price concerns or the decisions of their peers in choosing their energy sources. The simulations show the differences in energy source choices across a range of energy price and economic development scenarios while accounting for a consumers' economic, environmental and social network situations and product preferences.","distributed generation; energy forecasting; agent-based modeling; consumer behavior; product deployment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Systems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","De Maas kent een aantal waterbouwkundige kunstwerken die het einde van hun ontwerp levensduur van 50 tot 100 jaar naderen. Het is daardoor van belang te bepalen wat de huidige conditie van de kunstwerken is om de betrouwbaarheid van de Maascorridor te waarborgen. Om de huidige conditie van de kunstwerken te bepalen, dienen de constructieve elementen conform de voorschriften getoetst te worden. De uitkomst van de toetsing van een elementen geeft aan of het element wel of niet voldoet aan de voorschriften. Het resultaat zegt niks over de betrouwbaarheid van een element. Het doel van het onderzoek is: Het komen tot een algemene relatie tussen de “Unity Check” van onderdelen van natte kunstwerken en de faalkansen, dat uiteindelijk voor elk onderdeel toegepast kan worden, om zo tot een nauwkeurige faalkans voor de corridor te komen die op een snelle manier toegepast kan worden. In dit onderzoek wordt uiteindelijk gewerkt vanuit de basis van de relatie naar de relatie voor een aantal case studies. Voor het modelleren van de case studies moeten de kansverdelingen met bijbehorende verdelingsparameters voor de stochastische variabelen bepaald worden. Voor en deel van de stochastische variabelen is in het verleden al onderzoek naar gedaan. De sterkte van materiaal en afwijkingen in de dimensies zijn variabelen waarvoor al onderzoek is gedaan, maar belastingen zijn erg situatie afhankelijk, waardoor hiervoor in dit onderzoek extra aandacht aan besteed is. In dit onderzoek zijn voor twee stuwen in de Maas een aantal stalen en op druk belaste betonnen elementen als case studies genomen. De uitkomsten van de probabilistische berekeningen (uitgedrukt in betrouwbaarheidindices) zijn vergeleken met de unity checks van de elementen. De resultaten zijn gecategoriseerd om uiteindelijk de betrouwbaarheidsindex voor de unity check te kunnen bepalen.","unity check; faalkans; stuwen; betrouwbaarheidsindex; probabilistisch","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","",""
