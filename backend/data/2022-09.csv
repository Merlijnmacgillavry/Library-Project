(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","This study builds upon the existing work on futurizing the ecoinvent database at the service of the prospective LCA method that requires a temporally matched foreground and background system. It is a first effort in modelling future scenarios of Industrial Process Heat (IPH) generation using projections from the IMAGE Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) following the SSP2-baseline, SSP2-RCP2.6 and SSP2- RCP1.9 scenarios from 2020 to 2050. These scenarios are then implemented in the ecoinvent database (version 3.8, cut-off) and used to quantify the environmental impacts of generating 1MJ of IPH across four markets in twenty-six regions for three different scenarios. The markets under study are chemicals, food and tobacco, pulp and paper, while the rest of the sectors without cement and steel are grouped under the “other industries” category, as per IMAGE classification. We quantify and analyze the climate change impact and cumulative decarbonization potential of the future IPH generation markets across sectors and regions. Furthermore, we quantify their performance across fifteen additional impact categories to check for potential burden shift. On top of IMAGE projections, we also explore whether coupling CHP with CCS impacts our results.<br/><br/>By 2050, even in the best-case scenario (SSP2-RCP1.9), fossil fuels are still expected to be responsible for the generation of 48% of the global IPH demand for food and tobacco, 51.4% for the Other industries category, 64% for chemicals and 88% for pulp and paper. Nevertheless, heat from coal is expected to reduce its share in the global IPH generation market mixes in a range of -56% to -95% across sectors, being one of the main reasons why climate change impact shows a decrease in the range of 31-60% across sectors when compared to the baseline (pulp and paper: -31%, food and tobacco: -57%, Other industries: -60%, chemicals: -34%).<br/><br/>By 2050, in the best-case scenario, the direct combustion of biomass is expected to supply 25% of the global IPH demand for food and tobacco and 20.8% of the global IPH demand for other industries category. Biofuels are expected to provide 1/3 of the IPH demand in the chemicals sector with little impact on climate change but at the cost of contributing with a significant share in other environmental impact categories such as marine eutrophication (63.4%), terrestrial eutrophication (57.8%), non-carcinogenic human toxicity (70.2%), land use (98%), water use (91.8%) and minerals depletion (80.6%). Electrification is expected to take a more prominent role mainly in food and tobacco and other industries sectors offsetting emissions by -9.07% and -13.7% but at the cost of increasing the ionising radiation impact from electricity production.<br/><br/>The results from the other environmental categories highlight a decrease in impacts across most of the environmental impact categories except for land use, ionising radiation, water use and minerals depletion, which emphasized the potential burden shift that the decarbonization efforts may cause.<br/> <br/><br/><br/>Our results also show that the most optimal outcomes are received when the decarbonization of the heat supply is combined with the demand reduction. The demand reduction across sectors as well as the respective decarbonization of IPH generation market mixes, results in a cumulative decarbonization potential of 85.78 Gt CO2-eq. (RCP2.6) and 105.29 Gt CO2-eq. (RCP1.9).<br/><br/>Implementing CHP with CCS is beneficial to climate change but may decline the improvement potential for many impact categories compared to when CHP is not coupled with CCS.<br/><br/>By 2050, the highest emitters of CO2-Eq. emissions are the regions that drive the global IPH demand: China (CHN), India (INDIA), Middle East (ME), USA and Western Europe (WEU), responsible for at least 70% of the global carbon footprint across scenarios.<br/><br/>This study is the first trial of this sort, and as a consequence, there is a lot of potential for improvement of future IPH generation scenarios, which requires further research for the following aspects:<br/><br/>• Enriching IMAGE projections with shares of conversion technologies for IPH generation<br/>• Enriching the ecoinvent database with lifecycle inventories of cleaner heat generation technologies<br/>• Enriching IMAGE with projections for renewable heat sources and cleaner fuels for IPH generation<br/>• Enriching IMAGE scenarios with projections on GHG emissions reductions for IPH generation as well as projections on CCS implementation for IPH generation<br/>• Disaggregating the “Other Industries” category<br/>• Improving ecoinvent lifecycle inventories for the manufacturing processes in the most carbon- intensive industries that do not disaggregate fuels used for IPH generation versus feedstocks<br/><br/>Considering the data scarcity, time limitations and unresolved uncertainties, it is essential to treat these results as potential future trends rather than in absolute terms.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

(graduation committee); Koopmans, Rimmer (graduation committee); Huizer, Sebastian (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","River dikes in the eastern part of the Netherlands are characterized by a relatively low daily water table. In the unsaturated zone above the water table, a negative pore pressure (matric suction) is present that binds the soil particles together. Suction can be especially large in soils with small grains, such as clay, and increases the strength of a soil due to higher effective stress. High suction in soils has been proven to significantly increase the stability of dikes. However, due to water level variations and other climatic influences such as precipitation and evapotranspiration, suction in a dike will vary over the year and throughout the cross section. The research described in this report aims at evaluating whether there are parts of a cross-section of a dike where soil suction remains throughout a high water event in a river such that an increase in the strength of the soil can be used in stability analyses. The analysis is centered around a case study of an existing dike in the east of the Netherlands and uses time-dependent unsaturated groundwater flow models to simulate the spatially and temporally varying suction for a number of different initial conditions and climatic influences defined by scenarios. The results show that it is very unlikely that suction in the dike will be lost during the summer months. Due to high evapotranspiration, the water content in the dike is low, which results in a lower water table during a high water event and less infiltration in the dike occurs during precipitation. During winter, the probability that suction is lost throughout the dike cross-section is larger and will occur after heavy precipitation with a long duration where the return period is 1 – 10 years. Although in most scenarios some suction will remain present, the amount of suction during the winter is generally low, between 0.5 and 1 meter, which results in an apparent cohesion of 2 – 4 kPa. A simple stability calculation illustrates that the increase in strength in the dike due to suction does not result in a significant increase in the stability of the dike during high water conditions.","Suction; Unsaturated Zone; Dike; macro stability; apparent cohesion; transient flow; Unsaturated flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","51.971375, 5.965101"

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a motor neuron disease that is characterized by the degeneration of upper and lower motor neuron (UMN, LMN). A defining feature of ALS is its heterogeneous presentation, with varying sites of disease onset and progression rate. Diagnosing ALS requires the observation of both UMN and LMN degeneration in multiple regions of the body. Signs of UMN degeneration are difficult to observe in ALS. The goal of this study was to determine if reflexive parameters were related to UMN dysfunction in ALS patients. <br/><br/>Methods: A robot applied continuous torque perturbations to the right wrist of the subjects. Subject were asked to perform 4 different tasks, each provoking different control strategies. Closed-loop system identification was used to estimate the joint dynamics. A neuromuscular model was then fitted to the estimated joint dynamics to express the contribution of intrinsic and reflexive pathways in physiologically relevant parameters.<br/><br/>Results: We show that patients are able to alter their joint dynamics in order to comply with the tasks. During the relax task patients had visibly higher admittance than controls, in the active tasks the patients were able to lower their admittance similar as controls. Patients with pathologically increased reflexes had significantly increased reflexive feedback during the force tasks compared to controls. <br/><br/>Conclusion: In this study we have demonstrated the ability of neuromechanical parameters to detect hyperreflexia in patients diagnosed in ALS. Therefore the proposed method of closed-loop system identification and parameters estimation could be used to monitor the progression of ALS.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Teuwen, Julie J.E. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The growing demand for renewable energy has led to significant developments in wind turbine technology. The ever increasing size of turbine blades and their exposure to a variety of environmental factors can affect their annual energy production and service life. Erosion caused by rainfall and hailstones is identified as two of the most detrimental types of environmental factors to the life of a turbine blade. Hailstone impact in particular is expected to affect the aerodynamic profile of the leading edge as well as cause significant damage to the composite substrate. <br/><br/>The aim of this research study is to investigate the effect of varying hailstone sizes on the damage mode in leading edge polyurethane coated composites subjected to hail impact. The coated glass fibre composite samples were experimentally tested using an impact gas cannon. The impact parameters were determined based on real-life scenarios of blade tip speeds and hailstone sizes. Simulated hail ice (SHI) were manufactured using de-ionized water to form monolithic ice spheres. SHI of 15 mm and 20 mm diameter were used in the research for conducting the hail impact experiments. The coated composite samples were evaluated using non-contact profilometry (optical microscopy) and non-destructive testing (ultrasonic c-scan). Observations revealed that the polyurethane coatings remain largely intact throughout the hail impacts and no visible sign of damage or delamination between the coating and substrate was noticed during damage analysis. The damage mode of matrix cracks in the substrate for the impact parameters used, remained the same for both hailstone sizes. Further, it was seen over the experiments that there exists a failure threshold energy (FTE) for each hailstone size and sample thickness, below which no surface/sub-surface damage is visible. It is hypothesized based on observations in literature that a smaller hailstone will have a lower FTE compared to a larger hailstone and will be more lethal, owing to the concentrated area of contact. Future research to develop further awareness of damage evolution in the coated composites is recommended and discussed.","Hail; Impact; Composites; Wind Turbine Blade","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

During this time public and private transportation activities were limited, economic activities came to a standstill and healthcare resources were redistributed. India’s healthcare system faced problems prior to the COVID-19 pandemic such as insufficient availability, suboptimal healthcare services and high out-of-pocket expenditures. The exponential rise in patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated existing problems in the Indian healthcare system while introducing new ones. Realizing optimal care during the health crisis became more challenging as the focus was on mitigating the spread of the virus. The absent of public transportation and the pressure on healthcare resources impacted the healthcare accessibility of different demographic groups. During this study we assessed how access to healthcare was influenced due to the policy interventions that were meant to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. The hypothesis is that healthcare access for different demographic groups was negatively impacted by the policies meant to curb the spread. In order to analyse the impact, we performed a case study in the state of Goa using the Network-based Health Accessibility Index Method (NHAIM). This gravitational model allows us to study the spatial distribution of healthcare resources in the state of Goa. Based on our findings we can conclude that healthcare access is unevenly distributed in the state of Goa. Furthermore, we concluded that there is no significant correlation between healthcare availability and the urban and rural mortality rate for the state of Goa. However, there is a significantly strong positive correlation between geographical healthcare access and the urban and rural mortality for the state of Goa.<br","healthcare accessibility; COVID-19; Spatial distribution","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

(mentor); Chan, P.W.C. (graduation committee); Feijen, Bram (graduation committee); Woolley, Mark (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Container terminals are critical infrastructure for the economy, and the need to digitalize is felt in the industry. One solution is to combine digital integration and process automation with a digital twin. This is an ideal tool to identify weaknesses and opportunities in the operations of a container terminal. However, digital twins are often developed for a single terminal with unique characteristics, which means that the tool cannot be easily scaled to other sites. To optimize operations at multiple container terminals, it is necessary to explore how the twin can be scaled. Such a strategy for scaling digital twins at container terminals cannot be found in literature. Therefore, this research aims to fill this gap by developing a criteria-based roadmap for the senior management of global container terminals. The scaling strategy focuses on scaling up to multiple locations instead of scaling out to several processes on the same terminal.<br/><br/>After a detailed review of the literature and conducting interviews, the main findings were combined into design criteria for the roadmap. The three phases for the timeline are shown as three columns in the roadmap. The phases are 'developing the digital twin', 'using the digital twin' and 'scaling the use of the digital twin'. Most used in transformation projects is the People, Process and Technology (PPT) framework, so people (key actors), process (operations and strategy) and technology (data, hardware and software) are the three themes and shown as rows in the roadmap.<br/><br/>When all criteria were established and the roadmap template was designed, the logical steps of the roadmap were identified for each of the three phases. These steps were complemented and validated to see if important information was missing. For each step, it was determined which themes (people, process and technology) were applicable. After the first design, several interviews with experts from the container terminal industry were conducted to validate the roadmap. Based on their feedback, the roadmap was improved. Six stages were added to the final phase to emphasize the scaling phase. Each stage describes an essential element for scaling up and it is important to understand these to establish successful scaling procedures.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the roadmap developed in this study is useful for container terminals looking to scale up digital twins. It provides insight into the steps required to develop, use, and ultimately deploy digital twins on a larger scale. Especially for terminals that have no experience with such projects, it serves as a starting point to define the strategy and free up resources within the organization. Because the roadmap was developed at a strategic level, not all steps are very detailed, so an organization will need to do further research to determine its strategy. Each organization can determine for itself which steps are familiar and which steps require more attention. Therefore, this roadmap serves as a solid starting point for senior management looking to scale digital twin solutions.","Digital Twin; Container terminals; Scaling; Roadmap; Digitalization; Research through Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Monna, Bert (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","CubeSats have risen in popularity since its first launch in the year 2003. The low mass, lower launch cost, lower development cost, possibility for piggyback with larger satellites and lower development time involved compared to larger satellites have opened them to be commercialised by private companies. In contrast to being used for educational, research and technology demonstration purposes in their early years, they are now used for varied applications such as communications, Earth observation, military surveillance, in-orbit manufacturing, asteroid exploration, Internet-of-things and interplanetary exploration missions. Their lucrative features make them favourable over their larger counterparts. As a result, they are predicted to launch in higher numbers in the coming years, considering their preference for missions involving constellations or distributed space systems. This trend of increasing demand for CubeSats and their application in advanced missions requires more electrical power for their operation. The increased electrical power demand can be solved using a Solar Array Drive Mechanism. The SADM allows relative rotary motion of the solar arrays with respect to the satellite structure so that the solar panels are always perpendicularly positioned to the Sun independent of the payload pointing requirements. They can produce up to 185% more power than the panels just deployed in the case of a 3U CubeSat. Only a handful of six such SADM products were found in the commercial market, and four of them had a very similar design that drove two solar arrays and could be used in limited panel mounting configurations. A need in the commercial market for a SADM system that is modular and scalable was identified. Space mechanisms such as the SADM were found to be one of the major causes of mission failure after communications and unknown causes. It was found that tribological elements were the prominent root cause of such space mechanism failure. A research gap was identified to find the root causes of tribological failure in space mechanisms and design a SADM system that minimises failure caused due to tribological elements. This thesis has succeeded in designing a SADM that is scalable to multiple sizes of CubeSats (3U to 12U), applicable to more than three panel mounting configurations that were possible with the existing SADM and minimising failure chances due to tribological elements. The current SADM has minimised the chances of failure due to common tribological elements such as roller bearings and sliprings by eliminating the cause of failure. This includes eliminating rolling elements, liquid lubricants and metals in the case of bearings and a novel power and data transfer mechanism alternative to sliprings called ""Flex-wrap"" has been designed in this project. The current SADM is the smallest in the market in dimensions (70x50x6.9 mm) and applies to 5 different solar array mounting configurations.","Mechanism Design; tribology; Solar power; CubeSat; Mechatronic System Design; Systems engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-10-01","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

To design the monopile foundation and to accurately define the dynamic response of an OWT, the soil-monopile-superstructure interaction should be modelled properly. Due to the fact that the Three-Dimensional (3D) Finite Element (FE) analyses are complex and computationally expensive, research is focused on One-Dimensional (1D) FE models, in which the soil-monopile interaction is traditionally described via distributed translational springs representing the soil lateral load. Nevertheless, the increase of monopile diameter, followed by the monopile length-to-diameter ratio (L/D) decrease, implies the contribution of additional resistant components such as distributed moment, base shear and moment.<br/><br/>This thesis examines the 3D mechanisms to be accounted for in the 1D FE modelling of the soil-monopile-superstructure seismic response in case of a single-phased, linear visco-elastic soil layer. Both 3D and 1D FE analyses are conducted with the FE software OpenSees. The 1D analyses are simulated in two consecutive steps: first a Site Response Analysis is performed, next the recorded displacements over the soil layer depth are applied to the spring supports and the dynamic interaction of the system is simulated. Three different monopiles are considered with L/D equal to 26, 9 and 5. Two superstructures are examined, which are modelled as Single-Degree-of-Freedom systems. Distributed translational springs are assigned to the slender monopile (L/D=26), while for the stubbier monopiles the contribution of distributed rotational springs is examined as well. Lastly, the effect of considering the base moment and shear is also examined.<br/><br/>The stiffness of the soil reaction curves is calibrated by applying a monotonic lateral load and moment at the pile head, in case of the translational and rotational springs, respectively. The spring stiffness values are assumed uniform along the monopile length. As a next step, the dynamic response of the calibrated 1D models is examined in steady-state conditions, under the action of mono-harmonic excitation, and compared to the 3D results. Ultimately, the seismic response of the 1D models is examined in case of two earthquake excitations with different frequency contents.<br/><br/>In case of the monopiles with L/D=9 and 5, it is concluded that the use of monotonically-calibrated distributed translational and rotational springs provides a good match between 3D and 1D regarding the monopile head and superstructure response under seismic loading. Nevertheless, these 1D FE models cannot predict the base moment, for which a base rotational spring should be employed. In case of the stubbier monopile, with L/D=5, the base shear seems to positively affect the moment profile as well. Lastly, regarding the monopile with L/D=26, the employment of translational springs alone seems sufficient for the accurate prediction of the seismic response; however, the hereby monotonically-calibrated distributed translational springs result in a mismatch between 3D and 1D.<br","Monopile foundation; Offshore Wind Turbine; Winkler foundation; 1D Finite Element Modelling; Seismic response; Dynamic interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

(mentor); Veer, F.A. (graduation committee); Ten Brincke, Erwin (graduation committee); Noteboom, C. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Flat glass is a material which is used extensively in almost all the buildings, mainly as infill for windows or facade panels. However, neither glass production nor its recycling are sustainable processes, as both incorporate the use of gas furnaces, which produce high amounts of CO2 emissions. Thus, the re-use of glass seems the only way to minimize the environmental impact of this material.<br/><br/>The greatest challenge in the safe reuse of glass elements lies in the assessment of their strength after several years of use. This strength is reduced, compared to the inert strength, due to the damage (""defects"") that the environment inevitably introduces into the glass surface. According to the Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM), one of the defects in a stressed brittle material, which in this case is glass, will initiate the failure. Therefore, in order to assess the residual strength of weathered glass, it is essential to quantify it in terms of defects. The aim of this thesis is to develop the understanding on the performance of weathered glass, and to propose a methodology for the prediction of its residual strength, based on its surface defects.<br/><br/>The examined material is a 55-year-old annealed glass, which was used as facade elements in a building in the Hague, in the Netherlands. The X-Ray Fluorescence analysis showed that the composition of this glass meets the common float glass recipe but no tin residues were found on its surface. <br/><br/>This research firstly, focuses on the detection and characterization of the defects on the examined weathered glass. Both sides of glass were examined through non-destructive tests with the mobile optical profilometer Traceit® and the digital microscope Keyence VHX 7000. These tests revealed that the weathering induced mainly dense pits, digs and fine linear scratches on the surface exposed to the outside environment (external surface). The depth of these defects, as measured with Traceit®, ranged from 19 µm to 161 µm, which is aligned with the depths reported in literature, which range from 20 µm to 200 µm (Schula et al., 2013). The internal surface had occasionally some large defects which were probably man-made defects. Overall, Traceit® showed a potential for detecting and measuring the defects on weathered glass, whereas with the used microscope it was not possible to measure the defects nor to scan larger surfaces. <br/><br/>Subsequently, 90 specimens of weathered glass were subjected to Coaxial Double Ring tests, with either the external or the internal surface in tension, to assess the effect of weathering on strength. The specimens were of two different dimensions and they were loaded with two different rings to investigate the ""size effect"". In addition, 81 similar specimens of new glass were tested, with either the tin or the air side in tension, and they were used as a reference. These tests showed that the strength of the 55-year-old glass ranged from 22,9 MPa to 138,2 MPa, whereas that of new glass ranged from 38,3 MPa to 219,2 MPa. In particular, the average strength of the internal surface of the small weathered specimens was 53% higher than the external, but no major difference was observed in the tests of the large specimens. Furthermore, the average failure stress of the air side of new glass was approximately 45% higher than that of the tin side, while in literature that difference was characterised as marginal. Finally, although the size effect was clearly observed in the tests on new glass and in those on the internal surface of weathered glass, the strength of the external surface was found independent of the size of the loaded area. This implies that the defects on this surface are similar and uniformly distributed, so the probability of encountering a critical flaw is equal regardless the size of the loaded area. <br/><br/>Fracture statistics were used to derive the design strength of the glass of each testing series. Among three probability distributions, the Weibull distribution was found to describe the strength data of glass better. However, for low probabilities of failure, the data did not fit well to the Weibull distribution and thus, the resulted design strength values are probably very conservative.<br/><br/>The information collected during the non-destructive tests, namely the size and the shape of the defects found on the surface of weathered glass, was used for the identification of the critical defect which will initiate failure. At this step, the assumption that the largest defect will be the critical one was made. Then, the theory of LEFM was used to relate the size of the found critical defect to the failure stress, through the critical stress intensity factor KIC and the geometry factor Y. The predicted values for the failure stresses were analysed with fracture statistics and compared to the actual failure stresses of weathered glass, as emerged from the Coaxial Double Ring tests. In this way, the accuracy of the predictions was evaluated.<br/><br/>The effectiveness of the methodology for the detection of the critical flaw was evaluated through post-fracture analysis. This analysis showed that the critical defect was successfully detected in the 23% of the examined specimens. This suggests that the visually largest defect on a glass element could be the critical one. Furthermore, even if most of the specimens did not failed at the measured defect, the average predicted failure stress differ by less than 9% from the average actual failure stress. This outcome suggests that the defects induced by weathering on the glass surface are similar. Thus, a defect which was identified as critical for one specimen but eventually it was not, it was probably very similar to the critical defect of another specimen. <br/><br/>To conclude, this thesis examines and proposes a novel methodology for the prediction of the glass strength, based on LEFM, applied to defects found on the surface of naturally aged glass. If the defects on the glass surface are studied according to this methodology, a good estimation of the average failure stress can be obtained. For lower probabilities of failure the methodology gives conservative estimations, so it has a potential for use in design applications. Overall, the defects on the surface of glass, and especially their size and geometry, appear to have the greatest effect on the strength of weathered glass so far. Further experimental investigation on the parameters which affect the strength of weathered glass should be carried out, as well as further research on the automation of the proposed methodology, which is expected to increase its effectiveness and efficiency.<br","glass; weathering; surface defects; strength; coaxial double ring test; Non-destructive testing; Fracture Mechanics; statistics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

Higher conversion efficiencies than standard single-junction cells have already been achieved. Proving how these laboratory conversion capabilities translate into real-world performance is therefore a main interest drive within the photovoltaic research community.<br/><br/>Typically, photovoltaic device performance is assessed in Standard Test Conditions (STC). For the majority of climates, this is however not representative of actual operating conditions. With the aim of studying potential system applications, the energy yield prediction method adopted in this thesis analyzes tandem technology performance considering real-world conditions. For this scope, the PVMD Toolbox for PV system modeling is employed.<br/><br/>The tandem device investigated in this work is a perovskite/c-Si based structure in a two-terminal architecture. In particular, a TU Delft own poly-SiOx based crystalline silicon bottom cell is utilized in the configuration. This structure is implemented in the Toolbox to carry out Optical simulations from cell to module system level. Operating conditions are introduced through use of the Toolbox Weather and Thermal models. These recreate real-world illumination and climate settings for the selected locations of Reykjavik, Rome and Alice Springs. With an STC-optimized perovskite thickness of 515 nm, the hourly implied photocurrent density of the device is calculated and validated. The jph annual average is 1.92, 3.34 and 5.01 mA/cm2 for the three locations, respectively. These values take into account a sub-cells current mis-<br/>match loss between 5 and 8% depending on location. To reproduce real-world cell electrical parameters behavior, the variable irradiance and temperature sub-cells J-V curves have been obtained. A poly-SiOx based silicon prototype was tested in laboratory settings and its curves then utilized in simulations after measurements validation.<br/><br/>The module annual energy yield is computed through simulations with the Toolbox Electric model. In terms of specific DC yield, the STC-optimized module delivers 820, 1,427 and 2,161 kWh/kWp/year in the three locations. The power mismatch lowering effect due to the fill factor gain compensates the current mismatch in this 2T configuration, reducing energy mismatch losses. This performance is then compared to a reference single-junction poly-SiOx based silicon module, to show how tandem technology potentially outperforms standard modules differently depending on climatic conditions. The tandem module is also assessed in terms of DC performance ratio (PR), exhibiting values over 0.94 for all three locations. The structure is then real-world optimized by varying perovskite thickness, with the goal of maximizing<br/>location-specific energy yield and PR. Slight improvements are obtained for the Reykjavik and Alice Springs locations, where the energy yield increases by few relative percentage points along with PR.","Tandem modules; Perovskite; poly-SiOx carrier selective contacts; Silicon; Energy yield of PV system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-09","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Cellulose fiber is the most important component of FSF, which can be fermented into volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and then be used as carbon sources in biological nutrient removal (BNR). This thesis measured and evaluated the aerobic &amp; anaerobic biodegradability of solids in fermented FSF (fFSF) and the BNR performance of FSF-derived VFAs. In addition, this research tested the feasibility of using secondary sieving as a potential downstream processing technology. The products of secondary sieving (liquid: secondary filtrate, solid: secondary FSF) were compared with fFSF in terms of biodegradability and BNR performance. The aerobic biodegradability of raw FSF, fFSF and secondary<br/>filtratewere 52.3 ± 1.4, 60.4 ± 4.7 and 72.1 ± 6.4 %, respectively. The anaerobic biodegradability of raw FSF, fFSF and secondary FSF are 56.8 ± 8.4, 68.2 ± 6.4, 51.5 ± 7.8 %, respectively. The results of biodegradability revealed that secondary sieving increased the proportion of readily biodegradable solids and reduced the overall organic load of activated sludge systems. The residual solids after secondary sieving could be converted into biogas or recovered as building materials. FSF-derived VFAs could substantially increase denitrification rates and phosphate release rates. fFSF and secondary filtrate could increase the denitrification rate by 40 - 50%and increase the phosphate release rate by around 200 % compared to blank. Theoretically, the effluent nitrogen load could be reduced by up to 53.7%if FSF-derived carbon sources are fully used for denitrification atWWTP Aarle-Rixtel. If used for phosphorus removal, the capacity provided by FSF-derived VFAs could nearly remove all phosphate from the effluent. To sum up, FSF-derived VFAs could effectively increase BNR rates<br/>and significantly reduce the effluent nitrogen and phosphorus load. The main advantages of FSFderived VFAs over conventional carbon sources are sustainability and waste-reduction. Secondary sieving could reduce the solid load of activated sludge tank and achieve a combined recycling of VFAs and fibers, but the total COD available for BNR will be reduced as a compensation. The results in this thesis can facilitate the application of fFSF in WWTPs and the improvement of FSF-derived VFAs production.","Batch activity test; biodegradability; biological nutrietn removal; cellulose recycle; denitrification; downstream processing; enhanced biological phosphorus removal; fine sieved fraction; sieving","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-30","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

However, both these technologies use several critical raw materials essential for their functioning. Wind turbines generate electricity through generators, and EVs are driven by motors. An important component used in both these technologies is neodymium magnets. The magnets contain rare earth elements (mainly neodymium, dysprosium, and praseodymium) which are defined as critical raw materials by the European Commission. Against the massive usage of neodymium magnets in these green technologies, there is no collection plan that focuses on recovering and reusing the magnets from EVs and wind turbines. Currently, less than 1% of neodymium magnets are recycled in the EU due to no collection in place and a lack of large-scale recycling. End-of-life (EoL) EVs and wind turbines will be massive sources of scrap neodymium magnets in the EU. However, in order to reuse or recycle neodymium magnets, these magnets first need to be collected, which is seen as an opportunity. Only when a high collection rate is achieved, a significant amount of magnets can be recycled into magnets or their constituent rare earth elements (REEs) and thus contribute to more secure access to REEs in the EU. This master thesis uses a design approach to develop a set of collection strategies that can be implemented in the EU. To develop the strategy, requirements and functions are identified by the means of four analyses- neodymium magnet market analysis, reuse and recyclability of neodymium magnets, legal analysis, and stakeholder analysis. Based on the functions formulated, means are identified that can fulfil the functions. Finally, the chosen means are categorised in five themes: Legislation and regulation, Finance, Infrastructure development, Information exchange and Material flow. Furthermore, the different solutions are categorised into short-term (can be implemented 3-6 years), medium-term (can be implemented 6-9 years), and long-term plans (can be implemented 9-12 years).","Collection strategy; Neodymium magnets; Circular Economy; Close loop supply chain; EVs; Wind Turbine; Design Approach; Recycling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Point Clouds are a data type to represent 3D objects and scenes. During the processing of the point cloud data, undesired changes to the point cloud can be introduced or information can get lost. Automatic detection and classifying of the quality of a point cloud is needed, to regulate this data type for use in 3D environments, and speed up the processing of point cloud objects in real-time applications.<br/><br/>In this thesis, we look into the problem of no-reference point cloud quality assessment. Full-reference quality metrics compare a distorted point cloud with its original, while no-reference or blind metrics only look at a single point cloud. This task is more challenging than full-reference, as there is less direct information available to work with. We approach the challenge of how the perceptual quality of a point cloud can be estimated when a high-quality reference point cloud is not available, by analyzing if any point cloud properties correlate with the perceptual quality.<br/><br/>We try to find point cloud properties that are effective to use in a model to predict a user given quality score. We select multiple local properties to transform into global descriptors, by taking multiple statistical attributes of the data on all the points to combine into scalars. We analyze the created global descriptors to find linear correlations with the quality score, and found many features that to some measure linearly correlate with some distortion types. With the selected global descriptors, we use Support Vector Regression to find the fitting of the features to the quality score. Varying performances are achieved by training the models on different data subsets, and different fitting kernel functions.<br/><br/>The results show some distortions on unknown objects are properly predictable using fitted weights on this distortion. However, a single defining quality descriptor is not yet found. While the results show potential, our model is not robust and fast enough to perform a reliable assessment of quality in a real-time environment. We are just at the beginning of exploring no-reference quality assessment, and while the current methods are not yet appliable in real-time scenarios, future work can fill many knowledge gaps to reach this goal.","Quality Assessment; 3D Point Cloud; Feature Relevance; No-Reference; Master Thesis; Multimedia Computing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

This thesis presents a CMOS-based voltage reference that can work over a wide temperature range from 4K to 300K. To achieve a low-drift, high-accuracy reference, it is designed based on the devices’ cryogenic behaviour to minimize the nonlinearities of the PTAT- (proportional to absolute temperature) and CTAT (complementary to absolute temperature) voltages and combine them to generate a stable output voltage. Dynamic compensation techniques are employed to reduce the effect of process variations and a switched-capacitor circuit is proposed to minimize the output ripple.

(mentor); van Dalen, K.N. (graduation committee); Molenkamp, T. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","This study presents the structural response of a Submerged Floating Tunnel (SFT) subjected to earthquake loading and other relevant static loading types. The SFT is a competitive solution for crossings of deep seas, canals and fjords, as it is submerged in water and floats at a fixed submersion depth. It is supported by its buoyancy and tethers, connected to the seabed to maintain the structure at an even submersion level. Influence on the environment is low compared to other competitive structures, as the structure does not occupy any surface of the seabed, except for the tether foundations. Moreover, the environment has little influence on the SFT’s operability, as it is insensitive to harsh weather conditions. However, in areas of high seismicity, the SFT’s dynamic characteristics must be carefully tuned to the expected type of earthquake to optimize its performance. Previous research showed that special care should be taken of the transition between the SFT and land tunnels, as this joint has proven itself to be the main challenge.<br/><br/>The purpose of this research is to alter the transition structure between the SFT and adjacent land tunnels, such that an optimal dynamic response of a SFT is found to seismic events (Chapter 1). Initially, its performance is measured by comparing the seismic serviceability limit state (SLS) response to the static ultimate limit state (ULS) response. Subsequently, for more severe earthquakes, it is measured by comparing the SLS seismic stresses with maximum allowed levels of concrete prestress.<br/><br/>To analyse the SFT behaviour, a global model has been created of the SFT+land-tunnel system in Chapter 3, which is built by means of a linear-elastic finite element method in Python. It accounts for dynamic loads through the soil and tethers, as well as static loads by the structure's weight, traffic and buoyancy. The influence of stagnant water is accounted for by the Morison equation. Soil-Structure-Interaction (SSI) is incorporated using a Substructuring method. The properties of the soil and tethers are found in local sub-models, after which the total structural response of the global model is solved in the frequency domain. Later, its response is transformed to the time domain to obtain a time-series of displacements and forces. Its dynamic characteristics are studied by comparing Fourier spectra with SFT natural frequencies, which gives insight in the influence of design choices on the time-domain response.<br/><br/>The global model is validated with a replica model in the finite element software DIANA FEA (Chapter 4). A realistic case study is defined based on a previous TEC project in Chapter 5 and later applied in a parameter study in Chapter 6. Here, the effects of various design choices with respect to the transition structure are monitored using 3 earthquake signals. 5 standard end-joints and 2 special end-joints with seismic base isolation and viscous dampers are tested. The effects of Multi-Support-Excitation is studied by letting earthquakes horizontally approach the SFT with various wave speeds and angles of attack. Finally, the effect of SSI is compared with a non-SSI case, to see its contribution to the research.<br/><br/>In Chapter 7, the results are discussed and in Chapter 8 a conclusion is provided together with recommendations for both TEC and future research. <br","Submerged Floating Tunnel; Earthquakes; Soil-Structure Interaction; Fluid-structure interaction; Transition structure; seismic analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Structural Mechanics","",""

The MCUs are demanded to process the raw data acquired from the sensors with the integer-based workload, such as digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms and quantized neural network (QNN) inference. Snitch is a tiny RV32I control core based on RISC-V open-source instruction set architecture. Currently, the Snitch system built around the Snitch core aims to achieve high performance in floating-point applications. Novel hardware extensions have been implemented in its floating-point subsystem to achieve high floating-point unit (FPU) utilization, such as stream semantic registers (SSRs) and floating-point repetition (FREP) hardware loop. However, it only has RV32IM instruction set support for integer computation, which does not satisfy the increasing demand from the integer workload we mentioned. In this work, we present a unified Snitch architecture with integer extensions targeting integer workload acceleration. Some existing custom extensions to address performance bottlenecks in DSP and QNN applications were proposed, which are Xpulpimg ISA and sub-byte single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD) ISA, respectively. Both extensions are built on the outdated version of Snitch in another many-core system Mempool. In our work, we first integrated the DSP-oriented ISA extension Xpulpimg and the sub-byte SIMD ISA extension into the mainline Snitch. Then we extended the existing floating-point SSR to have integer support. To evaluate the proposed extensions, we benchmarked the Snitch core complex (CC) with integer matrix multiplication algorithms and compared the performance between the baseline RV32IM and our extensions. A speedup of 5.9$\times$, 22.6$\times$, and 77.4$\times$ in terms of MACs/cycle with respect to the baseline was measured for 32-bit, 8-bit and 4-bit data sizes, respectively. Post-synthesis figures have been obtained from GlobalFoundries 22 nm technology for area and timing evaluations. Our integer extensions only introduced 12\% area overhead compared with the original FP-capable Snitch CC, and they led to no measurable impact in terms of the maximum effective frequency with FP extensions enabled.","RISC-V; Snitch; ISA extensions; Computer Architecture; Stream Semantic Registers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Engineering","",""

This recently touted success of Transformers warrants an investigation into which of its components contribute to its performance. Moreover, previous work has a limitation of analysis only at fixed data scales as well as unfair comparisons with others models where parameter counts are not equivalent. This work investigates the performance of the window-Based Transformer for prostate CT Organ-at-Risk (OAR) segmentation at different data scales in context of replacing its various components. To compare with previous literature, the first experiment replaces the window-based Transformer block with convolution. Results show that the convolution prevails as the data scale increases. In the second experiment, to reduce complexity, the self-attention mechanism is replaced with an equivalent albeit simpler spatial mixing operation i.e. max-pooling. We observe improved performance for max-pooling in smaller data scales, indicating that the window-based Transformer may not be the best choice in both small and larger data scales. Finally, since convolution has an inherent local inductive bias of positional information, we conduct a third experiment to imbibe such a property to the Transformer by exploring two kinds of positional encodings. The results show that there are insignificant improvements after adding positional encoding, indicating the Transformers deficiency in capturing positional information given our data scales. We hope that our approach can serve as a framework for others evaluating the utility of Transformers for their tasks.","Medical Segmentation; Transformer; Convolution","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

Many new data marketplaces emerge from this, resulting in the heterogeneity of the data marketplace that leads to market fragmentation in the industry. The aggregator business model can offer various values to users in a fragmented market. Therefore, the idea of designing aggregator business models for data marketplaces could be worthwhile investigating. Design Science Research (DSR) methodology is used in this research. Business model requirements to design aggregator business models were defined in the literature review. The business models of various aggregators are analyzed with case studies. From the requirements and case studies, four new aggregator business archetypes are derived: search engine, advanced search engine, comparison sites, and one-stop shop. These four aggregator business models are distinguished by their service offerings and their degree of the network. It is also discovered from case studies that there is a connection between the degree of network and aggregators' embedded technology. The high degree of network aggregators tend to use API, while the low degree of network aggregators tend to use information crawlers. The aggregator business model archetypes are then demonstrated to the data marketplace cases by translating the business models into business activities and services that can be offered to the users. Then, we evaluate the data marketplace aggregator business model through semi-structured interviews with experts. From the evaluation, it is discovered that data marketplace aggregators could offer value to the users, e.g., navigating users to find data sales and providing a single access point to collect data. Different technology aspects that could help to realize the aggregation services have also been developed by various projects. Additionally, data providers are willing to join the aggregation services due to the economic benefit. However, although the benefit and possibilities, multiple challenges need to be addressed by the data marketplace aggregator. There are issues with technical standardizations and interoperability that could be problematic in integrating various platforms for aggregation. Maintaining collaboration is difficult due to the need to provide data assurance, which could be expensive and exhausting. Additionally, although it is beneficial to navigate users in finding sales, data marketplace aggregators might offer little value to data buyers with market knowledge because they will directly buy the data from the sellers.","Business models; Data marketplaces; Aggregator; Business model design; Data economy; Digital Platform","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(mentor); Mustafa, S. (graduation committee); Šavija, B. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Limiting maximum crack widths is a serviceability limit state, which ensures the durability of reinforced structures. In current practice, maximum crack widths are limited by using additional reinforcement, on top of the amount of reinforcement required for the designed ultimate bearing capacity. Reducing the amount of reinforcing steel used, could make the construction industry more sustainable. Recent studies showed that, hybrid reinforced beams with a 70 mm thick bottom layer of strain hardening cementitious composite (SHCC), so-called hybrid R/SHCC beams, are promising in controlling crack widths under pure bending, without using additional reinforcement (Huang, 2017; Singh, 2019). SHCC<br/>is made from a binder, fine particles and PVA fibers, which leads to ductile material properties and crack bridging. The beams studied in these previous studies were limited to a height of 200 mm. In practice larger heights are demanded. Increasing the height of a hybrid R/SHCC beam, by keeping the<br/>thickness of the SHCC layer constant, reduces the relative contribution of SHCC. In addition, cementitious materials exhibit strong size effects. Therefore, the effect of height scaling on the flexural crack width controlling behavior of hybrid R/SHCC beam is studied in this thesis. In addition, the optimization potential of the crack controlling behavior of the hybrid R/SHCC beams is studied, by the delamination of the SHCC-rebar interface.<br/><br/>The effect of height scaling on the flexural crack width controlling behavior of the hybrid R/SHCC beams is studied both experimentally and numerically, by 200 mm, 300 mm and 400 mm high hybrid R/SHCC beams, with a constant 70 mm thick bottom layer of SHCC. Reinforced concrete beams of the same heights are used as reference. The length of the higher beams are increased, to prevent<br/>direct force transfer. The experimental results of the 200 mm high beams are used from a previous study by (Singh, 2019). To study the effect of delamination of the SHCC-rebar interface, a 300 mm high hybrid R/SHCC beam with smooth and Vaseline treated longitudinal reinforcement bars is used. The beams are tested in a four-point bending configuration, with a 500 mm constant bending moment region. All the beams have the same amount of longitudinal reinforcement. The numerical study is performed with the Delft Lattice Model. As lattice models are only recently used for the modelling of structural behavior, the use of the Delft Lattice model in this study is a contribution to the development<br/>of lattice models. Analytical calculations, with use of the multi-layer model (Yassiri, 2020), are used in the comparison of the numerical and experimental results. <br/><br/>From the performed experiments, it is found that, the load, at which the 0.3 mm crack width limit is reached, decreases from 109% to 97% and 91% of the yielding load, upon increasing the height from 200 mm to 300 mm and 400 mm, respectively. Whereas, the beam with smooth and Vaseline treated longitudinal reinforcement bars, reached the crack width limit already at 59% of the yielding<br/>load. Increasing the height of the reinforced concrete beams does not lead to a reduction in the crack width limit load, relative to the yielding load (76%-78%). From the cracking patterns, it is found that, upon increasing the height, the number of propagated concrete cracks decrease, both in the reinforced<br/>concrete beams and in the hybrid R/SHCC beams, whereas the hybrid beam with smooth and Vaseline treated reinforcement bars showed a single propagated crack in the concrete layer. An effective tensile area is developed for the 300 mm and 400 mm high beams, which was not observed in the 200 mm high beams. Uniform cracking distributions are found in all the SHCC layers of the hybrid beams, except for the hybrid beam with smooth and Vaseline treated <br/>reinforcement bars. The delamination of the concrete-SHCC interface increases, upon increasing the height, whereas the ultimate bearing capacity is similar for the 300 mm and 400 mm high hybrid R/SHCC beams. On the contrary, the hybrid beam with smooth and Vaseline treated reinforcement bars shows very limited delamination. From the out of plane measurements, it is found that, hybrid R/SHCC beams show out of plane displacements, which are highly correlated to the applied vertical forces. This is not observed for the reinforced concrete beams. The numerical models are able to simulate the trends in the cracking patterns, as observed in the experiments. In addition, the numerical models are able to simulate the trends in delamination. Increasing the concrete-SHCC bond strength, in the 400 mm high hybrid R/SHCC numerical model, leads to the formation of an additional propagated crack in the concrete layer. In addition, the deformation capacity and the delamination of the concrete-SHCC layer reduces, for the beam with the stronger concreteSHCC interface bond strength. Using a coarser 25 mm voxel size in the numerical models, instead<br/>of the 10 mm voxel size used in previous studies (Mustafa et al., 2022), leads to similar simulated structural behavior of the beams. The voxel size limits the crack spacing, which is of larger importance for the SHCC, compared to conventional concrete. For the reinforced concrete beams, the numerical<br/>models are able to predict the yielding load, whereas for the hybrid beams, the yielding deformation is underestimated, due to the overestimation of the ductility of the modelled SHCC. The analytical calculations show good comparison with the numerical models, both for the hybrid beams and for the reinforced concrete beams. The hybrid beam with smooth and Vaseline treated reinforcement leads<br/>to an unreinforced hybrid beam, which is different from the experimental results. This difference is attributed to the numerical model simulating a weak bond over the full length of the beam, whereas in the experiments Vaseline is only applied over the 700 mm central span. To conclude, upon increasing the height of the hybrid R/SHCC beams, the effectiveness of the crack controlling behavior decreases. This is both found in the numerical and in the experimental results and holds both for a 0.2 mm and 0.3 mm crack width limit. However, the hybrid beams scaled in height still lead to a significant increase in the crack controlling behavior, compared to reinforced concrete beams of the same heights. Full delamination of the rebar-SHCC interface leads to worse crack controlling<br/>behavior for the hybrid R/SHCC beams. Even more, if the full delamination occurs over the full length of the beam, the beam could be considered unreinforced. The Delft Lattice model shows large potential in the simulation of the structural behavior of both the reinforced concrete beams and the hybrid R/SHCC beams. The coarser 25 mm voxel size is found to be a time efficient and suitable modelling solution to gain insight in trends in the structural behavior of reinforced structures. The numerical model with a stronger concrete-SHCC interface showed potential in improving the crack width controlling behavior of the hybrid R/SHCC beams in height. Therefore, it is recommended<br/>to study the effect of interface roughness for hybrid R/SHCC beams scaled in height. Additionally, determining the material input for SHCC remains a challenge in numerical simulations with the Delft Lattice Model. In order to improve the simulations of the numerical models, it is recommended to<br/>study the material input possibilities for SHCC. Even more, before the beams are applied in practise, it is recommended to gain deeper understanding of the increased out of plane sensitivity of the hybrid R/SHCC beams. Studying the fiber dispersion would be logical start for this.","SHCC; Flexural; SHCC-concrete beam; Crack width; Sustainability; Delamination; size effect; upscaling; serviceability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering | Concrete Structures","",""

To diminish the airline industry's increasing emissions, carbon-neutral growth for this industry is adopted. Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) are considered an important aspect to comply with these goals and a large upscale of the SAF industry is needed. Therefore, the European Commission recently proposed a SAF blending mandate which mandates the uptake of this industry. However, the SAF industry is still a relatively new phenomenon and faces multiple barriers of which one of which is the divergent perspectives of the stakeholder groups within the airline industry. This research aims to identify the preferences of these different stakeholder groups. The following research question has been formulated for this purpose: ""What are stakeholders’ preferences regarding different SAF technology pathways, in order to stimulate the SAF upscale for 2030 and comply with the proposed SAF blending mandate by the European Commission?"" To answer this research question, a qualitative approach is applied. As such, a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) approach is used, where the Bayesian Best-Worst Method (BWM) is applied to determine the stakeholder group preferences regarding different SAF technology pathways. These SAF technology pathways are scored on economic, environmental and technological criteria. The stakeholder analysis shows that the airline industry deviates from the other three stakeholder groups (SAF/aviation experts, SAF consumers and SAF producers) as this stakeholder group attains more value to SAF its economic performance, combined with a decreased importance of both its environmental performance and technological performance. It is also concluded that overall, SAF its performance on greenhouse gas (GHG) saving emissions and its production volume availability and scalability are both deemed critical for a SAF technology pathway. Also, the expected minimum selling price is an important criterion in the analysis. Given the considered criteria and their perceived importance, regardless of which perspective of the stakeholder group is considered, the Fischer-Tropsch technology performs well due to its good performance on environmental aspects and its high production volume availability and scalability. As this research shows the divergent perspectives within the SAF industry, future policies could focus on finding consensus between these stakeholder groups.","Best-Worst Method; Multi-criteria decision-making; Sustainable Aviation Fuels; ReFuelEUInitiative","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

A key challenge is to select and implement efficient measures to reduce the flood risk, within limitations of budget, time, space, and societal acceptance. Interactions between joining rivers in flood plains and cities lead to several challenges in flood risk studies. Typical ‘critical’ events of such river systems may differ as small (large) rivers are affected by short duration-high intensity (long duration large volume) rainfall events. The challenges are 1) to define design flood conditions (design events) for systems on which the flood resistance measures can be based, e.g. dimensions of measures like levees or reservoirs, and 2) to understand and determine the risk and consequences that a flood can cause. A multivariate analysis is needed to account for the interactions and statistical dependencies (Bender et al., 2016). Copula functions have been applied in different fields as a multivariate method. Nevertheless, its application in risk analysis for river confluences still needs further evaluation.<br/>In this thesis, the objective is to develop a methodology to determine design flood events that account for the different statistical dependencies and interactions between joining rivers, and that balances the required simulation time with the required accuracy of the results. For this objective, we evaluated the different statistical dependencies and interactions of joining rivers according to the catchment characteristics for each model domain: meteorological, hydrological, and hydraulic. First, identifying how the extreme precipitation events (meteorological) of neighbouring catchments are correlated, and evaluating the differences whit correlations of extreme river discharge events (hydrological). Second, we performed hydraulic simulations at a confluence to evaluate the hydraulic interactions of the joining rivers and the flood impacts, from which a response function was obtained. Subsequently, we evaluated the flood risk by implementing an approach to sample combinations of discharges of joining rivers, and determining the flood impacts from the response function. The developed approach consists of three main steps: 1) the selection of the extremes sets at the confluence, 2) the estimation of the copula parameters and 3) Monte Carlo simulations where the discharges of joining rivers are sampled from their respective marginal probability distributions, and the flooded area is calculated by using the response function. The dependence between the two joining rivers is taken into consideration by using a copula (Gaussian, Gumbel, or Clayton) to construct the joint distribution of the confluence from the marginal distributions.<br","Flood risk; Compound flooding; Copula modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

Altering the longitudinal position of each wheel with respect to the centre of gravity, leads to a change in lateral wheel forces. This affects the car's yaw rate, therefore making it possible to influence its agility. Available literature has shown that this subject is still quite weakly investigated, which makes it an interesting topic of research. To investigate this influence of actively reconfiguring the wheelbase, simulations were done using IPG Carmaker together with MATLAB/Simulink, during which a simplified vehicle model of a Toyota Camry was used. A proportional derivative controller combined with control allocation was designed to regulate the reconfigurable wheelbase system. It features a reference generator that returns a desired yaw rate and activation logic which ensures that the controller is only activated in a velocity range of 60 km/h to 110 km/h and when a steering input is given. Furthermore, a benchmark study is designed, using a fuzzy logic controller that is based on a simplified version of one presented by Soltani et al. (2017). This controller uses the same reference generator and activation logic for consistency. The rules and membership functions of the fuzzy logic block are adopted from the mentioned paper. The performance of both these controllers and a baseline vehicle without any control, are evaluated for a step steer manoeuvre, an increasing circle manoeuvre and a double lane change, at different velocities and/or steering amplitudes. Based on the results of these tests, it is shown that both controllers are able to influence the lateral dynamics positively during most of these manoeuvres and are therefore able to improve the vehicle's agility in the velocity range in which the controller is active.","reconfigurable wheelbase; lateral vehicle dynamics; vehicle dynamics control; vehicle agility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering | Dynamics and Controls","",""

More work towards independent scaling and optimisation of the 5GS user plane has to be done. The 4G base stations (eNB) are mainly deployed as monolithic units, whereas, in 5GS, the 3GPP 5G Next Generation base station (gNodeB) can be divided into Radio Unit (RU), Distributed Unit (DU) and Centralised Unit (CU). The CU can be divided into two logical components, the Centralised Unit-Control Plane (CU-CP) and the Centralised Unit-User Plane (CU-UP), extending Control and User Plane Separation (CUPS) approach into RAN. With the introduction of CUPS into RAN, more independence will be provided to the user plane. Moreover, using Open RAN (O-RAN), all these components can be deployed at different locations as Virtual Network Functions (VNFs).

Firstly, to compare the impact of co-locating the CU-UP with the DU at a distributed edge cloud location against co-locating the CU-UP with the CU-CP at a centralised regional cloud location. Secondly, with the aid of functional split design, virtualisation and O-RAN, we want to explore whether dynamically deploying the CU-UP and DU on a single physical host machine at a distributed location while centralising the CU-CP can enhance RAN development. To achieve this, we consider the 3GPP architecture as a reference and propose a new architecture and enhanced communication mechanism between CU-UP and DU. An analytical model was designed to evaluate the proposed architecture’s latency gains in the IP transport network, and a simulation model was designed to evaluate the proposed architecture’s communication latency. Furthermore, flow diagrams involving signalling of PDU session establishment are also presented.<br/><br/>We present an analysis and overall evaluation of the proposed architecture by comparing it with the reference architecture based on practical architectural aspects and PDU session signalling diagrams. The results of the calculation model and outputs of the simulation model indicated a significant latency improvement when the new architecture is employed. The new architecture found that, on average, 1.5 ms/packet of midhaul delay was reduced. And based on the flow diagram comparisons, it was found that the new architecture introduces overhead in terms of control plane signalling.","RAN; 5G; O-RAN; CUPS; Functional split of RAN; User plane","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Wireless Communication and Sensing","",""

(mentor); Ersoy, A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Food waste remains a large problem globally, not only in the light of global greenhouse gas emissions, but also in the light of decreasing resource availability. Research in this area has so far mainly focused on behavioral factors influencing production of food waste, while the formal and informal institutions that relate to the management of waste play an equally important role in shaping individual and company behavior. This research focuses on how food waste can be better managed among students, one of the biggest food waste contributors in the national food waste account, and other actors, such as companies and supermarkets, which continuously produce a lot of food waste. Accordingly, this thesis asks as a main research question: How do Institutional Barriers and Drivers influence the Food Waste Management of Students and Food Waste Initiatives in Cologne?<br/>The case study is the city of Cologne, Germany. The city of Cologne has been chosen as a single-case study due to the fact that it is one of the largest student cities in Germany and also home to many companies and initiatives that are engaging in reducing food waste. Data is collected through literature search, interviews and student surveys. The interviews have been conducted with nine different actors from food waste initiatives, supermarkets or associations. The data from the interviews has ben anonymized for the purposes of this thesis. The research follows an inductive and qualitative approach, which is why the survey that is collecting data from students is not used for statistical analysis. The aim is to find the drivers and barriers for food waste and develop a theory in the best case from it. <br/>This research captures the informal institutions (i.e. norms, rules and strategies) that shape student behavior, in conjunction with the strategies of different waste companies and initiatives. These informal institutions are analyzed within the framing of formal rules and regulations relating to food waste. The institutional network analysis (INA) approach that is built on the Institutional Analysis Development (IAD) framework and Institutional grammar (IG) is used to relate all institutions together in one picture to identify potential institutional misalignments. The collected data from the literature, the interviews and the survey, is coded using the institutional grammar by Ostrom (1995). Additionally, this thesis develops the institutional grammar a little further by introducing some new elements. On the one hand survey data is used for the first time in the institutional network analysis, which overall gives the network analysis more credibility through a larger data base. On the other hand, expectations have been introduced to the networks as a new element next to rules, norms and strategies. By using the institutional grammar according to Ostrom (1995), five action situations were identified. Action situations, or action arenas are situations in which rules, norms and strategies through conflicts form actor’s behavior. The action situations that were identified in this research encompass Waste Prevention, Waste Disposal, Waste Treatment, Sustainability Understanding and Best-Before Date. The action situations were defined according to the waste hierarchy of German Law and the findings of the institutional network analysis.<br/>Next to the institutional network analysis, a descriptive analysis helps identifying patterns from the collected data, which in turn helps embedding the results of the network analysis into a broader context. The descriptive analysis takes into account all gathered data that cannot be used for the institutional network analysis, but which can still provide important insights into the problem. Last, another more descriptive section provides an overview about the current German food waste management system, to be able to understand later on which parts would need improvement.<br/>The main finding of this study is that opposing expectations about how to effectively reduce food waste by the different actors mirror a general awareness on food waste in Cologne, but also reveal a lack of rules and norms in the area of food waste management. Moreover, the combined results of the network analysis and the general observations show that institutional misalignments among expectations are often not resolved through actor’s engaging in trying to prevent food waste. The actors in contrast are remaining rather inactive and seemingly hope that the government finds solutions for their expectations. To remove the barriers to improve the food waste management in Cologne even further, nine policy recommendations were formulated. The recommendations are based on the findings of this study, but are also subject to limitations, which could not have been further investigated in this thesis. <br/>One of the main takes aways of this study is that seemingly more orientation and clearer rules are needed for many actors, which have to come from the government. Only providing information events and education is not enough to reduce food waste, but clear regulations for customers and retail are needed. This can be achieved through providing clearer framework conditions for all actors could lead to the development of societal norms and a common understanding of food waste as a pressing issue and resolve the differing expectations. Further research should therefore focus on further solutions for removing the misalignments of the actors.<br/><br/>Key Words: Food Waste, Waste Prevention, Waste Treatment, Waste Disposal, Institutional Network Analysis, Institutional Interdependencies, Cologne, Differing Expectations <br","Cologne; Differing Expectations; Food Waste; Waste Prevention; Waste Treatment; Waste Disposal; Institutional Network Analysis; Institutional Interdependencies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","Master Thesis",""

(mentor); Soriano Sutil, A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The automotive industry has been in an increasing drive toward finding more sustainable transportation alternatives to abandon the era of Internal Combustion Engines (ICE). This was manifested in the large market share of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) that have been established in recent years. As BEVs are not an efficient option in long-haul transportation, Fuel-Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs) have presented themselves as a prominent choice. To maximize the attainable driving range, gaseous hydrogen is compressed to 70 MPa per recent regulations. As a result, hydrogen storage pressure vessels need to provide high structural integrity, whilst being as lightweight as possible. This has led to the introduction of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP), where type IV Composite Pressure Vessels (CPVs) with CFRP overwrap and plastic liner are gaining popularity. The mass implementation of FCEVs is however directly dependent on the cost and reliability of CPVs. Increasing the reliability levels inherently lead to minimizing the materials used inducing cost reduction possibilities, and presenting FCEVs as a more feasible solution. To attain such high levels of reliability, a thorough understanding of the manufacturing process of CPVs is required. This research project aims at contributing to an increased level of understanding of CPVs by investigating the influence manufacturing parameters have on the final product quality. This study is done in collaboration with Plastic Omnium, which allowed for the possibility of obtaining experimental data for validation purposes. The approach followed in this research project is by developing an analytical model that is capable of representing the manufacturing process of CPVs. The objective is to be able to link the manufacturing parameters to the vessel’s quality for a given vessel configuration. The analytical model takes the vessel configuration as an input, alongside the definition of the considered manufactured parameters, winding tension force and internal liner pressure, and outputs quantitative predictions of changes in dimensions, compaction and burst performance. The model was found on the basis of adopting a common analysis method for composite materials, Classical Laminate Theory (CLT) and adapting it to be capable of representing the manufacturing process. A major challenge in developing such a model is dealing with uncured composite materials, where different assumptions were imposed for the model to be physically sound. Hypotheses were generated using the analytical model for eight different vessel configurations, where either the vessel configuration was changed or the magnitude of manufacturing parameters. The proposed experimental campaign consists of microscope inspection and burst testing of 22 sub-scale vessels in total, where the obtained data were used to prove or disprove the hypotheses. The analytical model and experimental results showcased the significant influence varying tension force and internal pressure have on the end-product quality where at different parameter settings, differences up to 4 % in Fiber Volume Fraction (FVF), 4.5 % in porosity content and 8 % in burst performance were observed with respect to a baseline configuration. Changes in vessel configuration, by varying stacking sequence grouping or liner diameter, led to notable differences in compaction and burst performance. The work presented in this report highlights the significance manufacturing parameters have on the scatter and reliability of CPVs and showcases the possibility of improving mechanical performance for a fixed design. Additionally, a framework is proposed in this work to help in defining the optimum process parameters for different vessel configurations. This work serves as a basis for future investigations into further optimizing the process parameters definition as it has been shown that there is still room for further improvements.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-09-29","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Kleinsmann, M.S. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Floods, long periods of drought, wildfires, and natural disasters are becoming more frequent, in more extreme proportions. Our current food system is a major contributor to this. In particular, the livestock industry. This is due to the amount of land and water that the livestock sector uses, and the emission of greenhouse gasses. In order to work towards a livable planet for future generations, this project addresses how we can reduce the impact of our food system. One of the most promising ways to reduce the impact of our food system is to switch to a more vegetarian or plant-based diet. <br/><br/>This project focuses on the professional athletes who train at the Olympic training center Papendal and eat in the restaurant at Papendal. This is a unique situation where Papendal controls what the athletes eat. Although the plant-based market is growing enormously and more people are interested in reducing their meat consumption, hardly any vegetarian meals are sold in the restaurant. The manager of the sports restaurant at Papendal has no insight into what keeps athletes from choosing the vegetarian evening meal and what can be done to run a vegetarian menu in the future successfully. <br/><br/>A survey with athletes at Papendal was conducted to identify the barriers and attitudes of athletes towards vegetarian food. This research showed that most athletes are open to reducing their meat consumption. However, the main reasons that prevented them from doing so were that they had not thought about it, did not know what they should eat to get all their protein, and did not like the taste. <br/><br/>In this project, a strategy was designed to help Papendal work towards the vision of a successful vegetarian menu in the sports restaurant, where the goal is that half of all meals sold will be vegetarian in six years. <br/><br/>Several models were used to design this strategy, including behavioral change models and a model for achieving organizational change. The motivation technique called nudging was addressed to motivate athletes to change their behaviour. This motivation technique gradually steers consumers in a particular direction, at all times used for good purposes such as public health or sustainability. <br/><br/>Two roadmaps and two nudges were developed in detail as a final design. The organizational change roadmap helps Papendal work towards an optimal workplace for designing and implementing nudges. Furthermore, the other roadmap shows what type of nudges Papendal can implement over the years. Containing three horizons, each with a different focus of the behaviour change model.<br/><br/>Two nudges are designed in detail. To inspire Papendal what these nudges in the first horizon can look like. The first is a deck of playing cards containing information and visuals about the topic of vegetarian and plant-based food, which allows athletes to get in touch with this topic in an accessible and fun way. Next, a playful cube is designed with similar information on the sides. The cube can be placed on the dinner tables, attracting athletes' attention to increase awareness around this topic.","Vegetarianism; Plant-based; Transition Design; Nudging; Athletes; meat consumption","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

For the Netherlands to achieve its climate targets, Dutch municipalities have been delegated the crucial task of the heat transition. Prior research reveals that the Dutch energy transition and policy documents are often techno-economic centred and hardly stress citizens’ central role. However, it remains a thoroughly social affair as changes in energy technologies are accompanied by societal ramifications, and the exclusion of social aspects (public support and energy justice) has detrimental societal effects. This research aims to evaluate the impact of including social information in the information provided for the decision-making process on decisions made by local Dutch policymakers for the heat transition.<br/> <br/>Central to this thesis was the following main question: “What is the impact of including social information in the information provided for decision-making processes on the social responsibility of policymakers’ decisions for the heat transition?”. To assess this impact, interviews were conducted, and a 1x2 between-subjects experiment was set up where participants were randomly allocated to one of two conditions: group A: exposure to only technical and economic information, and group B: exposure to technical, economic and social information. With a Mann-Whitney U test, it was determined whether there were differences between the two groups.<br/><br/>The results of this study indicated that the inclusion of social aspects leads to more socially responsible decisions in the heat transition for nine out of 20 neighbourhoods, meaning that neighbourhoods with specific social characteristics are prioritised more than after including this information. These neighbourhoods often had extreme values for the social indicators. For example, neighbourhoods with high public participation or support were prioritised more. Future research should study which social factors increase residents’ participation or public support so policymakers can meaningfully include such social indicators for heat transition decision-making. Another interesting finding is that many policymakers (and therefore municipalities) seemed to have diverging approaches to the heat transition. Future studies should research what causes these differences between municipalities by focusing on personal (of the policymaker) or organisational (of the municipality) characteristics.<br/><br","Energy Justice; Heat Transition; social indicators; Energy transition; Decision-making; Experimental Research","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

KL Cityhopper (KLC) noticed they create food waste onboard of their European flights because they have a one-fits-all catering solution. They are aware that all back-up food and beverage options brought into the air cause extra weight and extra CO2 emission. They want their catering to have the option to be personalized to the needs of their passenger. This graduation project explores a new more sustainable way of providing a catering service to the passenger for the KLC Fairline. <br/>The internal and external analyses have been done to explore the current aviation catering and the behaviour of passengers; all gave valuable insights. The internal analysis showed that the catering on short haul is not possible to customize in advance. It is a free product provided during the flight and the passengers are not completely informed about what can be expected. While the longer flights have communications and choices in advance for the different types of catering onboard. Next to that, there is limited insights to the actual use of the service onboard. The competitors show in advance what can be expected of the free or paid services, using onboard magazines or websites with short movies. Resulting in insights about specific use per location.<br/>The passengers of KLC are demographically quite different, better to describe them by their needs during the journey. These diverse needs in the passenger travel journey are further explored by interviews, with the focus on the time they spend waiting at the airport.<br/>The future economy catering service of the KLC Fairline should be a brand store at the major airports, so KL can make use of this store too. The passengers can pick-up their own food and beverages and take it with them on the plane. The service will provide more options to fit better with the diverse food and beverage needs of passengers. <br/>The brand store is more sustainable solution because it will remove all catering trolleys from the planes on the short haul, it reduces weight and CO2 emission. The food waste will decrease significantly since the store has a system to keep track of the actual use of the service, further optimization of the service use is possible. The passengers informed of what is possible with the catering using information online, in e-mails and the KL-app.<br/>A roadmap for the KL catering service is made that includes the short, medium and long-haul flights.

Proton therapy may allow for significant sparing of the organs at risk, reducing the incidence of treatment-related morbidities. The aim of this study is to develop a treatment strategy that is robust to motion and uncertainties in intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) for the treatment of LACC.<br/>Materials and methods: Data from 14 LACC patients was included in this study. For each patient, a full and empty bladder planning CT (pCT) scan before treatment and four weekly repeat CT (reCT) scans after daily fraction were available. The full and empty pCT scans were used to create the patient-specific motion model of the cervix-uterus. An anisotropic CTV-to-ITV margin to expand this motion model was explored to account for uterine interfraction target motion. Subsequently, the motion model was divided into subranges to create a library of 1 to 4 plans, depending on the uterine motion due to bladder filling. Range and geometric uncertainties in the treatment of LACC are accounted for by robust optimization and evaluation. For each plan in the plan library, a treatment plan is created using the Erasmus-iCycle treatment planning system, taking into account EMBRACE-II constraints. To investigate whether the combination of margins, plan library, and robustness recipe is safe considering geometric and range uncertainties, ten treatments for each of the fourteen patients were simulated. These simulations were performed by recalculating the optimized treatment plans on the reCT scans with added uncertainties. We assumed that the target coverage was sufficient if the D95 of the target volumes was greater than or equal to 95% in at least 90% of the patients.<br/>Results: Of the 3430 margin recipes that were tested, the margin recipe with 95% cervix-uterus overlap and the smallest target volume was 1, 5, 7, 3, and 3 mm in the left/right, posterior, anterior, cranial, and caudal directions, respectively. The subranges of the motion model were expanded with the anisotropic margin recipe, after which robust optimization (setup robustness 5 mm, range robustness 3%) and evaluation (32 scenarios) of the treatment plans were performed. The treatment simulations showed that the D95 was greater than 42.75 for 99% and 92% of the patients for the cervix-uterus target volume and nodal target volume, respectively. <br/>Conclusion: The anisotropic margin and robustness recipe was robust to motion, geometric uncertainties, and range uncertainties when treating LACC patients with IMPT. Both values comfortably met the delivered dose criterion, indicating the strategy can be further improved.","Proton therapy; Cervical cancer; Treatment planning strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Technical Medicine | Imaging and Intervention","",""

(mentor); Hultink, H.J. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Universiteit Leiden (degree granting institution)","2022","br/>Pure mycelium materials are a novel type of biobased materials that provide an alternative to otherwise polluting leather products and meat. Pure mycelium is considered a sustainable material as it is being produced through biofabrication while making use of renewable biomass resources or waste streams. However, the production of this pure mycelium results in a waste stream itself. This waste stream consists mostly of the spent mycelium substrate (SMS) used for its production along with a smaller share of pure mycelium waste (PMW) which cannot be used for its intended purpose due to contamination with substrate particles. The current knowledge gap with regards to the lack of appropriate options for its valorisation results in these waste streams to be composted and provides a serious burden to producers of mycelium materials as this disposal is costly. Additionally, composting of these mycelium waste streams is considered unsustainable according to the principles of the circular bioeconomy (CBE). The CBE is suggested as an alternative economic system that is to overcome the problems that are inherent to our present linear economic systems e.g., resource depletion and environmental degradation. This thesis aims to determine the potential for valorisation of these mycelium waste streams to support operationalisation of the CBE and to improve the cost-efficiency of pure mycelium materials.<br/><br/>To assess this potential, the characteristics of the mycelium waste streams are synthesized from the literature and various options for its valorisation are identified from the literature based on these characteristics. The environmental impacts (GWP, water- and energy consumption) and economic viability of the identified valorisation options are determined by studying available lifecycle impact assessments and techno-economic assessments of processes comparable to those for the valorisation of the mycelium waste stream. Additionally, the eco-efficiency, or the relation between the environmental costs per monetary unit benefit of these valorisation options is calculated with the idea that this provides a more straightforward answer as to what would be the most favourable options for this valorisation based on the separate assessments of environmental impacts and economic viability.<br/><br/>The results of this study suggest that there are several economically viable options that theoretically provide the potential to support operationalisation of the CBE through the valorisation of mycelium waste streams. These are the production of mushrooms, cellulase and fuel pellets for the valorisation of the SMS and extraction of dietary fibers and phenolic compounds from the PMW. The production of fuel pellets is considered the preferred option for valorisation of the SMS due to its fast ROI. However, it does not provide the possibility for optimalisation of biomass resource utilisation. Furthermore, the identified options for valorisation of the PMW are not desirable due to their extremely high environmental impacts. Nonetheless, the production of fuel pellets from the SMS provides the opportunity to improve the cost-efficiency of pure mycelium production as it makes up the vast majority of the mycelium waste streams.<br/><br/>Additionally, the novel synthesis of mycelium waste characteristics provides the potential to study additional options for valorisation of mycelium waste streams in the future. These options could potentially provide the possibility to improve the cost-efficiency of pure mycelium production while simultaneously allowing an optimisation of the utilisation of the resources used for its production. Furthermore, the findings of this study suggest that a different approach in the decision-making of appropriate options for valorisation of biomass waste streams, including mycelium waste streams, is required. An initial idea for a potential decision-making tool is therefore provided.<br/><br/>Lastly, the findings of this study provide the first indication of the possibility to capture economic value from a waste stream that provides a growing burden to the mycelium materials industry. This will allow reductions in the cost price of pure mycelium, making it available to a larger group of consumers and allowing the release of their full potential through increased substitution of otherwise polluting materials and meat.","Mycelium; Valorisation; bioeconomy; Circular economy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

While the material provides many benefits, plastic pollution poses a heavy threat to the environment. To reduce the environmental impact of plastics while still benefitting from their use, various certifications aim at labelling different plastic products as sustainable. To ensure that those certifications really label plastics that contribute to sustainable development, it is important to analyse which labels are scientifically sound and useful instruments to enhance environmental standards, and which might contribute to greenwashing. However, a certification can only be as good as the practical implication it has. The example of Berdal Rubber &amp; Plastics BV, a Dutch producer of plastic buckets and tubs, shows that a key challenge arises from communicating the importance of adopting such certifications to business customers, in their case, especially in the building and DIY industry. Hence, this research tackled the following research question: How can the scientific soundness of sustainable plastics certifications in the European building and DIY industry be assessed and how can the importance of using such certifications be successfully communicated to the buyers and end-users of plastic products? To answer this research question, inductive research making use of a mixed-methods approach has been conducted, in which Berdal served as a case study. As a first step, this research developed an analysis framework for certifications, then, it researched what a successful communication strategy for certifications that includes said framework can look like. A major challenge that has been identified is to change the sometimes still unfavourable attitudes towards certifications and sustainability found within the building and DIY industries. Additionally, the low understandability of certifications limits their use, while being difficult to target by communication strategies. However, communication on certifications and sustainability can be more successful when it considers certain aspects. Especially the dialogue with stakeholders and credibility through proactiveness are seen to be important. Target group specific communication that focusses on personal relevance is found to be another aspect to consider. Here, the role of the framework can be to present information in a clear and detailed way, and to be an instrument to point out the advantages a specific certification can have for the communication’s receiver. For the specific situation of the case study of Berdal, it has been found that setting up a reciprocal dialogue, especially with their buyers, and emphasising the credibility of their message about certifications by focussing on their reliability and standard setting can be beneficial. Additionally, the focus of communication should lie on the personal benefits of their stakeholders individually. The framework for Berdal as a plastics producer can be used to transparently show why certain certifications have been chosen or how they compare to others.","Sustainability; plastics; communication","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

The parsing machine architecture was developed by formalizing the fundamental PEG expressions and creating a micro-architecture based on these PEG expressions, which led to the specification of the PPEG instruction set architecture. This architecture was then mathematically formalized and a proof for its strict adherence to the formalized PEG behavior was provided. The parsing machine architecture was implemented on an FPGA, a virtualization of the parsing machine was implemented in Python for easy analysis of its behavior, and a PEG compiler and assembler were developed for the PEG-PPEG translation. Finally, a memoization unit was developed as an extension to the parsing machine for an improved parsing throughput.<br/><br/>By running benchmarks for CSV, XML, JSON, and Java files on the PPEG parsing machine implementation, its parsing behavior was analyzed and compared to existing solutions. This showed that the minimum stack sizes depend solely on the size and complexity of the PEG; the percentage of clock cycles spent on jumps in instruction and data memory is substantial, ranging from 18\% and 40\%; the PPEG-compiled binary code size is relatively small compared to other solutions; and the throughput of the PPEG parsing machine is comparable if not better than other solutions running on faster hardware.

Interpreting unstructured texts in natural language is a crucial task for computers. Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications rely on semantic networks for structured knowledge representation. Although NLP technologies have been applied to various domains with some degree of success, they still face many challenges due to the ambiguity of human language. To inform better algorithms, we need to pay attention to fundamental structures of semantic networks in different languages. However, these remain to be investigated properly. In this thesis we extract semantic networks with 7 distinct relations for 11 languages from ConceptNet. We systematically analyze the degree distribution, degree correlation and clustering of these networks. We also measure their structural similarity and complementarity coefficients. Our findings show that semantic networks have universalities in basic structures: they have high sparsity, high clustering, and power-law degree distributions. Our findings also show that the majority of the considered networks are scale-free. In addition, our results show that networks in different languages exhibit different properties, which are determined by grammatical rules. For example, the networks of highly inflected languages show peaks in the degree distributions that deviate from a power-law. Furthermore, we find that depending on the type of semantic relation and the language, the connection principles of networks are different. Some networks are more similarity-based, while others are more complementarity-based. We conclude the thesis by demonstrating how the knowledge of similarity and complementarity can better inform NLP in link prediction tasks.","Semantic Networks; Topological Properties; Semantic Analysis; Graph Theory; Similarity; Complementarity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Wireless Communication and Sensing","",""

In this research, experiments were done on the SiC-Al2O3 UF membrane fabricated by LPCVD to study its chemical stability in a NaClO solution and its fouling features when filtrating sodium alginate and surface water under constant flux cross-flow mode. The backwash efficiency and the fouling resistance were analysed as well to further elucidate the fouling composition. <br/>According to the results, the SiC-Al2O3 membrane coated under higher temperature (860°C) remained stable in the NaClO solution for 200 h, (1% for 100 h and then 5% for 100 h) while the membrane coated under lower temperature (750°C) showed a water permeability increase during chlorine treatment, indicating the dissolution of the SiC layer. The high temperature coated membrane (860°C) had a better antifouling ability than low temperature coated mem-brane (750°C) and the pristine membrane especially when filtrating the pure sodium alginate (SA) solution without Ca2+ under normal flux (170 LMH) or the surface water under lower flux (65 LMH). Cake filtration was observed in the fouling curves when the critical flux was not exceeded. The addition of Ca2+ into the pure SA solution resulted in the decrease of elec-trical repulsion and the increase of bridging between foulants and membrane surface. These led to the severe fouling of the high temperature coated membrane. The low temperature coated membrane had better antifouling ability than high temperature coated membrane and the pristine membrane when 2 mmol/L of Ca2+ was added. However, the backwash (back-wash flux of around 340 LMH for normal flux condition and around 195 LMH for lower flux condition) was not efficient for all the membranes and should be improved in the future ex-periments. <br","SiC; Al2O3; Ceramic membranes; calcium; Sodium Alginate; surface water; chemical stability; sodium hypochlorite; ultrafiltration (UF); LPCVD","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-29","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Solar Electric Vehicles recently emerged in the market to solve dilemmas that have been hindering the EVs mass uptake: limited driving range, long charging time, and limited charging infrastructures. The SEV utilization is especially interesting for those who live in areas with many sun hours annually but have limited EV charging infrastructures. Interestingly, Indonesia is located along the equator, lacks EV charging facilities, and has a big market size for SEV. Even more, Indonesia has the urge to boost its decarbonization to meet its climate goals, especially in its transport sector. The combination of these facts leads to the overarching question if SEV could be easily mass adopted in Indonesia. However, the TIS perspective argues that, as part of a complex system of systems, SEV would need not only good technological features but also other “actors, factors and functions” to help it to reach its mass adoption (Ortt et al., 2013). Therefore, it leads to the main research question:<br/><br/>“From the technical innovation system perspective, how could solar electric vehicles reach mass adoption in Indonesia?”<br/><br/>This research is conducted in collaboration with Lightyear – a SEV producer. As Lightyear is aiming to mass produce its SEV, therefore, this research is conducted to explore and evaluate the Indonesian market, so that the best strategy recommendation could be provided to Lightyear so it could commercialize its SEV in a large scale in Indonesia. The qualitative research approach is implemented in this research by reviewing diverse online literature, including both scientific and grey literature. <br/><br/>The TIS Framework (Ortt &amp; Kamp, 2022) and the Ten Niche Strategies framework (Ortt et al., 2013) are used as the starting point of the research. TIS is defined as innovation systems around a specific technology that consists of four main elements: the technology, a network of actors, the institutions, and the demand. Ortt &amp; Kamp’s TIS framework is a tool to examine the TIS of an innovation that is in its adaptation phase to judge whether the innovation is ready for its mass uptake or whether a small-scale niche introduction strategy is needed prior to the large-scale diffusion. The framework consists of three major elements: TIS building blocks (most important aspects needed for large-scale diffusion), influencing factors, and strategies. When certain influencing factors negatively affect the completeness of the TIS building blocks, they pose as barriers to the mass adoption of the innovation. Certain strategies could be implemented to circumvent these barriers, such as the generic Ten Niche Strategies proposed by Ortt et al. <br/><br/>The research is conducted in four major steps. First, basic information about SEV technology is explored. Second, a new framework called “the Best Strategy Framework” is developed to extend and complete the original TIS Framework and Ten Niche Strategies Framework so that the users/readers could select the best strategy based on the combination of barriers that hinder mass adoption of the innovations. Third, the newly developed framework is used to evaluate the Indonesian market and to identify the barriers that might hamper Lightyear’s SEV mass adoption in Indonesia. Finally, by using the newly developed framework, the best strategy that could circumvent the identified barriers is selected and proposed to Lightyear.","Green mobility; Technological Innovation System; Barriers and Strategies Analysis; Indonesia; Solar Electric Vehicle","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Searching for alternative water resources could alleviate this issue. Municipal sewage reclamation with ceramic NF membrane has gained momentum nowadays. However, the inevitable fouling, especially organic fouling during membrane filtration, is the major limitation of the application. To mitigate the fouling issues and protect the membrane from frequent sodium hypochlorite cleaning, a reaction-based CaCO3 pre-coating method, which could prevent the direct contact of foulant and ceramic NF surface was developed. Acid cleaning was applied to initiate the reaction between CaCO3, which was attached with foulants (sodium alginate) and acid. Lastly, forward flush was implemented to remove the loosened CaCO3 and sodium alginate layers.<br/><br/>The effectiveness of hydrochloric acid cleaning, formic acid cleaning and citric acid cleaning was studied in this paper. Citric acid was found to be the most effective way of cleaning because of the highest permeability recovery rate obtained and the lowest consumption rate of the pre-coating layer. This could be ascribed to the carboxyl groups chelation with calcium ions and the ‘peeled’ chelates adsorbed with more foulants were flushed away. Formic acid was less efficient showing moderate efficiency. Besides, HCl cleaning restored the lowest extent of membrane permeability. Additionally, experiments of increasing the pre-coated CaCO3 amount (7655 mg/m2) to apply for more filtration/acid cleaning cycles were executed. The effectiveness increases in the order of HCl, formic acid and citric acid. The pre-coated membrane cleaned with citric acid could last for the whole six cycles, while the membrane cleaned with HCl only worked in the first three cycles. Lastly, the effect of bubbles generated during the reaction was explored using CaHPO4 as a pre-coating layer. However, the hypothesized positive impact of bubbles was not verified.<br","ceramic membrane; calcium carbonate pre-coating; fouling; municipal sewage; sodium alginate","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-30","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Since CO2 transport is capital intensive, this research proposal focuses on the identification of potential options of finance for the different CO2 transport assets and how these affect the cost of capital, as well as the implications for the overall cost of carbon transport. The research takes a mixed methods approach, combining a thorough literature review, financial modelling and semi-structured interviews with experts. The research focuses on a large-distance route in Europe, with an assumed time horizon starting from 2030 onwards. The results show that depending on the transport asset, distance and quantity transported the financing costs can play a key role and different financing structures can change the merit order in terms of costs.

(graduation committee); Pisano, F. (graduation committee); Zhou, H. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Suction caissons have been used extensively for anchoring and supporting the offshore installations like oil platforms and wind turbines. These foundations are normally subjected to complex combinations of the vertical, horizontal and moment loads (i.e. V, H, M) from the self-weight, wind, wave and currents. In the past decades, extensive studies have been conducted to investigate the combined V-H-M loading behaviour of suction caissons in clay. However, most existing studies are focused on the ultimate bearing capacity, while the deflection response is more critical in foundation design for recent infrastructures like offshore wind turbines. Due to the complex load conditions, predicting the three-dimensional (3D) deflection response of the foundation is still challenging. Machine learning (ML) appears on the research horizon due to its excellent capacity of solving nonlinear problems with desired speed and accuracy. However, conventional machine learning approaches were limited in their capacity to analyze raw natural data without artificial interventions. Meanwhile, the deep learning technique (DL), as a branch of machine learning, allows a machine to be fed with raw data, automatically extract the features, and discover intricate structures in high-dimensional data. The deep learning technique has been used in many fields like language translation, auto-pilot and image recognition. And Deep neural networks, including deep learning algorithms and architectures, are gradually being developed. In light of these backgrounds, this study proposed to develop a deep learning based surrogate model to predict the 3D deflection response of suction caissons under combined V-H-M loading. The advanced three-dimensional nonlinear finite element (FE) simulations under complex V-H-M loading paths were performed on suction caissons of different geometric configurations and in clay soils with different stiffness and strength properties. The 3D FE simulation data was then used to train the deep learning based design model. Three popular neural network structures, i.e., Feed forward Neural Network (FNN), Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) have been employed to develop the hybrid surrogate design model. In this study, two different training strategies were proposed for this geotechnical problem. In the first category, the 3D load-deflection behaviour of suction caisson is idealized as a point-to-point mapping problem, i.e. mapping between the deflections (i.e. displacement and rotation) with loads (i..e force and moment). This task was achieved by Fully-Connected Neural Network model (FC-NN) based on FNN, One Dimension Convolution Neural Network model (1D-CNN) based on CNN and Long Short Term Memory model (LSTM) based on RNN. In the second training strategy, the load-deflection response was idealized as a time series process, a line-to-line mapping problem, mapping between the past loading paths (i.e. 10 groups of forces and moments) with future loading paths (i.e. 90 groups of forces and moments). Besides the three neural network models mentioned before, another two complex and advanced models, LSTM Model combined with convolution neural network (1D-CNN+LSTM) and Temporal Convolutional Network model (TCN), are also applied for temporal prediction. The performance and training efficiency of these models were also systematically evaluated by interpolation and extrapolation experiments. Basically, all the models can well capture the 3D deflection response of the foundation with significantly high accuracy (i.e., root mean squared error is smaller than 0.05 and coefficient of determination is near 1.000) than the traditional design approach (such as macro-elements model), and with greater efficiency than the 3D FE simulations. Among all the models, the TCN model has the highest prediction accuracy and robustness. However, the FC-NN model has the simplest model structure and highest computational efficient in learning the non-linear relationship between deflection response and V-H-M load. Besides capturing the relationship between input and output, the deep learning model can also assist to identify the intrinsic failure mechanism. By observing the fluctuation of generalisation ability, the evolution of the failure mechanism of suction caisson with embedment depth was revealed.","Shallow foundations; Numerical model; Deep Learning; Model comparison; Undrained behavior","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-26","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

ERTMS will influence the train drivers and dispatchers the most, especially due to the introduction of the signalling and control element of ERTMS: the European train control system (ETCS). A reliability requirement for the migration towards ERTMS obligates to demonstrate that the reliability of the system stays the same or improves. Reliability can be quantified if all the possible risks are known, but identifying risks with traditional models is insufficient, because they do not capture the complexities and dynamics of socio-technical systems. <br/><br/>The hazard analysis technique ‘systems theoretic process analysis’ (STPA) is a promising technique to sufficiently identify hazards that models the system in a control structure and searches systematically for hazards. The main research question of this thesis is: ‘To what extent can STPA be applied to identify risks and determine the system reliability of interactions between ETCS, train drivers and dispatchers?’ What are the risks caused by those interactions and how can STPA be applied for an effective risk assessment are the two research objectives.<br/><br/>STPA consists of 4 structured steps. First the analysed system is described and the purpose of the analysis is set. The system is modelled in a control structure in the second step. The third step of STPA is to identify unsafe control actions with guided words. 27 unsafe control actions are identified for the 8 control actions that are present in the control structure. The last step of STPA is to identify loss scenarios that could lead to the unsafe control actions, those were formulated with system experts.<br/><br/>The desk research and this research demonstrates that STPA is completer and more thorough in identifying hazards than the tradition hazard analysis technique ‘failure mode effect and criticality analysis’ (FMECA). In this research, STPA identified 70 loss scenarios in the analysed procedure (compared to 4 issues identified with FMECA), those hazards ranged from missing or inadequate feedback mechanisms to inconsistent process models of the train drivers or dispatchers. STPA identified besides technical failures also design flaws in the procedure and unsafe interaction between the ETCS, train drivers and dispatchers.<br/><br/>Besides the conclusion that STPA turned out to be more complete and thorough in identifying hazards, another advantages of STPA is that performing STPA is very structured and not superficial. An identified disadvantage of STPA is that the method stops immediately after the hazards are defined. Determining the probability of occurrence and the impact expressed in train delay minutes can result in prioritization of the hazards and a better risk assessment. <br/><br/>To conclude, this research recommends applying STPA for complex systems where multiple controllers are involved. An STPA expert, someone who has experience with applying STPA in different projects, is a key to successfully implement STPA in an organisation.","ERTMS; ETCS; Reliability; STPA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Heavy rainfall during the monsoon period in combination with rapid urbanisation in the past decades causes an increasing amount of inundation events in the case study area Hanoi. The damage caused by these floods results in major economic losses that affect local citizens as well as governmental authorities. Flood waters are often heavily polluted with sewer water, threatening public health<br/>and reducing the overall livability of Hanoi. In addition, inundated streets are difficult to navigate, and waves induced by vehicles can lead to dangerous situations for pedestrians and other road users. This research aims to have a better understanding of the failure mechanisms of Hanoi’s drainage system, and the risks associated with each mechanism. Since there is no standard methodology for probabilistic risk assessment of urban drainage systems, the methodology for levee assessment was adopted and adjusted to the field of urban drainage. This straight-forward method is transferable to other study areas and results in clear and comprehensive fault trees which are easily interpreted by drainage authorities.<br/><br/>A combination of expert judgement, qualitative fieldwork and analysis of newspapers was used to obtain an overview of all failure mechanisms and presented in the form of a fault tree. To investigate the potential damage that could be done by each failure mechanism, a probabilistic risk assessment was done using the urban drainage modelling software PCSWMM, and the potential risk of each mechanism was quantified. For the mechanisms with an unacceptably high risk, potential solutions were proposed. Four failure mechanisms were found that pose an unacceptably high risk on the drainage system: increased catchment size, pipeline blockage, inaccessible drains, and design inaccuracies. Potential solutions are to incorporate Low Impact Development (LID) in the urban area such as green and blue roofs, infiltration trenches and rain barrels. This type of infrastructure reduces the hydraulic load on the drainage system by reducing the runoff peak. In this way, urbanisation goes hand in hand<br/>with preserving the natural flows. Other recommended solutions are to revise the cleaning schedule to make it more efficient, and raise awareness among local inhabitants to enlarge their role in the functioning of Hanoi’s drainage system.","urban flooding; Hanoi; probabilistic risk assessment; fault tree analysis; PCSWMM; integrated 1D-2D modelling; LID","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","","21.028511, 105.804817"

An abundance of phosphate (and other nutrients) in a water body is called eutrophication. Eutrophication can lead to algal blooms which result in very low oxygen concentrations in the water. Other species, like fish and aquatic plants, can die because of the lack of oxygen. Most WWTPs in the Netherlands are performing well and reach phosphate effluent concentrations below 1 mg/l. Nevertheless, Dutch water authorities are looking for ways to improve nutrient removal to perform even better then the WDF guidelines. At the same time they are anticipating on the expectation of more strict phosphate effluent targets in the future.<br/><br/>This research is focusing on VFA production from the sieved fraction of activated sludge. Sieves with a mesh size of 0.5 mm were used to sieve cellulose fibers from the sludge. Microbial conversion processes are stimulated in the VFA production reactors. A pilot plant that was performed resulted in very high phosphate concentrations in the reactor. The first phase of this research was devoted to identifying the source of the high phosphate concentration. The second phase was focused on phosphate removal and recovery strategies. <br/><br/>It was found that 20% of the sievings consisted of PAO sludge.

It was not able to precipitate struvite at the low pH levels at which the VFA production reactor was operated. Calcium carbonate addition could decrease phosphate levels (50%) and can be used to control pH in the reactor. The applied method does not allow for easy recovery because the precipitate ends up in the sievings. Finally vivianite precipitation was achieved by adding FeCl2. 90% phosphate removal was achieved. The para-magnetic property of vivianite allows for easy recovery with a magnetic separator.

Integration of operations is necessary for cost efficient omni-channel implementation, however little scholarly works exist exploring operational implications in the omni-channel context. The impact of operational philosophy is analysed through a discrete events simulation of the alternative operation designs. Through a sensitivity analysis on order arrival pattern and order type skewness, the performance of the design alternatives are compared. The considered operation designs have been found in literature. For realistic input values a case is considered of a distribution warehouse from a Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) supplier. From the results it is apparent that in an omni-channel warehouse, a dedicated zone is required to handle expected web order throughput efficiently, although such an operations design requires lots of space, which is often constrained. Space is constraint due to supplier seeking to integrate the online channel into existing operations, which turns out not to be durable. Therefore, it is concluded that for future throughput non of the considered operational philosophies is adequate.","Discrete Event Simulation; Case study; Omni-channel; Warehousing; Operations design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Multi-Machine Engineering","",""

The value of teleconsultation for the management of chronic diseases is being explored as well. It is widely proved that building a trustworthy relationship between doctors and patients is the key point for long-term care. However, in the new context of teleconsultation, the interaction between patient and doctor has changed dramatically. The expansion of physical distance and the involvement of new technologies have affected the building of trust. Therefore, studying patient trust building in a digital context is crucial to implementing teleconsultation for the long-term management of chronic diseases in the future.<br/><br/>Through a contextual study of the challenges and opportunities in healthcare and technology, a future vision of teleconsultation was generated in the Understand stage (Chapter 2) as the background for implementing the trust design. A literature review was then conducted for an in-depth understanding of patient trust in teleconsultation, identifying the characteristics, consequences, and predictors of trust.<br/><br/>At the end of this chapter, a distinction was made between trust attitudes and trust behaviors. The pathways by which trust attitudes influence the three focused patient behaviors (ITU, Continuity, and Adherence) were demonstrated through a conceptual framework explaining the scenario in which trust attitudes and behaviors are consistent.<br/><br/>The reasons for the inconsistency of trust attitudes and behaviors were explored in the Explore stage (Chapter 3) through qualitative research. Four patient archetypes were first classified according to whether patients' attitudes and behaviors were consistent. The trust-related attitudinal and behavioral characteristics of each archetype and the respective needs were then elucidated through interviews to address the scenario of inconsistency.<br/><br/>In addition, combining the findings of the theoretical study in Chapter 2 and the user interview insights in Chapter 3, five categories of factors that promote patient trust were identified. Considering the design feasibility and value in teleconsultation, the focus scope for the design of this project was positioned.<br/><br/>In the Design stage (Chapter 4), the findings from the research resulted in six design strategies to help designers design for patient trust. The six strategies were further discussed and categorized along three dimensions: the covered influencing factors, the implementation stage corresponded with patient behavior phases, and the value priority for four patient archetypes.<br/><br/>In the Deliver stage of the project (Chapter 5), patients and designers were invited to evaluate both the research outcomes and the design strategies. Ultimately, all research outcomes and final design strategies on trust were presented on an online website to provide design guidance and inspiration for future trust designers.","Patient Trust; Teleconsultation; Design Strategy; Behavior Change","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Noninvasive brain stimulation plays an essential role in diagnosing and treating diseases of the brain. This stimulation can affect disease-related changes in brain activation, inhibition, or connectivity. Ultrasound neuromodulation is a rapidly growing field of noninvasive brain stimulation. In a form of acoustic pressure waves, ultrasound can transmit mechanical forces to modulate neurons. The acoustic waves can be focused on a particular location with a spatial resolution that depends on the set frequency. Compared to other noninvasive brain stimulation methods, ultrasound neuromodulation is a safe and reversible method that can be used to accurately simulate neuronal circuits for the treatment of neurological diseases.<br/><br/>New medical ultrasound solutions, from ultrasound imaging to ultrasound neuromodulation and ultrasonic powering of medical implants, require a wearable form factor and low power consumption. In these applications, pulsers are the most power-hungry block since they deliver high voltages to the ultrasound transducers and transducers contain massive parasitic capacitance. The ultrasound transducer needs to be driven by a high voltage (HV) square wave so that it can generate desired pressure for ultrasound brain stimulation. Therefore, improving the power efficiency of the driver part is very important for the whole system.<br/><br/>The purpose of this thesis is to design an energy-efficient driver within a limited area. There are two energy-consuming parts in the driver circuit. One is the parasitic capacitance of HV transistors, and the other is the capacitance of the transducer. In order to achieve HV operations, the driver part is typically implemented with HV transistors which have massive parasitic capacitance and also consume large areas. To solve this problem, stacked 5 V CMOS transistors are implemented to replace HV transistors. As for the energy loss due to charging and discharging the ultrasound transducer, many energy-saving methods are introduced in the literature such as energy-replenishing technique, charge redistribution method, and multi-level pulse-shaping technique. The proposed design compared the advantages and disadvantages of these methods and made some improvements on the basis of these techniques.<br/><br/>This work presents a power-efficient high-voltage pulser to drive integrated lead zirconate titanate (PZT) ultrasound transducers for ultrasound medical applications. The proposed pulser employs charge redistribution technique by utilizing a storage capacitor to save part of the charges before discharging the transducer. Furthermore, HV transistors are replaced by stacked 5V CMOS transistors that allow delivering 10 V to the piezo transducer. The pulser is designed and simulated in 180nm CMOS technology with 10 V power supply and 15 MHz operating frequency. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed circuit improves the power efficiency by 30.55$\%$ compared to the traditional class-D pulser.","ultrasound neuromodulation; piezoelectric ultrasound transducers; high-voltage pulser; power-efficient driver; stacked architecture; charge redistribution","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-12-31","","","","","",""

Yet, a complete understanding of the underlying bi-directional pathophysiological mechanisms is lacking, hence obscuring effective diagnostic strategies, patient stratification and adequate administering of intervention therapies. Thus far, CRS has only been modelled in in vivo animal models, which are inherently limited in terms of experimental control and translatability of results to humans physiology. This underlines the need to develop more advanced in vitro models that accurately recapitulate the complex inter-organ cross talk responsible for the onset and progression of CRS. However, to date no such disease model system has been reported. <br/><br/>This project set out to design, develop and validate a microfluidic set-up, which would then enable the investigation of CRS in a three-dimensional environment. To that end, a theoretical framework covering all aspects related to Multi-Organ-On-Chip (MOoC) design was developed.

Various conceptual circuit designs were proposed and evaluated on the basis of the set requirements and their associated priority. <br/><br/>By executing feasibility studies, simulating computational fluid dynamics, designing specific organoid inserts and eventually setting-up the proposed microfluidic circuits, a better understanding of the technological and biological challenges to be addressed was obtained.

This research builds on previous publications, which have shown solar sailing to be a suitable propulsion method to visit NEAs. The dynamics of this problem are modelled within the Solar Sail Augmented Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BPS), and assume a near-term solar sailing technology level. A sequence generation algorithm is developed which generates trajectories to visit multiple co-orbital NEAs beginning at either the artificial co-linear equilibrium point SL1 or SL2. This algorithm develops trajectories with fixed controls to transfer between target asteroids, using Monte Carlo simulations to propagate a wide range of random combinations of settings before selecting those that perform the best. It is shown that the tuning performed within this research can generate a trajectory that enables 18 asteroid fly-bys within the selected nominal mission lifetime of ten years. Following this sequence generation, the first fly-by of the trajectory is optimised as proof of concept that each leg of the trajectory can be optimised for fly-by distance and velocity. An optimal control problem is developed, which is then implemented and solved using direct pseudospectral methods. The solution to this optimal control problem reduces the fly-by distance by 99.95 %, down to 158.73 km, while reducing the fly-by velocity by 9.68 % to 4.33 km/s.","Solar sailing; Co-orbital asteriods; near-Earth asteroids","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Commercial shipping contributes to these emissions by using fossil fuel as the only energy source to provide propulsion and power auxiliary systems. In order to reduce fuel consumption, much research is focused on increasing the efficiency of the propulsion system and reducing the required power consumption. In recent years an increasing amount of research focuses on utilizing wind energy as an alternative energy source. This is a renewable source of energy which is plentiful at sea. This thesis focuses on the novel concept of using a Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) as a means of ship propulsion and power generation. Existing Wind Assisted Ship Propulsion (WASP) systems can only be utilized in conditions when the ship is in transit and when the apparent wind conditions are favorable. The VAWT concept has the ability to generate power in wind conditions where conventional sailing systems are not functional, including when the ship is in port. This system can also be used as a thrusting device when the wind conditions are favorable for sailing systems. Therefore this system can be used more frequently which is beneficial for the overall power savings. The use of a VAWT for WASP in combined operation as a thruster and a power generator does currently not exist. Therefore the design of the rotor has to be investigated and optimized in order to evaluate effective designs for different conditions and to compare this device to existing sailing concepts. The aerodynamic performance of the VAWT will be evaluated using numeric simulation models. This model will be coupled to an optimization algorithm in order to find the optimal design parameters for different wind conditions and modes of operation. This project will result in a better understanding of the working principles of VAWT used for WASP and the potential energy saving of optimized designs for the operational modes as a generator, thruster and combined-operation. There is a large opportunity for capturing wind energy at sea. This project has the potential to add a new method of ship propulsion to reduce shipping emissions and reducing the cost of ship operation. When one or multiple of these systems can be applied on a large share of the worldwide shipping fleet, this research can contribute to the reduction of commercial shipping emissions.","VAWT; Wind assisted ship propulsion (WASP); Vortex model; VAWT thruster; Cyclorotor; Cyclogyro; Optimization; Nelder-Mead simplex; Sailing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-09-13","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Most TI applications have ultra low latency requirements that limit TI to short distances because the speed of light poses a constraint on how fast data can be transmitted over a distance. This thesis attempts to relax the delay requirements for enabling TI over long distances. This is achieved by locally simulating the physical interactions and tactile properties of the environment to provide instant haptic feedback regardless of network conditions. <br/><br/>Model Mediated Teleoperation (MMT) creates a local feedback loop using a model and lowers the network delay requirements of the system at large.

We implement a multi-purpose haptic framework attached to Unity that facilitates creating various TI testbeds and applications, and use it to analyze and benchmark our MMT design. We show that haptic feedback from stationary objects is completely unaffected by network delay with our MMT implementation, and narrow down the challenge to simulating dynamic objects. We demonstrate that the model inevitably diverges from the environment it simulates when movable objects are involved, and needs frequent corrections.","Tactile Internet; Model Mediated Teleoperation; Haptic Feedback","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-12-31","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

In the past several researches have been carried out on the effectiveness of an RTRM in reducing delay and improving punctuality. However, in most of these researches only one case study is used to test the RTRM. Still, it is unclear whether the results found for the application of an RTRM in one particular situation, are also valid for other situations (with different infrastructural and operational characteristics).<br/>With this research, the impact of different infrastructure layouts and traffic patterns on the effectiveness of rail traffic rescheduling models is investigated. It provides insight into whether the benefit of an RTRM depends on the infrastructure and timetable in the area where it is applied.<br/>For this purpose, an evaluation framework has been developed in which an RTRM can be tested using different infrastructure, operational and disturbance scenarios. In this framework, the RTRM is used to generate a real-time traffic plan for each scenario. These traffic plans are compared with the traffic plans of simple dispatching rules, that can be used in practice by dispatchers. For this comparison, KPIs such as the sum of consecutive delay (amount of delay that propagates within the network) and punctuality are used. This framework is applied to an alternative graph-based RTRM, which is formulated as a MILP (mixed integer linear programming).<br/>The results show that the improvement an RTRM can offer over simple dispatching rules, varies per infrastructure layout and traffic pattern. For some infrastructure and operational scenarios, the simple dispatching rules perform as well as the RTRM, which means that for these situations, implementing an advanced RTRM does have much added value. A trend has been observed that the effectiveness of the RTRM increases as more control options are available.","Railway traffic management; Traffic management system; Railway conflict resolution; Delay propagation; Alternative graph theory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Transport and Planning","",""

Intellectual monopolies are companies that build their wealth by excessive monopolising access to knowledge and converting it into intellectual rents, a type of intangible assets. <br/>The thesis are examined against the background of an overarching perspective on society as consisting of three spheres. Legal-political sphere is to develop laws and regulations; Economic sphere is about production, distribution (trading) and consumption of goods; Cultural sphere is to generate idea and knowledge.

In the first part, the research focuses on the macro-socialistic level first and then zooms in to business level (education technology) by analysing existing literature. This part investigates how intellectual monopolies emerge, first in general and then more specifically in digital education technology, and how they reduce freedom of education. More specifically, the thesis identifies economic, legal-political and cultural factors that promote intellectual monopoly in the digital industry, and explains how intellectual (near-)monopoly in digital education (e.g. in online-learning platforms, LMSs or video-conferencing software) arises as a consequence of particular relationships between the economic, legal-political and cultural sphere, where governments and international organisations give laws and regulation (e.g. IP law, education laws and regulation, the standardisation of education) that support the concentration of R&amp;D in a few giant digital high-tech companies and the growth of (near-)monopoly positions in the digital education technology market, enabling high-tech giants to extract what in this study is called ‘learning-related rent’ (tangible and intangible assets formed by controlling learning tools and learning content), and reducing freedom of education (the core component of the cultural sphere). <br/>In the second part, the thesis zoom in further to the university level and examines the possibilities decision-makers at universities have to expand freedom of choice in digital education technology for professors and students through a case study of a Dutch university.

Advancements in electronic devices have gave rise to tougher requirements thereby requiring the manufacturers to push the limits of consistency. This has lead to a need to enhance the accuracy of the chip manufacturing process. Wafer flatness is one of the primary prerequisites for attaining high accuracy in integrated circuit manufacturing. The high accuracy is achieved by incorporating optical lithography in the development of circuits with small feature sizes. The current lithography machine requires precise estimation of wafer flatness on a sub-nanometer scale for the elimination of deviations between the exposed region and the plane of focus. In this thesis, the point of focus is on the short stroke positioning system of a lithography machine. The critical aspect of flatness is interpreted by performing scanning operations on a wafer table surface. These operations provide an estimation of the types of deformations the wafer is subjected to. The wafer table acts as a wafer carrier, which undergoes lithography operations. Therefore, it becomes very critical to examine the nature of the wafer table. After performing scans for surface deformations, an optimization problem is formulated which involves placing piezoelectric actuators under the wafer table. The role of the piezoelectric actuators is to correct the wafer table thereby enhancing its flatness property. Through this research, the optimization yields to give a better estimation of flatness by placement of actuators. The problem formulation and the solution proposed are able to correct the flatness by approximately 95% of the initial deformation value. The work done in this research can be extended from an application point of view and can be utilized in estimating and correcting the deformations of any given structure. Since this research involved working in a 2-dimensional domain, the further implications of this research involves extending the proposed flatness correction technique to a 3-dimensional domain.","Flatness; Actuator Optimization; Deformation; Surface scanning; Wafer stage; Topology Optimization; Surface flatness; Actuators","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-09-28","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Structural Optimization and Mechanics","",""

One of the more difficult parts of using finite element software is deciding which solver method and solver parameters to choose, as the performance of the solver, and hence the performance of the whole simulation, depends on it.<br/>Pseudo time-stepping is a stabilisation method that is designed to lead to a stationary solution for a wider range of initial guesses compared to traditional Newton methods. During pseudo time-stepping, a CFL number is used. This CFL number is adapted each nonlinear iteration. In COMSOL the CFL number either depends on the iteration count, or the nonlinear error estimate and previous CFL number. In this case, the CFL number is a global value, but the pseudo time-step itself is local since it also depends on the mesh cell size.<br/><br/>In this research, a neural network is created to predict a local CFL number for pseudo time-stepping,<br/>such that the network accelerates convergence compared to the two CFL numbers for pseudo time-stepping in COMSOL and is generalisable. The convergence is assumed to be accelerated if the<br/>network predictions result in convergence in fewer nonlinear iterations compared to solvers that use<br/>each one of the two CFL numbers in COMSOL. The network is assumed to be generalisable if it is able to accelerate the convergence for different laminar flow problems in COMSOL on which the network has not been trained.<br/>A network with 2 hidden layers with each 16 neurons is trained on local data from element patches in order to make it generalizable. The element patch data points contain information of the central triangular element vertices, and of the vertices of the three adjacent elements. The local data consist of the velocities, pressure and residuals, as well as the cell Reynolds number and the element edge lengths. The loss of this network is the root mean squared error between the network output and a previously computed CFL target.

(graduation committee); Breedveld, P. (mentor); Mirzaali Mazandarani, M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Vitrectomy is an often performed procedure during eye surgery and requires a high-precision vitreous cutter. The production of these precise and lightweight vitreous cutters sets high demands on the manufacturing process. Trained technicians must assemble the device step by step and continuously check and validate the manufacturing process. Additive manufacturing on the contrary allows for non-assembly mechanisms that can be printed at once without requiring any post-assembling steps. However, a high-speed vitreous cutter design suitable for 3D Printing is not yet presented. This research aimed to deliver a 3D Printed driving mechanism design for a high-speed reciprocating needle used during vitrectomy that does not require post assembly steps from trained technicians. It was established that the driving mechanism should reciprocate two concentric needles by air pressure to cut vitreous. Currently used actuators are investigated and a prior attempt for a non-assembly vitreous cutter is analysed. The diaphragm and bellow-based design were considered a potential solution path. A suitable design for both potential solution paths is made. The bellow design consists of an inner and outer bellow to allow the passage of the needle. The diaphragm concept is already used for the first and only attempt to produce a non-assembly vitreous cutter. This prior attempt is further analysed and it became clear the damping of the diaphragm needed to be decreased to increase the speed of the backward motion. Therefore, a planar spring is added to the dual flat diaphragm design. Finally, the spring-reinforced dual flat diaphragm concept is selected for continuation and tested by using PolyJet prototypes. Tests are executed to determine if the requirements could be met, especially focussing on the speed and force requirements. Different spring shapes and thicknesses are tested. It became clear that the behaviour of the spring-reinforced diaphragms is suboptimal. The return time is higher than preferred and damping is still present in a large extent due to hysteresis. To improve the design it was decided to continue with tests where the start position is relocated to form a pretension and overcome the damping seen especially at the last part of the return stroke. Pretension appeared successful and showed a 98% decrease in return time, but the requirements for the speed could not be obtained. Altering the thickness of the spring led to a sufficient high backward force but did not show direct influence on the speed of the backward motion. Overall, a non-assembly vitreous cutter driving mechanism is made but not all requirements could be met. Exploring design directions which do have some drawbacks should be considered to offer a solution in the near future. Designing a driving mechanism that also requires 3D Printed flexible material, first requires a thoroughly material investigation to identify the mechanical properties and time-dependent behaviour such that a trustworthy design optimization can be made. However, a design for a non-assembly high-speed vitreous cutter is made and with the upcoming developments in the 3D Printing techniques and materials the design might form the basis of a high-speed vitreous cutter. This research tested the most ideal case and gave further insight bringing us a step closer towards a non-assembly high-speed vitreous cutter.","additive manufacturing; 3D Printing; non-assembly; print-in-place; vitreous cutter; spring; spring reinforced diaphragm","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

In building reconstruction, most works are based on point clouds because of their enhanced availability. In recent years, neural radiance fields (NeRF) have become a common function for implementing novel view synthesis. Compared to other traditional 3D graphic methods, NeRF-based models have a solid ability to produce photorealistic images with rich details that point clouds based methods cannot offer. As a result, we decided to investigate the performance of this technique in architectural scenes and look for ways to improve it for more significant scenes.<br/><br/>This thesis explores the ability to reconstruct large-field scenes with NeRF-based models. NeRF introduced a fully-connected network to predict the volume density and view-dependent emitted radiance at the special location, which will be projected into an image through classic volume rendering techniques. Due to the limitation of near-field ambiguity and parameterization of unbounded scenes, the original NeRF does not perform well on 360° input view, especially when the inputs are sparse. An inverted sphere parameterization that facilitates free view synthesis is introduced to address this limitation so that the foreground and background views can be trained separately. Besides that, we also compare the performance of tracing different light geometries, ray and cone, respectively. Meanwhile, to generate the reconstructed scene precisely, raw RGB images should be pre-processed to estimate the corresponding camera parameters. Finally, customized camera paths should be prepared to generate the final rendered video.<br/><br/>According to our experiments, training foreground and background separately is a promising method to solve practical large-scale scene reconstruction problems. A complete wrap-around view of the target building can be obtained using adjusted camera path parameters. Furthermore, introducing conical frustum casting into the original model also provides an alternative method to implement reconstruction. We named this method mip-NeRF++, which can contribute to the final results to some extent.","3D reconstruction; volume rendering; deep learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

These turbines allow for the harvesting of the power of the wind far offshore, where wind speeds are often higher.<br/><br/>Compared to their fixed counterparts, floating wind turbines allow for a certain mobility after the installation. This allows wind farm developers to consider layouts that change throughout the wind farm’s operational phase. The change in layout can increase the energy yield of the wind farm, which may reduce the cost of floating wind energy.<br/><br/>This Master’s Thesis presents a new method for wind farm layout optimization with movable floating offshore wind turbines. The objective function that is maximized is the annual energy production (AEP). The proposed method first finds the optimal installation locations of the turbines, then searches for the optimal wind farm layout for each wind direction while considering the movable range of the turbines. Different movable range sizes are considered in the analysis. These sizes range from small (there is almost no mobility allowed) to large (the turbine is allowed to move anywhere in the wind farm). The results show that the steepest gains are achieved for a movable range size of up to two rotor diameters (i.e., the turbine is allowed to move two rotor diameters in each direction, evaluated from the installation position). Above this range, a large additional movement is required for a minor increase in AEP. Moreover, for this movable range size, repositioning turbines is so effective that their installation positions almost do not affect the AEP.<br/><br/>In addition to the previous method, this Master’s Thesis also presents a novel method to assess the movable range of floating offshore wind turbines. In this method, it is assumed that the mobility is achieved by adjusting the mooring line lengths through a winch system on board of the floater. The proposed method optimizes the line lengths such that an equilibrium is obtained in the relocated position. Various locations are selected for the analysis that cover most of the mooring system footprint on the seabed. The results show that the assumed movable range shape is not the same as the actual movable range shape.<br/>For a 15MW floating offshore reference turbine, the movable range size with the steepest gains in terms of AEP (two rotor diameters) and the actual movable range are compared. The results show that the actual shape covers large parts of the circular shape.<br/><br/>In conclusion, large gains are expected in terms of AEP for movable floating offshore wind turbines. This brings us one step closer to reducing the cost of floating wind energy, which in turn increases its competitiveness with other energy resources.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore Engineering","",""

We applied the ACSA process and dataset to both the Dutch and Canadian NCSC and found that on average we can already automate the majority of advisories. This constitutes a significant workload reduction in comparison to the situation prior to the automation. Even better results are observed when looking at the performance of ACSA on specific vendors.

Within the past years, flooding has become a phenomenon which affects global, social, psychological and economic development. In Ghana there are major problems related to water and this has increased substantially over the years. Indeed, flooding is a major issue that is evident in urban sub-Saharan Africa and Ghana is no exception to this worrying phenomenon. <br/>Poor and inadequate infrastructure and urban drainage systems have increased the risk of flooding in Accra, a city that has had an exponential increase in population. Flooding has affected the economy of Ghana, claimed the lives of humans and animals and has caused the outbreak of infectious diseases. However, current flood risk management approaches in Accra, which include demolishing affected buildings, have not been effective enough to reduce the impacts of Ghana’s floods.<br/>This paper analyzes the current situation in Accra, the capital of Ghana, relating to floods, the factors that played a role in aggravating its effects, and how communities respond to flooding events. This is a main challenge Accra is dealing with and it is therefore imperative to look at the causes of flooding in Ghana as a country and propose an approach that can help mitigate the impact of floods. The challenge is to develop strategies for dealing specifically with increased vulnerability to flooding in order to reduce economic effects and save human lives, animals and properties. The study area consists of five local suburbs of Accra namely Agbogbloshie, Old Fadama, Adabraka, Weija and Alajo, which have been affected by floods. The effect of floods can be observed in an increased amount of flood events in these communities. <br/>This thesis therefore uses the concept of resilience as the basis in solving this problem. The problem is defined using literature review, a case study, field inspections and interviews. Resilience at multi-level governance level is studied using an analytical framework to examine what policies government authorities have adopted to stimulate the adaptation of Accra into a more flood resilient urban environment. The changes need to be implemented to improve upon the flaws are also studied. The challenges involved in multi-level governance of Flood Risk Management in Ghana from the perspectives of the various actors are also examined. This will help in filling the knowledge gap in the literature on multi-level governance arrangements and the challenges involved for Ghana in the context of Flood Risk Management. To do this, a case study approach in which the interactions between the actors, stakeholders and the policy instruments are looked at, is applied. <br/>The analytical framework is derived from the work of the five elements of flood risk management of Batica et al. (2013) and the two types of multi-level governance defined by Hooghe and Marks (2003). The findings from the analytical framework include key stakeholders in flood risk management as well as aspects of resilience and response and anticipation in flood risk management. Aspects of resilience in flood risk management strategies comprise Relief, Resist, Response, Recovery and Reflect strategies. The findings are used to analyze the effectiveness of existing strategies and recommend improvements. There are measures for resisting known flood risks, but their implementation is ineffective. Involvement of the local chiefs and key private sector organizations in flood risk management strategies in Accra would allow for advanced resilience regarding their responses to the impacts of land-use changes and the waste disposal in watercourses. This research shows that the effectiveness of flood risk management in Accra depends on implementation and enforcement.<br","Flood; Resilience; Multi-level governance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-09-30","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","","5.603700, -0.187000"

In order to do this a system where bose einstein condensation occurs is modeled as a Zero Range process which is a special case of a Markov process.<br/>First we made a single slow site Zero range process with uniform rates and see how this would be influenced by annihilating particles. For this system it is shown that, in the large system limit, the number of particles in the slow site is given by a differential equation. A series of realization of different sizes of this system are done to support that the fraction of the particles in the ground state converges<br/>to the differential equation.<br/>In order to relate this mathematical approach to physical Bose Einstein condensates it is established that the equilibrium distributions of multiple bosons in one system is the same as the detailed balance of a zero range process where the transition rates depend on the occupation of a site, with an indication function, that is equal to 0 when there are no particles at that site and some constant &#x1d450; if there is one<br/>or more particles at that site.<br/>In statistical physics we need to take the energy of the state of the system into account. If the particles do not have interaction with each other this is the sum over all particles of the energy of the particle site. As a zero range model only has rates with one particle hop we can see that the difference in energy of the system is equal to the difference in energy of the sites of hop. In order to stay in detailed<br/>balance the rate for the specific hop must be exp(BΔ&#x1d438;) times the opposite rate, where B = 1 / &#x1d458;_b &#x1d447;.<br/>Now we can go from any system with a set of spin orbitals and energies of those spin orbitals and design a zero range model where the spin orbitals correspond to sites of the zero range model with rates between those sites, such that the systems detailed balance distribution is the same distribution as the equilibrium of the physical system. In this zero range model an annihilation term is introduced.<br/>This can be any function of occupation for the site, but in this report a simple relation that decreases when Δ&#x1d438; increases is used.<br/>In order to see the effect on such systems the system is numerically approached for a 100 particles system in a 3 dimensional harmonic potential. This system is too complicated to get an differential equation that can be easily solved. Therefore it is approximated. This numerical approximation appears to have similar behaviour to the numerical approximation done in [3]. However the results are not identical.<br/>The advantage of the model in this thesis is that an annihilation therm can be implemented. This approximation of a 3 dimensional harmonic oscillator with annihilating particles is done. If annihilation is slow enough, the exited sites form a different equilibrium compared to a Bose Einstein condensate of non annihilating particles. This happens as long as there is a condensate in the ground state.","Bose-Einstein condensate; Zero Range process; Annihilation","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

However, large second-order wave forces cause the floating island mooring system to become expensive as the wave height increases. So, in many locations with an intermediate water depth, land reclamation is still a more economical solution. A breakwater connected to the wave-ward side of the floating island can reduce the mean wave drift force of the entire structure by attenuating wave energy and thereby lowering the mooring costs. In this thesis, the optimal geometry of this breakwater is designed.<br/><br/>An optimisation is performed to find the ideal geometry of this breakwater such that it attenuates the maximum amount of wave energy while experiencing a low mean wave drift force. A parametric design of a breakwater is made, with six varying factors/parameters that define its shape, such that the geometry could range from a flat plate just below the water line, a large box-type breakwater at the water surface, a deeply submerged wedge-type breakwater, or anything in between. ComFLOW (a simulation method for free-surface flow) is used to determine the mean wave drift force and wave attenuation performance of all the breakwaters in the design space for two different regular wave conditions: Wave Condition 1 with a wave height of 3.0 metres and a peak period of 6.0 seconds, and Wave Condition 2 with a wave height of 9.0 metres and a peak period of 10.4 seconds. After all ComFLOW results are gathered, an optimisation method Design of Experiments is used to map the dependency of the six input factors that define the geometry, on the performance of the breakwaters, to come up with the geometry of the optimal breakwater.<br/><br/>To obtain the most accurate representation of reality in the numerical environment of ComFLOW, a validation of the programme is performed in two phases. Firstly, ComFLOW results are compared to analytical formulas, derived from linear wave theory. And secondly, ComFLOW dissipation characteristics are compared with the results of a physical experiment involving a regular wave plunging over a barred beach profile. From this followed, a minimum of twenty cells is required at the height of the structure to give reliable results of the mean wave drift forces on the structure. ComFLOW results for the wave transmission, wave reflection and forces on the structure followed the same trend as linear wave theory, with a converging offset. The wave energy dissipation characteristics of ComFLOW of all different grid sizes used in comparison with the experiment in which waves were plunging over a breaker bar, showed results that were in compliance with the experiment.<br/><br/>In Design Iteration 1, 94 different geometries were simulated in ComFLOW, of which 46 were completely submerged. Around 80\% of all submerged breakwaters experienced a mean wave drift force in the opposite direction of wave propagation. An explanation for this negative mean wave drift force is sought by the set-up and set-down of the water level, which occur around breaking waves. This results in a difference in hydrostatic pressure, and if the breakwater is positioned in between, it will experience a mean wave drift force in the opposite direction of wave propagation. The length of the sloping beach of the breakwater needs to be shorter than the wave length; otherwise, the set-up will be above the beach, and this results in a contribution to the mean wave drift force in the same direction of the wave propagation. The optima found by \acrshort{doe} based on minimising the mean wave drift force were either a shallow box-type structure relatively far below the water surface or a large structure closer to the waterline with a sloping beach on its wave-ward side, which induces the waves to break and thus dissipate wave energy. For maximal wave attenuation performance, the height and length of the breakwater must be maximised.<br/><br/>A cost function is developed that computes the reduction in captical expenditures (\acrshort{capex}) the breakwater provides to the floating island. Therefore, the construction costs of the breakwaters and the reduction in the mooring costs of the floating island are calculated. The difference between the two is the total cost reduction that the breakwater provides. An optimisation is done on maximising this total cost reduction for Wave Condition 1, which resulted in an optimal design of a breakwater with a length of 10.0 metres, a depth of 9.6 metres, a draught of 6.2 metres and its wave-ward side is a sloping beach that induces the incoming waves to break. It can provide a cost reduction of 24.4 k\texteuro per unit width. Compared with a floating island designed by the 3-year Space@Sea project for a location in the North Sea, this breakwater would deliver a 51% mooring cost reduction and a 7.7% reduction in total costs.","breakwater; hydrodynamics; waves; optimisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Hydromechanics","",""

(mentor); Karremans, Erik (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The heating and cooling sector is one of the biggest sectors at this moment due to drastic fluctuations in climate parameters. Even though this sector helps in making sure everyone gets comfortable temperatures at the home, office, etc., there are environmental consequences attached to them. These consequences are in terms of emissions of greenhouse gases. Almost around 80% of the current greenhouse gas emissions are due to the demand for energy, mostly in the form of electricity and heat. Having looked at these emissions, the demand for heating and cooling in residential and commercial spaces is increasing day by day. The systems which provide the desired effect of cooling and heating use different working mediums i.e. fossil fuels and renewable sources which correspond to 75% and 22% usage in the EU currently. So, to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels, heat pumps came into the picture.<br/>A heat pump uses a refrigerant through which heat transfer is carried out to attain the desired temperature at a particular location. The properties of these refrigerants and other component-based parameters affect the COP (Coefficient of Performance) of the system. For a mobile system, i.e. a portable heating and cooling device used for military camps, agricultural purposes currently use fossil<br/>fuels which lead to enormous emissions, thus, these systems have to be redesigned by using vapor compression technology. One of the constraints is being able to use a refrigerant with GWP (Global Warming Potential i.e. a measure of the amount of heat a greenhouse gas traps in the atmosphere<br/>comparing it with the same amount of CO2) of less than 150. Aspen model was created to assess different refrigerant behavior under some constraints like a cooling capacity of 40 kW, a heating capacity of 60 kW, and an air-air system with an airflow rate of less than 10000 m3/h, these requirements are<br/>obtained from fossil fuel-based mobile systems, as these systems are air-air systems and system is kept outside the desired place, hoses have to be used to provide the air into and out of the system, thus, the specific air flow rate has to be achieved to get the desired temperature inside the desired place, similarly, 40-60 kW is a need for these systems due to high capacity applications. Sensitivity analysis of the aspen model was carried out by changing ambient temperature from 21 to 40 °C for cooling and -5 to 15°C for heating respectively, to quantify the behavior of refrigerants R290, R1234yf, R1234ze, R454C, R455A, R1270, R600a, R717, R516A. Exergy analysis was carried out along with the COP<br/>calculations to examine the second law efficiency for all the refrigerants to see the feasibility of these refrigerants being an alternative option for widely used R410A refrigerant. By varying a few parameters considered for the heat pump systems, optimization and sensitivity analysis resulted in finding the most<br/>suitable refrigerant for this system. For ease of calculations, a few assumptions and constraints were considered while simulating the system.<br/>The maximum COP value obtained for the refrigerants R290, R1270, R1234yf, R1234ze, R454C, R455A, and R516 for cooling effect are 1.75, 1.77, 2.09, 1.91, 2.18, 2.25 and 2.21 respectively and similarly for heating effect are 3.61, 3.26, 2.49, 2.72, 3.56, 3.67 and 3.68 respectively. These COP values are obtained when the pressure drop across the heat exchangers is zero, so, the values with a<br/>pressure drop of 0.5 bar will fluctuate a bit from these values. If not COP, it will surely affect all other component parameters. Apart from COPs, second law efficiency is also a crucial parameter to analyze the system performance compared to a Carnot system i.e. an ideal system. Exergy analysis helped<br/>in quantifying the second law efficiency of the system for each refrigerant, which is calculated by the ratio of the actual COP of the system and Carnot COP of the system (Calculated by taking the source and sink temperature values). The maximum second-law efficiency values obtained for the refrigerants<br/>R290, R1270, R1234yf, R1234ze, R454C, R455A and R516 for cooling effect are 0.32, 0.27, 0.2, 0.16, 0.29, 0.31 and 0.21 respectively and similarly for heating effect are 0.4, 0.41, 0.37, 0.45, 0.405, 0.42 and 0.41 respectively. So, by considering all the COP and second law efficiency values it can be<br/>concluded that a suitable refrigerant for this system with good performance as well as safe to use and handle is R455A, and other potential refrigerants being R454C almost similar performance with respect to R455A, and R290 and R1270 single component refrigerants with the concern of higher flammability<br/>can be used with further optimizations in the model.","Heat pumps; Vapour compression cycle; Low GWP Refrigerants; Exergy Analysis; Aspen Plus Modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In the upcoming years, freight transportation demand is expected to increase, and thus, raise the environmental impact of logistics service providers (LSPs). Transport and logistic activities are the second-largest emitters of greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) and have a significant impact on air quality, noise pollution, water quality, and, among many other, land take. In efforts to collectively reach the goal of reducing GHGE by at least 55% by 2030, compared to the 1990 levels, there is an increasing number of initiatives such as the Fit for 55 package, European Climate Law, EU strategy on adaptation to climate change, CO2 emissions from transport, EU emissions trading system, effort sharing, land use and forestry, and clean energy. Through these initiatives, governments aim to fight climate change and drive urban action that reduces greenhouse gas emissions and climate risks, while increasing citizens’ health, well-being, and economic opportunities. As part of the transport and logistics industry, LSPs play a significant role in changing the current trajectory of GHGE and other environmental problems. However, not many companies are acting upon these issues, and those who are, have not been ambitious enough. Some of the reasons include: the highly competitive, low margin, and capital-intensive market LSPs operate in, as well as the high level of green investment needed, the uncertainty of their payback period, the lack of employees with a focus on environmental initiatives, and the lack of a well-defined regulatory framework and financial incentives. In this context, research indicates that many of the barriers are highly influenced by how regulations are designed and how governments support LSPs in improving their environmental performance. To this end, many researchers have evaluated the relationship between environmental regulations, innovation, and a firm’s competitiveness. In this regard, evolutionary economists believe that environmental regulations can trigger innovation that may partially or more than fully reduce the costs of complying with them (increase in competitiveness) (i.e., Porter Hypothesis). In contrast, neoclassical economists believe that this “win-win” situation does not exist. To this date, the overall findings of the Porter Hypothesis have been inconclusive and context specific. Therefore, the objective of this study is to carefully evaluate the Porter Hypothesis in LSPs and understand whether environmental regulations are appropriately designed, understand the importance of the involvement of LSPs in the development of environmental regulations and provide insights on how they can design practical corporate environmental approaches. More specifically, the main research question the study aims to answer is: “Under which conditions can European environmental regulations increase competitiveness for Intra-European Logistics Service Providers (LSPs)?”...","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

Normally t-SNE embeds into Euclidean space, but recent work shows that embedding into hyperbolic space can lead to higher quality embeddings. Most notably on data containing hierarchical structures, as seen in single-cell measurements. As such it would be interesting to generalize computation of t-SNE embeddings to embeddings in hyperbolic space. A missing tool for this is the approximation of the objective and the gradient. This is needed as the cost for evaluating the objective and gradient is quadratic in the number of data points to be embedded. In practice such approximations are already used for Euclidean embeddings. In this thesis we introduce the first approximation scheme for hyperbolic t-SNE embeddings. To achieve this we generalize a Barnes-Hut approximation scheme to hyperbolic space. A major difficulty for this is to transfer the use of a quadtree in the Euclidean plane to hyperbolic space. We propose the usage of a polar quadtree in the Poincaré disk and show that our solution yields substantial gain in run time, in particular when embedding larger data sets, with the resulting embeddings being similar in quantitative and qualitative aspects.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""

While there is an extensive body of research on the topic of high tidal resource locations, little research exists on low tidal resource locations such as The Netherlands. The thesis aims to reduce this gap by designing the optimal Dutch tidal farm and determining its economic viability. Using Delft 3D and Telemac, 2D models are created to simulate the tidal resources based on shallow water equations. The models are used to determine the best location for the Dutch tidal stream farm through a multi-criteria decision making analysis using the analytic hierarchy process model. For the optimal location, a tidal cycle is extracted from delft dashboard data and the optimal configuration is designed. In the design stage of a tidal farm in low current velocities, the simulation shows the wake effect positively influences the production. The power production of such a tidal farm over a tidal cycle is calculated using various economic metrics. The results show that currently a tidal farm cannot be economically viable without substantial governmental support. However, this paper argues that tidal energy comes with a number of important benefits that cannot be neglected, such as sustainability, output consistency/predictability and potential future energy independency.<br/>Therefore, tidal farms in low resource areas show potential, but further technological-, economical-, and (geo) political developments are needed in the coming years for them to become sufficiently beneficial in the Dutch energy transition to a sustainable energy mix.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

This research aims to understand the circular transition in the context of the Netherlands’ construction and demolition waste management system. By using a mix-methods approach based on systems analysis and a material flow model, this study assesses the environmental impacts of 7 identified policies. The results found that implementing mandatory pre-demolition audits performed the best in increasing the upcycling and reuse rate from 8% to 23% by not only focusing on source reduction but also prioritizing reuse. The policy measure which focuses on waste identification, separation, and collection at the source with sorting obligations performed the best to recover the most amount of waste (20.3 million tonnes/year) and increase the total recovery rate to 83%. A scenario analysis done by clustering policies for a strategic focus found that recovering more waste on its own will not reduce carbon emissions in the long run unless it’s redirected towards low-carbon destinations. A recommendation to design effective circular policies for waste management is to include carbon emissions and upcycling and reuse-based indicators. <br/>From an academic perspective, this study integrates a partial life-cycle assessment into a material flow analysis by integrating carbon emissions into a material flow model. By synthesizing and using a multi-criteria framework to calculate potential impacts, this research adds to a growing literature in policy design.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Robotic manipulators are desired to keep their settling time as low as possible for the pick-and-place industry. If the settling time is lower, more cycles can be made, increasing productivity. For high-speed parallel manipulators, a significant vibration cause that increases the settling time is the movable mass and inertia. By dynamic balancing a manipulator, these vibrations can be eliminated. However, balancing a structure relies on adding mass and inertia to movable links, which decreases controllability. This thesis presents 2-DoF inherently dynamically balanced structures that make use of a constant inertia mechanism. Inherently balanced relies on structures that balance themself and do not need active counter-balancing, which is hard to control. A prototype of a 2-DoF, inherently dynamically balanced parallel manipulator is designed and optimized for controllability. By experimental verification, a reduction of 93.6% and 88.9% in shaking force and shaking moment, respectively, compared to the unbalanced case, is obtained for the first DoF and a 97.2% and 93.4% reduction, respectively, for the second DoF. The manipulator had a measured lowest eigenfrequency of 91 Hz and a workspace of about 20 cm. Up to 8 G of tip acceleration was achieved. So fully inherently dynamic balancing can be combined with high accelerations.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-09-27","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

At 100GHz operation frequency band, AiP is not only feasible but also mandatory for a high-density interconnect and efficient IC-antenna integration. Current packaging technologies such as LTCC, HDI, and E-WLB, and their feeding concepts limit the possibilities to achieve an optimum<br/>for the given silicon and antenna configuration, such as the complexity of the feeding network, the realizable thickness of metal or substrate material, and so on.

Our proposed pipeline exploits the object detection model (Scaled-yolov4) to detect fixed objects. The mean average precision with 50\% IoU threshold (mAP@.5) achieves more than 0.99 for all detected objects. Then use a self-supervised key-point detector and descriptor (SuperPoint). With the detected key-points, a feature matching technique based on graph neural networks (SuperGlue) is adopted to match the key-points on the target image with reference points annotated in the image databases (image DBs). The point-correspondences between the image coordinates and the 3D coordinates are applied to solve Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem to compute the orientation and position of each camera (Camera pose). The final camera pose estimation achieves a 5.79 pixel reprojection error with a 4.97 cm Euclidean distance error.<br/>Compared with other image-based camera pose estimation techniques, our pipeline requires no 3D reconstruction or 3D point cloud in the scene model.

A quantitative research approach, based on a survey of victims within a large Dutch telecom provider’s client database, is used to gain this understanding. This is aided by desk research, an interview with an active case of Flubot and expert input (employed by telecom providers and governmental bodies). The results from these research methods are put into context by making use of the Fogg Behavior Model, to better understand what might trigger certain target groups to or not to remediate the infection. The larger environment Flubot functioned in, is analysed too, as it was developed over time and by June of 2022 it had been taken down.<br/>This research has found that the detection methods used against Flubot, before it was taken down, were ineffective in detecting and stopping the spread of the malware. This is a result of a misunderstanding of the more recent workings of Flubot and a larger incorrect presumption that there was no urgency to do much about the malware. Furthermore, in the remediation process some important issues are unclear or unaddressed for victims, leading to a situation where it is often not clear what might have caused the infection or what can be done to prevent a future infection. It is important to prevent further infections, as similar malware does exist, functioning on similar principles, and there is a chance that Flubot might reappear.<br/>The research is based on victims and there was no target group reached that had not been victimised. This makes for a possibly skewed understanding of the situation which should be researched. The data has been gathered through one of the largest telecom providers of the Netherlands, which is not necessarily representative for the whole Dutch industry. Researching other telecom providers in and outside the Netherlands could provide a more comprehensive understanding. The research has led recommending an adaptive notification systems and improvements to the notifications currently used.","Remediation; SMS-phishing; smartphone malware; Survey","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

On the other hand, due to their minimal communication challenges, robot-like robots may function effectively in the human-robot interaction. Up to now, far too little attention has been paid to the increasing trend of the human-like robot. This thesis compared the performance of these two types of robots, which may help to explain why the trend is the way it is. Two research questions are created to accomplish this goal: Which type of robot, robot-like or human-like, produces the most fluent interaction in the elderly care scenario? Does the robot-like or human-like robot bring about the best memory performance in the music listening activity?<br/><br/>This thesis project aims to contribute to the development of the social robot in elderly care. In this thesis, a music assistance robot was developed, it can converse with the user while listening to music and recalling memories associated with the song. The elder's health and well being are benefited by this pastime. To address the question of which type of robot performs better, two types of robots, a human-like robot and a robot-like robot, were created to compare in terms of fluency in human-robot interactions and performance of memory recall during music listening activities. Four key elements: appearance, behaviour, voice and dialogue were used in the construction of two robot identities. Based on the robot we created, a joint music listening experiment was carried out. For evaluation, a questionnaire and video recordings of the interaction were both employed. This was tested with 30 volunteers (The young adults were chosen for the experiment due to COVID restrictions and time limitation), and it was discovered that the human-like robot performed better overall.","Robot; Music; Human-like robot; Robot-like robot; Fluency; Memory recall","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

Therefore, a tremendous amount of research is going on to solve this problem. This thesis focuses on solving the problem of nitrogenous emissions by capturing ammonium emissions from agricultural farms. Biochars have been gaining much attention due to their desirable properties, such as large specific surface area, a robust pore structure, and the presence of rich functional groups like carboxylic, phenolic, hydroxyl, hydroxylic, and metals. All these properties help biochar<br/>in adsorbing nitrogenous products. Biochars can also serve as good soil conditioners when returned to the soil. The application of biochar to the ground could also increase soil fertility. Research has shown promising results<br/>in applying biochar for ammonium capture at a lower price. Ammonium adsorption experiments were carried out to quantify the amount of ammonium adsorbed on biochars. Further, various experiments were carried<br/>out to characterize the biochar for ammonium adsorption, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface analysis, FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy). In addition, the adsorption mechanism was determined by analyzing the physico-chemical properties of pine wood pellet biochar and its UV activated biochar, the mechanism was also determined for plum tree wood chip biochar and its UV activated biochar. Based on the analysis, it was found that the adsorption of ammonium on biochar is mainly because of ion exchange due to the presence of metals and functional groups. Through adsorption experiments it was found that, biochar 2, made of plum woodchip, has a higher affinity for capturing ammonium<br/>over biochar 1 made of pine tree wood pellet because of the presence of metals and inorganic compounds on top of the surface. UV activation affect biochar’s adsorption capacity towards ammonium. Biochar 2 UV, after activating, has the highest adsorption capacity among all four biochars because of an increase in principle bulk elements like carbon. Apart from the characterization, calculations were made to find out the amount of biochar required to capture current ammonia emissions; this economic evaluation shown commercial feasibility of the<br/>project","Biochar; Ammonium; Adsorption; Ammonia; Livestock","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-10-15","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

The scope of this covered the commercial and contractual relationships, for the delivery of the bottle oil ready for distribution at the retail market; the procurement and production processes, as well as the Sales and Operation Planning (S&amp;OP) process in detail. For the S&amp;OP, Cargill relies on the Make to Forecast (MTF) production strategy, which has two main mechanisms for demand management and production planning. The first one is the use of a demand forecast and the second is the management of safety stocks. The demand forecast helps to guide the production planning to meet the upcoming weekly demand until it becomes available 7 days before the delivery time. While the safety stocks help to compensate for forecast errors and deviations, as well as for production setbacks that may occur. Unfortunately, for Cargill GEOS the automatic demand forecast has an accuracy of 42%, and the safety stock levels rose considerably and were managed on a constant level all year round to compensate. This impeded Cargill to meet the customer demand on time and in full according to the contracted service levels.<br/>The main challenges in this situation were the limited data availability and the demand data fragmentation due to changes in the product specifications. Which required the development of specific procedures and frameworks to align the fragmented data and to obtain a weekly demand forecast. For the development of the forecast model, 3 statistical seasonal forecasting models were considered to maintain the transparency of the process, the ARIMA model, the ETS exponential smoothing, and the STL+ETS. Due to the limited data availability, the chosen model was the STL+ETS model as this was the one that was able to replicate the observed demand, with an average weighted accuracy of 76%.<br/>The insights obtained from the seasonal forecast allowed to improve the safety stocks management, from a fixed level all year round to a seasonal management according to the expected demand and its variability throughout the year. <br/>The solutions developed in this thesis project were not limited to the demand forecast development but they aimed to improve the demand management process in different aspects. Which will allow Cargill GEOS to improve considerably their service levels without considerable additional costs, such as the increase of the production or warehouse capacity.<br","Demand forecasting; Demand Management Strategies; Production optimisation; Supply Chain Management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-09-26","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

E-bikes are able to accelerate quicker and travel at faster speeds than conventional bicycles, increasing the severity of injuries in case of an accident. There are a number of ways to improve safety, such as building better infrastructure, implementing active safety systems, improving bicycling skills, or better protective gear. In this thesis, a controller based on Model Predictive Control has been designed to explore whether it could be used as a haptic guidance system that would improve motor learning of a cycling task, and whether it could assist the cyclist during cycling manoeuvres. The cycling task of lane change manoeuvres performed at a constant forward velocity was investigated. The controller was implemented on a desktop PC, which wirelessly controlled the TU Delft's Steer-by-Wire bicycle -- a bicycle where the steering is enabled by the use of electric motors instead of mechanical coupling between the front fork and the handlebars. To test the controller, ten participants took part in a pilot study. The study was designed following a counterbalanced measures design and the participants were split into two groups that experienced the controller's haptic guidance in different order. During the study, the participants were asked to ride the bicycle on a treadmill and hit virtual targets, shown on a display mounted in front of the treadmill, by carrying out lane change manoeuvres. The hypothesis stated that the controller improves performance while it is assisting the participants. It was found that the controller did not significantly improve immediate performance and this result is likely caused by too low of the task difficulty. However, it is likely that the controller was more effective at improving motor learning of lower skilled participants compared to higher skilled participants, but a small number of lower skilled participants limited the analysis. A short post-hoc no-hands riding test of the same cycling task was carried out to investigate whether the controller is able to carry out lane change manoeuvres with minimal rider input. A significant performance improvement was found during the no-hands test. In conclusion, due to limitations of the study, no performance or motor learning improvement caused by the controller was found. Yet the controller showed promising results in a no-hands riding test, which suggests that the controller could be used as a starting point for advanced safety systems for bicycles.","Haptic guidance; Bicycle; Model Predictive Control; Steer-by-wire","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering | Dynamics and Controls","",""

The precise retrieval of the estimates of the Mars rotation and Orientation Parameters (MOPs) is an important application of the PRIDE technique and is the subject of this work. The MOPs that are retrieved can be related to four motions: the polar motion, variations of the rotation rate, precession, and nutation. More precisely, the MOPs analyzed consist of a total of 30 parameters that characterizes<br/>all the motion components, including: the core factor, the free core nutation rate, 8 spin variation parameters and 20 polar motion parameters. Properties related to the internal structure of the Red planet can be deduced from these parameters.<br/><br/>The aim of this work is to reduce the MOPs uncertainty and thus help identify the interplay and signatures of the different parameters, which in turn will provide a better understanding of the state and composition of the Martian inner core. In this context, it is required a thorough assessment of the benefits of combining the Doppler observations from the InSight-RISE and ExoMars-LaRa landers using an extended network of Earth-based stations, including 10 extra receive-only radio telescopes. The analysis has been conducted with Tudat astrodynamical toolkit, where a high-accuracy Mars rotation model can be adopted, in order to simulate the formal errors of the MOPs.<br/><br/>The results obtained can be summarized as follows. The considered two-lander geometry configuration allows a more precise retrieval of the MOPs, with a reduction of more than 92 % overall on the MOPs uncertainty compared to a single-lander configuration. The combined exploitation of the RISE and LaRa Doppler observations allows more efficient retrieval of the full set of the MOPs, and particularly, the polar motion parameters. Furthermore, the accuracy of the MOPs is additionally increased in a configuration with the 10 extra receive-only stations. The MOPs accuracy improvements observed in this case are, on average, a 12 % for the core factor, a 10 % for the free core nutation rate, about 25 % for the polar motion parameters at the Chandler frequency, a 5 % for the spin variations, and a 15 % for the other polar motion amplitudes.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-26","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In the last few years, the climate crisis has been accelerating at a dizzying pace and poses an emergency threat to our planet. Rainfalls have transformed into intense downpours, and flash flooding, combined with the sea level rise, leads to a higher risk of inundation of densely populated coastal cities. Moreover, the melting of the permafrost can lead to significant landslides, triggering the generation of mega-tsunami waves. The latter can have a catastrophic impact, not only on the infrastructure but also on human life. Man-induced climate change is responsible for the increase in frequency and intensity of extreme natural events, such as tsunamis, floods, and storm surges. Recent research indicates that almost one-fourth of the world population lives at high-risk locations to at least 0.15m of inundation depths with a return period of 1 in 100 years. Therefore,<br/>the urge of implementing protection measures against unsteady flows is imperative.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly, the involvement of engineers can play a pivotal role in order to analyze these flows in the built environment and provide sufficient coastal and building plans to ensure safety and reduce reconstruction<br/>costs. The behavior of the unsteady flow around a structure is not a well-understood topic and results in a lack of accuracy and reliability. More insights are required into the fluid-structure interactions to come up<br/>with a safe building design.<br/><br/>In the present study, unsteady flows are generated using the dam-break technique in line with previous research. The Thesis aims to model, validate, and implement a simplified approach to analyze the complexity of the hydrodynamic behavior of unsteady flows around impervious buildings, with different orientations<br/>and blockage ratios. To do so, the research introduces a numerical simulation method of a dam-break wave, using the two-dimensional, and non-rotational shallow water equations. The Galerkin finite-element model is applied for the discretization of the solution on a limited domain.<br/><br/>Initially, the flow of the dam-break wave was validated in the absence of the structure, using a dam-break experimental work for comparison. Then, in order to insert a structure in the domain, a second experiment with a structure is used, which generates tsunami-like waves using the vertical release technique. The gate, which represents the dam, is located at x=0 and opens instantaneously at t=0s. Behind the gate, the reservoir maintains an amount of water that flows, after the opening of the gate, into the channel generating the shock<br/>wave. At the channel downstream of the gate, initial water levels are considered and the behavior of a bore propagation is simulated. The building is located on the downstream side and different impervious building configurations were studied in terms of orientation and shape to investigate the impact of the unsteady flow.<br/>To analyze the complex hydrodynamic processes of flooding, four fixed points around the structure are set to measure the action of the bore on different impervious building configurations. The water elevations and the averaged velocity profiles in time were derived at each point. Moreover, the horizontal forces in the x and y directions are calculated by the model, integrating the stresses over the wet surface of the buildings.<br/><br/>The general behavior of the fluid-structure interactions is captured well, especially upstream of the building, and insights are gained regarding the behavior of the fluid around the structure and the parameters of<br/>influence. Results showed that orientation changes completely the impact on the building configurations. The separation of the flow and the blockage ratio are the main parameters that are influenced by the angle of rotation and change the behavior of the loading process at the initial impulsive phase, when the wave arrives at the structure, and at the hydrodynamic phase, where the flow has a quasi-steady behavior. Overall, a good agreement is achieved with the experimental data, although the numerical model overestimates the loads<br/>acting on the different building configurations. Results proved that the orientation of the building with respect<br/>to the flow facilitates the flow around the structure and contributes to lower water levels, and to a better distribution of the horizontal loads on the surface. The best results were achieved for an angle of rotation of 45°, where symmetrical separation of the flow is also playing an important role.<br/><br","numerical modeling; impervious buildings; bore impact; structure orientation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

However, their releases can, in some cases, be accompanied by undesired impacts to human health and the environment. In the context of a transition to a Circular Economy, it is therefore important to keep track of the flow of flame retardants in passenger vehicle plastics. This study focuses on the flame retardant Decabromodiphenyl Ether (decaBDE), whose use in plastics has become banned in recent years. <br/>Through a static layered material flow analysis, the flows of plastics and decaBDE are quantified for passenger vehicles in The Netherlands in 2019. Afterwards, six scenarios are created outlining different possible approaches to plastics and flame retardants: Reference, Recycling, Incineration, Less Cars, No DecaBDE Ban, and No Substitution. The first four of these scenarios acknowledge the progressive phasing out of decaBDE and include the use of an additional flame retardant, triphenyl phosphate (TPP). At the hands of a dynamic layered material flow analysis, the stocks and flows of plastics, decaBDE, and TPP, are calculated from 1980 until 2050. The emissions calculated in this step, as well as the flow of flame retardant directed to incineration, are then used to evaluate the environmental performance of each scenario by means of a life cycle impact assessment. The results from the life cycle impact assessment show that, from a midpoint perspective, no scenario is a clear winner. Moreover, the lack of characterization factors for some categories makes it difficult to assess the reliability of the results. From an endpoint perspective, the best performing scenarios are the TPP-free scenarios No DecaBDE Ban and No Substitution. This is because TPP is shown to have a significant influence in the global warming impacts. From the TPP-using scenarios, the best performing one is the Recycling scenario, which shows the advantages of promoting recycling strategies in the sector. Overall, TPP-using scenarios perform worse environmentally than decaBDE-using scenarios.<br/>According to the findings in this study, some of the key elements that could smooth the transition to a sustainable and healthy circular economy are policy measures that incentivize plastic recycling in the automotive industry and the use of less cars per capita. <br/>Further research is needed on the environmental performance of less harmful flame retardant alternatives to decaBDE. The methodology used in this study could serve as a framework in future research for other type of product applications as it is useful to evaluate different policies involving chemicals or additives embedded in materials over time. With this methodology, a link is made between the product, material, and chemical layers, able to bridge potential gaps in the often data scarce chemical layer.","flame retardants; decaBDE; TPP; decabromodiphenyl ether; triphenyl phosphate; circular economy; material flow analysis; dynamic material flow analysis; automotive plastics; life cycle impact assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

(mentor); Wouters, B. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Disintegration of Antarctic ice shelves can induce devastated consequences for the environment and human infrastructure in the form of an increase of the global mean sea level. One of the causes of an ice shelf break down is hydrofracturing due to the mass load of supraglacial lakes. The top of the snowpack melts and the meltwater flows to a local depression where it accumulates and forms melting ponds. Detecting and quantifying the depth of these supraglacial lakes will increase the knowledge on the evolution of supraglacial lakes. Satellite remote sensing techniques are able to determine the volume of individual ponds. However, these methods have their limitations in calculating the depth and area per lake. Regional climate models are capable of estimating the total volume of meltwater within a certain area of interest, but have until now not been able to measure the depth and area of separate supraglacial lakes with certainty. This research study focused on highlighting the limitations of and developing possible improvements for three climate-based and satellite-based methods for comparing them to one another. The first method made use of Sentinel-2 scenes and a threshold-based classification to calculate the water extent and the water depth was calculated by use of band values and by knowing both the volume can be estimated. The second method made use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images to classify areas containing water over a biweekly interval. A new method, denoted as the kernel method, was developed for measuring the depth of each detected lake with a lake mask and a digital elevation model. The volume is subsequently derived from the water extent and depth. Snowmelt, refreezing, precipitation and snowfall from a regional climate model, RACMO, was applied to estimate the total volume of meltwater within a catchment. With a digital elevation model a routing is determined to visualize where the calculated meltwater accumulates and subsequently the depth and area were computed. Based on comparing the water extents over the period of 2016-2021 on the Nivlisen Ice Shelf the following can be concluded: the climate model-based method cannot produce realistic water extents (the results were ten times larger than the satellite-based methods); the different classification methods have similar outcomes, the thresholds of the method using solely Sentinel-2 are preferred; The satellite methods are limited by clouds and frozen ice lids. The results of the water extents indicated unnatural large depths (average +30 $m$) and that the satellite remote sensing methods produce water extent in the same order of magnitude. In addition, the kernel method showed potential, since it can be executed without non-optical satellite data. However, in order for it to improve, the size of the kernel needs to be optimised. The total volumes are in the same magnitude range, but the climate data method overestimates ( getal) due to the fact that the maximum value is chosen within the biweeks. In addition, this study's resulting volumes are close to the values computed by Van der Zalm (2020) and Dell et al (2020), which increases the confidence in the results. However, a problem that arose is the absence of a ground truth to accurately compare the results with and therefore it is recommended to possibly compare the data to that of an altimeter. Additional improvements can be made in kernel size optimization based on the middle line of the lakes and developing a method to correctly locate and calculate the depth of water using a total runoff and a digital elevation model.","Remote sensing; Sentinel-1; sentinel-2; Supraglacial lakes; Hydrofracturing; Regional Climate Model; RACMO; Antarctic Ice Sheet","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The Netherlands currently suffers from a housing shortage, which cannot be solved by the traditional project-based approach of realizing new homes. Under a visible trend of a project-transcending, programmatic approach within the construction sector, various housing associations, municipalities and market parties are united in an inter-organizational collaboration to combat the shortage of social rental housing. These have led to various regional social housing construction programs, the Bouwstroom (Dutch translation for construction flow). Since program management requires an appropriate approach for each specific program, there is a need to better understand and further develop the current application of this management concept in the Bouwstroom programs for this context. Program managers should guard against a too one-sided focus on either control management, because this is too robust for a programmatic collaboration, or interaction management, because this leads to too slow progression and expensive ideas. The solution is to complement the two approaches with each other, in which an appropriate ratio of both approaches is context-dependent. To counter interaction or control related challenges, mixed strategies should be applied over time and a right structure is necessary in the organization. Furthermore, the literature speaks of six attributes of effective program management: 1) the vision, 2) priority focus, 3) planning framework, 4) governance, 5) coordination and 6) adaption. These attributes must be applied appropriately for each program for program management to function effectively. Two representative case study programs, WoonST and Bouwstroom Noord, are analyzed. A cross-case study has made it clear that the current application of program management in both cases leads to external interaction challenges in particular. Where the internal parties are aligned and motivated, there is still a hindrance from parties that are not part of the Program Management Office, but still influence the course. This results in the municipalities being limited in their role to speed up the processes. In order to create more value of the programs, the major challenges need to be mitigated. Multiple interaction-type strategies suggested from the literature are validated to mitigate them, several of which have not been applied before. However, they still need to be balanced with control strategies, of which those proposed from the literature mostly score poorly. This indicates that the need for additional complementary control measures is still present and does not seem to be satisfied by the study's findings. This study confirms the theory that program managers should maintain an appropriate interaction and control focus, despite a short-term detriment to the process. In addition, this research shows that program managers must continue to learn. By analyzing strategies from your own program, programs from other Bouwstroom programs and even programs from different contexts, and reflecting on a specific context, unique challenges can be approached more accurately. New strategies should be learned in order to approach unique challenges more accurately.","program management; control management; interaction management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

They determine what subset of the large pool of information is shown to people. IR algorithms determine which items should be returned in response to a query and rank the results in a ranked list.<br/>Recently, concerns about the fairness of IR algorithms have surfaced. In particular, research is being done into whether IR algorithms are fair to producers, people or organizations that provide the items that are retrieved by IR algorithms. The higher an item is in the ranked list, the more attention it receives from users. This attention translates to benefits for the producers, e.g. fame or financial compensation.<br/>In this thesis we investigate the fairness of IR algorithms in terms of a specific measure for provider fairness: the Expected Exposure Loss (EEL). This measure measures whether the providers of equally relevant items receive the same amount of attention in expectation. EEL was first proposed as part of the 2020 TREC Fair Ranking track (FAIR-TREC), which also provided a matching dataset. We investigate for two IR systems whether they achieve fairness on this dataset. We conduct a failure analysis and propose improvements for both systems.<br/>We find that for a system that always returns the same ranking it is not useful to improve its accuracy, but rather that it benefits most from fairness-aware post-processing.

To prevent misalignment, which leads to a loss in accuracy and precision, unwanted vibrations in structures must be attenuated. Topology Optimization (TO) is evolving as a mature design tool that provides innovative designs beyond human creativity. This thesis focuses on developing and investigating TO methods for the limitation of response peaks on a ﬂat surface for suspended structures. When optimizing for multiple excitation frequencies at multiple output points, the complexity of the problem increases, and the number of required constraints grows manifold. Thus, for a compact formulation, there is a need for aggregation of peaks in both dimensions, space, and frequency. Furthermore, the application requires the top surface of the suspended structure to remain ﬂat during operation. In such a scenario, where a structure is excited harmonically, the dynamic deformations on the surface become key to quantifying surface ﬂatness. The incorporation of dynamic ﬂatness measures in TO framework is studied and implemented, and the results show that the proposed methods look promising.","topology optimization; vibration suppression; frequency response; aggregation; dynamic flatness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Structural Optimization and Mechanics","",""

(graduation committee); Rongier, G. (graduation committee); Varkey, D. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The need of shear strength measurements of soil in the design phase of geotechnical engineering is almost indispensable. Many methods have been applied to estimate the shear strength of soil, including various laboratory test, in-situ test and analytical methods. As an in-situ test method, cone penetration test (CPT) is a powerful and cost-effective tool for the investigation of subsoil conditions. CPT data is usually complemented by the laboratory test data for verification. The laboratory-based studies of subsoil, however, can be not only a complex but also tedious and expensive task for large projects involving large amount of data. Therefore, new approaches for estimating the soil shear strength are demanded. Having demonstrated superior predictive ability for many material properties compared to traditional methods, machine learning methods have been increasingly popular and widely used. This thesis focus on the prediction of soil undrained shear strength through cone penetration test data. The major objectives of this master thesis include testing how machine learning could help us lower the need for laboratory test data. At first, the research starts with a literature review of various methods used to evaluate the soil shear strength. Comparing to the machine learning methods, the laboratory and in-situ test methods are relatively more time-consuming, costly and labour-intensive. And the analytical methods are considered lacking in precision. Then the training dataset which consists of 526 samples is introduced. In each sample, there are four input variables obtained from cone penetration test, namely the effective stress (σ′v ), cone tip resistance (qt − σv), effective cone tip resistance (qt − u2) and the excess pore pressure (u2 − u0). The undrained shear strength obtained from laboratory test is taken as the output variable. Next, the training dataset is fed to five machine learning techniques, namely the artificial neural network, support vector machine, Gaussian process regression, random forest and XGBoost, to train models. The hyperparameters are tuned with k-fold and group k-fold cross-validation strategies in the validation process. After that, the testing dataset which consists of 20 samples is established. Cone penetration test data that are in close vicinity to the location of the samples are processed by Gaussian process regression to obtain representative cone penetration test data at the sample location, which is taken as the inputs in the testing dataset. The undrained shear strengths of the samples are measured by Consolidated-Undrained shear test and are taken as the outputs of the testing dataset. Finally, the five machine learning models are tested on the testing dataset. The crossvalidation results, together with the prediction results of the models on the training and testing dataset are evaluated, gathered and compared by various statistic metrics to show the relative performance of the models. XGBoost appears to be the most accurate of all the tested algorithms on this dataset. And Gaussian process regression is chosen as the second option due to its ability to capture uncertainties. The robustness of these two models are then validated from a statistical point of view by applying Monte Carlo analysis. The importance of the input parameters in this study is evaluated by applying random forest for the sensitivity analysis. The results from random forest indicate that the excess pore pressure and the cone tip resistance - total vertical stress are the most influential inputs to the undrained shear strength","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

In recent years Deep Learning within computer vision has made it possible to automate various tasks using images. The Hoofdvaarweg Lemmer-Delfzijl has been assessed using images and a pointcloud. The images were being worked with two employees over a month. This is time-consuming and there are a lot of images to go through.<br/><br/>Our project statement is thus: Develop a tool using computer vision techniques to reliably detect problematic corrosion on piling sheet within 4-5 months to understand what the state is of this topic for asset managers.<br/><br/>We first start with an analysis in which we looked at the existing the literature, the data, the existing methods and how Witteveen+Bos is assessing the images. We then set the requirements to which the algorithm should adhere to. Literature study has shown that most models, with data-sets of above 3000 images, achieve above 90% for both accuracy and mean average precision. Afterwards we start writing the algorithm and model testing various model structures as part of the synthesis procedure. The models are variating in structures, filters, depth, and augmentation. <br/><br/>We created a classifier, of four and six classes, and an object detection algorithm and conducted various evaluation techniques. The four-class classifier performed better than the six-class classifier. This could be due to the six-class classifier being made up of less data, classes that are vague, parts of the data showing imbalance problems.<br/><br/>An object detection algorithm was created to detect dimensional features to estimate the height above water and distance of the bumps. To convert the pixel distance to actual distance, we trained the model to detect a reference object. The object detector performed well, but did not meet the requirements we set. The dimension estimation provided can only provide a rough estimation. This may be the result of not every image, in the training set, contained a reference object. Creating the data-set was a tedious task and our data-set with two classes, took around eight hours to finish training.<br/><br/> We can conclude that for image classification, the structure of the model and the trainable parameters play a role. The object detector can count elements, but the predicted bounding box is sometimes larger than expected. Some recommendations are to increase data and classes.

Thermal hydrolysis process (THP) is a reliable pre-treatment method to improve the biodegradability of sludge. Partial nitritation and anammox process (PN/A) is a suitable method used to remove nitrogen in reject water which has a low COD/N ratio. However, some organic compounds produced in THP process, such as melanoidins, have negative effects on AOO and anammox bacteria. Considering that humic substances occupy a large part of the soluble organics in reject water of THP-AD process. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the acute and long-term toxicity of three types of humic substances (commercial humic acid, melanoidins and reject water) on partial nitritation step of PN/A process. The biodegradability of three types of humic substances under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, and the evolution of humic substances during the biodegradability assays were also analysed. The results showed that all three types of humic substances had higher biodegradability under aerobic condition than that under aerobic condition, and melanoidins had more biodegradable compounds than reject water and humic acid. During the AD process, humic substances acted as electron acceptors, decreasing the cumulative methane production of all three types of humic substances compared to the blank. Also, small MW fractions were transformed to large MW fractions in all three types of humic substances during both aerobic and anaerobic digestion. Moreover, during aerobic and AD, both fulvic acid-like and humic acid-like substances were formed. In addition, the results of acute toxicity tests showed commercial humic acids had a stronger inhibitory effect than reject water and melanoidins on AOO biomass. In addition, a positive correlation between humic substances concentration and AOO activity loss was observed. The long-term operation of PN reactor was failed due to the formation of granular sludge in the reactor and the growth of AOO biomass in the tubing and culture medium.","Thermal hydrolysis process; Partial nitritation/Anammox; Humic substances; Biodegradability; Inhibition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-30","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","",""

Conversely, the human brain has a relatively shallow hierarchy with recurrent connections. Replicating this recurrence may allow for shallower and easier to understand computer vision models that may possess characteristics usually attributed to the brain. One of the characteristics we examine in this paper is the effect of recurrence on the robustness of the model against noise. Additionally, we vary the type of noise in order to observe what behaviour is universal and what behaviour is specific to the noise. However, it is crucial to make the distinction that recurrence in the brain is different from that in classical recurrent models. The key difference lies in how information passes through the layers at every step. This gap has been addressed by CORnet, a family of models that use a more biologically compatible hierarchy of recurrence.<br/><br/>In this paper, we take the idea of the biologically compatible recurrent hierarchy and look at the effects of recurrence when applied to a baseline down-scaled Resnet model. We show different settings where recurrence results in an increase in adversarial robustness, and settings where recurrence has the opposite effect. To offer an additional perspective of robustness, we also show how recurrence makes the feature maps of a model more resilient to perturbations. Following these observations, we conclude that biological recurrence allows the model to average out white noise spatio-temporally and we use the observations to support our hypothesis.<br","Deep Learning; Recurrent networks; Adversarial robustness; Biological recurrence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Bioinformatics","",""

The methodology is unique in that it accounts for the variability of site-specific conditions that may be present between wind turbines of the same class. First, a method for creating simplified structural models which depends only on a few degrees of freedom is derived. After this, a database of simulation data is assembled by varying the geometric, dynamic, and environmental degrees of freedom within ranges which capture a high degree of variability of possible site-specific conditions.

The larger KBE models suffer from long (re)generation times and outgrow the memory resources of standard desktop computer. In the meantime, the number of cores present in computer’s processors is steadily increasing, and the cloud revolution has changed the way software is consumed.<br/><br/>Yet, KBE models are not doomed to become slower and heavier as their complexity increase. They often feature inherent parallel region, which could be exploited to decrease their (re)generation time. ParaPy, a leading company in KBE technology, sees this opportunity and research possible solutions to distribute and parallelize their models. To this extent, this works proposes a partitioning<br/>strategy for parallelizing KBE models and extends the ParaPy KBE system with high-level parallel programming constructs to express and exploit parallelism present in their models.<br/><br/>Distributed ParaPy, as is called the extended ParaPy system, provides two new programming constructs, Persistent Remote Models (PRMs) and Transactional Remote Models (TRMs), that let developers define child objects in their model that will be instantiated in their own process. The remote children created with PRMs are long-lived and reproduce the behaviour of traditional ParaPy children, while introducing the opportunity to parallelize the evaluation of their slots. PRM can be displayed in ParaPy’s graphical user interface, which also automatically parallelize the generation of their geometries. TRMs are short-lived remote children, which are instantiated in the objective to compute a specific set of output slots and destructed once the computation is done. They return a dependency tracked lightweight version of the remote object containing only the values of the computed output slots. They provide the same parallelization opportunity than PRMs and add a solution to control the memory footprint of a model. <br/><br/>In addition to extending the ParaPy KBE system, this work proposes and compares 3 cloud architectures to run Distributed ParaPymodel. These architectures are partially implemented such that their respective potential can be assessed. The developed constructs and cloud architectures have been demonstrated on a KBE application from the industry, to evaluate their impact on (re)generation time and memory footprint.<br/><br/>The tests operations performed on the application showed that the (re)generation time of KBE models can be reduced through parallelization. The speedups obtained depend on the type of operation performed on themodel, and it is observed that the parallelization efficiency is higher when running in the cloud than on a desktop computer. Surprisingly, running a parallelized model across<br/>several cloud nodes provided better speedups than running on a single node with the same level of parallelization despite the communication overhead between nodes.","KBE; Parallelization; parallel computing; cloud; acto; distributed; parallel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-09-23","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

The PVE is an online method that enables participation for a large group of participants. This method is designed for citizens to evaluate a complex situation from a policy makers point of view. If a consultation lacks face validity, there is a likelihood that the results obtained from this instrument provide false information and lead to decisions that are misleading. During this research face validity is assessed by a four-step mixed methods approach. First, a framework to assess face validity in the PVE method is drawn up and applied in a case study of the Schiphol Environmental Council. The goal of this case study is to research by means of a PVE consultation how to improve the participation and information facilities for local residents, which are the respondents, around Schiphol Airport. The framework consists out of the categories clarity, unambiguity, relevancy, readability and completeness. Second, the results of this framework are applied in an experiment. From this experiment it becomes clear that there is no difference in the evaluation of face validity by respondents between a ‘sliders’ choice task and a ‘points’ PVE. However, respondents are more indifferent towards the ‘sliders’ PVE. On average, clarity and unambiguity are evaluated the lowest and readability the highest. Third, comparing to other previous PVE case studies that includes elements of face validity, it becomes clear that the four properties impact on personal life, the respondents, the platform and who is in charge influence the differences in the evaluation of face validity between different case studies. With the three face validity categories included in previous case studies, benchmarks are established. If the goal is to score high on the clarity category, the aim should be to achieve an average evaluation score above 3,67 for clarity, above 3,88 for relevancy and around or higher than 4,11 for completeness on a five-point Likert scale. Fourth, the established framework from literature is compared with concerns about face validity in practice. In addition to the five categories, feasibility turns out to be a practical concern. It is remarkable from the results that 18- to 34-year-olds and people with a low level of education generally rate the face validity categories lower. Therefore, a recommendation for further research is to investigate how the face validity of these groups can possibly be increased and what their needs are regarding face validity.","Participatory Value Evaluation Method; Face validity; Public participation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

The domain of Transfer Learning provides an opportunity to learn from the accumulated knowledge of Motorized Optomechanical LiDAR (Source Domain) and use it to reduce the learning time on MEMS LiDAR (Target Domain). Thus, reducing the effort, cost, and time to research MEMS LiDAR technology.<br/><br/>This thesis explores the Domain Mapping strategy of transfer learning for point clouds. A scan pattern-based domain mapping approach has been described in this thesis to reduce the domain gap between the source and target domain. Moreover, a point cloud densification pipeline that utilizes a depth completion network has been described to further reduce the gap between the two domains. Since semantic segmentation is one of the most actively researched tasks in the industry as it provides the researcher with in-depth information about the environment which could be used in activities like lane detection, parking assist, etc, therefore, this thesis utilizes it as the proxy for evaluating the performance of the domain mapping strategy. It compares a few domain mapping strategies like cropping the Field of View, an adaptation based on scanning pattern, and densification &amp; adaptation to simulate the density of points in the source domain similar to the target domain. This thesis verifies that domain mapping strategy is a suitable solution to learn from Motorized Optomechanical LiDAR and use it to enhance performance on MEMS LiDAR and therefore reduce the data required for research of MEMS.<br","LiDAR; Transfer Learning; MEMS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-08-31","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

Therefore, there is an urgent need for prevention measures. The risk of landslide occurrence can be mitigated by decreasing the pore water pressure in a hillslope, e.g. by drainage from the subsurface. The implementation of Nature Based Solutions (NBS) is advantageous, as these are not disruptive for the hillslope ecosystem. A Live Pole Drain (LPD) is a type of NBS which is inexpensive and can be installed at remote locations. However, its effect on hillslope hydrology has not been studied before.<br/><br/>In this study, fieldwork at an Open Air Lab, a laboratory experiment with miniature LPDs and the development of a conceptual model were used to characterise the hydrological behaviour of a slope in which a LPD is installed. After comparison of this hydrological behaviour to that of a slope with bare soil, it was found that a LPD facilitates rapid infiltration and drainage of precipitation and subsurface water. Furthermore, runoff volumes decrease after installation of a LPD and this effect is enhanced through plant development. Vegetation also contributes to the decrease of the stored volume of water in the subsurface through evapotranspiration. An increase of the design aspects diameter and macropore fraction of the LPD increases its drainage capacity. This study resulted in a first version of a numerical model to quantify the hydrological processes in a hillslope with LPD and the confirmation of the expected effect of drainage through preferential flow by a LPD.","Landslides; Nature Based Solutions; Live Pole Drain; Conceptual model; Rainfall; Open Air Lab","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

Companies are starting to invest in technologies such as offshore floating PV systems (OFPV) to avoid congested urban population centres. OFPV structures are likely to consist of many small, simple, flexibly connected floaters. The entire structure must be able to survive extreme offshore conditions. The OFPV response in various sea states is heavily influenced by the connector design.<br/>In this thesis, a 3D boundary element based numerical model is used which was developed by Tuitman [2]. The model is expanded to output the forces and moments experienced by the compliant connectors which have linear stiffness in 6 degrees of freedom. After successful verification and validation, three case studies are presented which are a three floater serially connected model and a 3x3 and 4x4 grid connected model. Various sea states and wave headings are analysed to show the effect on dynamic behaviour of a compliant connector. The time domain-based approach is used to capture nonlinear Froude-Krylov and hydrostatic forces. The remaining hydrodynamic terms are linearised by solving in the frequency domain. The connector response is linearised by using a finite stiffness matrix but the forces are solved in the time domain to include the effects from the nonlinear hydrostatic terms.<br/>The results show that the resonant response of the structure and connectors is critical in determining the floater motions and loads in the connectors. Additionally, the stiffness of the connector influences the natural frequencies of the structure. The forces and moments in the connectors of the grid are much more varied than the serially connected structure because of the complex interaction of the floater hydrodynamics and connector resonance. The floater motions and connector response becomes less evenly distributed for oblique seas and when sea states match the natural frequency of the structure. The grid experiences bending in multiple directions which results in large connector loads at some locations on the structure. When expanding to a larger 4x4 grid there is a different distribution of connector loading than the 3x3 grid because of the extra degrees of freedom. The aft connectors experience lower loads than connectors facing the waves due to a shielding effect.","Offshore energy; Offshore Floating Solar; multibody dynamics; Fluid-structure interaction; VLFS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

A digital transition of healthcare is needed in order to be able to keep offering widely accessible, quality care. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the healthcare sector has difficulties keeping up with the trend of digitalization in comparison with other sectors. This project aims to bring to light why the healthcare sector is struggling with the process of digitalization. Through this exploration it endeavors to design a solution with the intention of facilitating the digital transformation of the Reinier de Graaf Gashuis (RdGG). To keep the project scope limited it was decided to focus on digitalization of colorectal cancer care. <br/><br/>The following methods were used during the research phase of the project:<br/><br/>1) Conducting a literature review that explored the current state of affairs regarding digitalization in the context of colorectal cancer care and methods for digitalization of care processes.<br/><br/>2) Observing interactions between healthcare professionals and colorectal cancer patients and observing during meetings with different stakeholders in the RdGG. <br/><br/>3) Conducting interviews with colorectal cancer patients, healthcare professionals and organizational employees. <br/><br/>This led to the creation of a colorectal cancer patient journey map. The map displays the care process and reveals its ‘non-digital state’. The result showed that mapping a complete care process in a clear way is challenging. Most care processes are not linear or fixed; there are different treatment options and exceptional circumstances. It was discovered that there isn’t a journey mapping format available that is simultaneously comprehensive and user friendly. <br/><br/>The research outcomes revealed numerous factors hindering the digital transformation within the RdGG, some of which include:<br/><br/>1) The complexity of hospitals makes it difficult to keep overview over the process of digitalization. <br/><br/>2) Not all digital resources are perceived in a positive light, one reason being that they sometimes clash with existing workflows or care processes. <br/><br/>3) Patient journey maps and care pathways can help to prevent this from happening, but there are problems with the making of, managing and use of journey maps.<br/><br/>4) There are issues in the communication between healthcare professionals and organizational employees.<br/><br/>The following design goal was created:<br/><br/>Design an interactive journey mapping tool for care professionals and organizational employees at the RdGG, that helps to better comprehend care and digitalization processes, by offering overview, knowledge and easy communication.<br/><br/>This led to GoMedFlow.

However, there are no concrete studies linking mathematical notions to actual perceptions of fairness by people active in hiring and applicant selection.<br/><br/>We aim to explore the understanding and alignment of existing fairness notions by organizational representatives in the context of early candidate selection in hiring. Towards that, we interviewed 17 professionals from executive functions, talent acquisition, HR, I/O psychology, and diversity and inclusion operations in The Netherlands. By designing user-friendly illustrations and explanations in the context of early candidate selection in hiring, we explore their ratings and responses to six fairness notions on understandability, perception of fairness, perception of diversity, and applicability. Our qualitative investigation suggests that these fairness notions raise three concerns. One, they lack additional contexts such as a company's size or diversity goals. Two, they give rise to several ethical and practical concerns such as lack of trust in the data, disadvantaging minorities, or the selection of unqualified applicants. Lastly, they act only as a small step towards fairness in the large hiring pipeline. We conclude that a qualitative approach in collaboration between designers, practitioners, and policymakers is the key to refinement and contextualization of future technologically enabled fair hiring policies.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","With the increasing appearance of DC loads and DC sources in the MVAC distribution grids, the need for DC power systems is getting more and more pronounced. As a result, the MMC has become a promising and innovative technology that can serve as the interface between a DC and AC network. The MMC-based MVDC distribution link is one of the solutions to incorporate DC in power grids. This link consists of two back-to-back configured MMCs connecting two possibly asynchronous AC networks. Generally, an MVDC distribution link is operated at a fixed rated DC voltage set through the MMC. This work explores the possibility of enhancing the DC link voltage beyond the nominal value to improve the power transfer capacity of the distribution link. The enhancement is achieved while preserving the average energy stored in the MMC and maintaining the AC-side harmonic performance.<br/>First, a control strategy was developed that qualified for the static operation of back-to-back configured MMCs. This control strategy was designed using multiple sub-control modules, each regulating one or multiple circuit quantities using a closed-loop PI or PR control strategy. Second, the analytical limitation to the DC link voltage enhancement was determined. This provided the enhancement boundary expression, which revealed the dependence between the enhancement limit and the grid-injected reactive power. Third, the MMC control strategy was adapted to dynamically incorporate the DC link voltage enhancement. This was performed using the open-loop DC link voltage control, which dynamically enhanced the link voltage by using the reactive power input reference. The controller is realised using a finite state machine that provides an event-driven control system with conditional state transitions. Simulations verified the performance of this controller. Finally, the dynamic DC link voltage controller is implemented for a lab-scale MMC and optimally tuned using the MO tuning method. This is to provide experimental verification of the DC link voltage enhancement. Three experiments were performed to: demonstrate the workings of the enhancement concept, verify the analytical enhancement boundary expression, and show the performance of the dynamic DC link voltage controller. The experiments concluded that the open-loop dynamic control successfully achieved the DC link voltage enhancement and limited the grid injection of harmonic elements during system transients.<br/>So it is concluded that the power transfer capacity of an MMC-based MVDC distribution link can be enhanced by applying dynamic DC link voltage control. This while operating with the same submodule stresses and preserving the AC-side harmonic performance. When the DC current of the distribution link is fixed at the rated value, the power transfer capacity of the link increases linearly with the controller enhancement function. For system transients, the dynamic controller uses smart control logic to avoid harmonic element injection. Combined, this concludes that the dynamic DC link voltage control achieves a proper DC link capacity enhancement that meets the requirements for both steady state and dynamic conditions.","Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC); MVDC link; DC distribution system; Power Systems; Power Electronics; Converter Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-23","","","","Electrical Engineering | Electrical Power Engineering","",""

Therefore, the energy production must shift towards a more environment friendly mix. Changing our energy sources to mostly renewable energy sources comes with many challenges. <br/>The way the current Dutch electricity market is designed will lead to a drop in electricity prices on the wholesale market, when the market is penetrated with a high concentration of renewable energy sources. So the electricity market mechanism needs to be reformed to have a price determination system better suited for energy sources with low marginal costs. Furthermore, a capacity remuneration system needs to be implemented to create enough investment incentive in controllable energy capacity to maintain a high level of security of supply in the Dutch energy system during the energy transition.<br/>There exist many different forms of capacity remuneration mechanisms, but the strategic reserve and capacity markets are examined to check which one would work best in the Dutch energy system. In a strategic reserve a central authority sets the capacity volume, which will be contracted by an operator. This operator will dispatch the contracted capacity when needed. In a capacity market a central authority determines the amount of capacity each consumer should acquire through buying capacity credits on the market. <br/>To determine which capacity remuneration mechanism would deliver the highest level of security of supply, simulations of the Dutch energy system are run. The simulations were done using the models AMIRIS and EMLab, which are coupled to give a more accurate representation of reality. The coupling takes place in the Spine Toolbox. The capacity remuneration mechanisms were created in Python and can be activated as modules in the Spine Toolbox.<br/>The vertices are sketched of the possible future energy scenario of the Netherlands in 2050. These vertices are the so called scenarios, regional governance, national governance, European CO2-governance and international governance. The simulations were run with a scenario in which the energy demand stays equal and with a scenario where the energy demand descends similar to the international governance scenario. The international governance scenario was chosen to base the simulations on, because the simulations make profit driven decisions, similar to the international governance scenario. <br/>The results of the simulations show that, firstly, without any governmental interference, a (near) zero-carbon energy system will not be achieved in 2050. Secondly, when running the energy-only market in a realistic scenario, no shortage hours will occur and the system had sufficient generation capacity for supplying the demand, even in a ""dunkelflaute"" scenario. Thirdly, the basic version of the strategic reserve offered the least costly solution for society for providing sufficient security of supply, so no significant shortage periods will occur in a realistic scenario. Finally, the best option for maintaining security of supply in the Netherlands during the transition to a zero-carbon energy system is the implementation of the yearly capacity market.","Energy; Energy markets; Capacity Market; Strategic reserve; Capacity Mechanism; Simulations; EMLab; AMIRIS; Electricity; Energy system; Zero-carbon energy system; Energytransition","en","master thesis","","","","","","Data set: https://figshare.com/s/f1ef75db199074f2b731","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Electrical Power Engineering","",""

Thailand is no exception to the increased risk of these hazards, which is why Early Warning Systems are being set up. Since flash floods occur within a few hours after the triggering precipitation event, timely and accurate precipitation observations are critical, to enable timely warning and evacuation of inhabitants to mitigate the risk. One solution for this is the use of rain radar, which provides rain data with high spatial and temporal resolutions. <br/><br/>An analysis of this technique was chosen to form the basis of this research in Northeastern Thailand's Lam Takhlong basin. The objective was to investigate the importance of using distributed precipitation data. In this research, the hydrological response of the catchment of interest was studied. The ability of the physically-based, conceptual and distributed CALEROS model to capture this response was assessed. Different modelling strategies and sources of precipitation input were analysed, and the additional value of using distributed precipitation data was determined. The examination of multiple hydrological characteristics in the study area shows great heterogeneity of the catchments response to precipitation. A clear differentiation can be made between the hydrological response of the upstream and downstream part of the catchment. Additionally, the results from the catchment characterisation indicate great spatial variability of the precipitation patterns in the study area. This is confirmed when using the CALEROS model to recreate the catchments hydrology. <br/><br/>Four modelling strategies were used, varying by spatial and temporal constancy. Calibration performed using uniform precipitation showed to be incapable of capturing the discharge trends in the catchment, failing to properly catch the observed peaks as well as the base flow. Runs performed using distributed precipitation maps obtained by Inverse Distance interpolation of rain gauge data showed significantly better results, adequately capturing the trend of the discharge observed in the catchment. Differences in parameterisation only had limited effect on the outcome, making the precipitation input the most important parameter. Runs using synthetic precipitation data demonstrated the importance of properly capturing the precipitation pattern and movement across the catchment, as it greatly influences the timing of occurring discharge peaks. <br/><br/>A comparison between rain gauge data and rain radar data shows that, although data quality of the rain gauges seems acceptable, rain gauges are not capable of properly capturing rainfall patterns, while rain radar does. Precipitation patterns were found to be the most crucial parameter for modelling of flash floods in the area of interest, signifying the importance of using rain radar data for accurate flash flood forecasting.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

New marine power plants operating more efficiently and on cleaner fuels are receiving significantly more attention. While the transition to different power plants and fuels results in reduced fossil fuel consumption and emissions, waste heat recovery systems can aid in obtaining both as well. Current as well as future marine power plants do not convert all of the energy contained in the fuel into useful power, with significant amounts of energy being wasted as heat. Waste heat recovery technologies can be applied to recover some of this energy and generate additional power, effectively boosting total system efficiency, with the resulting benefits of improved fuel economy and reduced specific emissions.<br/>This study first provides an extensive summary of all the different marine power plants, fuels, and waste heat recovery technologies, of both the present and future. One type of power plant that could be an advantageous alternative for future marine propulsion is the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) due to its high efficiency and potential to run on clean fuels. SOFCs generate electricity from chemical energy using a high-temperature electrochemical process, resulting in high-temperature waste heat being expelled. Therefore, the potential for a waste heat recovery technology to boost system efficiency is high, and it is chosen to investigate several power cycles for the waste heat recovery of a case study vessel powered by a 2 MW SOFC system. The aim of this study is to develop and execute an approach to evaluate these waste heat recovery technologies regarding their efficiency, size, and associated cost.<br/>While numerous power cycles for waste heat recovery are in existence, a selection of potentially suitable systems with a number of different setups is made to investigate further. Thermodynamic models are created for the selected power cycles to determine and compare their theoretical efficiencies. Subsequently, the size of the heat exchangers are calculated for the evaluation of system size, considering the size of other components such as turbomachinery as well. Two types of heat exchangers are considered in this study: the compact and innovative printed circuit heat exchanger (PCHE) and the classic but commonly large shell and tube heat exchanger (STHE). Finally, the investigated systems are subjected to an economic analysis based on the cost associated with the main components, with again considerations being made regarding excluded additional components.<br/>The results indicate that various configurations of the (transcritical) Rankine cycle operating on steam and CO2, as well as the (supercritical) Brayton cycle operating on CO2 and air, present with significant theoretical efficiencies ranging from 41 to 52% and electrical power outputs ranging from approximately 530 kWe to over 670 kWe. From the evaluation of the system size it is concluded that the smallest systems are those operated on CO2 equipped with PCHEs, while the largest are the air Brayton cycles equipped with STHEs. The economic analysis revealed that the systems with the lowest costs are the configurations of the (transcritical) Rankine cycle operating on steam, as well as certain air Brayton cycles equipped with PCHEs. The systems with the highest cost are found to be the air Brayton cycles equipped with STHEs, due to the significant sizes of the required heat<br/>exchangers. In general, it is concluded that no system outperforms the others simultaneously across all three investigated aspects of efficiency, size, and cost, and trade-offs will be required when selecting a waste heat recovery technology for the presented case study vessel. Nonetheless, a detailed process-oriented approach has been developed and executed to allow various waste heat recovery solutions to be compared, and it is proven that a significant amount of power can be produced from recovered waste heat. The results from this study can be directly consulted by ship owners and designers considering the application of waste heat recovery to an SOFC powered vessel. Furthermore, the developed approach can also be applied to waste heat recovery in other industries and power generation systems, as it provides a step-by-step guide on relevant calculations and considerations.","Waste heat recovery; SOFC; Bottoming power cycles; Marine propulsion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Process and Energy Technology","",""

This approach requires the creation of a curved trajectory through cancellous bone. The goal of this project is to adapt the flexible oscillating drill design of Müller to a steerable drill that can create a curved hole in artificial cancellous bone.<br/>The oscillating drill tip is a cylinder which oscillates rotationally around its centre axis. The cutting direction is radial. This drill design constantly produces a sideways force since the cutters produce a friction force tangential to the cylindrical wall. The friction force on the forward stroke is currently cancelled out by an equal and opposite force during the reversed stroke. Introducing a difference in phase or amplitude between the two translationally oscillating inputs to the drill head can create a force difference between the forward and reverse stroke, which provides a net sideways steering force over many repetitions. <br/>A prototype drill and accompanying oscillator have been designed and built to further research the effects of the amplitude and phase difference on the drill motion and drilling performance. The oscillator outputs two oscillations that can be individually adjusted in stroke length and their relative phase angle. The output stroke lengths can be set to 0.75, 0.50 and 0.25 mm. The phase difference can be adjusted in 18° increments between 0° and 360°. The drill consists of the cylindrical drill head and two parallel leaf springs that slide longitudinally and thereby transfer the motion of the oscillator to the drill head. <br/>The results showed that the drill got embedded in the drilled hole which is insufficient for measuring a steering effect. Therefore, two alternative drill designs were proposed and evaluated to increase the drilling depth. The design adaptation that provides the most promising result, is to drastically lower the stiffness of the connection between the drill head and the leaf springs. An amplitude or phase difference applied by the oscillator causes the drill head to produce a different motion pattern. The pattern from the amplitude difference shows a decrease in the deviation distance which is expected to have a diminishing effect on the effectiveness of the drill. A phase difference of 144° between the two oscillations, causes the drill to produce an oval motion pattern which is expected to be the most effective in generating a steering effect.<br/>This project provides a great basis for the future development of a drill that can steer without a steering actuator. The next step forward with this design should be to incorporate hinges between the leaf springs and the drill head, to maximise the rotational motion of the drill head. <br","steerable bone drill; bone drill; pedicle screws; spinal fusion; spinal fixation; oscillating drill; steerable drill","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-09-23","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

However, the constant increase of installed wind capacity has put a strain on the selection of potential onshore locations for wind turbine installation. As a result, the wind industry is focusing on offshore applications, mainly with the use of bottom-fixed sub-structures. Nevertheless, research community has started shifting their interest in floating wind turbine designs to harvest the abundant wind potential of far-offshore locations, sited in water depths where monopiles and jacket sub-structures are not economically feasible. Despite the progress on the design of such floating units, there is still no consensus upon their optimum installation and maintenance strategies, activities which comprise one third of the lifetime cost of a floating wind farm.<br/><br/>The aim of this research is to gain understanding on the optimum installation and maintenance strategies for semi-submersible and spar buoy floating units based on their cost and duration. Towards this direction, four different installation strategies are investigated: semi-submersible installation with wind turbine assembly at quayside, semi-submersible installation with wind turbine assembly at wind farm site, spar buoy installation with wind turbine assembly in a single lift with a heavy lift vessel (HLV) and spar buoy installation with wind turbine assembly with multiple lifts with a crane barge. Furthermore, based on the type of the required maintenance activities, the onsite minor and major repairs of wind turbines with the use of a crew transfer vessel (CTV) or a walk-to-work (W2W) vessel are examined, as well as the onsite or offsite replacement of major wind turbine components for wind turbines installed on both semi-submersible and spar buoy floating sub-structures. In the context of this thesis, a deterministic installation and O&amp;M model was developed. This model relies on various input data, including weather time series for near-shore and far-offshore locations, vessels and facilities costs, personnel and components costs and an electricity price for the calculation of the lost revenue due to downtime. <br/><br/>The analysis of the installation and maintenance strategies is based both on a base case scenario and a sensitivity analysis of the main factors influencing the cost and duration of offshore activities: distance from shore/port and weather limits of activities. The results show that semi-submersible installation with wind turbine assembly at quayside is the most cost-effective and fastest of all implemented strategies, followed by the spar buoy installation with HLV. Furthermore, the use of a CTV for onsite repairs is more cost-effective, albeit slower, approach than the W2W one, for all examined distances and weather limits. Finally, the offsite major replacement strategy for semi-submersibles is the most cost-effective of the examined strategies. No definitive conclusion can be drawn on the best major component replacement strategy for spar buoys, as the cost difference between the onsite and offsite approach is small. When the cost difference of different installation and maintenance strategies is low, the final choice depends on the volatile vessel rates and the electricity market prices.","Offshore Wind Energy; Floating Wind Energy; Floating Wind Turbines; Techno-economic analysis; Installation; operation & maintenance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

To reduce the computational burden associated with it, surrogate models can be used as cheap approximations of the original fitness function. Training the surrogate models in a fully online manner can be done to remove the need of having previously generated datasets, which is another source of computational cost. The Sims­-Flanagan transcription is used to model an Earth-Mars transfer which is optimized through different optimization routines. The development of a C++ library with machine learning tooling was initiated, containing implementations for Generalized Regression Neural Networks (GRNNs) and Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFNs) that are used in global and local surrogates, respectively, having their hyperparameters tuned through cross-­validation. A surrogate model was constructed using Differential Evolution (DE) operators and an uncertainty-based infill criterion for the global search phase, and approximation of the derivative of the original fitness function which is provided to SNOPT (Sparse Nonlinear Optimizer), in the local search phase. An ablation study was performed to assess how each of the components of the surrogate model contribute to the results. It was verified that neither the derivative information nor the local search as a whole led to better results. The surrogate model was also outperformed by the standard optimization strategy found in literature, Monotonic Basin Hopping (MBH). Two new surrogate models incorporating ideas of this strategy were created, with one of them outperforming every other model that was tested. Despite not having performed a full study of the computational effort due to the simulations having been run in a server with a variable load, the new models present better results for similar amounts of fitness function evaluations. A Wilcoxon rank-­sum test was performed to assess whether the results have statistical significance, leading to the conclusion that a surrogate model can be used to improve the optimization of low-­thrust trajectories modeled with the Sims­-Flanagan transcription when inserted in a monotonic basin hopping optimization scheme.","Generalised Regression Neural Network; Radial Basis Function Network; GRNN; RBFN; Sims-Flanagan; SNOPT; Evolutionary Optimization; Surrogate-Assisted Optimization; Low-thrust Trajectories; Interplanetary Trajectories; Monotonic Basin Hopping; MBH; Differential Evolution; Surrogate Modelling; Space Missions; Transfer Orbits; Cross-Validation; Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test; Machine Learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-09-23","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Astrodynamics & Space Missions","",""

This opens property spaces that are difficult, or impossible, to access with traditional methods. However, exploring this vast design space remains challenging because classical techniques can be computationally inefficient. Recent years has seen many successful applications of data-driven methods to this problem. Data-driven models can be used to bypass expensive Finite Element (FE) simulations and experiments by exploiting large datasets. This requires the parameterization of microstructures such that they can be mapped to properties. The forward problem, in which properties of are determined from design parameters, is typically well-posed, which allows straightforward application of machine learning methods. The inverse problem, in which design parameters are identified to match specific properties, is ill-posed because multiple sets of design parameters can produce similar properties. The Voronoi growth method induced by star-shape metrics provides a way to explore a large geometrical design space using simple parameterization. It is used to generate 2D unit cells of void and material pixels with non-trivial topologies. The growth process enforces connected geometry while also allowing for smooth transition between different designs. Using homogenization techniques, we generate a large dataset of design parameters and stiffness properties. Machine learning techniques are first used to model the forward problem. By combining the trained forward model with the inverse model, the inverse problem is rendered well-posed. Both the forward and (deterministic) inverse model show excellent agreement between target and predicted values. The method is generalized beyond the design space by targeting properties of non-growth based structures. We investigate methods to create a stochastic inverse model, that can produce multiple designs to match target properties. Verification is done by comparing tensile tests of 3D printed samples to FE simulations.","Metamaterials; Machine learning; Inverse design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-25","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Hofland, B. (mentor); van Wesenbeeck, B (mentor); Kalloe, S.A. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","To estimate wave attenuation by mangrove forests, trees are often schematized as uniform cylinders (over the height) representing a tree’s stem. However, trees have more complex geometrical features that influence the interaction between waves and tree structures. Recent studies have shown that the frontal surface area distribution over the height Av(z) is a crucial parameter for estimating wave attenuation by vegetation (Kalloe et al., 2022; van Wesenbeeck et al., 2022) because it can account for complex geometrical features. This study aims to model the complex geometry of the Avicennia marina mangrove species. The research question then becomes: <br/><br/>How to construct geometrical tree models of Avicennia marina vegetation and how to obtain the projected frontal surface area distribution over the height, Av(z)?<br/><br/>In this study, manual measurements were performed to obtain tree structure parameters. Both canopy and root measurements were conducted for Avicennia marina vegetation with varying characteristics (age and density). Two saplings (approximately 1.5 years old) with variable canopy densities and two young trees (around five years old) with varying canopy densities were measured. We stored canopy measurements in a so-called tree data structure consisting of nodes (representing the branches) that contain information about the individual branches, such as branch orders, -lengths and -diameters and edges, which are links that establish direct relations from one branch to another. After that, we developed a search tree algorithm to loop through all tree data, compute parameters of interest and store the results in assigned data arrays. Parameters of interest to obtain after the data analysis were branch dimensions and diameter ratios of branches (between various branch classes). This information was necessary to create a blueprint for constructing geometrical tree models.<br/>Tree modelling started with the construction of a root (pneumatophore) model. Additionally, the frontal surface area of these roots was computed and displayed as a function of the height. In addition to the root model, we constructed two canopy models. The first model is based on relations between branches and can be called deterministic or dependent (canopy model 1). The second canopy model (canopy model 2) generates branch dimensions based on the normal distribution of branch diameters and is, therefore, more probabilistic with branches independent of each other. Both canopy models construct branches based on information travelling from preceding branches. The models account for the proper placement of branches within 3D space by rotations and translations. The algorithm computes and outputs the projected frontal surface area over the height of a system of branches for a given direction (XZ-plane projection or YZ-plane projection). We validated the two canopy/tree models against validation measurements. Three trees were divided into seven vegetation layers, and branches were registered that intersected with the layers. As a result, estimation could be made on the frontal surface area per layer.<br/><br/>This study found that the frontal surface areas due to roots and canopies are significant and are well represented by the parameter Av(z). The contribution of the roots and canopy cannot be neglected in modelling wave dissipation by vegetation. The contribution of smaller branches to the total Av is significant, proving that considering only the tree stem is an underestimation. Moreover, the research shows that it is possible to develop a geometrical tree model based on a set of measurements and design rules that follow from observations, at least for the considered tree species. We could extrapolate and interpolate our results to generate tree models for a wide range of tree ages. Additionally, it is possible to create a forest by generating multiple trees.<br/><br/>Both tree models (1 and 2) showed little differences in Av(z) during the model validation process. Moreover, the validation measurements led, in general, to an overestimation of the total frontal surface area. Consequently, model validation was inconclusive regarding both tree models. However, we found that constructing tree models according to tree/canopy model 1 is preferred because it resembles an L-system more and is more practically applicable in computer models. We can improve future tree models by collecting more measurements regarding branch structures and root distribution as a function of tree age. This will result in increased model reliability.","Mangroves; 3D Modeling; Python; Vegetation; Hydrodynamics; Geometric Modelling; Woody; Nature-based Solutions; Building with Nature","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Such shared control applications require time-varying human identification because the control feedback should be compatible with the operator's variable behavior. A promising time-domain identification algorithm is the Dual Extended Kalman Filter (DEKF), estimating human operator parameters from Van der El's preview model. In this article, the DEKF's time-varying identification performance is studied with realistic simulations, followed by human operator experiments in a fixed-base simulator. The investigation focuses on look-ahead time, indicating how much future information the operator uses for control. Compared to other parameters, look-ahead time is adapted most considerably with preview. The results suggest that this parameter should be initialized in a 0.25 s proximity of its actual value to make the DEKF converge within 30 s. Although only estimating look-ahead time while fixing the other parameters, the DEKF is capable of identifying time variations in preview. Based on the sigmoid results, the estimation bias increases linearly to 0.35 s at the largest 0.75 s steps in look-ahead time. For sine variations, the DEKF estimations are in phase with the look-ahead time until 0.03 rad/s. Between 0.03 rad/s and 0.4 rad/s the DEKF behaves as a lag function, and for higher frequencies the estimation response is decayed. For the first time, it is quantified how well the DEKF can identify variations in look-ahead time during preview tracking tasks. With further research, the DEKF might become capable of real-time identification, bringing the cybernetics community one step closer to intuitive shared control applications.","Manual Control; Cybernetics; Preview Display; Time-Varying Identification; Dual Extended Kalman Filter (DEKF); Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) Experiments","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-09-22","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Control & Simulation","",""

This research was contacted through the involvement of TU Delft in such a project called the Implementation of Ship Hybridisation.<br/><br/>The design and optimization of hybrid propulsion systems is a complex and challenging task due to the different power sources involved and the dependence on the energy management and control. The physical system and the control algorithm should be designed in an integrated manner to obtain an optimal system design. This study applies a multi-objective double-layer optimization methodology to optimize the sizing and energy management of a hybrid ship propulsion system to be installed on a Crew transfer vessel. A proposed hybrid topology which combines diesel engines, batteries and fuel cells is considered. The proposed approach incorporates the development of fuels and electricity prices as well as the investment costs of the system’s components as an uncertainty element. The introduction of emission reduction measures such as carbon tax was also considered in the study. Future trajectories for the relevant uncertainties were developed and incorporated in the optimization methodology to provide decision-makers with a more realistic picture of the solution space.<br/><br/>The analysis of the optimization results was based on the Total cost of ownership (TCO) and the emission reduction potential of the optimal designs produced by the optimization methodology. The results show that instead of choosing a hybrid propulsion system for the vessel under study, an all-electric propulsion system which is based entirely on batteries and fuel cells is the most economical and environmentally friendly option. Incorporating diesel engines has a negative impact on the operational expenditures of the system in the long term. A fully electric propulsion system would require a larger initial investment from the ship owner, but it would pay off over the course of the ship’s remaining useful life.<br/><br/>This research can be used as a reference to base the decision of the stakeholders on choosing a new propulsive system for their vessel. The parameters of the optimization methodology can be easily changed to explore more options and expand the design solution space if this thesis’ results don’t satisfy the shipowner.

Nineteen OMPs have been included on the contaminant watch list of the European Union Water Framework Directive since 2015 and efficient and reliable methods to eliminate them are researched worldwide. Therefore, in this study, five of these 19 OMPs (benzotriazole (BTA), carbamazepine (CBZ), diclofenac (DIC), ketoprofen (KET) and caffeine (CAF)) were selected as target OMPs. And the research objective is to fabricate a ternary composite photoanode and to investigate its photoelectrocatalytic degradation performance for all five target OMPs.<br/><br/>BiVO<sub>4</sub>/(TiO<sub>2</sub>/graphene oxide (GO))<sub>mix</sub> ternary composite thin films were successfully deposited on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates using ultrasonic spray paralysis (USP) method to form a ternary heterojunction structure and to improve the photoelectrocatalytic performance for degradation of the five target OMPs. The morphology, crystal phase, surface chemical composition, optical and electrochemical properties of this ternary composite photoanode were analyzed by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-vis spectroscopy, incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), respectively. The results of these analyses showed that TiO<sub>2</sub> P25 nanoparticles and GO sheets were distributed uniformly on the brain-shaped BiVO<sub>4</sub> structure which indicated that the ternary heterojunction structure was formed successfully. From the UV-vis analysis, it could be estimated that the band gap energy for BiVO<sub>4</sub>/(TiO<sub>2</sub>/GO)<sub>mix</sub> ternary composite photoanodes is 2.43 eV. Further, the LSV and EIS analysis showed that the photocurrent of the ternary composite photoanodes is lower than pure BiVO<sub>4</sub> photoanodes.<br/>The degradation experiments were divided into five stages. The optimal photoanode type was first determined in the pre-experiment stage using methylene blue (MB) as indicator organic pollutant and then the effect of initial concentrations of target OMPs and initial pH on the degradation efficiency were studied in stage II and III, respectively. The highest removal efficiency of the five target OMPs was obtained with initial OMPs concentration at 10 μg·L<sup>-1</sup> and initial pH range of 3.5-4.0. The degradation experiments were triplicated under this optimal condition in stage IV. It was noticed from the results that the degradation efficiency of different OMPs after 3 hours of reaction time varied from 31.1 % to 99.5 %. To further confirm that there is competition between the five target OMPs during the photoelectrocatalytic degradation process, experiments were carried out in which individual OMPs were degraded independently. The reusability and stability of the photoanodes were evaluated in stage V. Trapping experiments using scavengers were also included in this stage, which showed that superoxide anions was the most active species during the degradation process.","Organic micropollutants; Photoelectrocatalysis; Ultrasonic spray paralysis; Ternary composite photoanodes; BiVO4; TiO2; Graphene oxide; Scavengers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-22","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","","51.9989427, 4.3761059"

However, due to large MAC operations involved in the implementation of Neural networks, the traditional digital hardware based on the von-Neumann architecture is not well suited for an edge device. Computation-in-Memory (CIM) is an attractive alternative in mitigat- ing the challenges involved with traditional hardware by directly processing the data within the memory. It utilizes emerging memory devices such as Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) to perform in-place computations in the analogue domain, thereby, eliminating the bottlenecks associated with the constant movement of data in the von-Neumann architecture. However, the standard implementation of CIM comes with several challenges, with the pri- mary being high power consumption, which debate its implementation on an edge device in accelerating Neural network computation. Thus, this work proposes a novel CIM crossbar that has the potential to alleviate the challenges associated with the standard CIM cross- bar. Subsequently, an ultra-low power micro-architecture design is proposed, based on the novel CIM crossbar, that can accelerate Binary Neural Networks (BNN) and Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) with high power efficiency. The benchmark results obtained over the imple- mentation of custom-developed BNN and SNN, trained over the MNIST dataset, indicate a power reduction of 13x and 26x respectively for the proposed micro-architecture, compared to its standard CIM crossbar counterpart. In addition, the proposed micro-architecture exhibits energy savings of around 4-5x over both BNN and SNN, making it a promising alternative for accelerating neural network computation over edge devices.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-22","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

To reduce these emissions, Tata Steel has decided to replace the blast furnaces with direct reduced iron (DRI) plants in combination with reducing electrical furnaces. The DRI plants will first operate with a 100% natural gas feed. Whenever green hydrogen becomes available on the market, the natural gas will gradually be substituted with green hydrogen, reducing direct CO2 emissions. Producing steel using 100% green hydrogen as the reducing gas, called green steel, comes along with an awkward problem regarding the carbon content of the DRI. Green steel has a carbon content of 0%, while carbon is essential for multiple aspects of the production process. Furthermore, the metallization of the DRI is a critical parameter in the production process. Thus, the following research question is established: ”What is the influence of the ratio of hydrogen to natural gas inserted in the direct reduced iron plant on the performance of the reactor?” <br/><br/>To answer this research question, an extensive literature review is performed to gain knowledge of the reduction process, reduction technologies, and the existing mathematical models of the DRI plant. Furthermore, a multiscale mathematical model is made of the shaft furnace of the MIDREX plant. This model uses a grain-based pellet model, which incorporates the morphological structure of the pellets during the reduction process. The shaft furnace is modelled as a 1D model with multiple zones, in which the local energy, mass, and momentum equations are solved. However, due to the time restrictions of the thesis period, only the two reduction zones of the shaft furnace are incorporated. Hence, the shaft furnace model lacks the transition and cooling zones. <br/><br/>The shaft furnace model is compared to a real operating MIDREX plant named ”Gilmore”. The simulation results are validated against the simulation results from literature and the real plant data. The average relative error of the simulation results compared to the Gilmore plant is 14.4%. The most significant error can be attributed to the carbon weight fraction in the solid. This is the result of the missing transition and cooling zones, as most of the carburization occurs inside the transition zone. Neglecting the carbon weight fraction, the average relative error is 9.2%. <br/><br/>Increasing the ratio H2 / CH4 in the feed of the MIDREX plant results in an increasing H2 / CO ratio of the reducing gas entering the shaft furnace. Five cases with different H2 / CO ratios are simulated to answer the research question. The metallization of the DRI is affected by two different phenomena. First, increasing the H2 / CO ratio results in a larger gas input mole flow for the same input pressure, which is the effect of a smaller pressure drop over the shaft furnace. Subsequently, a larger gas input mole flow results in better metallization, which is the effect of more heat input and a lower gas oxidation degree in the shaft furnace. Second, as the hydrogen content increases, the temperature decreases as a result of more endothermic reduction. The thermodynamics and kinetics of reduction by hydrogen are favourable at higher temperatures, which results in a slow-down of the reduction. At lower temperatures, the thermodynamics of reduction by carbon monoxide is more favourable, realizing more reduction and increasing the temperature. This second phenomenon is predominant for equal input mole flow, resulting in worse metallization when increasing the H2 / CO ratio, as confirmed by literature. Consequently, to achieve equal metallization for a higher H2 / CO ratio, the process gas compressors of the MIDREX plant will consume more electrical energy. To conclude, substituting natural gas with hydrogen does have its disadvantages, but it is highly necessary to become CO2 neutral in the future. <br/><br/>For further research, the addition of transition and cooling zones to the shaft furnace model is recommended, allowing investigation of the carburization of the DRI. Furthermore, the shaft furnace model is extremely useful for implementation in a complete MIDREX plant model. Such a model could be used to investigate the total CO2, energy, and material balance of the plant for different H2 / CH4 ratios of the feed of the plant.","DRI; modelling; reactor; direct reduced iron; direct reduced iron plant; plant; multiscale modelling; hydrogen; natural gas; tata steel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-09-22","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(mentor); van de Kaa, G. (graduation committee); Wiarda, M.J. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Conventional meat (CVM) and the related livestock industry are considered to contribute significantly to negative environmental impacts, animal suffering and threats to public health. Nevertheless, the demand for meat is still growing which is majorly due to global population growth. Lab-grown cultured meat (CM) is anticipated to be environmental-friendlier, animal-friendlier and potentially allows for public health benefits. However, it is not yet introduced in the market and faces multiple development challenges related to the technology, consumer acceptance and socio-politics. Furthermore, while CM stakeholders possibly aim for a meat transition, the challenges are hardly addressed in transition context. Transitions are generally studied across the levels of landscapes, regimes and niches using the Multi-level perspective (MLP). Moreover, Strategic niche management (SNM) can be used for assessing the internal processes that determine the success of a niche. On the basis of the MLP, SNM and the CM niche industry, this research therefore is intended to answer the following research question: What are the barriers to the transition of cultured meat from niche to regime perceived by stakeholders? Hence, this study provides niche stakeholders insight into supporting and accelerating a CM transition. For this purpose, the case of the Dutch CM industry is chosen. By means of conducting interviews with academic, business, government and society stakeholders combined with an analysis of related policy documents, 12 barriers are identified. The landscape level involves mutually reinforcing barriers (The environmental paradox &amp; The Dutch political climate). The CVM regime level also involves reinforcing barriers that provides its dominant and stable character (Socio-Cultural lock-in, Techno-Economic lock-in, Institutional-Political lock-in and Regime perspectives). The CM niche industry level in turn, involves barriers that impede the process of the articulation of expectations (Operational constraints &amp; Imagining), impedes network formations (Insufficient incentives &amp; Network disunity) and impedes learning processes (Limited accumulation of knowledge &amp; Dependent on innovation diversity). As these niche processes also reinforce each other, the CM niche industry possibly is entangled in a vicious circle, affecting niche nurturing and hindering reciprocal interactions between the levels. The barrier interactions and reciprocal interactions between the levels combined, determine that the window of opportunity for a CM transition is potentially only limitedly on the rise. Moreover, the effects of moderate landscape change, gradual regime reorientation to the landscape, limited institutional change and an insufficiently well-developed niche, are indicators that the transition is potentially on a transformation pathway. Based on the theoretical implications of this study, future research should aid a better articulation of niche expectations by the CM industry to attract new stakeholders and enhance learning processes. Furthermore, studying the CVM regime capabilities and specifying intentions in relation with CM, especially since the regime barriers could become CM enablers, potentially gives further insight into how the transition could be governed. With regard to practical implications, the potentially occurring transformational directionality failures could be addressed with mission-oriented innovation policies. Moreover, the possible transformational demand articulation failures would optimally be resolved if participation possibilities with the general public for exploration would be implemented. The mentioned failures also relate to transformational reflexivity failures for which CM stakeholders should anticipate the effects that impact the pathways for transition. Furthermore, when comparing the used policy documents with the interviews, the documents predominantly address the need for facilities and incentives regarding the CM niche industry. Although this also is constructive and necessary for the establishment of the Dutch CM industry, the influential landscape and regime developments are hardly considered. Hence, addressing the regime with true pricing for CVM and the landscape with implementing societal challenge-based mission policy instruments, possibly also accelerates the transition. Although CM is still fraught with uncertainty and has not yet been introduced in the market, approved by the regulatory authorities and is yet to be scaled up, it could have a major impact on a better sustainable future. In the end, as it will benefit all, that projection in itself makes CM worthy of further investigation.","cultured meat; transition; Multi-level perspective; Strategic niche management; Barriers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

Being successful at conquering nature also showed in the increased urbanisation and management of remaining landscape. Due to globalisation, the impact of daily activities on nature remain distant. The world now has entered a so-called ‘digital era’ where daily activities take place online rather than outside in nature. A ‘shifting baseline’ leads to people caring less for nature protection (Miller, 2005; Pauly, 1995; Karouzos, 2018). In the light of a glooming climate crisis, it is urgent to improve peoples sense of responsibility to not only protect, but to restore the natural balance.<br/><br/>In collaboration with Staatsbosbeheer, this research aims to increase nature experiences in urban territory. A case study is done at three scale levels: Tanthof; a neighbourhood in Delft Zuid, the Abtswoudse Bos; Staatsbosbeheer property, and Midden-Delfland; the cultivated green buffer between Rotterdam and The Hague. Although Tanthof was designed as an eco-neighbourhood with a strong green infrastructure and car-free streets called ‘woonerven’, over the years these streets have become parked car territory. An overall private atmosphere is the result of houses oriented to the backyard and closed off to the streets, making Tanthof a barrier between the citizens of Delft and the adjacent nature areas Abtswoudse Bos and Midden-Delfland. The Abtswoudse Bos fails to function as an urban park, due to a lack of urban program, attractive entrances and the barrier effect of infrastructure. In Midden-Delfland, human interventions serving agricultural practices are causing subsidence of the peatland and lead to fragmentation of the ecological network. <br/><br/>The design attempts to answer the question: ‘How can urban design of the woonerf type in Tanthof contribute to reconnecting people to the natural landscape system of Midden-Delfland, by facilitating meaningful gardens of responsibility?’. Literature research, physical analysis in the form of mapping and site visits, and inspiration found in philosophy, art and poetry, are used to reshape our understanding of the human-nature relationship. Following the theory of Oneness- implicating a mutual relationship between humans and their environment- forms the concept of the Gardens of responsibility. A different mobility strategy is proposed to create community gardens as residential public space. A green route is created from home to Midden-Delfland. Meaning is found in reshaping natural layers of the past in Midden-Delfland and in building a intergenerational community that takes responsibility for caring of their environment.","Urban Ecology; Ecocities; Reconnect with Nature; Rewilding; Responsibility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Urbanism","","51.9819201, 4.3445227"

Nevertheless, the intermittency of these technologies renders them unsuitable for reliable energy supply. A prominent solution is the utilization of renewable energy to produce green hydrogen that can be stored for later use.<br/><br/>The most environmental-friendly viable method for green hydrogen production is the electrolysis of water. Between the already existing types, alkaline electrolyser is the one with the highest technological maturity and lowest cost of hydrogen production. Despite that, the low energy efficiency, and the energy losses associated with the materials and the geometrical configuration make it difficult to produce hydrogen at competitive prices compared to fossil fuels. The connection with renewables exposes the electrolyser to variable loads that negatively affect the life of materials and the purity of hydrogen since the operating conditions like temperature and electrical current change constantly. Previous research work has shown that the energy losses owing to the electrode kinetics, diaphragm, and electrolyte resistivity are responsible for higher energy consumption than the thermodynamic minimum. These losses are a strong function of temperature and current density. This research project aims to investigate the performance of the electrolyser under fluctuating working conditions to get an insight into how energy consumption and efficiency are affected.<br/><br/>The research objectives are encountered by building a physical model that accurately predicts the electrochemical behavior of the cell under various circumstances and simulates the thermal response of the electrolyser. The numerous experiments performed at XINTC’s laboratory enabled the improvement of the model’s accuracy and the consideration of effects that are not easily confronted in a purely theoretical investigation. The results showed that the model accurately describes the experimental data of the cell with less than a 2% discrepancy. The model was also used for simulating the cell behavior under different pressures, electrodes, and diaphragm materials. The elevated temperatures and highly electroactive materials such as Nickel significantly reduce the voltage of the cell. Regarding the thermal model of the theoretical electrolysis system, sensitivity analysis of the current density, ambient conditions, and electrolyte flow was performed. The temperature across the system was uniform at an electrolyte volume flow of 5 Lt/min and the cooling load accounted for 20% of the electrolyser power. The thermal modeling of the real experimental setup was successful (&lt;1.5°C deviation) at high current densities indicating the sound assumptions of the model. On the contrary, at low current densities, the discrepancy between the model and the experiments reached 10% due to the additional heat generation induced by the shunt currents. For that reason, a simplified electrical circuit analysis was formulated and included in the model. This led to reducing the deviation to less than 5% and at the same time calculation of the current efficiency in the absence of measuring devices was achieved.<br","Alkaline electrolysis; Hydrogen production; Thermal modelling; Electrochemistry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-09-22","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Process and Energy Technology","",""

When extracting the accurate impedance model of an EV charger, the knowledge of the charger’s circuit and controller parameters is indispensable. However, EV chargers’ manufacturers do not disclose the design parameters of chargers since they are confidential designs. Therefore, developing an approach to estimate the charger’s design parameters is practically beneficial for establishing the charger’s impedance model and thereby analysing the harmonic and stability of the charger-grid system.<br/><br/>Recent works on physics-informed machine learning provide a promising data-efficient approach to estimating unknown parameters of a system with a known physical model. However, to the author’s knowledge, such a technique has not been explored extensively in the power electronics domain. Thus, exploring whether PINN is also suitable for the parameter estimation of power electronic converters and how to implement this technique is worthwhile. In this thesis, to begin with, a Physics Informed Neural Net model is developed as a proof of concept to estimate the parameters of the boost converter. And subsequently applied to the AFE converter of the Fast-Charging Station to explore the scalability and generalisation of the model developed.<br/><br/>Implementing the physics model within the neural net is still an open problem; hence the physics parameters are estimated similarly to the weights and biases during the training process using the existing optimiser. This approach requires diving deeper into the development of the neural net, and hence instead of eager execution, TensorFlow’s computational graph method is used to build the neural net and the physics model. This allows complete flexibility to build the network from scratch with added complexity.<br/><br/>In the PINN model developed for the boost converter, the mean estimation error was 0.89%, and the parameters were estimated in 25.76 seconds. Because of the complexity of the physics model, optimizing the PINN model was challenging for the AFE converter. With a mean estimation error of 30.25%, the PINN model for the AFE converter took 361 seconds to execute. For both models, less than 150 data points collected over 25 switching cycles peak-to-peak values are used. The proposed PINN model developed in this thesis thus proves to be highly data-efficient with quick convergence. Despite the success of the developed PINN model, several drawbacks of PINN-based parameter estimation are also noticed and summarised.","Physics Informed Neural Networks; Parameter estimation; fast charging stations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

Dutch universities struggle to find effective evidence-based intervention tools to reduce the high prevalence of sexual violence among their students. Reducing sexual violence means a safer student climate and thus better inclusion of women and more diversity in higher education. Interesting approaches to consider for cultural change are bystander intervention and an already existing co-designed serious game. This game aims to encourage a dialogue among students but has thus far not been evaluated on its effectiveness. Therefore, the goal of this study was to evaluate how a serious game can promote an intergroup dialogue between female and male students in Dutch universities to encourage bystander intervention in situations of sexually transgressive behaviour. Methods. Literature research and brainstorm sessions with female and male students from Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) were conducted to gain a better understanding of sexual violence among students. These methods were used as part of participatory game design research. Moreover, a quasi-controlled experimental trial was conducted with 64 TU Delft students from different nationalities and study backgrounds to evaluate the serious game on bystander attitudes, sexual violence myth acceptance, the willingness to intervene, and the effectiveness of the intergroup dialogue. Results. The results showed that the serious game session has a significant positive effect on bystander attitudes (i.e. bystander awareness and responsibility) and the willingness to intervene. No significant difference was found in sexual violence myth acceptance. Additionally, the game proved to promote an effective intergroup dialogue between the participants. Conclusion. Serious gaming proved to be effective in encouraging ethical bystander behaviour by promoting an intergroup dialogue. Therefore, universities are recommended to use serious games as an intervention tool to contribute to cultural change. Future studies should include students from other universities and focus on minimising selection bias to research whether serious games can also influence sexual violence myth acceptance.","Serious gaming; intergroup dialogue; communication; bystander intervention; ethical bystander behaviour; bystander attitudes; sexual violence; sexually transgressive behaviour; higher education institutions; universities","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

The research aims to answer how well an open rotor-wing-flap configuration can be modeled by the low-fidelity methods.<br/><br/>The method includes a blade element rotor model that accounts for non-uniform inflow conditions, a vortex based slipstream method that models contraction and deflection, and a non-planar VLM for the wing and flap that is coupled to MSES through a novel decamber method.<br/><br/>The developed method is shown to predict good results for the total system lift and system drag at low and higher angles of attack close to stall for the retracted flaps case. The decamber method is shown to successfully account for general thickness and viscous effects if solutions from MSES are available. For wings with deployed flaps, reasonable results are achieved at low and medium angles of attack, but the accuracy of the results is largely sensitive to the quality of the finite slipstream correction method which performs worse for larger off-sets of the flap from the main wing. The analysis is unable to provide reliable results for higher angles of attack for wings with deployed flaps due to convergence issues by MSES.<br","PWF; ORWF; slipstream; Aerodynamic interaction; aerodynamic modelling; high-lift device","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the problems encountered in nuclear installations is that vital parts of the reactor, such as the fuel rod bundle, corrode over time. Corrosion leads to roughness elements on the surface which affect the heat transfer. To increase safety and reduce costs, it is of paramount importance to predict the heat transfer accurately when the surface is rough. The effect of roughness on a flow is an increase in both skin friction and heat transfer. Current models rely on the Reynolds analogy to calculate the heat transfer. Because in most applications pressure has no effect on heat transfer, it is often overestimated. In this thesis the accuracy of RANS modelling with respect to predicting heat transfer rates from or to a rough wall has been investigated.<br/><br/>It was found that a model for Low Reynolds Number meshes showed promising results. A downside of a RANS simulation on a Low Reynolds Number mesh is the increased amount of computational time due to fully resolving the velocity and temperature profiles compared to one on a High Reynolds Number mesh where wall functions are used. Therefore the model has been applied on several High Reynolds Number meshes and was compared to DNS results from literature. The results clearly showed that the mesh size was of influence on the predictions. However, a possibility was identified to reduce the mesh size dependency. The damping function was found to be responsible for this dependency and was reformulated using DNS data, resulting in a fitted equation for two different Prandtl numbers.

These end-effectors tend to be prone to vibrations due to their lightweight design and low thickness, whilst they still should have high accuracy and precision. This motivates the search for damping methods that can be implemented in industry, where the emphasis is set at the upcoming trend in the use of smart materials and structures. In this thesis, the application of piezoelectric transducers to a wafer gripper with a high stiffness is investigated. The main aim is to show a 'proof-of-concept'. This to show the feasibility of piezoelectric transducers that are used to effectively dampen modes of thin and stiff end-effectors. The dynamics of the gripper have been analyzed to determine to optimal placement of the piezoelectric transducers using the coupling relation between the gripper and the transducers. This relation has been studied to be used as a guideline for the design process. After the placement of the piezo electrics, an experimental setup has been built to perform active vibration control. 3.3% damping was achieved with a simple PPF controller with a limited gain for which the piezoelectric transducers where placed according to a simplified line optimization. This shows that the concept of dampening very stiff and thin end-effectors, such as the wafer gripper, is feasible.","Active Vibration Control; Piezoelectric transducers; Smart materials","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-09-12","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Mechatronic System Design (MSD)","",""

This is the case in, among others, the Galveston Bay Area. In response to this threat the USACE (United States Corps of Engineers) recommended a plan to reduce the risk of flooding, through a range of measures to form a resilient coast of Texas. This plan includes a storm surge barrier at Bolivar Roads in Galveston Bay, whilst the other inlet at San Luis Pass remains open for environmental reasons. Leaving the San Luis Pass open still results in a significant rise in the water level of Galveston Bay, so finding a way to close the San Luis Pass is preferred. Therefore, this thesis researches a barrier for the San Luis Pass to contribute to a resilient Texan coast whilst also taking the local natural habitat into account. The methodology combines the concept of 'Building with Nature' and the civil engineering design method. The methodology incorporates the flood safety, ecological values, and socio-economic aspect into the design process. A conventional storm surge barrier does not fulfill all the requirements and criteria for the San Luis Pass. This research thus proposes a new, innovative type of storm surge barrier: The Shade Curtain Barrier. The shade curtain barrier functions by being rolled down in extreme conditions and stored under the bridge under normal conditions. The two main advantages are that no bottom protection is required and the view is hardly disrupted. Concluding, the shade curtain barrier is a promising solution for a storm surge barrier at the San Luis Pass to contribute to a resilient Texas coast.","Storm surge barrier; Building with Nature; San Luis Pass; The Shade Curtain Barrier; Flood Risk","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

On the other hand, it is even more challenging for existing vessels that are not fuel flexible to successfully improve their carbon impact. The current study examines the combustion characteristics of alternative maritime fuels including methanol and hydrogen in the compression-ignited internal combustion engines of Bravenes that burn diesel fuel, as well as the implications these fuels have on the environment and on safety when used onboard ships. The diesel fuel still acts as the main fuel but also as the ignition fuel for the injected additives. The purpose of the additives is for the substitution of diesel and to offer more complete combustion in the cylinders. Van Oord is already implementing the Fuelsave Marine+ technology on board Bravenes. This technology aims to reduce harmful emissions like &#x1d441;&#x1d442;&#x1d465; and greenhouse gases while also increasing engine efficiency in order to contribute to the overall energy transition effectively. Therefore, the primary goal of this research is to examine if there are any potential impacts of the technology on the efficiency, emissions, and fuel consumption of Bravenes engines.<br/><br/>The model used is able to characterize the combustion of the engine using the Seiliger combustion shape parameters a, b and c. These parameters consider the combustion efficiency, the ignition delay, and the heat fractions of the potential heat for the appropriate stages. The effects of the additives in small quantities can be seen in the combustion duration and the ignition delay of the combustion. In order to properly model the additional fuels effects some of the diesel mass needed to be substituted with methanol mass to provide the same energy content in the cylinder. Attention was also given to the proper selection of the &#x1d44b;&#x1d44e;&amp;&#x1d44b;&#x1d44f; parameters impacting the combustion shape parameters, and as a result the pressures and temperatures in the engine. <br/><br/>The results of the model for the diesel and diesel with additives operation predict a decrease in diesel fuel consumption which is a good indication of &#x1d436;&#x1d442;2 emissions reduction. The peak cylinder pressures have increased with the additives injection and the peak temperatures as well which indicate an increase of &#x1d441;&#x1d442;&#x1d465; emissions. The increase in the temperatures is not something expected in reality and could be due to a modeling effect. The indicated work of the engine combustion cycle also improved for the Fuelsave technology but due to the increase in peak pressures the mechanical efficiency decreased resulting in reduced effective efficiency. The selection of the Seiliger settings, which allowed<br/>for a higher heat loss efficiency than was realistically anticipated, is another factor contributing to the decrease in effective efficiency. All in all, proper measurement campaign needs to be performed to show the clear effects of the technology as a retrofit solution on board existing vessels for efficiency and emission reduction.","methanol; hydrogen; diesel B","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology","",""

Combining different renewable energy sources gives the opportunity to build systems that can help limit these effects and provide energy in different types. The main goal of this project is to model a system that can offer electricity and hydrogen to a steel industry, in this case Tata Steel, and provide an insight for their next steps towards sustainability not only to cover their electricity needs but also investigate alternative steel making routes for their primary processes which are the iron making and further the steel making with hydrogen injection. The models developed for this project aim to answer the following research question: ”What is the feasibility to cover with a solar - wind - hydrogen system, the loads of the different steel making routes of Tata Steel ?” Different models were build through the software TRNSYS for the scenarios investigated that are linked with different combinations of components and loads so more sustainable steel making routes can be followed in the future. The steel making routes refer to the iron making process and the electrification of the industry with green electricity. For the year of 2030 a fuel mix of 70% natural gas and 30% of hydrogen and for the year of 2050, 100% of hydrogen will be used for the iron making process while for both of them 100% of the electricity loads were investigated to be covered by renewable energy sources. The scenarios were divided in a combining structure of local - non local generation and the loads corresponding to the different steel making routes. The local scenario refers to generation in the Netherlands while the non local scenario refers to the generation of hydrogen in the Arabic Peninsula and the generation of the electricity loads of the processes in the Netherlands. The components that were used were wind turbines, solar panels, batteries and electrolyzers. Each system was optimized with the help of GenOpt, an add - on of TRNSYS, to which was set to minimize the levelized cost of electricity, considering also the load coverage both for the hydrogen and electricity loads not to deviate more than 1% from the full coverage. Further than the optimization, a sensitivity analysis with the Sobol method through the programming environment of python and more specifically the SALib library and the parametric analysis of TRNSYS was conducted for all the different scenarios investigated to give an insight how the amount of the different components affects the levelized cost of electricity. Combining different metrics that were calculated as the Levelised cost of electricity (LCOE), the Self Sufficiency Ratio (SSR), the SSR of hydrogen, the total cost, the avoided emissions per MWh, the area ratio and the avoided emissions per area, a final comparison was done through the different scenarios. The most attractive choices both in a feasibility and economical perspective were the scenarios for local generation of hydrogen and electricity for the projected steel making routes of the years of 2030 and 2050. For the local generation scenario of 2030 an LCOE of 0.383 AC/kWh with an electricity coverage of 99.007 % and a hydrogen load coverage of 99.135% were resulted. On the other hand, for the scenario of the local generation of 2050, an LCOE of 0.421 AC/kWh, with an electricity load coverage of 99.875% and a hydrogen load coverage of 99.207% were calculated. The scenario that was the most attractive throughout the different metrics was the one for the local generation of 2050 while the next to come was the one for the local generation of 2030. Given the aforementioned study and its respectful results, it is a first step to evaluate the impact that such a system can have not only in the emissions reduction of such an intensively emitting industry but also to bring into perspective all the different aspects needed to be considered to realize such a project and evaluate them in more depth in the future.","Steel industry; Hydrogen production; Electricity generation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Previous studies have used this approach but required convoluted collection of excretion before analysis.<br/><br/>This study investigates methods for non-invasive mineral uptake determination in babies, through measurement of minerals and trace elements in used diapers based on two analytical techniques, instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). This study compares the applicability of both techniques for different types of diapers. Furthermore, the representativeness of subsampling of diapers is investigated, and the elements that can be measured by the proposed methods are identified.<br/><br/>This study finds that Large Sample INAA (LSNAA) can be used to investigate used cloth diapers, assuming it is possible to measure cloth diapers individually. This method is able to measure potassium and probably sodium in urine, as well as potassium and potentially sodium, iron, and zinc in feces. The proposed method is as follows: The used diaper is dried and thereafter placed in the pot, with the empty space filled with cotton sheets. The samples are irradiated for 100 hours with a flux of 3.00 *1012 ± 0.02*1012 cm2s-1, followed by measuring the diapers after 2.5 and 19 days after irradiation. To determine the minerals in excretion, the minerals measured in the blank diaper are subtracted, which are determined by irradiating three blank diapers, with the same settings as the used diapers, and taking the average and standard deviation.<br/><br/>Furthermore, this study finds that ICP-OES can be used to measure potassium in disposable diapers containing urine. The proposed method is as follows: the area where the urine is located is dissolved using 6 mL nitric acid (65%) per 200 mg. The same area is dissolved three times for a blank diaper. The samples are filtered and diluted ± 8 times. Thereafter, the samples are measured using the ICP-OES device. To determine the minerals in urine, the measurements of the blank diaper are subtracted from the measurements of diaper with urine. Internal standards are used to compensate for differences between matrices. This approach assumes that differences between different sizes of diaper pieces are the result of matrix differences. The results from this study provide no conclusive evidence for the best dissolution method for a disposable diaper.<br/><br","INAA; ICP-OES; Infant; Diapers; Minerals and trace elements","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

However, to pick the right NPIs for one’s office, knowledge is needed of the effects of the different NPIs within the given context.

(mentor); Kok, M. (mentor); Raadgever, GT (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In the summer of 2021 severe flooding occurred in Belgium, Germany and The Netherlands. High damages have been estimated in the Geul catchment, leading up to 250 million euro. Flood risk management in The Netherlands is mostly focussed on reducing the probability of flooding and in lesser extent on damage mitigation. Especially in areas such as the Geul catchment, reducing the probability of flooding through flood defences is difficult to achieve. Also taking climate change and urban development into consideration, it is challenging to meet flood safety standards in the (near) future, as the frequency and intensity of flooding is expected to increase. Under these circumstances a shift is observed in scientific and policy discourses towards a flood risk reduction strategy that includes resilience, in which the capacity to resist, mitigate and recover has a larger role. As a consequence, there is an increasing interest to include private actors in the strategy by promoting private flood mitigation measures. However, it is difficult to quantify the effects of these private measures and little research in The Netherlands has been performed. This thesis investigates which improvements can be made to the flood risk reduction strategy in the Geul catchment, thereby increasing resilience through private flood mitigation measures. Thereto a method to include and asses the effect of the measures in a risk based approach is derived.<br/><br/>An international literature study about flood resilience and society provided two applicable private mitigation measures and their damage reductive effect. Dry-proofing types of measures are defined as measures that prevent water from entering an object and can reduce damages between 60%-100% up to an inundation depth of 1 meter. Wet-proofing measures reduce damages and recovery time, while allowing water inside the object, by flood adapted use or structural measures. The maximum damage reduction is 53% up to an inundation depth of 2 meter. Investigation of the Protection Motivation Theory provided important factors that improve the uptake of these measures, by identifying connections between awareness, preparedness and self-reliance. The two main findings are that the communication strategy should focus on the relative risk reduction effect of private measures and should provide guidance on implementation to motivate private actors to initiate action. Five interviews were used as a reference to these findings. To describe the relative effect of measures, they are modelled in a publicly available risk assessment method (SSM-2017), based on hazard, exposure and vulnerability. The effect of the measures is calculated for two scenarios, that describe at which locations the measures are implemented. In the first scenario, top risk locations are identified and measures are applied. This is representative for high awareness and object specific guidance. The second scenario randomly distributes measures over the flood prone area and represents the current approach without specific guidance. For the modelling of measures and scenarios, an automatic procedure using a Python script is developed, which is applicable in The Netherlands in combination with SSM-2017.<br/><br/>The results showthat both dry-proofing andwet-proofing houses and shops are applicable in the Geul catchment. At many locations measures have a positive benefit-cost ratio, indicating it is worthwhile to implement them compared to a situation without measures. More importantly, it is found that high awareness of flood risk or object specific guidance increases the effectiveness and cost-efficiency significantly. For residential objects, an optimum was found to implement measures at the top 40% locations most at risk. The achieved risk reduction was 47% and the benefit-cost ratio 1.3-2.2 for dryproofing. At this coverage the benefit-cost ratio ofmeasures is a factor 2 higher compared to a situation without specific guidance. Location specific investigation revealed that the inundation depth is the main driver for determining the most effective measure. Wet-proofing is cost-efficient in a smaller number of areas at risk for inundation depths higher than 1 meter. For most areas dry-proofing is more cost-efficient as the expected inundation depths in the catchment are mostly below 1 meter.<br/><br/>The research demonstrates the potential of privatemeasures with a significant reduction of flood risk. Given the limitations to reduce the probability of flooding in the Geul catchment, the measures are highly interesting. The method itself was able to determine the type of measure thatwas most effective with confidence. However, based on uncertainties in the model, the benefit-cost ratios have to be interpreted carefully. An extension of this research with a higher resolution of input data can address this uncertainty. Current approaches and communication to motivate private measures were found to be ineffective, as they mainly focus on the type of measures and costs instead of the effect and implementation. It is suggested to improve this by explicitly including the before mentioned factors and bymaking use of social network on the spatial scale of a neighbourhood.","Private Flood Adaptation; Flood risk; Limburg Floods; Flood resilience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

Understanding the various reduction-oxidation pathways, and interactions of manganese and iron, can play a major role in optimizing the performance of such filters. Interestingly, it is found that under certain conditions, mobilization of dissolved manganese can occur in such filters, which can be critical to the filter operation. Therefore, the main aim of this research is to dive deep into studying the possibilities of manganese reduction pathways occurring at the top layer of the filter media of a groundwater filter. Secondly, the research also focuses on knowing how the removal of manganese is related to the oxidation by MnO2+O2 systems, and also how these systems interact with each other under different pH conditions.<br/> To do so, manganese dioxide (MnO2) coated sand grains were obtained from the second filtration unit of Vitens groundwater treatment plant situated in Holten. Various batch scale experiments were done under aerobic as well as anoxic conditions, in the presence of Mn(II) or Fe(II). Additionally, the influence of pH on manganese removal efficiencies as well as the rates of both manganese and iron oxidation was investigated.<br/> It was found that the dissolved Mn was a reduction product of MnO2-Fe(II) system, where Mn(IV) got reduced to Mn(II), reaching an Fe(II) : Mn(II) molar ratio of 3.65:1 instead of 2:1, as there was a significant difference between the calculated theoretical values and the measured experimental values of both Mn(II) and Fe(II). There was mobilization of Mn(II) which took place from the MnO2 surface, when there was a presence of Fe(II) in the system, which simultaneously got partially oxidized to Fe(III). Also, it was observed that manganese could be removed by MnO2 under anoxic conditions, although under aerobic conditions the removal efficiency was high (93.32% vs 71.83%). Apart from oxidation, there is a possibility of adsorption over MnO2 due to its high sorption capacity towards cations like Mn2+, Mn3+ and Fe2+. This research also showed that a small fraction of Mn(II) reacts with Mn(IV) to form Mn(III) as a reaction product, enhancing the mobilization of Mn(II). <br","manganese dioxide; manganese reduction; redox pathways","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-01","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

In order to prepare for this, several adaptation measures are available to reduce the overtopping discharge. Wave overtopping can be reduced by including roughness elements or adding a berm. Another possibility is to employ crest elements such as a vertical crest wall, promenade or parapet on the crest wall to reduce wave overtopping discharges.<br/><br/>The overtopping discharge is key when defining the dike dimensions. Moreover, the effect of wind on the overtopping discharge is not included in existing guidelines, whereas wind is complex due to its dynamic behaviour. Also, the knowledge niche regarding the position and height of the vertical crest wall is the reason for performing more research. Physical model tests are conducted to gain more knowledge about the maximum wind effect to obtain a better understanding of how it affects the overtopping discharge and the loading on seadikes.<br/><br/>The following research question is covered in this master thesis: What is the maximum wind effect on wave overtopping at dikes with crest elements? The aim of the present research is to examine this wind effect based on physical model tests, which are performed at Deltares in Delft, the Netherlands. Experiments on a small-scale model of a seadike with a smooth outer slope at an angle of tan⁡(α)=1:3 are conducted. In total, four dike configurations were tested, consisting of a crest wall, which is placed at the seaside of the dike crest in one case and on the land side in another. A paddle wheel is used to simulate the maximum effect of wind, based on the idea that all vertical spray exceeding the dike crest is transported over the crest by onshore wind. The maximum wind effect is determined by comparing the tests with and without the use of the paddle wheel.<br/><br/>The results of this investigation show an optimisation of the existing guidelines, such as TAW (2002), for calculating the overtopping discharge. For non-breaking waves, the wave steepness is not included in the TAW (2002) overtopping formula, but the data show a clear dependency on this parameter.<br/><br/>One of the most significant findings from this study is a quantification of the maximum wind effect. It provides an amplification factor on the overtopping discharge. This maximum wind effect is defined as the ratio q_wind/q, which indicates the overtopping discharge with maximum wind effect due to onshore blowing winds (q_wind) over the overtopping discharges without wind effects (q).<br","Maximum wind effect; Physical model tests; Crest elements; Seadike; Overtopping discharge; Coastal Engineering; Coastal structures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-20","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","",""

The short rates are modelled under the one-factor Hull-White (HW1F) model and for the exchange rate we assume they follow geometric Brownian motion. The key insight is that the cumulative distribution function (CDF) can be recovered semi-analytically using Fourier-cosine expansion, whereby the series coefficients are readily available from the characteristic function of the total exposure. The characteristic function in turn can be solved numerically via quadrature rules.

The current cryptographic algorithms that are used to enable secure communication across insecure channels have the potential to be brute-forced by sufficiently powerful quantum computers, endangering the security of many electronic devices and protocols that use popular algorithms such as RSA. Although it is not feasible currently, these advancements in quantum computing are accelerating rapidly and the impact this could have on the security of the cyberspace is too great, therefore countermeasures must be considered. To protect against this threat, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has started an initiative to work towards standardizing quantum-resistant cryptoschemes before the advancements in quantum computing reach such a level. This has led to a great amount of collaboration by researchers to develop and analyze the security of these quantum-proof schemes over the past six years.<br/><br/>This thesis explores the various post-quantum cryptoschemes that are currently being considered, outlining their differences and the potential advantage of using each scheme. While all of the current submissions are required to have a software implementation to be part of the submission, this is not the case for a hardware implementation. Hardware implementations can have different vulnerabilities than software implementations and, due to this, having one or preferably multiple hardware implementations available for these schemes would greatly advance the security analysis that can be performed for these candidates. Therefore, this thesis describes the hardware implementation process of one such scheme, NTRU, one of the longest standing lattice-based schemes, since this danger of quantum computing is equally dangerous for the many hardware devices and chips that are used worldwide. It discusses the various design decisions that have been made during the implementation and presents all functions that have been implemented to perform the encryption and decryption step of the deterministic public key encryption (DPKE) algorithm of NTRU. This implementation combines work that has been done for the previous NTRU submissions and adds additional logic to support the new and adjusted parts of the current NTRU algorithm. The results show a fully functional encryption and decryption functionality of the NTRU cryptoscheme where the full encryption function can be performed in 3038 clock cycles while still maintaining a considerably low area usage, showing a speedup of 16 when compared to an optimized software implementation. Aside from this result, this thesis also provides several potential adjustments to the hardware implementation that can be made to reduce the decryption time at the cost of additional area so that the hardware can be tuned depending on the desired specifications.<br","Cryptography; Hardware-based encryption; Hardware; decryption; encryption; Hardware Security; security; FPGA; privacy; Quantum","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Engineering","",""

It is difficult to run all tests after each code change, so the tests are often run for batches of code changes by different developers, late in the release cycle. This has developers waiting for tests longer than desirable and makes it difficult to link a failed test to a specific code change. To increase developer productivity a subset of high-priority tests can be selected to be run directly after a code change. Tests can furthermore be reordered so that tests reveal faults faster. This field is called test case selection and prioritization (TCS&amp;P). On the flip side the large number of historical test executions can be leveraged to predict test failures. This can be done by training machine learning models on the historical execution data and metrics about the software repository at which these tests were executed. The prediction of failure is then used as the basis for test selection and the confidence of the prediction can be used for prioritization, with higher risk tests being run earlier resulting in tests failing faster on average. This technique is named predictive TCS&amp;P (PTCS&amp;P). This work describes an attempt at PTCS&amp;P by using the historical test executions of Adyen, a financial technology platform. The resulting model has a recall of 95.4% and can be used for three use cases: skipping the tests with a low probability of reveal- ing a fault, which misses 0.6% of faults and saves 34.4% wall clock time, selecting only tests with a high probability of revealing a fault, which saves 94% of time and reveals 39% of faults, and prioritizing based on the chance of failure, which allows for partial left shifting of these tests, which reduces the average time to first fault revealed by 95%.","test; case; selection; prioritization; predictive; machine; learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

High- frequency bank transaction data have previously been proven valuable in accessing the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (Neuteboom et al., 2021). To the best of my knowledge, this type of data has not been used to estimate the economic impacts of a natural catastrophe. I focus on a synthetic difference-in-differences methodology to estimate the impact. I find that the economic impact is 18,045 EUR on average of extra spending per inundated individual in Valkenburg aan de Geul, the most heavily hit area. This is very similar to the damage estimate of the ENW (2021) of 18,713 EUR on average per person for the inundated in Valkenburg aan de Geul. Further- more, the duration of the economic impact for the inundated is roughly 35 weeks on average. Finally, I did not find a measurable economic impact to uninundated and evacuated individuals. In summary, high-frequency bank transaction data paired with a synthetic difference-in-differences model is a reliable gauge of the economic impact of a flood and should be used to estimate the economic impact of future natural disasters. Additionally, it can be be the empirical foundation for calibrating existing damage models.","Flood; Damage; Big data; Synthetic difference in differences; Transaction data","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Electrocoagulation (EC) is a water treatment technology where the coagulant is dosed electrochemically from a pure metal electrode. The performance of Fe-EC in a full water column using a continuous flow setup has had little to no attention yet. The aim of this proof of principle study is to determine the feasibility and the practical potential of Fe-EC during a continuous flow implementation, and to give insight to the general performance of the system in terms of water quality improvement. <br/><br/>Experiments were conducted in a continuous flow Fe-EC unit with descending flow. Two pairs of electrodes were used, evenly distributed along the length of the unit, and at the bottom an air diffuser was used to provide aeration. Operational configuration of the unit was needed as no prior experiments had been performed with this unit and the exact behavior of the electrodes, flow and aeration within the continuous flow system were unknown. Furthermore, experiments were conducted to evaluate the removal efficiency of Fe-EC on nutrients, organic micropollutants (OMPs), microbes and (heavy) metals, operating at a pH of 8 and 7. <br/><br/>The operational parameters were set to deliver an Fe dosage of 50 mg/L, flow rate of 7.5 L/h, and a current density of 15 mA/cm2. It was found that the system was able to achieve high removal of phosphorus up to 99% during all experiment sets. Highest removal of E. coli and coliphages was found when operating at a pH of 7, reaching 1.56 and 0.65 log removal respectively. Removal of OMPs was found to vary greatly among the compounds and measurements. More stable results were found when using increased OMP concentrations (around 50 µg/L), reaching removals varying from 7% to 25% at a pH of 8, and slightly lower removals from 1% to 15% at a pH of 7. No correlation was found between the observed removal and the acid dissociation constant (pKa) or the η–octanol–water partition ratio (Kow) of measured OMPs. Lastly, various heavy metals show affinity for removal during Fe-EC, such as arsenic, copper, zinc, manganese, chromium and vanadium. Using increased influent concentrations of the heavy metals (around 80 µg/L) resulted in removals above 85% for arsenic, zinc, chromium and vanadium.<br/><br/>The system has shown to have high removal potential on secondary effluent, even when contaminant concentrations reach high levels. Nevertheless, uncertainties and were found for the practical implementation of Fe-EC, and design and operational parameters first have to be optimized in order to fully utilize the potential that Fe-EC has.","Electrocoagulation; Continuous Flow System; Proof of Principle","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-04","","","","Civil Engineering | Environmental Engineering","",""

Therefore, there is high demand for a comprehensive driveability analysis that considers key aspects of the installation process, such as the soil conditions, the pile-soil interaction and efficiency of the driving equipment used.<br/>The total resistance during pile driving is usually estimated through numerical simulation techniques based on the wave equation, whereby the main inputs are the hammer, pile and soil properties. Commercially available driveability software, such as AllWave PDP, enable the modelling of the hammer-pile-soil system and simulate the stress wave phenomena during the installation process. Moreover, these programs have an integrated database of a variety of hammer models (hydraulic, diesel and more) that are used in practice, and also static and dynamic parameters for a variety of soils. <br/>One of the key aspects in which this Thesis focuses on, is the static component of the driving resistance, referred to as SRD. Over the years, various SRD models have been developed, with the aim of estimating the static soil resistance during driving, while the dynamic components of the total resistance (increasing resistance due to inertial and viscous rate effects) are commonly being quantified in terms of damping factors. <br/>This Thesis investigates the performance of frequently used traditional driveability models, such as the Alm &amp; Hamre (2001), Toolan &amp; Fox (1977) and Stevens et al (1982), in predicting the SRD in dense sand conditions. Furthermore, it examines the application of the Unified Method in SRD estimations. The Unified Method is a recently developed static capacity design approach for driven piles in silica sand. This design method will be included in the forthcoming 2022 edition of the ISO guidelines and will replace the four CPT based design methods (ICP, UWA, NGI, Fugro). <br/>The performance of the aforementioned models has been evaluated through predictions of blow count profiles by utilizing pile driving records from five sites in the Netherlands, namely the Eemshaven (project known as Euripides) and APM, RWG, SIF and HHT terminals in the Port of Rotterdam. The diameter of the open-ended steel tubular piles examined in this study, is 0.762 m for the Euripides project and 1.42 m for the rest of the projects.<br/>This research, will eventually highlight advantages and disadvantages of the commonly used SRD models, while it will further prove that by modifying the Unified Method, overall better driveability predictions can be made for a larger range of pile diameters than the current methods. The gain is that on one hand, with improved driveability predictions it is possible to minimize installation risks, optimize driving acceptance criteria, and select an appropriate hammering equipment. On the other hand, having a set of formulas that can be used both in estimating the SRD, as well as the static axial capacity, can reduce the engineering effort.<br","Driveability; Driveability analysis; Unified Method (2020); Alm and Hamre (2001); Stevens et al (1982); Toolan and Fox (1977); SRD; steel open ended piles; shaft resistance during driving; toe resistance during driving; AllWave PDP; Driveability models; static soil resistance during driving; friction fatigue; set up; base displacement model; Smith (1960) soil model; pile driveability in sand","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","",""

Tuning of HSC requires knowledge of the neuromuscular system (NMS) of drivers. This MSc thesis project aimed to experimentally validate a linear parameter varying (LPV) technique for modeling driver neuromuscular admittance in time-varying conditions, scheduled with grip force. LPV estimations were compared with estimates made with a Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm and, where possible, a linear time-invariant (LTI) estimation technique. A human-in-the loop experiment was performed in the HMILab fixed-base driving simulator at the AE faculty. To force drivers to change their neuromuscular admittance, a steering wheel manipulation task was designed, where drivers had to keep the steering wheel angle in between limits that were visually indicated on the dashboard, while a perturbation torque was applied. Changing the limits (narrow/wide) forced drivers to adjust their admittance. The results show that the relation between admittance and grip force is not only different between subjects, but also for the same drivers in time-invariant and time-varying conditions. This leads to fundamental scheduling issues for the LPV modelling approach. The variance accounted for (VAF) for the estimated steering wheel angle varied between 0% and 90%. To overcome these scheduling problems, individual LPV models can be constructed on time-varying experiment data. RLS estimates reproduced the system output data accurately with average VAF between 80 and 90% for all experiments. RLS low-frequency (&lt; 2.5Hz) FRF estimates closely match the LTI FRF estimates. The largest variations in driver admittance occur in this lower frequency domain, making the RLS algorithm an effective tool for identifying changes in driver neuromuscular admittance, which can be applied online.","Neuromuscular admittance; linear parameter varying; grip force; recursive least squares; human driver; time-varying identification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2027-09-30","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Keller, A.I. (mentor); Cramwinckel, Laura (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Death is and endlessly interesting and relevant topic. After all, every human will encounter it one way or another. The common denominator among the many cultural and ideological perspectives on death is the cessation of all biological processes of an organism. But beyond that come rituals, values, and beliefs, all of which are subjective and open to interpretation. This graduation project was about what this subjectivity means for children. Children generally start developing more abstract questions about life and death at the age of 9 to 11. How can we educate children on something that we cannot fully describe and define ourselves?<br/><br/>This graduation project was conducted in collaboration with Nederlands Uitvaart Museum Tot Zover, a museum that aims to encourage people of all ages to reflect on death, mortality, and bereavement. For a couple of years, the museum has had the ambition to increase their impact on children’s death education with an experiential concept that operates outside of the museum walls. This ambition aligned with my own in the overall project goal: I aimed to design the narrative concept of a Tot Zover pop-up exhibition for 9- to 11-year-old children about the subjective aspects of death.<br/><br/>From the project goal, I derived the main research question: How do 9- to 11-year-old children currently learn about the subjective aspects of death and how could storytelling make a positive contribution? Among other activities, I conducted literature research and contextmapping sessions with schoolchildren. I concluded that children currently learn about the subjective aspects of death – now classified as the psychological and metaphysical aspects – in isolation, since the topic is not often discussed. A positive change could be made through storytelling: telling stories to a group of children invites them to share their own experiences, fantasies, and reflections, which promotes feelings of comfort, and which may enrich the perspectives of the listening children.<br/><br/>I used the research insights to form a central theme which the narrative concept should discuss. I defined that the concept should ask children what death means to them instead of teaching them what to think or believe. Children should see that death has many faces and each one may be open to interpretation. Contrary to the current situation, death should not be something the children wish to avoid, but an approachable entity. The concept should present children with a diverse and colorful spectrum of death stories, which may contradict one another or take the children out of their comfort zones.<br/><br/>The theme, using the narrative blueprint called the hero’s journey, was implemented in my design goal: to give 9- to 11-year-old schoolchildren space to: (1) explore death stories, (2) embrace that such stories, in their variety, may be authentic and personal, and (3) explore their own stories. I defined that, through the interactions with my concept, children should feel adventurous, imaginative, acknowledged, and connected.<br/><br/>The criteria led to the design Mijn Eigen Hein, the narrative concept for an exhibition that travels across locations of the OBA (Public Library of Amsterdam). It is a result of an iterative ideation and conceptualization phase, where developing a detailed narrative was complemented by designing the interactables that would bring that narrative to life.<br/><br/>While interacting with the concept, children explore death stories embodied through a collection of 10 Hein masks that represent contrasting perspectives on the subjective aspects of death. They learn to embrace that death can be many things, and that anyone is free to form their opinion. In the climax of their journey, they express their own stories by making their own Hein and add it to the digital collection by scanning it in a presentation ritual.<br/><br/>The design outcome is a storyboard of the children’s learning journey, concept art for the exhibition scenography and prototypes of the learning materials and the collection of Hein masks.<br/><br/>The concept was evaluated with positive results through a prototype test with schoolchildren and through feedback meetings with experts of experience design. I concluded that Mijn Eigen Hein fulfills the design goal. Children understood the story’s moral, and they could use the mask as a canvas for their personal stories. Although it was found that not all children share their deepest ideas, I argued that even those children learn during the journey by hearing their classmates’ diverse stories. The interaction qualities could unfortunately not be evaluated through the test with children, as I found that they do not yet possess the linguistic skills to reflect on their interactions and experiences on the required level of abstraction.<br/><br/>Mijn Eigen Hein has the potential to be a viable way of contributing to death education beyond Tot Zover’s museum walls, by which this project accomplishes its main objective. I would, however, recommend the museum to place the embodiment design concept’s technology high on the priority list. Moreover, Tot Zover will need to attract funding and further develop the narrative with the OBA and possibly other partners if the project is scheduled to launch in September 2023.<br/><br/>In its academic context, the project has generated new insight on the merits of storytelling in death education of 9- to 11-year-old children. More specifically, making use of this age group’s inherent fantastical worldview, although controversial in children’s psychology, proves to make an effective and fitting contribution to breaking the death taboo. If the concept was implemented on a large scale, I could imagine that it would help to shape a generation that is open-minded about other death perspectives and that gives death a healthy place in their lives.<br","Death education; Fantasy; Subjectivity; Storytelling; Children; Diversity; Culture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

In spite of their advantages, UAVs can be used for terrorist attacks to fly over restricted areas, transport illegal materials or cause an accident in crowded areas. Thus, in the event of non-cooperative drone users, radars can be ideal detection devices, due to their capability to operate day and night in all-weather conditions. However, due to birds and UAVs having similar altitude, speed and radar cross section, many false alarms can occur.

However, limited solutions exist based on the differences in flight behavior, which is referred as ""track behavior"" in the radar domain. Assuming that drones and birds have different kinematic characteristics, the question arises, whether these can be tracked by surveillance radars in such a way that radar processing can recognize either or both, based on a given tracking time interval. In particular, possible methods include the exploration of the flights of drones and birds, the kinematic features extraction from tracking their trajectories, their implementation to machine learning models in order to classify these two flying objects, as well as the evaluation of their classification accuracy.<br/><br/>The methodology of this thesis project is divided into two classification cases. First, a 6-Degree-of-Freedom quadcopter simulator is used to generate drone trajectories, while the bird data are created from real bird GPS tracks. The second part of the work classifies real bird and drone trajectories tracked by a man-portable scanning surveillance radar. The current research can provide valuable information for the development of classification algorithms for existing radars, and fill the gaps for future efforts to improve the classification of birds and drones.","drone tracking; drone classification; surveillance radar; kinematics; machine learning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-09-19","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

This thesis presents the characterization of a flip-chip interconnection used for an integrated front end at 150 GHz (G-band) with an on-package leaky-wave dual lens antenna. Two paths for the front-end integration have been proposed. The first path adopts CPW transmission lines on 500 μm-thick fused silica and provides easy assembly and seamless flip-chip capabilities. The second uses microstrip transmission lines on 50 μm-thick fused silica and provides lower transmission line loss but a challenging assembly and flip-chip interconnection. In this thesis, a path toward microstrip and CPW flip-chip interconnections has been outlined at the high millimeter-wave frequencies. Two-port test structures using CPW transmission lines were developed, adopting a double Thru-Reflect-Line calibration and allowing for accurate extracting of the interconnection response. The final interconnection to the MMICs has been realized using a via-less CPW to microstrip transition with high impedance transmission line S11 matching compensation. The simulated S11 and S22 are below -12 dB, Ohmic loss below 0.6 dB, radiation loss below 0.4 dB, and transmission line losses around 0.15 dB/mm.","flip-chip bonding; MMIC packaging; chip interconnection; mm-wave; g band","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Wireless Communication and Sensing","",""

Modern e-bikes feature Internet of Things (IoT) modules capable of collecting and sending cycling data that can be used for traffic safety analysis. This study explores the potential of using cycling data to detect dangerous intersections and then implement local low-speed areas using geofencing. <br/><br/>A natural cycling experiment with 10 participants is conducted, where data is collected similar to the capabilities of e-bike IoT modules (GNSS, power and IMU data) and participants are asked to cycle through Delft, The Netherlands. The data is combined with a traffic accident dataset from the Dutch government, where intersections with accidents are labelled dangerous. The cycling data is separated into separate intersection approaches, based on positional data. Metrics based on power and cadence data show the most significant statistical difference (p-values &lt;0.02) and the largest effect size (Cohen's d &gt;0.80) at dangerous intersections. A binary classification model is trained on the dataset, which can correctly predict whether an intersection is dangerous or safe with an accuracy of 68,2%, a specificity of 50,0%, and a sensitivity of 24,2%. This prediction is based on the metrics of a single intersection approach.<br/><br/>To investigate the viability of using geofencing to implement low-speed areas at designated dangerous intersections, a simulation is carried out to determine the minimum size of a geofence that effectively slows down e-bike cyclists. The minimal effective geofence size to limit a cyclist's speed at an intersection is determined by simulating cyclists approaching a geofence for several geofence perimeters, incline levels, and wind speeds. The e-bike's motor stops supporting when the geofence is entered and the cyclist is cycling above a target speed. The minimal effective geofence size ranges from 50 to 300+ m and depends on the target speed, wind speed, and road incline.<br/><br/>This study shows that cycling data can be used to identify dangerous intersections. Enforcing a slower speed on intersections with local geofencing is not feasible, as the geofences have to be extremely large, showing a lot of overlap on other intersections in cities due to high intersection density. Future work can be done on the intersection risk estimation method and the feasibility of speed-limiting geofences that employ active braking.","Cycling accident analysis; Intersection safety; Natural cycling data; Machine learning; E-bike; IoT data","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-09-16","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Ghaffarian Niasar, M. (mentor); Lekic, A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The energy transition requires massive expansion and reinforcement of the transmission grid which is challenging because of its high utilization, and regular maintenance, replacement, and repair. The difficulty of performing maintenance on high-voltage equipment and especially the substations lies in the fact that a big part of the substation needs to be taken out of service for the maintenance crew to work safely. When a part of a substation is taken out of service this influences the capacity and redundancy and thus the reliability of the grid. A planned outage is required to take a part of a substation out of service, these planned outages are limited in frequency and duration due to a shortage of especially trained and skilled people in combination with the high utilization of the grid.<br/><br/>The objective of this master thesis is to investigate important design aspects for mobile transmission stations to reduce/prevent planned outages during maintenance, replacement, and expansion projects on TenneT's (the Dutch transmission system operator) permanent substations. A mobile substation is a fully equipped substation mounted on one or multiple trailers to be easily transported. The mobile substation provides a bypass during maintenance on permanent substations allowing continued service without requiring planned outage.<br/>A case study in this work shows that using a mobile substation during maintenance, replacement, and expansion projects on substations can possibly save TenneT several hundred million euros per year. Using the mobile substation on a 380 kV or 220 kV substation would make it possible to work on multiple 380 or 220 kV substations at the same time. It would also be easier to get a planned outage permit for the 150 kV and 110 kV substations. The use of a mobile substation would thus increase the efﬁciency of the projects and would reduce the amount of required critical resources.<br/><br/>Besides the case study, this work investigates the design requirements for mobile substations. The mobile substation should be able to (partly) bypass all TenneT substations and should contain mobile power transformers. The weight of the mobile substation is limited by road regulations. The transformers will be the heaviest components in the substation thus special attention is needed for their design. For the power transformers, a shell-type core design would be preferred with (high temperature) hybrid-insulation, due to its compact design and robustness for transportation. To comply with road regulations without special permits six 83.33 MVA single-phase transformers with an approximate weight of 36 tonne need to be connected in two banks of three single-phase transformers to reach the standardized capacity of 500~MVA.<br/><br/>The insulation distance in the mobile substation will greatly inﬂuence the size of the substation when deployed and during transport. Therefore, this insulation distance is an important design aspect which is covered in this work. The standards for insulation distances were analyzed. This analysis gave rise to doubts if these distances would apply to compact substations with large electrodes. An experiment was conducted at the TU Delft Electrical Sustainable Power Lab to determine the dielectric strength of large electrodes with sharp points in compact substations, and to verify if the insulation distances as speciﬁed in the standards should be applied to mobile substations.<br/>It was found that the large electrodes with sharp points have similar breakdown voltages as a rod-rod gap setup. A higher breakdown voltage was found for the large spheres with protrusions compared to the rod-conductor gap which is used by the IEC standard. This indicates that the IEC standard insulation distances would be sufﬁcient for use in a compact substation. Whether the substation can be made more compact by reducing the insulation distances should be investigated by executing experiments on an actual skid in a future study. <br","Mobile substations; planned outages; Energy transition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-16","","","","Electrical Engineering | Electrical Power Engineering","",""

Recently also open data communities have been set up by several national governments. The effects of setting up these data communities on open data benefits and barriers and whether an effect exists at all is not yet clear, because there has been little scientific research into data communities. This thesis therefore focuses on the effects of setting up open data communities. <br/>A single-unit case study was conducted to gather qualitive information of the effects of data communities. The case study focussed on the Dutch open data community and consisted of two parts, a document analysis and in-depth interviews. The results of the analysis show how the Dutch community contributes to enhancing open data benefits, including (indirectly) creating more informed citizens, increasing the access to capacity and resources outside of the data publishing organisation and a higher problem-solving capacity. Furthermore, the interview participants agree to a large extent that communities contribute to intragovernmental collaboration and the use of collective intelligence to solve public problems. According to the interviewees, the community also (potentially) mitigates open data barriers such as the lack of interest in using open data (by governmental organisations). The interviewees stated that the community managers made sure every question that was posted got a sufficient answer within a reasonable amount of time and therefore the barrier stating that the data provider ignores requests and suggestions of data users could also be mitigated, as well as difficulties in the interaction with the data provider. Both researchers and most community users and managers argued that the community could also contribute to mitigating low engagement of public managers with open data and increasing the knowledge and skills of employees to use the open data. Lastly, according to the interview participants, the community can decrease difficulty in discovering/locating data and not being able to combine and connect datasets. The interviewees were also questioned about how institutional instruments could increase the value of the open data community. Although the participants concluded that the contribution of formal instruments (such as rules) is limited, they indicated informal rules (such as norms) and enforcing instruments (such as rewards) can contribute to the value that is created by an open data community. <br/>The community-specific challenges identified in the analysis can contribute to the process of designing an open data community, because policy makers can compare scope and design choices with the empirical experiences. This thesis also provides an exploratory scientific contribution: this research provides insight into how open data communities can contribute to enhancing open data benefits and the mitigation of open data barriers. Although the results are promising, certain limitations are applicable to the research. The thesis only studied one open data community and the full list of open data benefits and barriers was reduced based upon an assessment of the author of the thesis. Last of all, the interviews focused on qualitative data. Combining the results of this thesis with other case studies can improve generalisability. <br","open data; open data communities; open government data; effects of data communities","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Climate policy minimising the amount of emitted carbon can not be evaluated without accurate quantification of CO2 emissions.<br/>Not only the amount of emitted carbon is of interest, but also being able to place emissions in both the spatial as well as the temporal context is necessary. This gives policy makers and scientist the ability to compare the climate impact of neighbourhoods and cities. For doing so, it is necessary to have a rasterised emission estimate with a high resolution.<br/><br/>This study proposes a new method using a Random Forest model trained on the Hestia dataset. The model utilises spatial co-variates, such as population density, night time lights, to estimate emissions in a resolution of 1 X 1 km.<br/>To assess the spatial generalisability of the model, the emission observations of the Hestia dataset are compared against model estimates. The explained variance and R2 is the highest in log transformed form at ∼0.47. The features and hyper-parameters<br/>selected through this method are found to be stable under a variety of model specifications. This provides evidence that the presented model performance generalisability are the that could be achieved given the current data. The relevant covariates for the model are the following, in order of importance: Nightly radiance, intersection density, population, GDP, PM25 and Pedestrian intersections. Inspection of the partial dependence shows that each of these variables, except PM25, have a positive increasing relationship with the emission estimate. This relationship quickly converges for higher values. The highest relative errors mainly occur around the peripheries of cities, for cells with low emission values.<br/><br/>This study lays forward a new scalable approach to estimate emissions and the spatial distribution in urban areas. Currently the study data is limited, but as more data becomes available a Random Forest regression approach could prove to produce accurate insights.

Materials/elements are used whereafter they are wasted which is a problem considering the finite material supply on earth. Therefore, the current linear economy needs to move towards a circular one in which materials are reused and thus kept in the circle. However, reuse is still not a common practise. This is due to the fact that there are no insights in the structural feasibility, potential savings on environmental impact, and costs related to reuse. Besides the lacking knowledge about the different aspects there is no clear image where the potentials for reuse are located within the sector.<br/>The goal of this research is to give insights in the reuse potentials and to find opportunities within the sector. This research started with a material flow analysis to find promising material flows in the sector. In this material flow analysis it was found that the demolition of office buildings is responsible for a big portion of the outgoing material flow and the majority of the ingoing material flow is related to the new construction of serial houses. In the analysis it was found that the elements with the highest ECI and mass are floor elements. Next the available floor elements coming from office buildings and the floor elements needed for the construction of serial houses were examined to check possible matches. It was found that new plank- and hollow core slab floors used in serial houses can potentially be substituted for reused monolithic- and hollow core slab floors out of office buildings. <br/>Thereafter, two different tools were developed. One related to the reuse of monolithic floors and one related to the reuse of hollow core slab floors. These tools are means to give insights in the reuse potentials considering the structural feasibility, potential savings on environmental impact, and costs. Different cases were checked using the tools and the following results were found:<br/>-In all cases it was structurally feasible to use reused floors coming from office buildings in the new construction of serial houses. <br/>-When reused floor elements are used it is possible to save 40-90% on environmental impact.<br/>-Reused floor elements can be cheaper or more expensive as new floor elements. <br/>These results are promising and hopefully contribute to an acceleration of reuse in practise. The research states where the potentials for reuse are located in the sector and presents two tools which check the reuse potentials considering structural feasibility, environmental impact, and costs. <br","reuse; Circularity; concrete; Floor; Environmental Impact; Structural feasibility; costs; Reuse Potential","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering - Structural Design","",""

Some of such flows also involve complex fluids, as in blood flow from the left atrium into the left ventricle in a human heart. Among the complexities of such fluids, we are interested in the viscoelastic nature. The effect of acceleration in vortex dynamics and forces has been studied for a long time. However, there have been discrepancies in the origin of the unsteady forces and modelling them. It is still not very well understood how unsteady forces scale in laminar, highly separated flows? On the other hand, the presence of viscoelasticity alters the vortex dynamics and hence the forces. It has been well studied how the viscoelasticity may affect steady state forces. However, the change in vortex dynamics and forces due to presence of viscoelasticity during acceleration is not well understood. This experimental study aims to add to the literature on unsteady force modelling, effect of viscoelasticity in unsteady forces and vortex dynamics. <br/><br/>To begin with, shear and extensional rheological experiments were performed to identify a weakly elastic fluid. An experimental setup was built with a linear traverse, PIV system and force sensor. The experiments were performed with an accelerating flat plate (aspect ratio of two), in the identified viscoelastic fluid and also in a viscosity matched Newtonian fluid for one-one comparison. To understand the vortex dynamics, we use FTLE fields, Lamb-Oseen model, and Q-criteria. We quantify the vortex formation time and other properties of a vortex ring. <br/><br/>Overall, we observe that both the vortex growth rate and the decay rate are enhanced by the presence of viscoelasticity. We extend the idea of optimal vortex formation to two time-scales instead of one. One, when the plate no longer provides energy and the other, when the vortex is filament free without any more addition of coherent fluid parcels. Furthermore, a limit for optimal vortex formation is proposed to indicate a completely different type of vortex dynamics at lower accelerations. The drag reduction and enhancement due to the presence of viscoelasticity qualitatively agrees well with the trend in literature. In terms of unsteady forces, we try to interpret an equivalent mass for potential flow's added mass in separated Newtonian flows. We propose a model using wake's mass, and it reasonably agrees with our experimental results in Newtonian cases. We use FTLE ridges and vortex-frame streamlines to estimate wake mass, along with a literature driven model for third dimension. Furthermore, we also propose that the added mass in separated flows is time varying and eventually reaches a constant value. Moreover, the effect of viscoelasticity is primarily observed in unsteady forces for acceleration less than optimal vortex formation limit.<br","Viscoelasticity; Vortex dynamics; Added mass; FTLE","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering","",""

The baby is developing, but so are a mother's fears and imaginations about her unborn child. Such imaginations about the unborn child and parenting methods are sure to evoke a range of emotions, including happiness, excitement, curiosity, anxiety, frustration, and maybe depression. Social comparison and intense emotional expression are two of the numerous opportunities offered by social networking platforms. Social comparison is a personality characteristic. Individuals who are highly social comparison-oriented make excessive social comparisons and are more affected by the outcomes. Social comparisons can be done intentionally, but more frequently they are done involuntarily. Social networking sites play a key role in the contemporary digital age in terms of personal experience sharing and constructive debate. However, research has found that the need for social comparison increases at times of stress, uncertainty, or adjustment. As a result, in unexpected and upsetting settings like pregnancy, social comparison may become more significant. The social comparison, psychology, and linguistics aspects of pregnancy had all previously been the subject of very few research, however, they had been done so independently. The objective of this research is to jointly comprehend the social, psychological, and linguistic aspects of pregnancy. In this research, a survey that was published on Reddit communities collected responses based on three questionnaires (Iowa-Netherlands Comparison Orientation Measure, Gratitude During Pregnancy Scale, and Tilburg Pregnancy Distress Scale), as well as a textual question on using social media while being pregnant.

One of these areas is the Baltic Sea, where the potential for wind energy is very large, but which is also prone to the occurrence of ice. For the design of offshore foundations it is paramount that ice-structure interaction is appropriately considered as ice-induced vibrations are known to significantly increase the loads. As a result, ice-mitigating measures may need to be included in the design. However, such measures will substantially increase the cost estimates required<br/>for competitive tenders. Hence it is valuable for developers to have early screening tools to assess this. The aim of the research was to provide a ‘feasibility map’, which predicts the necessity for ice-mitigating measures in the entire Baltic region. Feasibility of monopiles was considered both technically and economically. The former by imposing design, installation &amp; fabrication constraints and the latter was measured in terms of weight increase of monopiles. <br","Ice-structure interaction; offshore wind; monopile; design optimization; feasibility map","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Therefore, at every design iteration, differently from other integral equation methods, only the linear system has to be solved. Moreover, thanks to the use of a uniform sampling, a convolutional structure is obtained, implying that only a reduced number of projections are sufficient to characterize the entire matrix, reducing significantly the memory requirements, and allowing the solution of large scale systems. The linear system is then solved with an iterative solver, that, thanks to the convolutional properties, can be accelerated by fast matrix-vector products by using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The method is validated by studying the field scattered by a homogeneous and multilayer dielectric sphere, proving an accuracy within the discretization<br/>tolerance, and the capability of handling inhomogeneous structures.<br/>A Graphical User Interface (GUI) based on the presented method has been developed, with the aim of easing and assisting the user experience on the electromagnetic analysis. The GUI allows to simulate complex<br/>geometries combining elementary shapes, characterized by arbitrary materials, and excited by either plane waves or discrete ports. The solution can be post-processed in terms near-fields, far-fields, and network quantities. A representation in terms of impressed currents and incident voltage has been formulated to represent the incoherent radiometric sources in the V-MoM, used to analyse the power emitted by lossy semiconductors, characterized by a Drude’s dispersion for the conductivity.

(graduation committee); Schouten, Bram (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Modern organisations are increasingly dependent on data to develop new products, services and to improve their operations. However, they are increasingly dependent on external data resources which has led to the rise of data marketplaces where data are traded. This rapid rise of data marketplaces has led to a fragmented data sharing landscape resulting in data discovery issues for data consumers and a lack of trust by data providers. Recently, the concept of platforms to integrate different data marketplaces to reduce fragmentation has arised: data marketplace meta-platforms. However, these platforms still need to make sure that data providers stay in control over their data, as data providers will otherwise not be willing to share data at all. Staying in control over data for data providers is about data sovereignty. As data marketplace meta-platforms can reduce fragmentation in the data marketplace landscape, but relatively little is known regarding how data sovereignty can be achieved in that context, this research project explores governance mechanisms to enhance data sovereignty for data providers in the context of data marketplace meta-platforms.<br/>Using existing literature, four antecedents of data sovereignty were identified: data ownership, data access, data usage and data storage. Next, the current state of existing data marketplaces and data sharing initiatives was analysed using industry literature and insights from expert interviews. This analysis indicated that the use of a common legal basis among participants of data sharing ecosystems is often the first step. Additionally, processes were data providers arrange a data sharing agreement with data consumers and certification of entrants and participants are adopted in practice. <br/>Analysis of the data marketplace meta-platform context identified three areas of challenges for data sovereignty in the meta-context, namely DMMP-ecosystem where data providers fear DMMP-dominance. Secondly, at the level of the data provider, there is a lack of capabilities to estimate required control and to estimate the value of data assets. Thirdly, data access and usage is difficult to arrange at the level of a data transaction between data providers and consumers. The use of DMMPs to exchange very different types of data, across different industry sectors further complicates the process of granting access and arranging data usage. <br/>Using findings from the expert interviews, three categories of solutions were identified: architectural, trust-related and technology. Architectural solutions are about the structure of the DMMP and how decisions rights and ownership are distributed across the platform and its users. Trust-related solutions are both about building and sustaining trust, for example by use of certifications, and by increasing autonomy for data providers. Lastly, technology-related solutions such as data tagging and labelling can help to enhance visibility over the data chain and to further help data providers to stay in control over their data.<br","data marketplaces; data sovereignty; Digital Platform; platform governance; data economy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

Researchers suggest underground storage in depleted gas fields and geological formations to overcome this barrier of stationary storage. As found by Abe et al.

The Hyway 27 study, a report that explores the feasibility of a Dutch national hydrogen grid, proposes the installment of 6 PJ of storage capacity in salt caverns (Tezel et al., 2021; Juez-Larré et al., 2019).

Development is held back by little geologic knowledge of this interval as well as legislative constraints. Better understanding of the reservoir characteristics and well design in this depth range is necessary in order to accelerate the heat transition away from fossil fuels. The Breda Formation is deemed as one of the most promising formations within the medium depth range. Therefore, this formation, particularly the part found in the Zuiderzee Low (ZZL), is the focus point of this thesis. The reservoir characteristics are determined using newly obtained cutting information, novel biostratigraphic analyses, old and new seismic interpretations and petrophysical log data, eventually leading to a static reservoir model. Consequently, the static model is upscaled and used as input for dynamic simulations in the Harderwijk case study area. The static model provides new thickness, depth, porosity, permeability and transmissivity maps of the Breda Formation in the ZZL. These maps were generated using more data (types) than the current ones present in the REGIS model, and should therefore contain less uncertainty. The dynamic model provides insights into doublet lifetimes and flow rates for three different well trajectories in two possible reservoir scenarios. The horizontal trajectory proved superior in terms of doublet lifetime and flow rate for both reservoir scenarios. Finally, the current Dutch legislative framework covering the medium depth is limiting medium deep geothermal development in the Netherlands. A revision of the 500 m depth boundary separating the Mining and Water Law jurisdictions should be considered if the full potential of the medium depth is to be accessed.","Geothermal heat; Reservoir Characterization; Reservoir Modelling; Legislation; Medium Depth; Low Enthalpy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Energy Engineering","",""

Compared to traditional wired charging, wireless charging can avoid many safety issues. The efficiency of wireless power transfer (WPT) system is determined by many factors, the coupling factor is one of the most important factors. Therefore, estimating the coupling factor of WPT system is necessary. The research objectives of this work are to review and benchmark different methodologies of coupling factor estimation. Besides, a comprehensive method is selected and simulated. This work is focused on magnetic inductive WPT systems. Five different methodologies of coupling factor estimation for static WPT system and one methodology for dynamic WPT system is reviewed and analyzed. The methodology that uses alternative capacitors to estimate the coupling factor of a static WPT system is analyzed in detail. By using the zero crossing unit, the primary side and secondary side of WPT system are under full resonant. The WPT system will work in two different modes by changing the primary side capacitance. The two sets of circuit parameters will be recorded and calculated by a PLL unit. Based on theoretical analysis and the calculated parameter, the load and mutual inductance of WPT system can be identified. Therefore, the value of the coupling factor can be determined. The accuracy of coupling factor estimation of this methodology is higher than 97 %.<br/>Compared to the literature that proposed this methodology, this work made a sensitivity study. The circuit parameters are made to fluctuate in a certain range. The accuracy of estimation of mutual inductance is still higher than 95% when the primary side resistance, secondary side resistance and load fluctuate. However, the system becomes unstable when the primary side capacitance, inductance and secondary side inductance fluctuate. The reason is that when the capacitance and inductance change, the operating frequency will deviate from the resonant frequency. However, the mutual inductance identification unit is not able to detect this deviation. If the deviation of circuit parameters is updated, the accuracy of coupling factor estimation will remain at about 97%.","estimation; coupling factor; wireless power transfer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

Debtor payment prediction according to the historical payment behaviour of debtors can help give companies more insight into the risk of late payment. The debtor payment prediction is important for financial risk analysis because companies can better manage their cash flow to avoid the risk of capital chain breakage if they know when the invoice they present will be paid in advance. However, real-world data is far from perfect. With the inflow of various free-form data streams, it is challenging to integrate invoice payment records regarding debtors' historical payment behavior. As a result, the debtor payment prediction model sometimes performs sub-optimal because sufficient historical payment data cannot be retrieved for debtors. To improve debtor payment predictions, the data sparseness problem is studied to be addressed through entity resolution technology. Instead of fine-tuning a more complex model or adding new financial features, the prediction performance is studied to be improved by mining the information hidden in the data. More specifically, an end-to-end entity resolution workflow is proposed for invoice payment data to match debtors representing the same entity so that more historical payment data is available for the debtor that is known to be matched with other debtors.

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The consequences of climate change are happening now, and will increase in the years to come. Understanding the energy consumption of dredging operations is becoming increasingly important for dredging contractors such as Van Oord. With the emergence of more complex dredging situations, including dredging at limited depths and short sailing distances, it has become more difficult to provide an accurate estimate. This research was conducted to evaluate Van Oord's current estimation method, called VOHOP, and to provide an improved estimate of the energy consumption for dredging activities based on historical data. Therefore, the main objective of the study is as follows:<br/><br/>""To improve the estimation of energy consumption for dredging activities based on actual data.""<br/><br/>To achieve this goal, the method that is selected for creating improvement is comparing estimation methods with actual data where the difference gives insight in how to improve the estimation method, explained more briefly: EST vs ACT = DIFF. A literature review is first conducted to indicate what a dredging cycle looks like. After analyzing the different phases, consisting of sailing empty, loading, sailing full and disposing, the parameters that play a role in the consumption of energy during the dredging process are stated. For example for the sailing stages parameters that play a role are: sailing distance and sailing speed. Due to the relatively less elaborate calculation of energy consumption for the sailing stages, an improvement of estimation accuracy for these phases is considered to be valuable. Next, existing alternative methods for estimating energy consumption for the sailing phases are explored and the method proposed by Holtrop &amp; Mennen (HM), including modifications created for limited depth estimations, is selected as the most appropriate because it takes into account a larger number of parameters (such as depth, draught and distance), which is expected to increase the accuracy. After comparing the current estimation method VOHOP, with the method proposed by HM including modifications, one of the main findings is that the modified HM approach has a lower outcome of energy consumption compared to VOHOP especially for larger depths. After comparing, the starting point of the selected estimation method (EST) is created. The comparison of the modified HM method and VOHOP is done by means of the simulation software OpenCLSim in Python.<br/><br/>To validate the accuracy of either VOHOP or modified HM, comparative material consisting of actual data provided by Van Oord is used. Multiple projects (20+) that have been performed by a trailing suction hopper dredger (TSHD) of Van Oord are analyzed after which three are selected. The selection is based on the amount of data available for a project and the difference in depth and distance, to use data that is suitable for comparison. After filtering out non-representative data (missing data points or too large time steps), the actual data is analyzed where a distinction is made between acceleration, free sailing and deceleration. Using the suitable data for comparison contributes to the actual data (ACT) part of this research.<br/>\\<br/>\\<br/>The selected actual data is compared with the modified HM approach for estimating energy consumption, which contributes to the DIFF part. For the free sailing part, a main finding when comparing the modified HM with the actual data is the deviation (lower estimation compared to actual data) for increasing depth estimations (analyzed for depths up to 60 m). A possible reason for this is due to the applied modifications for the modified HM approach that are observed to have less impact on the estimation for increasing depths with respect to the draught. However, estimates for limited depth also show a deviation as the results are more sensitive and show an asymptotic behaviour for which a correction is recommended. It is therefore concluded that the modified HM approach needs corrections for both estimating deeper situations as for situations with more limited depths. After analyzing the resistance components of the modified HM approach in different situations, consisting of different ratios of depth and draught, the reason for the large deviation in the modified HM method for deeper situations and the greater sensitivity for more limited depths is found in the contribution of the wave resistance term $R_w$. This is found out after comparing and determining the contribution of all resistance terms for multiple situations gathered from real time projects of actual data containing increasing depths and draughts. A correction to the wave resistance calculation is made using actual data, finding a fitting between increasing wave resistance for increasing vessel draught with respect to water depth. The result is a proposed HM method containing a less sensitive estimation method that takes into account the draught of the vessel related to the water depth for both deeper situations and shallower situations.<br/><br/>The acceleration and deceleration phases of the actual data are considered inappropriate for comparison with the modified HM approach, since the used power in the actual data contains the effect of slip, causing the vessel to use more power for reaching a certain velocity than actually required according to modified HM. Therefore, to improve the estimation of the acceleration and deceleration, a generalized fit is found in the actual data for the power in relation to time. This fit is generated for different ranges of depth and is coupled with the sailed distance to quantify whether the distance has any effect on the results. It is found that at a short sailing distance a significantly lower velocity is achieved, which in turn affects the power used. By taking into account depth and distance, an estimation fit results that takes into account a larger number of parameters (velocity, distance, depth and draught) than the VOHOP method, and is therefore expected to produce more accurate results. With the estimation fits created for acceleration and deceleration and the corrected estimation method, HM proposed, for free sailing, the outcome is a newly created estimation tool that is based on historical data.<br/><br/>The improvement of the newly developed estimation method is validated by comparing VOHOP and the new estimation tool with eight cases from historical data. The cases are selected at different depths and different distances and are found in the selected projects for this research. The results show an increase in accuracy for the acceleration phase, while the other two phases, free sailing and deceleration, show fluctuating results. The reason for the fluctuation in the free sailing phase is the difference in duration of the phase caused by the definition of acceleration and free sailing, where the new estimation tool considers part of the free sailing as acceleration. The results indicate that the power usage is more accurately estimated by the new estimation tool, which indicates that the fluctuations of energy estimates are caused by a miss-estimation of duration instead of power usage. For deceleration, the fluctuating results can be attributed to the fluctuating pattern of deceleration, which may be caused by external factors such as traffic or currents, making it difficult to predict the energy consumption for this part of the sailing phase. All in all, the new estimation tool exhibits greater accuracy for the overall energy consumption estimation compared to the current estimation method VOHOP. In addition, the estimation of power consumption during free sailing shows improvement, indicating that incorrect estimates of energy during free sailing are more likely to be caused by inaccurate estimations of the duration instead of inaccurate estimations of power.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the results show that when considering depth, distance and draught as input parameters and applying a data based correction, the accuracy of the estimation method increases. Where the results do show an improvement, it is recommended that further research be conducted on the estimation of energy consumption and sailing duration for acceleration and deceleration. Several assumptions were made in this study to simplify the analysis such as constant wave climate, where a follow-up study could verify these assumptions or even improve the results of the study by implementing additional consequences for these assumptions. Moreover, this study took into account a certain number of parameters and observed only one vessel type, where adding more parameters or considering more vessel types would give a clear picture of the reliability of the estimation method and energy consumption. A further study is needed to perform the same procedure of improving the estimation also for the other phases of a dredging cycle, since these phases do contribute to a large extent of the total energy consumption of a dredging cycle. Finally, using a larger amount of data for this study could reduce the uncertainty of the results and increase the reliability. In addition, an increase in the quality of the data further increases the reliability of the results.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

This kind of acoustic tweezer is gaining increasing attention due to its high throughput capability and non-invasiveness. In addition, this device allows for parallel manipulation of bio-molecules. Therefore, it can provide statistically significant data about the DNA replication process, which is widely considered a stochastic process. Understanding the dynamics of the DNA replication process plays a vital role in developing medicine to cure diseases that are still incurable today. Most single-molecule techniques, such as optical tweezers, magnetic tweezers, and atomic force microscopy, can only manipulate a limited number of particles simultaneously.

This report describes the design, fabrication, simulation and characterization of an easy-tobuild and cost-effective acoustic tweezer. The trapping stiffness of this device is derived from finite element modelling and experiments.

On the contrary, true-time-delay (TTD) planar lenses, which do not resort to phase wrapping, can achieve large bandwidths. One convenient way to design wideband TTD lenses is by means of artificial dielectric layers (ADLs), which are stacks of sub-wavelength-period patch arrays embedded in a host medium to increase its effective permittivity to values higher than commercially available dielectrics. The procedure to retrieve the effective refractive index for a given ADL stratification is reported, as well as the synthesis of the multi-section transformers in ADL technology. Trade-offs including bandwidth, focal ratio, lens diameter, and thickness, are discussed and related to the manufacturing constraints of artificial dielectrics, such as the number of metal layers, maximum achievable effective permittivity, and smallest features realizable in printed circuit board technology. An example of design is also presented, operating from 70 to 140 GHz with a lens diameter of 11.5 wavelengths at the highest frequency. A modeling method for the analysis of a flat lens based on ADLs is presented. This consists of a combined geometrical optics (GO) / physical optics (PO) approach, where each GO ray is studied as a plane wave problem to evaluate the reflection/transmission through each unit cell of the lens.

(mentor); Langer, J.K.A. (graduation committee); Qian, QK (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Indonesia has ambitious targets to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 29 to 41% by 2030 and to achieve net-zero emissions by 2060. The residential sector in Indonesia consumes close to fifty percent of the country’s overall electricity demand. In the last decade, the residential demand for power has doubled, indicating a substantial rise. As a country with more than 17,000 islands, it is crucial to tackle the global warming implications including rising sea levels, significant drought risk, and rainfall fluctuations due to increased emissions arising from the surging energy consumption of Indonesia. Renewable energy installations, especially solar rooftop, and energy efficiency initiatives are some effective strategies to reduce Indonesia’s household emissions. Therefore, the purpose of this thesis is to study the decarbonisation potential of the residential sector’s supply and demand sides through energy-efficient appliances, efficient building envelope design, and rooftop PV deployment. This report majorly addresses the research gap in evaluating the impact of continuous revision to appliance performance standards and the impact of current efficiency standards fixed by the government. To answer the research problem, three scenarios from 2023 to 2030 are designed; business as usual, government policy, and ambitious. Using the bottom-up stock model method, the projected electricity consumption of four appliances (air conditioner, refrigerator, rice cooker, and LED lamps) was determined. For rooftop PV, the electricity production was forecasted using the PVwatts software, and scenarios were created based on government targets, and considering the high rooftop PV growth in Vietnam. Finally, the policy recommendations were proposed after analysing the electricity saved, mitigated emissions, and generating costs saved in these scenarios from the residential sector.<br/>The analysis of Indonesia’s residential demand sector revealed that efficient building envelope and appliance alone can cut the residential sector’s electricity use by 18% by 2030. In addition, it was observed that the energy consumption of appliances could stabilise by 2030 as a consequence of aggressive energy efficiency policy measures. Among the four appliances analysed, air conditioners provide the largest energy savings (about 60 percent) due to their higher energy use and greater household penetration in coming years as a result of urbanisation and higher living standards. Existing mandated efficiency standards for refrigerators are well below the average efficiency in the market, preventing energy savings and market transformation to- wards efficient appliances. Significant financial savings owing to the elimination of fossil fueled power generation due to demand-side interventions amount to two billion US dollars. While analysing the supply side of Indonesia’s residential sector, it was observed that in ambitious scenario for rooftop PV may reach 79 GW by 2030 which would lead to decarbonisation of the supply side of residential side by 50%. In the optimistic scenario, the rooftop PV penetration in households could reach 64% by 2030, considering 1 kWp per house and the total rooftop area required for rooftop PV could be around 250 million square metres. The savings on the supply side resulting from the elimination of fossil fuel generation are close to 6 billion dollars. Considering the demand and supply interventions, the net demand for energy from the grid in the residential sector of Indonesia could be 165 TWh, 130 TWh, and 57 TWh under the three different decarbonisation scenarios. These measures can cut the net electricity consumption<br/>from grid in the residential sector by 65%. These demand and supply solutions would enable Indonesia to achieve at least 20 percent of its NDC target by 2030, which is crucial given that the current emission contribution of residential buildings in Indonesia is close to 16%. The results clearly demonstrate the enormous potential for decarbonising the residential sector in Indonesia, both on the supply and demand sides.<br/>This analysis resulted in some policy recommendations, one of which is that Indonesia could revise energy performance thresholds for appliances every two years as energy savings could double as compared to a scenario following the current revision cycle. The current efficiency standard for refrigerator is non impactful and may be ratcheted up soon. Like in the case of Vietnam, the Feed-in Tariff (FiT) could potentially increase the deployment of rooftop PV, so it is suggested to implement FiT for rooftop PV in Indonesia. For further research, it is suggested that financial constraints and economic impact of energy efficiency solutions from consumers’ perspective could be explored, energy savings from other widely used appliances like fans, CFL lamps could be investigated and the impact of setting minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) for rooftop PV in Indonesia could be further analysed.","Energy Efficiency; Rooftop PV; Indonesia","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Nowadays linear isotach models belong to the state of the art but result in very small strain rates when small load increments or unloading is applied. For that reason this study has focused on the validation of those predictions using InSAR. Different causes of settlement have been studied and it was found that fluctuations in groundwater do not affect the final settlement. Another influencing factor is the presence of organic matter and its degradation. This reduction of organic matter is caused by many factors and is yet too complicated to quantify and include in predicting models. In spite of the idea that predicted strain rates by linear isotach models are too small, InSAR results show that the measured displacement rates were actually smaller than predicted some years after construction for road segments of the A2 and that a new proposed model could be used to match these displacement rates better. The C+S model by Vergote et al. (2021) is an isotach model which uses non-linear isotachs which would reduce the strain rates faster than linear isotach models and viscoplastic swell is included which also reduces the total strain rate. Results on incremental loading tests show that this model captures the behaviour in unloading stages better than the linear isotach models but for conventional incremental loading tests the two models do not differ much. For field scale embankment scenarios the results show that the C+S model with non-linear isotachs and viscoplastic swell included will predict a longer swell period with more swell, lower total strain rates after the swell period with a faster decay and in the and less residual settlement.","Isotachs; Soft Soil; Creep; Embankments; Incremental Loading Test","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Therefore penalties are applied to the DSOs if they overcome the benchmark set based on all the DSOs reliability performance. Hence, the fast restoration of the power supply is crucial for the grid operator in order for the operational costs to be decreased. The traditional way of fault locating is performed with the help of so-called Fault-current Passage Indicators. This can be improved by automatic estimation of the fault location using analysis of the current and voltage signals during the fault, which also depends on the accurate fault classification. However, the existence of distortions and instabilities in some of the fault waveforms leads to an unreliable fault loop-impedance/-reactance. As a result, the location of the fault has to be performed in the traditional way which leads to a delay in the restoration of the power supply.<br/><br/>The objective of this thesis is to explore the potential of modern signal processing and machine learning (ML) techniques for the development of an explainable classification scheme of faults in the distribution network. ML explainability is a huge part of the research held for this thesis, as it is very important for the fault analysis department to understand the model and for the grid operators to trust the results of the model. The problem is divided into two parts. The first part concerns the construction of an explainable ML-based classification model that can accurately differentiate between types of stable faults. The second part concerns the identification of suitable criteria for single-phase and multi-phase fault stability. Combined with a fault classifier based on the first part research, this will lead to a classification and location scheme that can incorporate all fault types.<br/><br/>First, a literature study is done. The pre-modeling explainability stage is the most suitable one and based on that, the Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) is chosen as the signal processing technique since it can lead to more explainable features than other techniques, e.g. the Wavelet Transform (WT). Also, the Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are selected as the supervised learning technique, as it performs well in classification problems and it is not a method as complicated as for example the Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Next, three different feature sets are shaped appropriately from the three-phase fault current and voltage signals, which are the inputs for the SVM classifier model, so then this model can be tuned and evaluated. The model with the symmetrical feature set is selected serving suitably both the performance and explainability requirements. Following that, a set of stability rules are developed to better identify the stable faults that previously were classified as unstable. These rules are tuned based on a set of initially labeled unstable faults. In the end, the ML classification and the stability model combined with section selection rules constitute the final classification scheme. This is tested on hidden data and the results indicate good performance in classifying faults, locating faults and identifying stable faults that initially would be classified as unstable. In particular, the performance of the proposed scheme on that test set has f1-score of 95.1% exceeding 93.3% of the current algorithm tested on the same data, errors regarding the fault loop-impedance/reactance are located within the acceptable limits and 4 stable faults correctly identified that previously were seen as unstable.","Machine learning; Classification; Distribution Network; Explainability; Stability; Fault Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

In literature many different models and predictions can be found to describe the possible futures of wind energy. But there is still a lot of uncertainty in this field as to what factors play which role in its development.<br/>This research contributes to this challenge by comparing the economic attractiveness of windmills expressed as Net Present Value(NPV) with annual added wind capacity in five countries for 2008 till 2019. The countries used for this research are Germany, Denmark, Canada, Texas and Sweden. This research found an exponential relationship between the NPV and added wind power capacity. A 10% increase in NPV(AC/MWh) found an increase of 15% for the annual added wind capacity(MW/TWh) of added windmill capacity per TWh of electricity produced. The vast amount of data sources used could have lead to a higher uncertainty regarding their uniformity and trustworthiness. Doing a sensitivity analysis yielded no improvements in the results. The simple economic model used was able to describe the growth in wind energy in countries, though there is still a significant spread in the results. A likely explanation for this spread is the lack of several important aspects such as permits, company influences, cultural differences and social-economic challenges which were all not taken into account. This research also makes several recommendations regarding possible policies countries could in order for them to reach their wind or clean energy goals.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(mentor); van de Kaa, G. (mentor); Wiarda, M.J. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In order to combat the global climate crisis, our energy provision needs to be decarbonized. One of the potential methods that can help is Green Hydrogen Energy Storage (GHES). GHES is a complex technology/energy carrier combination. It comprises of a conversion process of renewable electricity to hydrogen to then be used for conversion back to electricity at times of high electricity demand and low renewable supply e.g., in winter. Describing sociotechnical imaginaries on this technology/energy carrier combination can provide better alignment of the technology/energy carrier combination with the normative ideas of actors &amp; stakeholders. The research question is thus formulated as: “What are the different sociotechnical imaginaries of green hydrogen energy storage (GHES) in the Netherlands?” These sociotechnical imaginaries will be described by using Q method. The scientific relevance is twofold. First, insight into the conflicting and overlapping imaginaries on this topic. Second, methodological because Q method is relatively new for studying sociotechnical imaginaries. The master Management of Technology is organized around technology, innovation, organization, commercialization, engineering economics, research, and reflection. Research and reflection are by design embedded in this research thesis and technology and innovation are connected because the aim of the thesis is to describe the sociotechnical imaginaries of GHES in the Netherlands and to have that knowledge be utilized by the stakeholders to better align the technology to the sociotechnical imaginaries. And finally, organization relates to the industry stakeholders who will be aware of desired technology futures and can innovate towards those desired futures. The imaginaries have been named: [1] “We are hydrogen-optimistic and critically realistic”, [2] “Hydrogen: a driver for economic opportunity”, [3] “We’re not excited”, [4] “Welcome state intervention”, and [5] “Hydrogen storage is the way to go but be aware of big industry”. The first imaginary mainly describes how hydrogen should be a part of the energy mix, not the sole solution. The second imaginary emphasizes the economic opportunity that GHES can have with an emphasis on cooperation between parties. The third imaginary shows that there are respondents who feel concerned for climate change, but don’t see hydrogen as a solution at all. The fourth imaginary sees government intervention as the only way to facilitate this transition. The final imaginary shows that there is a concern for social implications on who will benefit from the transition towards GHES. Practical and theoretical implications are subsequently formulated to better align the technology/energy carrier combination to the normative ideas of stakeholders. According to the respondents, the case looks promising for GHES as there is agreement on GHES becoming a part of the Dutch energy mix. Methods of achieving this goal are e.g., a higher fossil fuel tax, development of technology standards, and the need for international cooperation. Furthermore, conflict items are defined, as is also the goal of Q method, the degree of the focus of economic development, the role of the government to guide and intervene, and the focus on the social implications of the transition towards GHES. These conflict items could be addressed according to an agonistic approach by utilizing social learning and reflexive governance. These practices defined in the literature that have gained eminence and are becoming more accepted. Pertaining to the theoretical implications, sociotechnical imaginaries as a concept fall short of describing the normative future visions as expressed by the respondents. Other scholars have also recognized that the concept might miss diversity in future visions because of its singular interpretation. However, it has been proven possible to, in a quantitative manner (using Q method), describe the sociotechnical imaginaries of around 3/4 of the respondents. The results of this study could be thus for further research be placed in a different social concept such as one of the concepts in the rich umbrella of foresight studies. An example being ‘normative scenarios’ which recognizes more diversity. Another implication is that it is also possible to use Q-method to peek in the ‘black box’ of wicked problems. The results show that conflicting visions about the future could be better understood in the context of contestation, uncertainty, and complexity (in other words; wicked problems). Additionally, according to the results, private sector stakeholders are divided on their views of GHES, meaning that shared value creation using open innovation is problematic. An alignment of normative future visions or even a possibility of open innovation without such an alignment is designated as a direction for future research.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

The use of robotic systems in this field has increased in the past decades. In this procedure, the surgeon requires excellent dexterity and precision. On the other hand, the patient requires safety and minimum incisions during the procedure. These have been the driving forces for the development of robotic systems for laparoscopic surgery. However, existing successful robotic systems have some common drawbacks: high cost, excessive complexity, heavy weight, and large size.<br/>In this work, we focus on the design methodology for developing a robotic arm for minimally invasive surgery that meets all the requirements of the procedure. The aim of this project is to progress towards a next generation surgical robotic arm that reduces the weight and size of the system. Based on a comprehensive study of laparoscopic surgery, the design goals and requirements were defined. <br/>The design is based on a novel division of the surgery into two sub-operations: a global passive positioning and a local active laparoscopic motion. This permits to reduce the overall size of the robotic arm and to develop specific functional mechanisms. The first mechanism allows the alignment of the incision point with the centre of rotation. It is light and intuitive to set up. The second mechanism is responsible for the active surgical movement and is inspired by the spherical linkage.<br/>A complete kinematic analysis and optimization is performed to optimize the geometrical parameters of the mechanisms. The optimization is defined as a multifunctional optimization problem with the aggregation of objective functions, that increase compactness, reduce size, and avoid singularities. In addition, a workspace validation is presented. Motors, sensors, materials, and cross-sectional areas of all parts are selected and tested so that all requirements are satisfied.<br/>Finally, a first prototype of the alignment mechanism is built and an experiment is conducted to prove the ease of setting up the robotic arm. The results demonstrate the ease of setting up the system and the simplicity of the steps for alignment. It also shows that the alignment mechanism is intuitive to use without extensive training.<br/>The proposed robotic arm is suitable for appendectomy, cholecystectomy, and inguinal hernia surgery and has several advantages: It is smaller and lighter than commercially available robotic arms, weighting less than 3 kg and measuring 318 mm x 241.4 mm x 35 mm and 385 mm x 178 mm x 101 mm, and it is portable, as specified in the European standards. This modular design with a division into an alignment mechanism and a surgical mechanism has reduced the <br/>size of the overall system and its complexity.","laparoscopic surgery; surgical robotics; spherical linkage; remote center of motion mechanism; Alignment mechanism","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | BioMechanical Design","",""

Existing natural gas infrastructure is considered as a means to transport hydrogen, due to practicality and financial aspects. However, hydrogen can deteriorate the fatigue behaviour and thus induce premature failure. Since fatigue is a common failure mode in pipelines, a more thorough understanding of the effects of hydrogen on fatigue behaviour is required. In this work, the hydrogen fatigue of X60 pipeline steel and its girth welds was investigated through a combined approach of modelling and in-situ fatigue testing. A novel in-situ gaseous hydrogen charging fatigue set-up was developed, which involves a sample geometry that mimics a small-scale pipeline with high internal hydrogen gas pressure. The specimen geometry involved an internal circumferential notch that induces a stress concentration factor (Kt = 3.0) related to the worst case scenario for pipelines. The effect of hydrogen was investigated by measuring the onset of crack initiation and growth using a newly designed direct current potential drop setup which probes the outer surface of the specimen. A FEA modelling approach was used to estimate the hydrogen equilibrium concentration in the specimens, as well as to determine the stress states in the material. Results showed that both materials experienced a reduction in fatigue life in the presence of hydrogen. For the base metal, the reduction in fatigue life (37%) manifested solely in the crack growth phase; hydrogen accelerated the crack growth (factor 4). In contrast, the reduction in fatigue life (68%) of the weld metal was due to accelerated crack growth (factor 8) and a decrease in resistance to crack initiation (57%). Varying the hydrogen gas pressure from 70 barg to 150 barg did not cause any differences in the fatigue behaviour. The presence of hydrogen influenced the fracture mechanisms of both materials. The fracture path of the base metal transitioned from transgranular and ductile in nature, to a mixed-mode transgranular and intergranular quasi-cleavage fracture. The weld metal exhibited a similar transition, however in the inert environment some intergranular features were observed at the prior austenite grain boundaries. The presence of hydrogen reduced the crack tortuosity. This is associated with a decrease in roughness- and plasticity-induced crack closure, thereby accelerating the crack growth. It is inferred that hydrogen-enhanced localised plasticity (HELP) and hydrogen-enhanced decohesion (HEDE) were the dominant types of hydrogen embrittlement mechanisms during fatigue of this pipeline material. It was concluded that the weld metal is more susceptible to hydrogen fatigue than the base metal in a gaseous hydrogen environment. The worst-case scenario for pipelines is in the case of weld defects. The weld defects involved in this work were macropores (0.5-1.0 mm) with a spheroid morphology. When these defects were located at the notch surface, the resistance to crack initiation decreased by 92% compared to non-porous specimens in nitrogen. The existing natural gas infrastructure could have accumulated similar flaws during service life, which would make them unreliable for safe hydrogen transport. The costs associated with the repurposing of these pipe segments could raise unexpected economic hurdles, hindering the transition to a hydrogen economy.","Hydrogen embrittlement; In-situ testing; Crack monitoring; Fatigue crack propagation; Pipeline steel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-09-13","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

It estimates that the sea levels may rise by 20 cm in the next thirty years or up to 80 cm by the end of 2100. The increase in sea levels poses serious questions and challenges to the housing infrastructure in flood-prone areas. Two locations that have been severely affected by the tidal and fluvial floods and typhoons are the provinces of Bulacan and Pampanga in the Philippines region. There is a ground level subsidence of up to 5cm per year because of the uncontrolled ground-water level conditions prevalent worsening the floods. The high levels of stagnant waters causes unsanitary conditions in these areas. In 2017, Pieter Ham, co-founder of Finch Floating Homes, developed a floating house model suitable for the Philippines’ climatic conditions. After the prototype construction was proven successful, they are now venturing into creating a floating neighborhood in Hagonany, located on the island of Luzon. This research topic aims to study the urban physics context of the floating homes neighborhood. Alazne Enchaniz Jurado, as part of her master thesis in 2021 at Delft University of Technology, designed resilient coastal neighborhoods for the city of Hagonoy, Philippines. After extensive research on the geographical, social, and cultural context, she designed floating neighborhood models suiting the needs and requirements of the people. However, the urban physics parameters of these concepts are to be further studied to determine the thermal and wind comfort of the occupants in the outdoor areas. This is because of the high-temperature tropical climate present in that region. Therefore, the primary focus of the present project, this MSc thesis, is to understand the role of urban physics in floating community development. It focuses on the influence of vegetation and urban form configurations on the outdoor thermal comfort and outdoor wind comfort of the open spaces, as they serve as the primary gathering locations for the residents. After analyzing the results, it concludes that increasing vegetation decreases the daytime temperatures, thereby improving the comfortability index. Additionally, the urban form also significantly plays a role in influencing the micro-climate of the region.","floating house Philippines; urban form; Waterbody; Micro-climate","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","","120.273142, 14.824364"

The goal of this thesis report is to conduct a comprehensive benchmark of the front-end voltage control solutions.<br/><br/>This thesis report focuses on the front-end voltage control solutions including the front-end buck converter and the phase shift control based on the primary inverter. Six different front-end voltage control scenarios are designed and compared in terms of system efficiency. There are four scenarios of the front-end buck converters including the single-phase buck converter working in Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM), the single-phase buck converter working in Triangular Current Mode (TCM), the two-phase interleaved buck converter working in CCM and the two-phase interleaved buck converter working in TCM. There are also two scenarios of primary inverter-based phase shift controls including phase shift with and without phase delay. The single-phase buck converter working in TCM has the highest efficiency reaching 95.5% at a light load. The phase shift control scenario with phase delay has the highest efficiency exceeding 96.5% at a heavy load.<br/><br/>Different from previous research on phase shift control, this thesis report conducts an in-depth harmonic analysis and compares the accuracy of harmonics analysis with the accuracy of fundamental wave analysis. The conclusion not only proves that fundamental wave analysis is reliable and accurate enough to calculate the phase shift parameters for the S-S compensation but also improves the calculation accuracy at a light load by harmonics calibration.","Wireless Power Transfer; TCM Buck Converter; Phase Shift Inverter; harmonic analysis; Two-phase interleaved buck converter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over the last few years, calls from both academic literature and practise have emerged stating that participation throughout these processes is of utmost importance.

As locals have been deemed key decision-makers, once’s that should be supported by policymakers. Inherently the qualities of participation should thus ensure a more optimal decision-making process towards a smooth roll-out of neighbourhood heat transitions. The problem identified however is that policymakers lack a comprehensive set of tools to engage in participation, better understand their stakeholders and thus better enable their decision-making within the local context of a neighbourhood transition.<br/><br/>To address this problem a novel iteration of the IAD framework is designed, enhanced through value theories and a nested structure. To research whether this toolkit is fit-for-purpose, the design is operationalized on a case study. Namely, the neighbourhood heat transition of the KNSM-eiland in Amsterdam. It was found that the designed framework provides a structured lens through which the complex and dynamic heat transition can be dissected, unfolding insights that lead way towards more optimal processes. The IAD framework, nested and value enhanced, has served this research as a toolkit to guide decision-making across a neighbourhood heat transition. The design allowed the researcher to work beyond pitfalls of traditional participation and alongside novel standards.

Suppressing the out-of-band blockers reduces this power consumption. N-path filters (NPFs) have recently been used to reject interferers in adjacent channels, by using a tunable center frequency. The state-of-the-art NPFs at mm-wave, however, only have a limited attenuation or use a large chip area. In this thesis, a fourth-order NPF is designed for 26-30 GHz. The implemented filter combines two frequency-shifted NPFs to create a flat in-band response and a steep roll-off, without the use of a large passive baseband filter. A rejection of 14 dB in the center of the first adjacent channel is obtained. This increases up to 24 dB at far-out-of-band frequencies. The noise figure of 10-12 dB is the lowest of the state-of-the-art, due to the added low-noise amplifier (LNA) in front of the filter. Despite this LNA, the designed filter achieves a comparable power consumption (40 mW) and smaller area (0.2-0.3 µm) than the state-of-the-art. The filter designed in this thesis is the first reported active N-path filter at mm-wave. The bandwidth is among the smallest reported, while the estimated area is lower than the state-of-the-art.","N-path filter; Receiver; 5G mm-Wave; Low-noise amplifier","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-09-12","","","","Electrical Engineering | Circuits and Systems","",""

(mentor); Ghiassi, Masoud (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Abstract—Multi-label classification is an important branch of classification problems as in many real world classification scenarios an object can belong to multiple classes simultaneously. Deep learning based classifiers perform well at image classifica- tion but their predictions have shown to be unstable when subject to small input distortions, called adversarial perturbations. There are multi-class classifiers, which assign images to a single class, and multi-label classifiers that attribute multiple labels to an image. In multi-class scenarios these adversarial attacks are conventionally constrained by a perturbation magnitude budget in order to enforce visual imperceptibility. In the related studies concerning multi-label attacks there has been no notion of a budget and this results in visible perturbations in the image. In this paper we develop attacks that cause the most severe disruptions in the binary label predictions, i.e. a maximum number of label flips, while adhering to a perturbation budget. To achieve this, we first analyse the applicability of the existing single label attack MI-FGSM on multi label problems. A naive way of using MI-FGSM in a multi-label scenario means using binary cross entropy loss and targeting all labels simultaneously. Our key observations are that targeting all labels simultaneously when restricted to a small budgets leads to inefficient budget use, that all labels have different attackability and also that labels exhibit different correlation structures which influences the combined attackability. Moreover, we show that the loss function determines the optimisation direction through prioritising labels with certain confidence values. We find that there are two dif- ferent strategies to optimise budget use and propose two distinct methods namely, Smart Loss-function for Attacks on Multi-label models (SLAM) and Classification Landscape Attentive Subset Selection (CLASS). SLAM comprises a loss function that uses an estimate for the potential amount of flips to adapt the shape of the curve, and hence the label prioritisation. CLASS uses binary cross entropy loss but focuses the budget on merely a subset of the labels, which was constructed while considering label attackability and pairwise label correlation. CLASS does have the drawback that it relies on classifier specific heuristics for determining the size of the label subset. We extensively evaluate SLAM and CLASS on three datasets, using two state of the art models, namely Query2Label and ASL. Our evaluation results show that CLASS and SLAM are able to increase the flips given the budget constraint by up to 131% and 61% respectively compared to naive MI-FGSM.","Deep Learning; Adversarial attacks; Multi-label classification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Distributed Systems","",""

Broken access controls take first place in the OWASP Top Ten Web Application Security Risks 2021. The need for this research comes from the observation that testing for broken access controls in web applications is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and error-prone. Therefore, security researchers require a modern methodology and toolset for exhaustively discovering access control vulnerabilities in web applications.<br/><br/>The posited hypothesis is that the contextual awareness required for access controls can be achieved by assuming that users are only authorized to perform actions accessible via the UI for that particular user. The methodology developed in this research consists of four phases: 1) A crawl phase where an application is crawled as multiple users. 2) A request selection phase, where potentially vulnerable requests are selected. 3) A request replay phase, where selected requests are replayed in the session context of another user. 4) A response comparison phase to identify whether an access control vulnerability has occurred. An implementation is provided and evaluated during web application penetration tests of DongIT. The results show that critical and structural access control issues can be identified when all four stages are completed. However, the intricacies of web applications often pose challenges for one or more of the four stages. From the results, it is concluded that the BACS methodology is a viable strategy and a valuable tool in the toolbelt of a security tester.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Cyber Security","",""

Infiltration drywells are vertical infiltration pipes that are installed above the groundwater table and through which stormwater is drained to the subsurface. Infiltration drywells can have a prominent place in urban water management since they mimic processes that occur under natural conditions. In urban areas the hydrological cycle is altered due to impermeable surfaces. Utilization of infiltration reduces the effects of the alteration on the hydrological cycle. Hereby, reducing the risk on urban flooding and surface water contamination. Furthermore, urban heat stress is reduced by enabling more drought resilient vegetation through groundwater replenishment. Especially considering that climate change will result in more extreme weather conditions, infiltration facilities can aid in creating more resilient urban areas. Until now, there are no design rules for these wells which hinders the implementation in urban areas that are fit for infiltration facilities. In this research a design method for sandy soils in the Netherlands is created and set forth.<br/><br/>The theoretical and practical performance of infiltration drywells is analysed by conducting experiments with Hydrus 3-dimensional geohydrological model simulations, as well as in the field and laboratory. In the field falling head tests were performed with existing infiltration drywells to determine the functioning while soil samples were analysed in the laboratory to determine the hydraulic conductivity. The model simulations also exist of falling head tests and are compared to the experiments in practice. It was found that the most important parameters on functioning of infiltration drywells are the soil hydraulic conductivity and well dimensions. When comparing the simulated falling head tests to field tests and laboratory tests at the same location, discrepancies were discovered. This can be clarified by simplifications that were made like homogeneity and isotropy of the soil in the model. Furthermore, the absence of wall resistance of the well in the model and the method that was used for the calculation of hydraulic conductivity using in practice falling head test data could be the cause. <br/><br/>To this end the generic design method is based on the Hydrus 3D model. This design method consists of empirical contour plots that give the necessary number of wells based on multiple input parameters, including a design storm of 21 mm in 10 min, which has a statistical return period of 25 years in the Netherlands. Due to discrepancies in the research, the design method is used to test the viability of a plan to implement infiltration drywells. Afterwards, a detailed design procedure is still necessary. Overall, the research resulted in a generic design method and shows the advantages of using infiltration drywells, which could be an essential part of urban water management in the Netherlands in the future.<br","infiltration; infiltration facilities; Infiltration modelling; infiltration drywell; Hydraulic Conductivity; HYDRUS-3D; Design method; Stormwater management; experimental measurements; parameter determination; Simulation study; Urban water management; Design storm; inverse auger hole method; Laboratory experiment; field experiments","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

This study investigated answers to this problem and assessed the feasibility thereof under strict requirements. <br/><br/>A literature study has specified Martian regolith as the optimal raw resource. The use of water was not feasible. Simulants MGS-1 and JEZ-1 were used as materials analogous to Martian regolith. Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) has been chosen as the optimal production method considering Martian regolith and the environment. An experimental study has verified the feasibility of the proposed material combined with the proposed method. Standard compressive tests, CT, SEM, SEM-EDS, DSC-TGA, Taguchi Design, MSEL and SPS, accompanied by standard measurements, yielded the following information: uniaxial compressive strength, density (distribution), macro porosity, microstructure, elemental composition, compaction, and energy requirement. Both simulant types were subject to three modifications: particle size, particle size reduction method and drying. Four SPS parameters have been analysed: temperature, duration, applied coating and applied pressure. <br/><br/>The minimum required compressive strength of 1.9 MPa was readily achieved. A maximum compressive strength of 137 MPa was found with an average of 48.50 MPa. Combined with the possible shape geometries of SPS, the manufactured material is expected to be structurally applicable. The measured theoretical energy requirement was 17.07 GJ/m<sup>3</sup>. The applied energy use was 2.72 TJ/m<sup>3</sup>. A reference dome requires a feasible theoretical 89.5 kW or infeasible applied 14.3 MW for one year. The latter value was elevated due to experimental factors. The actual energy requirement of a Martian mission is expected to be closer to the theoretical energy requirement due to efficiency improvements. Water vapour was produced during sintering. This is a vital benefit to a Martian colony. To conclude, ISRU bulk construction material manufacturing on Mars, for early colony development, is possible with regolith simulant and SPS.","SPS; Martian regolith; ISRU; Mars; Feasibility; Strength; Construction Materials; Taguchi","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

The Paraná River, the basin’s main river, discharges into the Río de la Plata estuary in Argentina. In the Lower Paraná Delta, near the deltaic front, a complex system of mostly natural and some man-made channels redistribute a part of the river flow. Like the river and the estuary, the channel network has been subject to sediment deposition, limiting the navigability needed for the small-scale transport of goods, leading to hindrance to tourism and other economic activities in the Lower Delta. Compared to the river system on the large scale, not much is known about the characteristics and the morphodynamic behaviour of the channel network. The objective of this research is to set a first step in providing insight on the relevant processes and human activities that influence morphology changes in the Lower Delta channel network. <br/><br/>Making use of existing data, a literature study and data obtained during several field surveys, various hypotheses were formulated. Hypotheses included the potential influence of land use change in the catchment and climate change related trends in precipitation patterns, climatic variability associated with El Niño Southern Oscillation, the effect of artificially deepening one of the two main branches of the Paraná River and the excavation of artificial channels in the Lower Delta in the early twentieth century. The effects of said processes and human activities are tested with a scenario-based hydrodynamic modelling study, making use of Delft3D Flexible Mesh with sediment transport and morphology modules.<br/><br/>Our analysis provided various insights in the behaviour of the Lower Delta channel network, and the influence of human activities and natural processes on this behaviour. A notable finding is that artificial deepening of the Paraná de Las Palmas by dredging its thalweg since 1990 has lead to a significant reduction in river flow entering channels supplied by the river branch and increased sedimentation rates in these channels. In addition, insight was gained on the spatial distribution of depositional and erosive patterns instigated by discharge and sediment input changes. <br/><br/>This research has provided a first, global insight into the relevant processes governing channel morphodynamics. Some of the findings can serve as input for future dredging strategies, as results imply that the current strategy has lead to limitations to the navigability of an intensively navigated part of the channel network. Furthermore, the outcome of this research can serve as a starting point for research on one of the specific topics covered by the hypotheses, including but not limited to the influence of storm surges, the effect of a potential spatial heterogeneity in soil composition and the influence of tidal divides on morphological features in the channel network.<br","Paraná Delta; Morphodynamic model; Delft 3D flexible mesh","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","-34.293839, -58.567982"

It is expected that many grids will soon reach their limits. One solution to mitigate these issues is exploiting ﬂexibility in e.g. electric vehicles. In this work, a shrinking horizon model predictive controller is constructed to optimally charge and discharge EVs with respect to the day ahead electricity price or grid carbon intensity. The model takes into account that users with a dual rate electricity plan only want to charge during their oﬀ-peak hours. A feature to implement a household PV setup in the optimization is included. The possible consequences in terms of associated carbon emissions, utility costs and user costs are analysed using a simulation based on data from 4279 charging sessions that took place between June 23, 2021 and June 23, 2022. The sessions are split in 2855 weekday sessions (duration between 4 and 24 hours) and 1424 weekend sessions (duration between 4 and 60 hours). It is found that using current circumstances, minimizing the carbon emissions using bidirectional charging results in a higher price (5.5 %) for the utility than using the current state of the art, unidirectional charging minimizing the wholesale electricity cost. Bidirectional charging minimizing the wholesale electricity cost results in higher emissions compared to unidirectional charging (2.8 %), and even compared to uncontrolled charging (0.9 – 3.6 %). The reason for this seems to be a negative correlation between carbon intensity and wholesale price during the times that vehicles are typically connected although this needs further investigation to be conﬁrmed.","EV; Smart Charging; V2G; Bidirectional; Smart grid","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-09-09","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

The call for good charging infrastructure is urgent with the rapid shift from carbon-based cars toward battery electric vehicles. However, the present electrical distribution networks are not designed for large additional loads. Many cities have traction networks such as trams, metros, or trolleybuses for public transport purposes. This thesis explores the potential for charging electric vehicles directly from these traction networks. A case study uses public charging behavior to simulate EV charging on the trolleygrid network of Arnhem. Moreover, six smart grid methods are evaluated to increase a traction network's electric vehicle charging potential. Various trolleygrid parameters such as the trolleybus intensity, section length, and the charger's location on the trolleygrid play a role in the charging potential. An individual area can fully charge up to 111 electric vehicles daily. This study shows that increasing the substation capacity and introducing smart charging are the two smart grid methods that increase the potential up to 201 EVs/day. Adding an extra overhead line has a minor effect on the charging potential (+12 EVs/day). Increasing the substation nominal voltage has the same impact as the last mentioned method but is cheaper to implement. At the connection point of two isolated sections, the best smart grid methods are introducing a bilateral connection and using a multi-port converter. Charging battery electric vehicles from traction networks could be a suitable alternative to increase the charging possibilities in cities.","Electric Vehicles Charging; Trolleybus; Trolleygrid; Traction network; DC grid; Smart Grid; PV system; Arnhem","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-09-08","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","Trolley2.0","51.9851034, 5.8987296"

Its success can be linked back to its mouldability, durability and low cost. Unfortunately, current conventional concrete pedestrian bridge designs do not benefit from these key features and still require bulky shaped cross-sections, whereby part of the concrete does not contribute to the structural strength. This study assesses the potential reduction of material use by combining shot-crete 3D printing (SC3DP) with the application of textile formworks for the production of form found pedestrian bridges, instead of the conventional design and fabrication process.<br/>The present thesis looks at conventional concrete pedestrian bridge design and form found concrete for it examined for four different spans: 5 m, 10 m, 20 m and 45 m. The designs are tested for full vertical loading, asymmetric vertical loading, and buckling. The amount of material required for each span and load case are determined and compared with each other. The results show that the form found concrete pedestrian bridge designs only re-quire a fraction (between 13.0% and 20.0%) of the amount of concrete used for the same design with conventional approaches. The form found concrete pedestrian bridge designs become more material efficient than the conventional designs as the span increases. Dur-ing the calculation process it was ascertained that the conventional concrete pedestrian bridge design cannot reach spans larger than 20 m. It was also observed that the concrete thickness of the shorter span form found concrete pedestrian bridges (5 m and 10 m) is governed by the asymmetric load case and the concrete thickness of the longer span form found concrete pedestrian bridges (20 m and 45 m) is governed by the buckling case. Over-all it can be concluded that the form found concrete pedestrian bridge design is superior with regards to the material use, when compared to the conventional concrete pedestrian bridge design.<br","Form-finding; KnitCrete; Additive manufacturing; Shotcrete 3D printing; Bridge design; Optimization; Material-use","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","Additional thesis",""

(mentor); Ullerup, Helle (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","While lives are saved through the use of medical devices; they have a significant negative impact on the environment. In particular single-use medical devices make up a large part of the healthcare sector’s negative environmental impact as they contribute significantly to generating more medical waste and greenhouse gas emissions. Approximately 90% of medical waste consists of single-use products or components. The incineration of medical waste is still common practice, leading to harmful environmental and human health effects. Additionally, devices that could potentially be recycled, reused, or repurposed in another way to help close the loop of a product’s life cycle are incinerated instead, which sustains and fuels the unsustainable linear economic model. This research aims to identify opportunities at the end-of-life of single-use catheters that could sustain value and limit the amounts of medical waste produced. A method is presented that supports approaching this aim, called the recovery assessment tool for single-use catheters. The presented method allows for identifying components of a catheter that limit or provide opportunities for recovery purposes at the end-of-life. Two protocols have been developed to guide this process. The first protocol covers the dismantling process to explore the build-up of a catheter and separate components to establish a Bill of Materials. The second protocol describes the procedure that was followed to analyse a catheter. The Bill of Materials is used as an input to assess a catheter at the sub-assembly and component level. The assessment evaluates a catheter on three types of indices: disassembly indices, hygienic recovery indices and material recovery indices. The outcome of the assessment is a graphical visualization that highlights areas of attention for recovery. By interpreting these results using the explanations given with each index, components can be identified that limit or provide opportunities for recovery purposes at the end-of-life of single-use catheters. Two single-use catheters of Philips were assessed as a case study with the proposed methodology. A Bill of Materials for each catheter was established with the results of a material investigation in the lab. The results of the case studies led to several limitations and opportunities. The first limitation is that cleaning catheters can be challenging, given their long tubular shape and the fact that almost all components and sub-assemblies cannot be disassembled and reassembled again. This limitation may impede recovery options since catheters must be cleaned and sterilised after use if considered for recovery purposes because they come into contact with blood. Additionally, catheters are lightweight devices, meaning they make up only a small amount of the piles of medical waste produced daily. Still, catheters are high-value devices; therefore, any form of recovery is valuable. Opportunities for recovery at the end-of-life of catheters have also been identified. It was determined that catheters contain valuable metals that could be recovered to reduce medical waste, sustain value and potentially decrease the demand to collect raw materials. Also, most of the materials used in the case studied catheters seem compatible with ethylene oxide sterilisation which provides an opportunity for recovery; however, this must be thoroughly validated. Finally, it is suggested to reconsider the design or build-up of a catheter. Investigating opportunities for a hybrid design and exploring the possibility of recovery of functional modules for new catheters at the end-of-life are suggested. The outcomes of this research indicate that closing the loop on single-use catheters is a complex problem in terms of circularity due to their hygienic criticality and light weight compared to the waste produced daily per hospital bed. The amount of medical waste produced due to the use of catheters is only the tip of the iceberg.","Single-use medical device; Circular economy (CE); Catheter; Medical waste; Sustainability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Universiteit Leiden (degree granting institution)","2022","Reducing meat consumption is considered a crucial and urgent element in terms of reaching climate targets, public health and the protection of animal welfare. Especially in industrialised countries, it is considered the most important recommendation in the field of sustainable food consumption. The transition is difficult to realise, as meat consumption is a complex area involving numerous institutions and stakeholders with conflicting interests and consumers with very different opinions and behaviour. Meat consumption is the result of diverse individual factors, while being rooted in culture and social norms. It is thus considered challenging for policymakers to set this transition in motion, as intervening in the system comes with uncertainties, a lack of understanding, and possibly resistance on both the stakeholder and consumer side. Simulation models can be supportive in such a case, as they can support an increased understanding of the system, while being able to deal with the transition and all its complexity. Specifically agent-based models can be a suitable tool to support policymakers in making sense of this transition, as this type of modelling can deal with heterogeneity of consumers and is able to provide insight on how various policy interventions affect the individual and overall system behaviour. <br/><br/>The process of developing a simulation model for policy support using a technique that is not widely understood and accepted yet, can be challenging. Participatory modelling is a method in which stakeholders are involved throughout the modelling process to promote social learning and achieve model improvement. In this thesis, a participatory modelling process was designed to identify the potential use of agent-based modelling in reducing meat consumption in the Netherlands. The study focused on including elements of behaviour in the ex-ante evaluation of policy with the use of an agent-based model. <br/><br/>An agent-based model representing meat consumption behaviour of Dutch young adults was evaluated and improved together with a group of participants. Knowledge elicitation with the stakeholders working in the field of policymaking, research, and academia occurred through interviews, workshops, and mind mapping. The key findings of these sessions were that the participants desire to gain understanding on the socio-cultural factors influencing meat consumption and how these can be targeted with interventions. To respond to this lack of knowledge, the agent-based model was adjusted to capture meat consumption behaviour according to the COM-B wheel. This is a theoretical framework in which behaviour is categorised into physical and psychological capability, reflective and automatic motivation, and physical and social opportunity. In the agent-based model, consumers select and consume meals from a supermarket, take-away, or restaurant. Dietary preferences are based on knowledge and skills, environmental and animal welfare concerns, income, desired meat consumption, and social norms. The consumers are able to adapt their dietary preferences through reflection processes. The individual profiles were empirically grounded with input data from a cross-sectional questionnaire. <br/><br/>The agent-based model was used to study the effectiveness of various policy pathways that were formulated in consultation with involved participants. The policy pathways included in this study were various meat price increases, an increase of the vegetarian representation in the food environment, a social marketing campaign targeted at social norms, and combinations of the three. Of these interventions, meat price increases showed to be most effective in reducing the overall meat consumption. Increasing the vegetarian representation in the choice was effective, but to a lesser extent. The social marketing campaign on social norms showed no direct effect on the amount of meat consumed. When interventions were combined, even higher reductions were observed. <br/><br/>This study sheds a light on how the field of policy and science can together work on a gained understanding of this complex transition, with the use of agent-based modelling. <br","Agent-Based Modeling & Simulation; Participatory Modelling; Meat consumption; Policy analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

(mentor); Naaijen, P. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Operational optimization of vessels is valuable for the planning and execution of maritime operations. Accurate and efficient models to predict vessel motions are needed to make reliable operational decisions. The wave-induced vessel response can be modelled in terms of a Response Amplitude Operator (RAO) and a wave spectrum. Uncertainties related to the parameters that govern the RAO can significantly influence the reliability of the vessel motion prediction. To decrease these uncertainties, the maritime sector has realized the potential of using vessel motion measurements. As a result, it is envisioned that a vessel response model might include an identification module that searches for model parameters using measurements of responses to make a reliable prediction.<br/><br/>This study presents an identification procedure to handle the inherent uncertainties of vessel model parameters, aiming to improve vessel motion prediction. The identification procedure identifies the vessel's RAO by the measured response spectrum and nowcast wave spectrum, with the goal of finding the heave and roll natural frequencies. The natural frequencies provide information on the vessel’s parameters. This is used to identify the parameters related to the mass distribution and damping of the vessel. These were found by minimizing a cost function, that quantified the difference between the measured and predicted response spectrum, using an optimization method. Identifiability analyses of the parameters were performed on two case studies. <br/><br/>For the first case study, a synthetic data set is created with the vessel response model to simulate the vessel motions. Tests were conducted with five different wave spectra and several vessel headings, constituting diversified scenarios. The RAO was identified by the measured response, the wave spectrum, and a sinusoidal function to describe the directional dependency of the RAO. Using the synthetic data set, the identification algorithm successfully identified the parameters with good agreement to their actual values. The second case study involved the examination of parameter identification on real onboard vessel motion measurements. In most of the cases, the RAO could be identified from the measurements and the natural heave and roll frequency was found. The identified parameters resulted from the identification procedure and improved the vessel motion prediction compared to the initial prediction, but still, deviations remained. The identified parameters are verified against a different measured data set. The results show that the identified response spectra approach the measured responses, indicating that the identified parameters are reusable. <br/><br/>In summary, it was found that the parameters have a great influence on the output of the vessel response model. Therefore, it is essential to have a thorough understanding of the correct operational parameters for accurate motion prediction. The established identification procedure shows to be a good addition to existing vessel motion models to identify input parameters at relatively low computational cost.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-09-02","","","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Yet, since competitors can now achieve similar results, they have expanded their strategy to offering excellent customer experience too, resulting in the foundation of the Customer Experience (CX) department. Nevertheless, Flyco notices their NPS is not rising above 50. One of the reasons is the silo-driven lay-out a typical corporate as Flyco has, where teams lack knowledge sharing. A way to bridge these silos is by using cross-functional collaboration, where multiple distinct functions come together to tackle complex problems with a multidisciplinary perspective. <br/><br/>This results in the research question: “How can Flyco improve the consistent implementation of customer needs throughout the customer journey through more effective collaboration between the different teams of the CX department?” During the research, multiple perspectives are taken into consideration. At first, the connection between collaboration and customer needs is defined to learn why the stated claim is currently a problem. Thereafter, the current way of collaboration between the different teams is reflected on by means of seven in-depth interviews with employees. Simultaneously, a literature review gives insights into what way effective cross-functional collaboration should be framed and which elements are essential. However, since multiple elements have a considerable effect on cross-functional collaboration, a decision needs to be made for a focal point to realise effective change at one, or a few of these elements. A quantitative analysis, filled in by the CX department, gives insight into where the department believes they could improve. The focus is put where most progress can be made for the CX department. This results in a focus on effective knowledge sharing between the different teams through more effective and open communication to lead the focus within the department towards the group.<br/><br/>Plenty literature has been written in knowledge management including multiple tools and methods. Nevertheless, earlier attempts in implementing a new knowledge management method have failed due to unacceptance of implementation by the employees. Therefore the behaviour of the employees needs to change. Consequently, literature in behaviour change is reviewed, resulting in four behaviour change techniques most appropriate for this problem. Five concepts are established through combining cocreation insights on the behaviour change techniques with knowledge management tools and methods. These concepts in unison form a system for a profound knowledge management, which ideally are all developed and applied. However, for the purpose of this thesis, the concept ‘Community of Practice (CoP)’ is chosen for further development.<br/><br/>The concept focuses on knowledge sharing through a group, sharing a domain/passion, a practice, and a community, coming together to discuss a question or statement stated by one of the teams of the CX department. People can apply when they are interested to learn more or have gained expertise in this area. The group of employees form a community group where they run through five steps to get an agreement on the topic. The results will be shared with the department for knowledge sharing.","Customer Experience; knowledge sharing; Collaboration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); van Bommel, Jasper (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The intensive care unit (ICU) is a dehumanizing technical environment causing complications that are all captured in the term post-intensive-care syndrome (PICS). The patient’s well-being could be improved by moving away from this hostile environment toward more patient-centred care. Therefore this report explores how to improve the daily ICU experience from a critically ill patient’s perspective.<br/><br/>Environmental influences in the ICU, like noise exposure, are important contributors to PICS (Abuatiq, 2015). Hearing is the most prominent sense of ICU patients. Thus, the Erasmus ICU is designed to keep sound out. It has been shown that there is no clear relationship between reduced volume levels and physiological improvement (Drahota et al., 2012), and the absence of sound does not necessarily create a positive environment (Truax, 1984). Therefore, this project aims to consider sound in a positive manner since sound is only perceived as noise when it does not fit the patient’s state of being.<br/><br/>After many former patients were interviewed and an Erasmus MC ICU nurse was observed, it turned out that it is hard for patients not to focus on their feelings of frustration, loneliness, discomfort, shame, panic, confusion etcetera and still keep a positive mindset. Thus, the design aimed to redirect the patient’s focus by connecting the patient to the environment. <br/><br/>The Thirteen Fundamental Needs for Human-Centered Design typology was utilized as a source to design a positive experience for the ICU environment. Six fundamental needs (Stimulation, Recognition, Relatedness, Autonomy, Security, and Comfort) were uncovered. Strengthening these needs could improve the patients’ experience. <br/><br/>Mapping a patient’s daily routine showed that need fulfilment changes according to the eventfulness, the presence, or absence of people or sound inside the ICU. A patient’s journey revealed that the absence of people right after leaving causes the most harm to the patient. Thus, the decision was made to focus on this transition moment. <br/><br/>Eventfulness can be determined by measuring sound pressure levels (SPL) in dB in the ICU. So the transition moment from an eventful (high SPL) to an uneventful (low SPL) environment can be detected and vice versa. <br/><br/>New visual/auditory stimuli were developed. These can be introduced to benefit patients’ recovery (Arbabi et al., 2018). The stimuli consist of sounds of nature in combination with a nature-based projection. The audio and the visual stimuli change according to the SPL in the room. This design intervention helps guide the patient into the new environment. It is a subtle way to notify the patient that something is happening. Furthermore, it can distract the patient (when bored or during treatment) and decrease the difference between higher and lower sound pressure levels.<br/><br/>The design was developed, embodied, and finally tested in a simulated ICU environment. The evaluation of the design intervention showed that all participants appreciated the design intervention, mainly because they were distracted from boredom, stress/anxiety, negative thoughts (loneliness) or discomfort. It made the experience more comfortable or relaxed. <br/><br/>Finally, three use cases were presented, redirecting the focus from anxiety, boredom, and loneliness. Additionally, recommendations were made.<br","Intensive Care Unit; Sound; Need fulfilment; Daily routine; Visual and auditory stimuli; ICU patient; Patient Experience; Perception","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Integrated Product Design | Medisign","",""

To solve these problems, a new videolaryngoscope, the Goodscope, has been developed which is less expensive, reusable and easy to clean. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the Goodscope compared with a commonly used videolaryngoscope, the GlideScope, when used by experienced anaesthetists and residents in anaesthesia in both a normal and difficult airway scenario. Methods: Participants randomly intubated the manikin four times using both the Goodscope and the GlideScope twice in a normal and a difficult airway scenario. The primary endpoint was time to successful intubation. Secondary endpoints were time to glottic view, time to ventilation, number of intubation attempts, successful intubation rate, and ease of intubation. Results: A total of 73 participants were included in this study. The primary endpoint, time to successful intubation, showed no statistically significant difference between the Goodscope and GlideScope in both the normal (median Goodscope 10.3 s, inter-quartile range (IQR) 8.5, 12.2 vs GlideScope 10.1 s, IQR 8.4, 13.6, P = 0.614), and difficult scenario (median Goodscope 18.5 s, IQR 14.3, 25.3 vs GlideScope 18.4 s, IQR 13.7, 24.2, P = 0.238). Similarly, no significant differences between the two videolaryngoscopes were identified for all secondary endpoints in both scenarios. Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that the Goodscope is non-inferior to the GlideScope since no significant differences between the Goodscope and the GlideScope were identified for all primary and secondary endpoints. Therefore, this study contributes to proving the concept of an affordable reusable videolaryngoscope without compromising on quality.","laryngoscopes; intubation; randomized controlled trial; intratracheal; manikin","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-09-08","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Dodou, D.

However, with an increasing level of automation in vehicles also comes an increase in interaction with in-vehicle technology by drivers while they are meant to supervise the automated driving systems. Due to more interaction with in-vehicle technology and a vigilance decrement of the driver in Level 2 driving, an increase in reaction time of the driver is seen when intervention is needed by the means of a take over request. This delay in reaction by the driver opposes the benefit of the introduction of automated driving systems and causes hazardous situations. To try and circumvent the effect of vigilance decrement, this paper attempts to demonstrate the reduction of noticing time of the Hands-On-Wheel warning message for drivers of Level 2 vehicles while interacting with in-vehicle technology through the implementation of a gaze-contingent interface. The results of this experiment indicate a 79.3% lower noticing time of the Hands-On-Wheel warning message when the stimulus is placed in a gazecontingent manner, while the participants engage in secondary tasks on the in-vehicle technology. The placement of the stimulus on the head unit when the participant is already looking at it reduces the primary task load of touching the steering wheel and causes for the stimulus to be seen quicker as compared to a static interface. However, the performance of the secondary task seems to decrease when using a gaze-contingent interface. This is due to the intrusive nature of the placement of the stimulus, which demands the driver to store information regarding the secondary task in their working memory while they attend to the primary task. Despite the decline in secondary task performance, the reduction of noticing times of time critical messages when placed in a gaze-contingent manner could be beneficial to the safety of autonomous driving functions where the driver has a vigilance task and is engaging in secondary tasks.","Gaze-contingent; Eye tracking; Interface; Autonomous driving","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Vehicle Engineering | Human Factors","",""

Part of the identified challenges is the develop- ment of a model for the actuator effectiveness and lift especially as a function of skew, the newly added degree of freedom. In particular it is assumed that the actuator effectiveness changes linearly with actuator state and that aerodynamic forces change quadratically with airspeed and depend mainly on the chordwise component of airspeed. Moreover, the position of the moving actuators is expressed as a function of the corresponding moment arm and the skew angle. The models and assumptions are verified through static and dynamic wind tunnel tests at the OJF of TuDelft. A WLS routine is used to solve the control allocation for the overactuated guidance loop. A lower cost is assigned to the use of the push motor so to steer the control allocation in its favor rather than commanding changes in attitude. A gradual switch of the hover motors in transition is achieved by scheduling the lift-pitch effectiveness with airspeed. Therefore, as airspeed increases the outerloop INDI controller evaluates that changing pitch to achieve a certain vertical acceleration set point results in an increasingly cheaper command allocation than changing thrust. An automatic skew controller is designed based on the developed control moment and lift models. The skew angle is scheduled with airspeed so to perform transition while also maximizing control authority. Finally, the controller is validated by performing multiple transitions inside the OJF windtunnel.","incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion, weighted least squares, variable skew quad plane, control moment modelling, lift modelling, transition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Five metrics are proposed related for the individual flight complexity, and their predictive ability is tested with a human-in-the-loop experiment, where air traffic controllers were tasked with assessing the complexity of an individual flight in a series of static scenarios and indicate which other flights in the scenario affected the complexity score. <br/>Results show that the complexity is depends mostly on flights that near each other within 10 NM in the horizontal plane and have overlapping flight levels. Furthermore, flights requiring a flight level change are considered more complex as the number of possible interactions increases due to the vertical change and the additional dimension increases the uncertainty of the trajectory. The performance of the metrics indicated a dependency on different traffic patterns, leading to the conclusion that the use of only one metric is too limited to describe the complexity, and future research is needed to better understand the interdependence between the metrics.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-10-01","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Rooftop solar photovoltaics (RTSPV) are a potential generation method that can be used in support of this, with Bali chosen as a case study. No estimates of the total technical and economic potential of RTSPV on Bali exist in academic literature. Low spatial resolution statistical methodologies exist to estimate the technical potential of RTSPV, but these are not accurate on the sub-national scale of Bali. Methodologies with a medium spatial resolution are most suitable for an area of the scale of Bali, however existing methodologies cannot be used due to incomplete cadastral data. In this thesis a novel methodology is introduced that allows the use of incomplete cadastral data, in combination with land use data, to estimate the total rooftop area in a region at a medium spatial resolution. The total rooftop area is then used to estimate the total technical potential and the total economic potential. Using this method, the rooftop area of Bali is estimated to be 130 km2, and the technical potential 22.9 TWh/year. The economic potential for RTSPV is estimated to be zero, as RTSPV cannot compete with conventional generation methods at current capital costs (CAPEX) of RTSPV components of 1200 USD/kWp. It is estimated that at a CAPEX of less than 870 USD/kWp sufficient electricity can be generated annually to fulfill the estimated annual demand of Bali of 5.7 TWh. 96% of the entire technical potential can be achieved at or below the cost per kWh of conventional generation methods if the price of RTSPV installations decreases to below 650 USD/kWp. If the compensation paid by the Indonesian state electricity company PLN for RTSPV electricity that is supplied<br/>to the grid is increased from 65% to 100% of the consumer electricity price, residential RTSPV installations can become economically viable at the current CAPEX of 1200 USD/kWp. This thesis will enrich existing literature on RTSPV potentials by introducing a novel methodology that can be applied in other regions with incomplete cadastral data. In addition, it provides a blueprint to estimate RTSPV potentials for other parts of Indonesia, and it supports policy makers by giving insight in factors that influence the economic potential of RTSPV on Bali and in Indonesia as a whole.<br","Rooftop PV; Economic Potential; Technical Potential; Rooftop Area","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","On the east coast of Romania, at Eforie, coastal erosion manifests. To strengthen the coastal area a large coastal protection project was setup involving beach nourishment combined with the construction of breakwaters. The breakwaters are designed with the well-known modified Van der Meer formulas. To ensure confidence in the breakwaters stability the designs were tested during a 3D physical model test. The designs were stable, however the measured damage to the breakwater was larger than was expected. Investigating the physical model test resulted in three important aspects, that need to be investigated. First, a broad list of configurations, that could responsible for the damage, could be identified. Secondly, excessive wave breaking on the foreshore during the model test resulted in a shift in wave energy from higher to lower frequency waves. These low frequency waves, or so-called infragravity waves became increasingly dominant near the coast. Their effect on the stability of the structure is however unknown. Thirdly, the incoming waves were very oblique and on a shallow foreshore, resulting in a different failure mechanism than is incorporated in the modified Van der Meer formulas. A new stability method has to be formulated to investigate breakwater stability for this physical model test. Due to the broad list of configurations and the possible influence of infragravity waves, real scale or physical model tests are not feasible and a numerical model needs to be used. A reliable and widely applicable method to link breakwater stability to a numerical model has however not yet been composed. Therefore, the goal of this thesis is to propose a method that can link breakwater stability to a numerical model and to assess whether the identified configurations resulted in the damage along the statically stable rubble mound breakwater, measured during the Eforie physical model test.<br/><br/>First, an investigation is performed on the physical model test set-up and observations, resulting in a final list of 5 configurations, that are investigated in this research: The applied offshore transitional slope (1), the assumption of uni-directional waves (2), the slope of the lower foreshore (3), the depth-contour lines inducing wave focusing (4) and the very oblique wave angle on a shallow foreshore (5). Secondly, a method is proposed linking breakwater stability to a velocity signal from the numerical model SWASH. An equation is formulated, based on the theory of Izbash (1935), with a slope factor included, and scaled with the theory of Shields (1936). It requires a velocity signal, that can be obtained from SWASH, to calculate a stone size required for stability.<br/><br/>Thirdly, a numerical model is set up in SWASH, with grid dimensions 3m x 2m, resembling the physical model test. The breakwater is modelled as an impermeable core with a permeable porosity layer placed on top. The thickness of the porosity layer is based on the thickness of the outer armour layer of the original breakwater. The numerical model is validated by comparing the wave characteristics, at several locations along the breakwater, to wave data available from the physical model test. The numerical model shows accurate resemblance of the wave characteristics. Since the wave velocity is linked to the wave height, it is assumed that the wave velocity on the breakwater is also correctly modelled. The model is therefore found valid for the modelling study. In the numerical model along the still waterline measurement points are indicated that provide the velocity and waterlevel signal during a simulation. In the numerical model two layers in the vertical are assumed and tested to be sufficient. The velocity of the top layer resembles the velocity that flows just over the stones. Therefore from the velocity signal of the top layer the governing u_0.2% along the waterline at the breakwater is obtained and from the waterlevel signal the wave spectrum is derived. In the study simulations are performed in which the configurations are tested one by one, and all simulations are assessed on two parameters: the u_0.2% and the wave spectral transformation along the breakwater. The results from the different simulations are compared relatively to identify the relative effect the configurations have on the velocity and wave characteristics.<br/><br/>The results of this research show that breakwater stability can be predicted reasonably well from a velocity signal obtained from SWASH. The velocity signal, obtained from SWASH, results in reliable stone sizes. The configurations could be investigated with the proposed method and the results provide reliable and useful insights. In addition, the proposed method is able to identify the effect of infragravity wave energy on the stability of a breakwater. The method is also tested by calculating the relative obliqueness factors for different incoming wave angles, which shows promising results. It is important to reproduce the breakwater porosity well in the numerical model as it can significantly influence the velocity signal. A decrease/increase of the porosity thickness with 30% or 0.6m can result in an increase/reduction of 20-26% in velocity respectively.<br/><br/>The five discussed configurations provide partial explanations to (in)directly induce the higher breakwater damage in the physical model test. Both the applied offshore transitional slope (1) as the assumption of uni-directional waves (2) result in a slight underestimation of the breakwater stability and therefore a somewhat conservative design along the entire length of the breakwater. The combined effect resulted in a reduction of 0-6% around the head of the breakwater, h/Hs = 2.5-4.8, and a reduction of 16-24% near the shore, h/Hs = 1.1-1.8. Especially near the shore the breakwater is conservatively designed, due to the fact that both the transitional slope as the assumption of unidirectional waves increases the infragravity wave energy in the system. It is found that incoming waves break around h/Hs = 1.7 after which the infragravity waves induce a temporary increase in waterlevel, around h/Hs = 1.1-1.8. This allows the depth-limited short waves to become bigger resulting in higher velocities and more damage on the breakwater. This affects the breakwater stability closer to shore and needs to be taken into account when designing a breakwater in these conditions. The lower foreshore (3) induces the generation of infragravity waves, which affect the velocity closer to shore as described above. The depth-contour lines (4) result in a wave focusing effect increasing the velocity around h/Hs = 1.1-1.8 with 8-11%. Based on the results of this thesis the very oblique wave angle on a shallow foreshore (5) does not induce higher velocities and breakwater instability. It is however assumed that the effect of a breaking plunging wave, inducing acceleration and pressure difference effects on the stones on a slope, is not sufficiently into account, due to the grid dimensions used in the model. As other plausible causes of the increased damage are disproven, it seems likely that the different oblique wave breaking process that is not modelled in detail leads to the increased damage.","SWASH; Breakwater; Stone stability; Numerical model; Izbash; Damage; Infragravity waves; wave attack; Wave directional spread; Foreshore slope; angle of attack; Physical model tests","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-07","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","","44.050547, 28.643997"

For biomedical implantable applications such as neural sensing and Brain-computer Interfaces (BCIs), due to the increasing number of sensing channels and elements, not only the precision of the biomedical analysis is increased, but also a wireless system with higher data rate is required. Besides the high data throughput, as an implanted device, settling within a human or animal body requires high reliability and low power consumption. Such a wireless system finds its position in smart wearable devices as well. With a higher data rate and small form factor, more functionalities can be adapted to those smart wearable devices.

As wind farm areas are increasing, offshore seaweed aquaculture in multi-use platforms at sea (MUPS) has been proposed as one of the possibilities for smart use of ocean space. Apart from providing a multitude of benefits through the many applications of seaweed, it is also widely suggested that seaweed could offer ecosystem services during its growth by means of nutrient bioextraction of eutrophied waters. In this thesis, the critical nutrient flows of cultivation of S. latissima in MUPS at the North Sea are quantified using a dynamic mathematical nutrient model, and the impact on the marine vicinity is assessed. The assessment is performed for two scenarios: (1) a seaweed farm producing for a high-value chemicals factory, and (2) a seaweed farm producing for a fuel biorefinery. Both these scenarios are modelled over the course of one cultivation season on four offshore wind farm locations in the North Sea. Moreover, an analysis is performed on the potential role of monitoring technologies in offshore seaweed aquaculture in MUPS. The results of this study are combined to assess whether it is possible to establish ecosystem services through large-scale offshore seaweed cultivation in MUPS at the North Sea using monitoring technologies and nutrient analyses. The analysis in this study showed that offshore seaweed cultivation has a promising potential for nutrient bioextraction in the North Sea. However, nitrate depletion could occur during the last months of cultivation, when primary productivity is naturally lower. It is recommended that further research on the ecological effects of this nitrate depletion is conducted, and measures are taken to minimise the risk of detrimental effects. It is concluded that a combination of nutrient analyses and monitoring technologies could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of large-scale offshore seaweed cultivation. Subsequently, this can create a solid foundation for the development of ecosystem services and the further development of the offshore seaweed sector in the near future.","Seaweed; Macroalgae; Nutrients; Impact Assessment; Monitoring technologies; Offshore; Multi-Use platforms; North Sea","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

Gate set tomography is a protocol for characterization of logic operations (gates) on quantum computing processors. The NV’s electron served as a qubit. The quantum circuits were run both experimentally as well as on an NV-simulator. GST is different from its predecessors in the sense that it estimates all aspects of the processor simultaneously, without assuming any of its parts to be ideal. However, it does assume that the gates are Markovian. This allows to analyse the gate errors more precisely via their error generators. In addition to this, the diamond norm and a measure of the amount of model violation were used to examine the results. The electron qubit can couple to the nearby nitrogen nucleus, which can cause non-Markovian dynamics. The nitrogen nucleus (&#x1d446; = 1) can be initialised using nuclear spin polarization. The effects of different initialisation procedures on GST’s results were<br/>researched. Furthermore, a dynamical decoupling XY-4 echo sequence could be employed to protect the quantum state of the qubit. How the presence of the echo affected the estimated gates and their errors was probed. It was discovered that the echo was extremely good at decreasing the amount of model violation, most likely by preventing the electron from coupling to the nitrogen, which can lead to non-Markovian dynamics. Without the echo, GST’s estimates were satisfactory only if the nitrogen nucleus was initialised with a high enough fidelity, at least 0.95. Another topic for further research would be to perform GST on the electron and the nitrogen system, by modelling the nitrogen nucleus as<br/>a qutrit.","Gate set tomography; Nitrogen-vacancy center; Markovianity; XY-4 sequence","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

(mentor); Stikkelman, R.M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","The Russian invasion of Ukraine has created a renewed focus on both climate change and security of supply of energy. The European Commission’s Green Deal highlights the importance of the clean energy carrier ’low-carbon hydrogen’ to combat climate change. Simultaneously, in the new REPowerEU package, the European Commission emphasises the potential of low-carbon hydrogen as an alternative to the scarce natural gas. The quantities the European Commission aims for in these proposals are difficult to produce in Europe. Low-carbon hydrogen therefore needs to be imported. The main objective of this research is to develop a framework for all relevant players in both market and government on what mitigation measures to take for different risks for security of supply. It therefore answers the following research question: How can the security of supply of the low-carbon hydrogen import flow be organised, in a dynamically evolving market?<br/><br/>The data has been gathered by qualitative methods and has subsequently been analysed through a newly developed theoretical framework. This theoretical framework consists of the dynamic market theory of de Jong [1985], the transaction cost theory of Williamson [1979] and security of supply framework of [CIEP, 2019]. <br/><br/>This research has shown that the newly developed theoretical framework is suitable to analyse both the development and security of supply of the gas market and the low-carbon hydrogen market. It has also helped to shed light on very recent developments since the current gas crisis only started when this research already had begun. The dynamics between the market and the government in the gas-market were shown and it became evident that the current market-focused approach has not worked, given the current crisis. This research has shown that this market approach is two-sided: firstly, the Netherlands was dependent on the spotmarket without having long-term contracts. Secondly, most mitigation measures in case of disruption were also organised by the market. Therefore, this research has combined different risks with suitable mitigation measures and shows which ones should be regulated or taken by the government: in the introduction phase, important mitigation measures that should be focused on are: I) commercial storages II) the ability to switch fuels and carriers and III) foreign and security policy. In the expansion phase the same mitigation measures are important and new ones arise, these are: I) diversification to type of carrier, II) diversification to geographic source, III) resilience in infrastructure and IV) strategic storages.<br/><br/>The development of a low-carbon hydrogen import value chain is crucial to combat<br/>climate change. In order to secure the supply of low-carbon hydrogen, a right balance should be found in the trade-off between the organisation by the market and the government. This thesis presents a newly developed framework that contributes to approaching this balance.","Security of supply; Low-carbon hydrogen; Import value chain; Hydrogen; Transaction cost economics; Dynamic market theory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Resource availability is finite and concerns about future supply shortages rise. An approach to tackle this problem is circular economy which entails multiple strategies to reduce the demand of virgin materials. The implementation of those strategies require knowledge about material stocks and flows in a society. Material Flow Analysis can provide those insights. This fast developing field brought about MaTrace models which allow to trace the fate of materials in an open-loop recycling system. Recycling is only one of multiple circular strategies, thus the purpose of this research is to integrate an elaborate reuse model into a MaTrace model to build the foundation of a model which considers multiple circular strategies in sufficient ways.<br/><br/>Two existing models were combined to achieve this: Consumer goods present in the MaTrace model were redirected into a reuse model and the end of life products of the reuse model were fed back into the MaTrace model. The impacts of this model extension were investigated by comparing the total in-use stock when considering one, two, and three consumer products' use cycles. Furthermore, Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to gain an understanding of the model behaviour.<br/><br/>The results show that the total in-use stock increases in the peak by 8 % when reuse is considered. However, the gross stock dynamics do not change significantly in comparison to the original model. The evaluation of the Monte Carlo simulations revealed that the input which contributes the most uncertainty to the total in-use stock is the split of the initial material inflow. Furthermore, the results of the Monte Carlo simulations appear to be strongly connected to the initial input data. On the basis of this research it can be recommended to further extend MaTrace models to obtain a more comprehensive representation of a circular economy. Furthermore, MaTrace models using time series data for inflows and model parameter have to be created, this way MaTrace models can follow the evolution of MFA from static to dynamic models.","Material Flow Analysis; MaTrace; Reuse; Cobalt","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

As these code constructions have a natural interpretation in the language of homology, this thesis studies the interplay between homological algebra and various recent product constructions of qLDPC codes.<br/><br/>First, we provide an overview of the theory of singular homology, cellular homology, and homological algebra over vector spaces, and use this theory to analyse two product constructions: the hypergraph product construction and the distance balancing procedure. These constructions can be interpreted as tensor products of chain complexes over vector spaces. We present new proofs for results from the literature regarding the distance and the number of encoded qubits of these product codes. <br/><br/>Secondly, we survey the theory of homology over ring modules, and use this theory to interpret and analyse another product code construction (the lifted product code construction), which is a generalisation of the hypergraph product construction. We prove a Künneth theorem for these codes, and use this theorem to prove a formula for the number of qubits such codes encode. <br/><br/>Thirdly, we investigate the homology of fibre bundles. To this end, we provide an overview of the theory of covering spaces and of fibre bundles, as well as an overview of the theory of homology with local coefficients and of spectral sequences. We then calculate the homology of a specific class of fibre bundles using three different methods. After this discussion, we consider two product code constructions: the fibre bundle product construction and the balanced product construction. We explicate their mathematical foundations, and use these insights to prove two new results for the number of qubits that these product codes encode. Finally, we explain under which conditions these two code constructions and the lifted product construction coincide.<br/><br/>Lastly, we consider a specific example of fibre bundle product codes: the twisted toric code. We determine an analytic expression for the distance of such a code and verify this expression using numerical simulations. Furthermore, we perform an extensive numerical study on these codes to determine how performing a twist alters the scaling of the logical error rate of such codes. We present a new analytic method to explain the scaling of these codes on a small domain, and verify the validity of these calculations by comparing them with the results of our numerical simulations.","Quantum Error Correction; Homology; Homological Algebra; Low Density Parity Check Codes; LDPC codes; Fibre Bundles; Algebraic Topology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

This can be used to simulate the evolution of a protoplanetary disk, which gives insight into how planetary systems form. The analytic propagator calculates collisions one by one, while a numerical propagator would compute each time step. The idea of using the analytic propagator is that collisions are rare in astronomical scales, such that jumping from collision to collision and calculating it, is more efficient than calculating all the time steps that are between collisions. Simplifying the orbits of the planetesimals into perfect Keplerian orbits, analytical solutions exist which are used by the analytic propagator.<br/><br/>In this thesis, the runtimes of simulations were measured as well as other properties directly related to the runtime. The overall efficiency of the algorithm with respect to <i>N</i> seemed to be <i>O</i>(<i>N</i><sup style="""">3</sup>), which is one power less than previously predicted. The prediction was that the runtime of the full simulation is <i>O</i>(<i>N</i><sup>2</sup><i>ε</i> + <i>N</i><sup>4</sup><i>s</i><sup>3</sup>/<i>Ia</i><sup>3</sup>). Here <i>ε</i> is the maximum eccentricity, <i>s</i>/<i>a</i> is the ratio of a planetesimal's radius to the semi-major axis of its orbit, and <i>I</i> is the maximum inclination. This was calculated by estimating the total number of collisions to be <i>O</i>(<i>N</i><sup>2</sup><i>s</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>Ia</i><sup>2</sup>) and the runtime for each collision to be <i>O</i>(<i>N</i><sup>2</sup><i>s</i>/<i>a</i>). But the number of collisions turns from quadratic to linear in <i>N</i>, implying that above a certain <i>N</i> almost all planetesimals collide, which reduces the power of <i>N</i> by one. For comparison, the octree code has an algorithmic efficiency of <i>O</i>(<i>N </i>log<i>N</i>) per time step, and the number of steps for a fixed integration time grows as <i>O</i>(<i>N</i><sup>4/3</sup> log <i>N</i>).","numerical efficiency; simulation; gravitation; analytical propagator; collision detection; celestial mechanics; protoplanetary disks","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics | Applied Physics","",""

This enables everyday monitoring outside of clinical environments in contrast to generally used scalp EEG with wet electrodes. This thesis proposes and describes the design of novel flexible dry CNT/PDMS electrodes with short pins, long pins, and a snake pattern. These dry electrodes make use of microstructures to improve electrode-skin impedance (ESI) by enlarging the effective contact area. In the composite fabrication process, SEM is used to optimize CNT dispersion which plays a significant role in the impedance of the material. The performance of the proposed dry electrodes is evaluated in comparison to conventionally used wet Ag/AgCl electrodes. Electrode impedance measurements show the superior performance of CNT/PDMS electrodes with microstructures with lower aspect ratios. This is confirmed by ESI measurements, which show a 49 % improvement at 10 Hz for the electrode with short pins compared to the electrode with long pins, and a further 53 % improvement for electrodes with the snake pattern. This makes the latter comparable to wet electrodes. Moreover, normalization by the projected surface area shows significantly lower ESI at low frequencies for dry CNT/PDMS electrodes with a snake pattern compared to wet electrodes. ESI of the dry electrode at 10 Hz is 30 kΩ cm2, one order of magnitude lower than for wet electrodes. At 1 kHz the ESI is 9.9 kΩ cm2, which is comparable to wet electrodes. Finally, ASSR tests show comparable suitability of dry CNT/PDMS electrodes and wet electrodes for in-ear EEG monitoring, suggesting that the proposed dry CNT/PDMS electrodes are a viable solution for in-ear EEG applications.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Using renewable energy to power a Mars habitat is a technological challenge because resources such as solar and wind are significantly weaker than on Earth. This work investigates the feasibility of using airborne wind energy (AWE) systems in combination with solar photovoltaic (PV) modules to power a Mars habitat. The Luchsinger model and the higher fidelity QSM are used to simulate the performance of the AWE system and compared. This thesis builds upon two earlier design synthesis exercise (DSE) projects by implementing a version of the quasi-steady model (QSM) that accounts for the transition phase, models a realistic retraction trajectory, and accounts for the mass of the airborne components. Additionally, the results of the first DSE indicate that the Luchsinger model used did not appear to consume any energy during the reel-in phase, which is not realistic and led to an over-prediction of mean cycle power. However, this thesis aims to implement the Luchsinger model correctly. <br/><br/>Creating a road map for sizing AWE kite systems on Mars is the main objective of this thesis. Since the performance of the AWE system is varying in time and space, the Mars Climate Database (MCD) is used to retrieve atmospheric and surface solar flux data including wind Weibull probability distribution functions (PDF). The second DSE used the MCD and validated the results against wind data from various Mars landers. The MCD is based on numerical simulations of the Martian atmosphere using a general circulation model and validated with available observational data. Seasonal vertical wind profiles are generated from the meteorological data to characterise the boundary layer over time. A scaling study assesses how AWE on Mars differs from that on Earth, performing dimensional analysis. In the system characteristics chapter, the initial sizing of the kite area and mass is computed using the scaling study. The performance models create the power curves, which together with the wind PDFs and surface solar flux data are used in the habitat energy model to verify whether the power requirements are met. Due to an insufficient amount of quantitative information on the energy consumption of the robotic construction of the habitat, the design of the microgrid is covering only the use of the habitat, which is 10 kW of continuous power. This is similar to remote off-grid solutions on Earth, with the additional challenge of having lower resource availability, both for wind and solar. This thesis concludes that various configurations of a hybrid power plant can continuously provide 10 kW of power throughout the entire Martian year. Moreover, the results indicate that using kites alone could generate sufficient power for the habitat without using solar PV.<br/><br/>Rhizome project: http://www.roboticbuilding.eu/project/rhizome-development-of-an-autarkic-design-to-robotic-production-and-operation-system-for-building-off-earth-habitats/ <br/><br/>Published poster on thesis for Airborne Wind Energy Conference in Milano, Italy,: https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A4013ca0b-5508-4413-b8cb-5251ca1e7781 <br/><br/>Video made to illustrate how Mars flight would look like.: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS20vHhqgKk&amp;ab_channel=AirborneWindEnergyOnline","wind energy; Airborne wind energy; mars habitats; Mars; mars atmosphere; Mars climate Database; habitat energy model; Quasi steady model; Luchsinger model; Scaling study; kitepower; V3 demonstrator; 10 kw","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","Rhizome",""

Thus, the research objective of this thesis is to investigate which factors affect the de jure standards adoption by high-tech start-ups, and within the scope of the Netherlands. In addition to this, the thesis also aims to discover if the factors effecting de jure standards adoption are possible to influence by the Dutch standards organization (the NEN), and if so, how.<br/>This thesis is setup as a theory-building, explorative case study consisting of 3 rounds of data collection. The first is a literature review into the studies of de jure standards adoption and the determination of which major recurring theories and frameworks are applied in these studies. Three major recurring applied theories were found, the diffusion of innovation, neo-institutionalism and the network economics approach applied in the TOE framework. A list of potential factors was formulated from the factors applied in the relevant studies, using the aforementioned theories and frameworks. The literature-backed list consists of: (1) Perceived relative advantage, (2) Perceived compatibility, (3) Perceived complexity, (4) Observability, (5) Competitive pressure, (6) Environmental uncertainty, (7) Mimetic pressure, (8) Coercive pressure, (9) External support, (10) Normative pressure, (11) Management support, (12) Centralization, (13) Formalization, and (14) Organizational size.<br/>This list of factors was used as a basis for the 2nd step of data collection in this case study: the 1st round of semi-structured interviews. This 1st round of interviews consisted of interviews with 6 cases: 5 Dutch high-tech start-ups and a NEN official. The interview transcripts were codified and analyzed to determine which factors the start-ups identify, and which effect they mention the factor has. Factors were also mentioned that were not included in the literature-backed list. These were axially (thematically) analyzed to formulate new propositional factors. The transcripts were then analyzed again to determine if the new propositional factors were mentioned by the others as well, and which effect they mention. This data is used to build upon the literature-backed list of factors. The result is thus a list of factors consisting of literature-backed factors that were identified and the new propositional factors. In other words, a list of factors that the high-tech start-ups and the NEN official identify. This list consists of: (1) Perceived relative advantage, (2) Perceived compatibility, (3) Perceived complexity, (4) Environmental uncertainty, (5) Mimetic pressure, (6) Coercive pressure, (7) External support, (8) Normative pressure, (9) Management support, (10) Centralization, (11) Formalization, (12) Organizational size, (13) Awareness/prior knowledge, (14) Processual characteristics, (15) Trust in evolution of standard and (16) Costs. The effects of the standards were also collected, interpreted and discussed. A significant outcome is that there is a distinction between the adoption of a single standard and the adoption of a combination of standards and that this can be seen as a factor, which has a moderating effect on certain other factors.<br/>The last round of data collection consisted of a 2nd round of semi-structured interviews with 2 cases: (1) a NEN official and (2) two standards organization experts. These interviews were to determine which factors the cases identify as possible to influence and how. The results of this are that the cases identify the factors of coercive pressure, awareness/prior knowledge, trust in evolution of standard and costs as possible to influence.<br/>This research is one of the first studying the factors affecting de jure standards adoption by high-tech start-ups. There are multiple points of contribution to theoretical literature: the aforementioned list of identified factors and their respective effects on de jure standards adoption, and the factors that were determined possible to influence.","high-tech startups; standards adoption; de jure standards","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

At the same time, OWTs have been found to contain many electrical components that may not officially fall under the WEEE direct but share many similarities with WEEE. While there is little known about the recycling of OWTs and their electrical components due to their recent introduction, the recycling of WEEE has been studied more extensively and is a more mature industry.<br/><br/>To determine the preferred recycling route for permanent magnets from OWTs, a comparison was made with the characteristics and the recycling routes of permanent magnets from WEEE. The disassembly was found to be the most critical part to enable an efficient recycling process, leading to the objective of how can permanent magnets be disassembled from OWT generators. It was found that the disassembly of magnetised magnets at the scale of OWTs is challenging due to the forces required to move them and the brittleness of the materials. For efficient disassembly, the permanent magnets need to be locally and thermally demagnetised. Through a series of interviews, desk research, a lab visit and a site visit to Cuxhaven a concept for the disassembly of permanent magnets from OWTs was developed. <br/><br/>It was found that induction heating a copper coil wrapped around U shaped core to transfer heat to the permanent magnet via conduction is a potential scalable, automatable and time-efficient solution for demagnetisation. The power required to heat the coil depended predominantly on the time taken to heat the core as well as the contact surface area of the core with the permanent magnet, the mass of the conductor and the material chosen for the conductor. After thermal demagnetisation, the magnet can be removed while the magnetic is still hot or after cooling, dependent on the thermal expansion coefficient, effect of re-magnetisation and remanence of the magnet. Depending on the acceptable remanence to be able to handle the magnet, it may not be necessary to heat the magnet up all the way to the Curie temperature. The solution proposed in this study is just one of many options towards the recycling of permanent magnets, thus alternative solutions such as direct induction of complete thermal demagnetisation should also be considered.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Mouter, N. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","In order to understand the impact of new infrastructure projects, appraisal tools are used to estimate the impact it will have on society. Infrastructure is a key part of society, enabling and disabling society to work and live, playing a vital part in everyone’s lives. Former studies by Annema, Frenken, et al. (2017), Niek Mouter (2017b) and Eliasson and Lundberg (2012) have researched how appraisal tools and especially CBA are used by decision-makers to get to a decision. Other research by Van Wee (2012) has shown the ethical problems which arise when using CBA as an appraisal tool. However, there has not been any research on the impact appraisal tools have on the process and outcome of infrastructure projects. This thesis will provide insights in the impact of appraisal tools on social and process equitability. By using a framework by D. Levinson (2002), case studies, interviews and policy documents, the incorporation of social and process equity factors can be depicted per country. Results show that the Dutch appraisal tools do not incorporate a wide array of dimensions and stratifications, which are depicted in literature. This lack of information results in social inequitable decision-making as well as inequitable outcomes due to negligence of not incorporating more dimensions. Two reasons can be found for this Dutch approach, namely the funding reason which results in solution-oriented design, and the general Dutch mindset of seeing and treating everyone as equal, resulting in inequitable outcomes due to not taking differences into account. The Dutch process equity is boosted by its near-perfect transparency in terms of accessibility of documents, but hurt by the lack of participation and the lack of impact when participation is present. The United Kingdom on the other hand has an elaborate appraisal process which analyses a much wider variety of dimensions and stratifications. However, due to a solution-oriented process design, the alternatives for a project have already been shot down when the social impact information is available to a decision-maker. Another reason which hurts the social equitability in the United Kingdom is the fact that it is necessary to have a high value-for-money project to receive funding, resulting in ignoring of social impact analyses due to this economic focus. In terms of process equity, the United Kingdom has a solid consultation process which is used consistently. However, a lack of transparency in the process with regard to decisions made and the availability of (policy) documents results in poor process equity overall. This thesis shows that social and process equity cannot be improved by simply adding tools which gather social impact information to the appraisal process. Political play, the drift for efficiency and cultural differences per country makes it difficult to create a single strategy to improve equity in appraisal processes. However, by improving transparency, focusing on getting a problem-oriented design and using a third party as a validation for the incorporation of equity factors, it is possible to improve the inclusion of equity factors in appraisal processes. This thesis can be used as a basis for analysing and understanding appraisal processes in other countries.","Equity; Equitability; infrastructure; appraisal; Netherlands; United Kingdom; Social equity; Process equity; cost-benefit analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

The perception of safety has been proven to play a significant role in the decision to adopt active forms of transportation. The significance of this feeling is underlined even more when it comes to vulnerable road users, in this case, cycling children. This study seeks to provide a better knowledge of the road conditions that increase the perception of road safety in order to establish a safe and encouraging cycling environment for adolescents cycling to school. The preferences of different categories of the population toward various measures are explored using the stated preferences experiment. Furthermore, with the adoption of the new lowering of the speed limit policy, the attitude toward a growth in the usage of bicycles is done. According to the findings of this study, different sectors of the public have distinct perceptions and preferences toward the numerous aspects shown on the highways. The presence of separated bike lanes, a speed restriction of 30 km/h, and a priority for crossing rule for cyclists are discovered to be components that all groups in the sample strongly prefer. Parking on the country road is limited to the groupings of parents and road designers. Finally, the presence of speed displays is discovered to be negligible for all subgroups in the sample population as a measure that has no influence on making roads safer for children to cycle on. Furthermore, it has been discovered that parents who bring their children to schools that<br/>are now located near unsafe GOW50 roads have a more positive attitude toward cycling following the implementation of the speed limit policy. More aspects that were discussed in the GOW30 debate could be included in a future study to gain a better understanding of the impact of the various elements on providing a safe cycling environment for children. Furthermore, a recommendation is made to examine the behavior of parents in other locations that are also in close proximity to hazardous GOW50 roads and to incorporate the features of other respondents in order to corroborate the findings of this study.","Cycling; Children; Safety; Subjective safety; Stated choice; GOW30","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","With variable renewable energy on the rise, large-scale energy storage is needed to assure grid stability. Thermal energy storage (TES) is a new player in the large-scale energy storage landscape, but might prove a cheap, safe and reliable option, with low permitting barriers. TES is not geographically limited, generally compact and has a low levelised cost of storage (LCOS) which comes at a cost of a lower round-trip efficiency compared to other grid-scale energy storage methods. Thermal energy storage is most suited for intraday and multiday storage.<br/>Within thermal energy storage, several types can be distinguished based on the design of the thermodynamic cycle. In this thesis, these types are analysed and compared on basis of technology, cost, and miscellaneous characteristics. An overview of cost and characteristics of current relevant thermal energy storage (TES) storage materials and TES companies is given. A Rankine-type TES, as is used in the E2S project, is generally cheaper and easier to implement, at a cost of a reduced round-trip efficiency. Rankine-type TES have a round-trip efficiency of about 40% as it is limited by the Rankine-cycle efficiency.<br/>The TES studied in the scope of this thesis relies on evaporation of water and a steam turbine to recover power. The work of the thesis comprises of a thermodynamic and hydraulic optimization study regarding the heat transfer during conduction, convection and boiling inside the TES. To this end, a steady boiling model is constructed based on empirical and phenomenological correlations. It is found that during steady state, boiling phenomena incur higher heat transfer coefficients for low to medium wall superheat in comparison to a model that does not regard boiling phenomena. Conversely, lower heat transfer coefficients are attained for high to very high wall superheat in comparison to a model that does not regard boiling phenomena. It is hypothesised that this phenomenon will incur higher overall boiling heat transfer during transient operation.<br/>An optimization study is conducted with the aforementioned boiling model to find the optimum combination of TES parameters for a given power and capacity, with the optimization parameter being the combined material cost of steam generator tubing and storage material. Several design guidelines are concluded. Most notably is found that pressure drop plays a very minor role in TES optimization and therefore a lower pressure drop may be chosen. Furthermore, critical parameters and bottlenecks of the TES are identified in a sensitivity analysis.<br/>Lastly, integration of the TES in a steam cycle is evaluated. The effect of variations in pressure and temperature output of the TES are analysed, and the total round-trip efficiency and its performance during part-load operation are determined. Various qualitative changes are discussed, and a quantitative estimate is made of the sizing of a start-up TES, which may be used for cold, warm and hot start of the steam turbine. As the TES is to be implemented in a thermal power plant, an estimate is made of the sizing and cost of such an implementation using the data from the optimisation study. Various aspects of this plant are evaluated such as system response, start-up time and a techno-economical analysis of multi-day operation.","Thermal Energy Storage; Thermodynamics; Heat Transfer; Optimization study; Turbomachinery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2024-09-02","","","","","",""

This system largely consists of daughter craft, small vessels that increase the multitasking capabilities of an SOV. The goal of this research is to improve the accessibility to ultimately increase turbine availability, which is proven in this work to be necessary. The research is carried out in cooperation with Siemens Gamesa, a major wind turbine supplier. This research builds off the basis laid by Brans et al., who applied a needs analysis on the daughter craft system. This research applies the next step in the systems engineering sequence: concept exploration. The scope of this research extends beyond that of the daughter craft to any system that can improve the unplanned maintenance of far offshore wind farms. <br/> <br/> Because the subject matter is relatively little covered in the scientific field, this research lays great emphasis on the context of the problem. The status quo of the sector is described in terms of equipment, operations, regulations, forms of limitations, financial context, trends, and different stages performed in unplanned maintenance. By performing an analysis of alternatives a high potential for system improvement is found.<br/><br/>A set of performance requirements for the accessibility system is developed to structurally assess the system and possible improvements. These performance requirements are used to determine which alternative system holds the most potential for accessibility improvement. Increasing daughter craft dimensions is chosen as the most potent alternative. A feasibility study is performed on deploying CTV-sized vessels far-offshore for two weeks thereby significantly reducing transfer time and distance. These vessels are called far-offshore transfer vessels (FOTV). <br/>Different configurations are tested for storing the FOTVs far-offshore when not in operation and interfacing with the SOV. Two principal concepts are identified: Enlarged daughter craft, where the FOTV is stored on the SOV, and the exposed principals, where the FOTV remains in the water. One configuration of the enlarged daughter craft principal is deemed feasible: The lifting launch configuration. Two configurations of the exposed principal are deemed feasible: The connected to the SOV configuration and the moored to designated platform configuration. Furthermore, a model is constructed to assess the logistic and economic merit of different combinations of FOTV, wind farm, and configuration. <br/><br/>This research concludes that the deployment of a FOTV combined with a lifting launch configuration is most profitable for any wind farm. Nonetheless, the exposed principal concepts outperform the current system significantly. The choice of FOTV depends mainly on the accessibility performance and day rate of the vessel but also on the wind farm. The model predicts that in the current market, the highest-performing CTVs are the most profitable options for FOTV deployment. Finally, the results show that the effects of improving accessibility vessel performance relates inverse exponentially to profit performance.","accessibility; Offshore; Offshore energy; safety; Far offshore transfer vessel; CTV; Daughter craft","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design","",""

(mentor); Baars, W.J. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","During the start-up and shutdown sequence of rocket engines, immense forces are generated that are required to propel the payload into earth's orbit or outer space. The bulk of the generated forces are in the form of thrust. However, forces are also generated that act perpendicularly to the thrust direction. These side-loads are unwanted byproducts of the complex flow features present in the nozzle and as such, research has been conducted in the past to address this issue and discover their origin. Conventionally, research into side-loads has been conducted using subscale nozzles that don't deform as the flow passes through them. Due to the rigidity of these models, the nozzles don't deform to any degree that would cause it to interact with the flow. This fluid-structure interaction, present in full-scale rocket nozzles due to their sheer size, is therefore not taken into account when testing on subscale nozzles. To this end, a rocket nozzle testing facility was designed and built to investigate the fluid-structure interaction present in rocket nozzles using flexible subscale rocket nozzles. Due to the laborious nature of designing and manufacturing the testing facility, no working subscale flexible nozzles could be manufactured within the given time. <br/><br/>To continue building upon this previous work, subscale rocket nozzles were poured using various types of polyurethane. To cast these nozzles, multiple mould parts were manufactured. To guarantee a smooth surface finish for the inner nozzle wall, an inner mould was CNC machined. To enable the casting of multiple nozzles with different wall thicknesses, outer moulds were 3D-printed. After having determined the correct variant of polyurethane, Smooth-On's 'Smooth-Cast 66D', three different nozzles were cast on which tests were conducted. The nominal nozzle was designed with a wall thickness of 2mm, with two additional nozzles being cast with a wall thickness of 1.5mm and 2.5mm.<br/><br/>Having manufactured the nozzles, they were mounted to the test facility. The test facility consists of a stand connected to an air tank capable of containing air at pressures of up to 40 bar. Due to pressure losses throughout the valves, the maximum attainable nozzle pressure ratio, or NPR, amounted to slightly over 30. Various tests were performed during which the NPR was either altered during the test, done by manually opening or closing the control valve contained in the system. Further tests were conducted at a number of constant values of NPR at which excessive vibrations occurred to gain further insight into the flow phenomena present at these critical values of NPR. Lip tracking was done as well as schlieren photography. For the lip tracking, correction fluid was applied to the nozzle lip as well as spray painting the outer wall of the nozzle black. The area surrounding the nozzle was made dark such that the predominant feature photographed would be the circular nozzle lip. Once the images were taken, the nozzle lip was discretised in 180 points and was compared to an image of the nozzle taken when the wind tunnel was closed. The end result is a discretised function of 180 points displaying the lip deflection at each azimuthal location. With the help of the discrete Fourier transform, the dominant eigenmodes could be extracted from the nozzle vibrations in the form of their Fourier coefficients. In addition to lip tracking, schlieren images were taken simultaneously with the aim of visualising the flow downstream of the nozzle exit. The brightness of a set of pixels was tracked and their spectral make-up was determined.<br/><br/>Along the entire scale of NPR, two regions were found in which most of the vibrations occurred. The first region of activity, was purported to be linked to the transition of separation regime from free shock separation, FSS, to restricted shock separation, RSS. The second region of NPR, in which the deflection was often even more excessive than the first, is highly likely due to the presence of a recirculation bubble passing over the nozzle lip. Out of the first three eigenmodes, named the breathing, bending and ovalisation mode respectively, the ovalisation mode accounted for the largest proportion of the deflection by far. Based on these transient tests, further tests were conducted at a constant NPR of NPR = 21.7 and NPR = 27.7. These were chosen as all three nozzles showed large deflections at these NPR. For the nominal 2mm nozzle, two additional values were chosen of NPR = 22.7 and NPR = 27.5 to conduct further tests at. The energy present in each of the first three eigenmodes was determined by calculating the variance of the Fourier coefficients. The energy in the modes during the constant NPR runs were compared to the energy in the modes during the transient tests. These were obtained by determining the energy of an NPR-envelop spanning 1 unit of NPR centered around the NPR at which the constant run was performed. By and large, the energy storage in the first three modes remained similar when comparing transient tests with constant NPR runs. The bending mode showed the largest deviation from this trend, mainly when in RSS. Frequency analyses showed the nozzle to oscillate at rates predominantly within 130Hz-400Hz. Wavelet power spectra showed no clear trend between the NPR and the frequency with which the nozzles vibrated. Strouhal calculations further confirmed that NPR would not have a drastic effect on the unsteadiness frequency of the flow. The testing helped provide insight into the mechanical vibrations of nozzles of various wall thicknesses in different flow conditions. However, due to the absence of quantitative flow visualisation and measured flow unsteadiness frequency, no concrete link could be made to the aeroelastic coupling and the fluid's role in the forcing of the vibrations.","Flexible nozzles; Overexpanded; Fluid-structure interaction; Schlieren; Lip tracking; FSS; RSS; Recirculation bubble; Supersonic flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-09-02","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Moreover, we found that the delay-based pricing scheme is more flexible and more capable of reducing congestion. It is recommended that some road sections may be tolled to reduce delays.

In this thesis the economic engineering concept of modeling individual agents is used to model economic systems consisting of many agents, e.g. an entire country. This is done using classical statistical physics. In statistical physics the microscopic movement of individual gas particles as described by classical mechanics and the macroscopic properties of gases as described by thermodynamics are linked. Using this insight, microeconomics and macroeconomics are linked within the economic engineering framework.<br/><br/>The critical contribution of this thesis is finding the analog of Gibbs' interpretation of entropy, calling it the amount of diversification. This is done as follows. A thermodynamic system in equilibrium is seen as the analog of a Pareto optimal economy or macroeconomic equilibrium. The 2nd law of thermodynamics guarantees the existence of thermodynamic equilibrium and it follows that the entropy is maximized in equilibrium. Clausius interpreted the entropy as an ""arrow of time"" that pushes the system towards equilibrium. In this thesis Adam Smith's invisible hand is then viewed as an economic analog of Clausius' entropy. Gibbs gives a statistical interpretation to entropy. By calling the amount of diversification the analog of the Gibbs entropy, it follows that a Pareto optimal economy is fully diversified. The amount of diversification contains both the distribution of economic rent over agents and the portfolio diversification of agents for different goods.<br/><br/>Based on the diversification analog, the thesis develops several further analogs. The analog of the partition function is called the opportunity function and gives the opportunities for extracting profits from an economic system by trading. From this the economic engineering analog of the free energy follows. The temperature and chemical potential are given economic engineering analogs as well, namely the level of welfare and the disposable income per capita respectively. The thesis is finalized with applications of the theory developed.","Economic Engineering; Statistical Physics; Microeconomics; Macroeconomics; Thermodynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(mentor); Lin, P. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","SBS modified bitumen is popularly utilized in road construction owing to its outstanding performance and competitive pricing. However, like normal bitumen, SBS modified bitumen will also be aged and causing asphalt pavement distress and the need for maintenance, resulting in a significant amount of wasted modified asphalt. Recycling waste asphalt is critical for lowering road construction and maintenance costs, conserving original resources, and protecting the environment. Since recycled bitumen waste deteriorates over time, rejuvenators can be used to restore its properties. Many rejuvenators, on the other hand, only rejuvenate aged bitumen, and the excellent performance of SBS modified bitumen is largely attributable to the SBS polymer and polymer network structure in it. As a necessary consequence, it is critical to consider the simultaneous rejuvenation of both aged bitumen and degraded SBS polymer. <br/>In this research, SBS modified bitumen was aged with thin-film oven test (TFOT), followed by pressure aging vessel (PAV), and various contents and proportions of reference rejuvenators, physical rejuvenators, and chemical rejuvenators were applied to the aged bitumen. Dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) tests and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) tests were conducted on aged and rejuvenated bitumen samples to study rejuvenation effects with different types of oil, SBS content, and chemical compounds by comparing rheological and chemical properties. The study showed that the rejuvenation effects of pure oil based rejuvenators are intimately connected to environmental temperature and oil molecular weight. High molecular weight oil provides better rutting resistance in high temperatures and low molecular weight oil provides better cracking and fatigue resistance at low temperatures. Rejuvenated bitumen with chemical rejuvenators performed admirably at high temperatures but with poor cracking and fatigue resistance in low temperatures. Increasing the SBS content in physical rejuvenators improves rutting resistance at high temperatures and reduces cracking resistance but partially improves fatigue resistance at low temperatures. The effects of different oil types and proportions for physical rejuvenators at high temperatures are a little complicated. In rejuvenators with low or medium SBS content, increasing proportion reduces performance, indicating oil is dominant now. In rejuvenators with high SBS content, increasing proportion improves performance, implying SBS is currently leading. For rejuvenators containing rapeseed oil and high SBS content, rising proportion barely affects performance, possibly because high viscosity oil has diminished the effect of high SBS content. For low temperature performance, physical rejuvenators with large molecular weight oil have the worst performance. Furthermore, increasing physical rejuvenator proportion improves the cracking and fatigue resistance of rejuvenated bitumen. In FTIR analysis, the polybutadiene group index IPB of rejuvenated bitumen with physical rejuvenators increases significantly and continues to rise as the proportion or SBS content increases. Moreover, the IPB index increases for rejuvenated bitumen with chemical rejuvenators, and a group of new absorption peaks in the spectrum demonstrated MDI had chemical reactions with degraded SBS polymer and had successfully connected the fracture SBS polymer segment.","SBS modified bitumen; Rejuvenator; Rheological properties; Chemical properties","en","student report","","","","","","","","2023-09-30","","","","Civil Engineering","CIE5050-09 Additional Graduation Work, Research Project",""

(graduation committee); Wertheim-Heck, dr. SCO (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution); Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions (degree granting institution); Wageningen University & Research (degree granting institution)","2022","This master’s thesis aims to shed light on the recent phenomenon of regional food strategies that aim for more localized food provisioning for urban and metropolitan areas. The discourse used in these strategies influences not only which stakeholders are included in the urban food governance process, but also influences the competition for urban and peri-urban space. It is imperative to highlight how discourse is used in regional food strategies and how this could potentially affect the fair use of and access to certain food resources within growing metropolitan areas. A search of current literature was done, and no research was found on how the discourse used in regional food strategies and urban food governance impacts spatial justice and food security within cities. This thesis aims to do so.<br/><br/>A comparative case study was used as they effectively analyze and synthesize patterns across phenomenon – regional food strategies – that unfold in different places – the two metropolitan regions of Amsterdam, North Holland the Netherlands and Phoenix, Arizona in the United States of America. A triangulation of qualitative methods, including discourse analysis, were used to enhance the validity of the research design.<br/><br/>The results revealed that both cases are characterized by fragmented governance, a lack of political urgency in addressing food system challenges, stakeholder conflict, and low to non-existent awareness of the RFSs among the public. Additionally, both cases are facing increased spatial inequalities that are effectively decreasing access to basic urban food resources.","Regional food strategy; Urban food governance; Discourse; Spatial Justice","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Metropolitan Analysis, Design and Engineering (MADE)","",""

(mentor); Eckardt, H.F. (mentor); Sanaan Bensi, N. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2022","Starting from a port, Marseille was born as the result of improvisation and spontaneous architectures rather than urban planning. Same things happened in the architecture scale. architects are not the only doers of architecture. Long after the building has been made the non-architects continuously do architecture. When non-architects occupy space, they start to ‘do-it-themselves’. In most cases, they do this in an already occupied territory, where the activity of doing architecture has been classified and claimed by architects - the rules have already been established. But there are also some space occupations that are out of the rules, such as squatting, vendors, graffiti, protest. They, like “pet architecture”, do not necessarily create appealing spaces, and some are even illegal, but they can highlight people’s demands and show people’s bottom-up determination to shape the city.<br/><br/>When people do the practice, they mainly based on their own current needs and what material they have instead of considering the building or city as a whole. These practices are spontaneous, unplanned makeshift and ad hoc. They can be seen as improvisational practice. Seen architecture as paintings, in these cases, their improvisational activities are more like a collage rather than fully considered composition. But as Jencks explains, it involves using an available system in a new way to solve a problem quickly and efficiently. By doing so, it offers a way for everyone to shape and discuss the city they live in. And for the public, there should be nothing preventing them, in an agonistic and participatory manner, from devising and debating forms of their shelter and space for daily life. The improvisational practice has itself taken inspiration: Another world is possible.","Urban Improvisation; Marseille; Spontaneous Practice","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Borders and Territories","",""
