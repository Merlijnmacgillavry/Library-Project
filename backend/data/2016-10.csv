(mentor)","2016","Online social networks have been attracted considerable attentions and provided new channels for users to share and disseminate content, products, ideas and etc on the websites. With the advent of Internet, the user activities in online social networks can be easily tracked, which provide us with a extremely large scale of online data to study the individual interaction patterns and interpersonal influence over online social network. In this work, we aim to investigate the characteristics of user rating activity contagion, by which the information can spread through network of users in Epinion online social network. Our study is based on a dataset collected from Epinion online social network, which includes not only the trust network data indicating the social graph formed by its users but also the users’ rating activity data. We analyze the social structure and confirm that the Epinion social network exhibit small-world and scale-free characteristics. We present the analysis of user rating activity data and extract the interactions between users, that indicate the spread dynamics of user activity over Epinion using a percolation process based methodology, and present the user behavior patterns observed in Epinion social network. We propose a social contagion model that is inspired from the Epinion data, which captures the unique characteristic that percolation probability along social links is dependent on the user degree property. We use the model to systematically study the propagation dynamics of user activity through the Epinion social network as well as two generated network models: scalefree network and Erdos-Renyi network on the activity dynamics to investigate the following questions: How quickly and widely does rating activity spread in Epinion social network? How social network topology influences the activity propagation process?

(mentor)","2016","The intensive research interest in studying genomes has led to a series of advances in DNA sequencing methods and technologies, resulting in a high pace of data production. As a result, the need for storing, managing and transmitting DNA sequencing data in an affordable and efficient way becomes urgent. Data compression is used as a solution that enables facing this data production challenge. Despite the domain specific data compression algorithms developed for genome files, they are mostly compressed using general purpose algorithms and formats such as gzip. In the context of this project, a boosting technique is presented as a genome file preprocessing step to be applied prior to compressing it using an LZ77-compliant algorithm. The approach is based on the idea of clustering the data in the gnome file using similarity of quality scores in the sequenced DNA data. This thesis creates a mathematical model for this approach and then implements it for a number of genome files and shows its effectiveness for some of them. In addition, a decision framework is then proposed and evaluated experimentally, focusing on file characterization so as to predict the applicability of the technique to a general genome file. Results show marginal improvement in the compression ratio of preprocessed files of up to 0.43% as compared to the original file.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Quantum Engineering","","Computer Science","",""

(mentor)","2016","Growing concern about global warming and climate change intensified the research into more efficient ways of operation in the maritime industry. These researches triggered the use of electrical batteries in hybrid systems. Van Oord aims to operate more efficiently, which implies using less fuel and thus emitting less carbon dioxide. A way to achieve this might be the use of batteries for hybrid power plants on board of their cutter suction dredgers. This will investigate what the potential carbon dioxide reduction of a hybrid system could be. Since the competitiveness of the Van Oord fleet should not be affected a certain cost perspective is taken into account as well. The objective of this thesis is to find a battery capacity that achieves a fuel and running hour reduction in such a way that it is cost effective. The cutter suction dredger’s operational profile has a fluctuating nature in terms of power demand. In this study several operational profiles are examined and one most representative operational profile is constructed. This operational profile has large peaks and troughs which favours the use of a certain peak shaving system like a battery. Moreover, the average loading of the diesel engines is quite frequently far off the optimal 85% load. In order to optimise the power demand from the diesel engines and ensuring efficient operation, models are developed to simulate the behaviour of the diesel engine, the battery and the hybrid system as a whole. As a start the effect of transients in the load profile of the diesel engine on its efficiency is investigated. It is found that the efficiency of a larger medium speed diesel engine running on constant speed with a sufficient air excess ratio, is not affected by transients in the load profile. The data collected in this analysis is used to develop a fuel consumption model which estimates fuel consumption as function of the load of the engine. In addition, the diesel engine the battery pack is modelled. The model of the battery pack is based on multi dimensional lookup tables that hold the non-linear relations between terminal voltage, state of charge and current. For the battery a separate lifetime calculation is developed, which estimates the battery lifetime for different charge/discharge profiles. The fuel consumption model and the battery model are tested and perform as intended. In order to combine the fuel consumption model and the battery model, a power management system is developed. This power management system uses binary logic to optimise the system performance. The set-points of the power management system are tuned in an iterative way. Due to a structured simulation approach the simulation results can be converted to trend lines. These trend lines enable the determination of the optimal battery capacity with respect to reduction of fuel consumption, reduction of running hours, investment cost and battery lifetime. The optimal capacity for the battery is 4516 𝑘𝑊ℎ. With this battery the system is not cost effective. However, technical feasibility is proven and fuel consumption is reduced. A yearly fuel reduction of 75 ton HFO and 142 ton MDO is achieved. This results in a reduction of carbon dioxide of 687 ton annually. With this system every ton of carbon dioxide reduction will cost Van Oord €575. The performance of the hybrid system can be improved by extending the battery lifetime. This is done by adjusting the power management settings according to the actual residual battery capacity. This method reduces the cost per ton carbon dioxide reduction to €128. Furthermore the effect of running on MDO instead of HFO is investigated, this results in a marginal improvement in cost perspective. Every ton of carbon dioxide reduction will cost €554. The actual annual carbon dioxide reduction will not change. Unfortunately the proposed hybrid system will only reduce carbon dioxide emission in a cost effective way when the HFO price rises to €700 per ton and the battery price per 𝑘𝑊ℎ halves. In combination with a Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) fuelled power plant the hybrid system can be used. It is proven that energy demand can be stored in and provided by a battery with a reasonable size. Due to the response of a gas engine the battery is not an extra any more, but it becomes a necessity.","hybrid; dredging; battery modeling; diesel engines; transient operation; peak shaving","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Ship Design, Production and Operations","",""

(mentor)","2016","Over exploitation of fossil fuels and ill effect of global warming have forced human civilisation in search of new sustainable energy resources. Renewable energy resources like hydro, solar, wind , biomass etc., are environmental friendly energy resources. One such renewable energy resource is Wind Energy. The growth of offshore wind farms is increasing, with it the problems associated with electrical generation. Harmonics is one such problem faced by the Offshore Wind Power System. Harmonics are injected into the power system primarily through power electronic converters and are amplified by harmonic resonances in the power system. It is of utmost importance to provide harmonic pollution less voltage to the customers. Harmonic mitigation structures are used to mitigate harmonic frequencies. Passive filter is one such and major harmonic frequency mitigation structure. This thesis deals with optimization of passive filters in a wind power plant. The objective of the thesis is to analyse harmonics that are present in the wind power system, design passive filters to eliminate or control the harmonic distortions and optimize these filters on various and possible parameters. A test case system Anholt Offshore Wind Farm was taken into consideration and the wind power system was modelled in MATLAB Simulink. The harmonics present in the system was analysed. LCL filter was designed at wind turbine level to mitigate harmonic frequencies and optimization of LCL filter components on factors like attenuation factor, acceptable total and individual voltage and current harmonic distortion, fundamental frequency losses and reactive power capability was conducted. The optimum LCL filter parameters was found out to give acceptable total harmonic distortion of voltage waveform dictated by IEC standards. Further second order high pass filter, third order high pass filter, C-Type filter, Switching frequency trap filter, C-Type with switching frequency trap filter and resonance trap filter were designed and modelled in the simulation platform. Optimization of all these filters was conducted based on quality factor, acceptable total and individual voltage harmonic distortion dictated by IEC standards, fundamental frequency losses and reactive power capability. The results of the optimized filter was tabulated an it was found that C-Type filter with switching frequency trap filter gave the optimum results. At wind farm level reactive power compensation was established, harmonic distortion monitoring and harmonic resonance monitoring was done, and the result show that C-Type with witching frequency trap filter gave the optimum results. It can also be seen that different passive filters operate more efficiently at different harmonic frequency ranges.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","Erasmus Mundus, European Wind Energy Master (EWEM)","",""

(mentor); Illiberi, A. (mentor)","2016","Achieving high efficiency solar cells becomes more interesting in order to make solar cell become cost competitive to the other renewable energy sources. Transparent conductive oxide (TCO) which has a requirement to be chemically stable, high transparency and high conductivity, and also application for light trapping application makes it important to be developed. TCO that are commonly used for thin film solar cell has a similar problem, which is high absorption in the near infra-red (NIR) region. Recently, hydrogenated indium oxide (IO:H) has been developed and gained more attention due to the possibility to obtain high mobility with low absorption from visible to NIR region. Therefore the objective of this thesis is the development of high mobility IO:H TCO for thin film solar cells application. Several parameters have been adjusted in the development of IO:H such as partial pressure of water vapor, thickness, annealing temperature and power. Introduction of water vapor during the deposition suppresses the growth of In2O3 crystal and make the layer amorphous. Deposition amorphous layer is important to achieve high mobility due to the possibility of defects clustering (oxygen vacancies and indium vacancies) during the annealing. Another important role of water vapor is as the source of hydrogen atoms which could passivate the defects inside IO:H layers. IO:H with mobility of around 150 cm2/Vs and sheet resistance of 28 (thickness of 100nm) has been developed. By increasing the thickness of IO:H layer, the sheet resistance could be decreased until 12.5 at 400nm thickness with maintaining mobility of 120 cm2/Vs. Application of IO:H as TCO in thin film solar cells need to be optimized further. CIGS solar cell with IO:H on top of it indicates a lower efficiency (11.92 %) compared to CIGS with AZO (15.05 %). The loss in CIGS solar cell with IO:H on top of it mainly caused by the drop in the VOC and FF of the solar cell. Meanwhile, the a-Si solar cell with IO:H indicates a better efficiency (5.71 %) compared to cell with AZO (5.34%). It gain higher VOC and JSC but loose in FF. In general the solar cell with IO:H as TCO layer indicates lower FF and higher JSC¬ compared to solar cell with AZO.","TCO; Hydrogenated; Indium Oxide","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Peters, D.J. (mentor); van Es, S.H.J. (mentor); Everts, H.J. (mentor)","2016","Even though for most hydraulic and geotechnical structures clear guidelines are available, those for flexible dolphins are still missing. Consequently, whether a design is safe is usually subject of debate. Economical dolphin piles are large diameter tubular piles, susceptible to local buckling. After installation the embedded part of these piles remains predominantly filled with soil. The aim of this research is to provide understanding of the effects concerning local buckling and therewith to contribute to the discussion whether a dolphin design is safe. The main research question is: Does the soil in dolphin piles contribute to the local buckling resistance and can this be used in the design of these piles? Gresnigt (1986) prescribes a strain based method to check a pile on local buckling. This method is incorporated in EN 1993-4-3 (2009). The resistance against local buckling depends on the slenderness ratio De/(tε2) . Also, ovalisation influences the resistance. The presence of a soil plug reduces the ovalisation, enhancing the local buckling resistance. An analytical method is proposed in which beam theory is used to determine the dolphin pile deformation and loads on the pile. Literature provides equations to calculate the ovalisation that can be applied in three distinct parts: above the bed level, between the bed level and plug level and below the plug level. The provided equations however, show inconsistencies at the transitions. It is proposed to apply beam theory on the pile wall, modelled as a linear beam with springs providing resistance against ovalisation. Above the plug level, the resistance is provided by the ring behaviour of the shell. Below the plug level, the stiffness is increased with the stiffness of the soil plug. The model overcomes the inconsistencies in ovalisation. The method assumes the stiffness of the plug in the pile can be approximated. However, it is concluded that the suggested stiffness in CUR 211E (2013) is not able to determine the plug stiffness for semi-filled piles. Key parameters that affect the local buckling resistance are identified. These are the plug packing, plug level, slenderness ratio and the soil packing. The influence of these key parameters are studied with the finite element program Abaqus. The parametric study proves that the soil in dolphin piles contributes to the local buckling resistance. A denser packing of the plug improves the capacities of the bending moment and lateral load. Most of all, the dolphin can dissipate more energy. The plug level influences the level at which local buckling is observed, as well as whether an inward or outward buckle occur. The contribution of the inner soil on the local buckling resistance can be compensated by designing a more slender dolphin pile. A more slender cross-section reduces the capacities of the pile. The packing of the outer soil also influences the buckling level and shape. Furthermore, a looser soil packing improves the energy capacity of the dolphin pile. To obtain a dolphin pile that optimises the improvements on the local buckling resistance by the inner and surrounding soil, an installation method is used that does not compact the soil and plug packing and after installation, the plug packing is compacted. With the Abaqus analyses the stiffness of the soil plug is studied. It reveals that the plug is stiffer at deeper levels. For a pile with a diameter comparable to 914mm, when the predicted ovalisation for that pile without a soil plug is less than 8 mm, a plug stiffness of 30,000 kN/m2 can be assumed in the proposed analytical method, regardless of the plug packing. The stiffness is independent of the slenderness ratio. The Port of Rotterdam facilitated a full scale field test with eight piles. The Abaqus model shows reasonable comparison with the field test. The observed local buckling behaviour piles that were not modelled can well be explained with the results of the parametric study.","dolphin; pile; local; buckling; soil; fill","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Hydraulic Structures","",""

(mentor)","2016","Voltage drop and rise at network peak and off-peak periods are one of the major power quality problems in low voltage distribution networks. Additionally, the ever increasing demand for electricity along with the other requirements are driving modern day power systems towards more distributed generation (DG). Integration of large scale DG can be limited by these voltage variations. Therefore, it is of high interest to investigate the voltage support strategies that are able to successfully mitigate these problems. One of the solutions is to use energy storage systems (ESS). On the one hand limited amount of energy storage might not have the desired impact. On the other hand it is not possible to install large amount of energy storage as this would increase the costs substantially. Therefore it is required to optimally place and size energy storage. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the optimal placement and sizing of battery energy storage with the integration of renewable energy sources (RES) in a low voltage distribution network. An optimization model has been developed in order to identify the potential battery size and location combinations that increase the RES hosting capacity of the distribution network. The optimization tool used for this problem is the Genetic Algorithm (GA). Among the most important features of this algorithm stands its robustness and ability to provide good results in optimization processes. The functionality and the performance of the developed model is assessed using an IEEE benchmark network that has shown to be adequate for both the dynamic and steady-state analysis. The results of this work show that the voltage problems caused by the integration of RES can be mitigated by optimal placement and sizing of battery energy storage. They also show that besides the the voltage profile improvement reduction of losses can be achieved.","distribution network; low voltage; distributed generation; reverse power flow; voltage rise; voltage support; battery energy storage systems (BESS); genetic algorithm (GA)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","Erasmus Mundus, European Wind Energy Master (EWEM)","",""

Measurements of the HC behavior were analyzed in the frequency domain by estimating the parameters of a quasi-linear model and compared to the distributions and means of the gaze data. The model fits accurately to the measurement data, therefore its validity is extended to occlusion scenarios. We suggest that internal processing of the target signal is performed by HCs, allowing them to respond to the signal inside the occlusion region by interpolating the last available position of the target preview. Results show a correlation between foveal gaze position and identified near-viewpoint locations, while the far-viewpoint is perceived peripherally by the HC.

(mentor); Pasman, G.J. (mentor); van Opbergen, L. (mentor)","2016","Financial pressures in the airline industry have forced KLM to change their strategic direction. Using the Treacy & Wiersema (1993) model KLM’s new focus is on customer intimacy. This implies researching customer needs and designing from a user-centered perspective. Which are fueled by the change in the consumer landscape, namely digital darwinism and demand for contextualization. Looking at the digital content send along a customer’s journey and how to contextualize this is the starting point of this thesis. An extensive customer, trend and company analysis (including context mapping and interviews at the x-gates) led to four areas of interest. Mainly reassurance and stress relief is sought in situations where white wingers experience that digital content isn’t sufficient. Each channel distributes content in a different manner, causing confusion for the passenger instead of creating an omnichannel-like experience. In general, the need for content differs throughout the phases of the customer journey, but still can be regarded as satisfactory until a flight schedule is disrupted. During disruptions most passengers experience more stress and seek guidance. The research highlighted disruptions as an area of interest where KLM can offer more content fitting to a passenger’s situation. Disruptions happen quite frequently in the airline industry, and come across in all sizes and variations. A disruption can be seen as anything that alters the planning of a passenger, this can for instance be a seat change or a cancellation of the entire aircraft. Unfortunately, lots of causes for disruptions are out of KLM’s control (e.g. weather conditions), meaning that disruptions will always occur. Keeping customer intimacy in mind, disruptions are highly relatable to customer satisfaction (NPS) and are the cause for most complaints. Each change in flight schedule is subjective; for some passengers a disruption can have great impact on their travels, while for others it does not bother them that much. This makes it highly appropriate for contextualization of content. Currently, the handling of disruptions resulted in generic push notifications as the only form of communication towards a passenger. Often leaving passengers stressed, confused and unsatisfied. De Matos, Rossi and Henrique (2007) discussed the service recovery paradox, suggesting that it is normal that customer satisfaction decreases when a disruption is experienced, but can be increased (even above the default-level) if the appropriate service recovery is in place. According to Kau and Loh (2006) customer satisfaction can be increased with a service recovery if the service is perceived as just. This correlation suggests a focus on interactional, distributive and procedural justice. Therefore, the analysis and more in depth focus on disruption handling ends, but introduces the ideation phase in which solutions for these problems are sought. Using brainwriting in groups and a future workshop as co-creation techniques resulted in a storyboard of a desired situation. Eventually forming the new service recovery experience; Care+. Care+ uses a conversational UI to communicate with a passenger and helps the passenger with any type of disruption he is coping with. Creating this cross-channel point of reference allows the passenger to have one conversation with KLM, forming a seamless omnichannel experience on which the desired content is received. Next to informing the passenger, extra features are offered as a form of compensation. For this content to adapt and be tailored to the moment the passenger is experiencing a lot of data needs processing. This data is needed to identify the passenger and its moment. Here lots of backend bottlenecks are encountered, and different enablers are needed for each moment. Only with these enablers in place can a good service recovery be delivered for different disruptions. This thesis contains a design proposal (namely Care+) as just described, but also focusses on the steps that KLM needs to undertake at the backend. Suggesting a Care+ API to connect and recognize different data patterns. The feasibility of these enablers are discussed in the implementation plan. Using a high-level digital wireframe, a simulation of Care+ was tested with participants at the X-gates. It showed high user acceptance and potential, but the real challenges still remain at the functionality. If Care+ can provide solutions with real-time data as quickly as the simulation, a great gap regarding customer satisfaction can be filled. This thesis has hopefully drawn KLM’s attention enough towards the bottleneck that is disruptions, and have encouraged them on building certain enablers.","Disruptions; Service Recovery; KLM; Contextual; Omnichannel; Conversational UI","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design / Design Conceptualisation & Communication (DCC)","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); de Bruijn, E. (mentor)","2016","Additive manufacturing (AM) is a manufacturing method with two distinct advantages over traditional subtractive methods. First, it allows for much higher form freedom, allowing for shapes that are unobtainable by conventional techniques. Second, this method is also referred to 'rapid prototyping' given the fact that objects, and mainly prototype iterations, may be produced in a matter of hours instead of days. Fused deposition modelling (FDM) is the most ubiquitous and accessible AM technology, relying on the layer-by-layer deposition of molten thermoplastics. While FDM is very accessible and shows great potential as a future manufacturing technique, it is still inferior to traditional techniques due to the very low production capacity and limited speed. Print speed is mainly limited by volumetric ow rate through the nozzle, of which the counter pressure at high velocity causes filament slip in the extrusion mechanism. Therefore, the goals of this thesis are (1) to design an accurate extruder model to describe input-output behaviour of feed velocity. This may yield better understanding of FDM extrusion and form a basis for model-based design. (2) The synthesis of an anti-slip controller allowing for high print speed while retaining object quality. When a higher print speed could be attained, one of the largest disadvantages of FDM would be mitigated and a new step is made towards industrial application of this technology. To make the model of the extruder, the only known velocity input-output model available was taken and verified. This black-box transfer function model accurately describes low-speed behaviour of the extruder. This model, however, did not incorporate slip phenomena, making it an inaccurate model at high volume flow. Hence, a model from the automotive industry, also known as the 'Magic Formula' was combined with this known transfer function, producing a new black-box model covering all feed velocities. This new model has opportunity to be used as a basis for model-based design of 3D printers, which are now generally designed based on past experience and trial-and-error. For the future, it would be highly interesting to find an analytical model rather than a transfer-based one in order to gain physical understanding in the influence of extruder parameters. Regarding the synthesis of an anti-slip controller, we implemented a type of extremum seeking hybrid control which essentially finds an feasible maximum velocity for a limited amount of slip. The logic of the controller was based on Schmitt trigger logic, defining three control parameters that together define the switching behaviour of the controller. After tuning, if was found that the controller improved extrusion errors as well as completion time compared to open-loop control, achieving the set goals. The successful application of such a controller could mitigate the low velocity disadvantages of FDM and facilitate the acceptance of this technology. In the future, it is recommended to further investigate the practical applications of the controller, find the limitations of the controller in real printing and explore different control architectures.","Additive manufacturing; 3D printing; fused deposition modelling; high speed; slip control; extremum seeking control; slip modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomechanical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Climate change is an important problem nowadays. There are several industries causing this problem. One of them is the air transport industry. In order to reduce its induced climate impact there are different approaches: design of new aircrafts or engines, use of alternative fuels, more efficient air traffic management, or re-routing. All of them except re-routing aim on reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Re-routing, on the other hand, aims on reducing the climate impact of non-CO2 emissions (that considerably alter their climate impact depending on the region of the atmosphere where they are released) by increasing slightly the carbon dioxide emissions. This study focuses on this last approach. It establishes an analysis of the results obtained within the REACT4C project (Reducing Emissions from Aviation by Changing Trajectories for the benefit of Climate). The project aims to reduce aircraft induced climate impact in the North Atlantic flight corridor by changes in flight trajectories and considers fleets of around 400 aircraft. Moreover, this project considers eight different weather patterns (three for summer and five for winter), two flight directions (westbound and eastbound), and three climate metrics. Therefore, a total of 48 configurations have to be studied. Moreover it considers six different climate parameters causing the total climate impact. The climate parameters are carbon dioxide, water vapor, contrails, and NOx. The NOx climate impact is obtained as the summation of ozone, methane, and primary mode ozone climate impacts. The results that are analyzed are the climate impact caused by each of the climate parameters and how this climate impact changes when applying gradual changes on the aircraft trajectories. The analysis shows that water vapor has a negligible effect on climate impact. Carbon dioxide climate impact is more relevant when considering long term time horizons. Also, it increases when more trajectories are modified since the fuel consumption increases. Contrails are the main driver of the optimization for seven out of eight weather patterns. Their climate impact goes down during the optimization. Moreover, they are more important when considering short term time horizons and westbound flights. NOx is driving the optimization for only one weather pattern. Its contribution to reduce the total climate impact during the optimization is higher in the long term due to the enhanced net-cooling effect caused by methane depletion. Moreover, it is more important for eastbound flights. However, for winter weather patterns, NOx is controlled mainly by methane and primary mode ozone during most part of the optimization. Ozone is only important in the first and last segments. In addition, ozone presents the highest values of climate impact and has more contribution in the short term; while methane has always a negative climate impact or net-cooling effect due to its depletion, and is more important in the long term. The climate impact reduction is caused in the first part of the optimization by a small number of flights that reduce considerably their climate impact. Their trajectories change to go through regions of the atmosphere where their climate impact is smaller. As the optimization progresses, there are more flights modifying their routes. However, their climate impact reduction is not as noticeable as in the first cases. This happens because the regions of the atmosphere where the emissions have a lower climate impact are busier with the prior flights. Therefore the latter flights changing their trajectories have less potential to reduce their climate impact. This leads to a small part of the fleet causing an important climate impact reduction while the vast majority of flights slightly reduce their climate impact.","Climate impact; eco-friendly re-routing; REACT4C project; North Atlantic flight corridor; Climate Cost Functions; aircraft routing; aircraft emissions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operations","","Aircraft Noise and Climate Effects (ANCE)","",""

(mentor)","2016","REACT4C is a project that received European funding to investigate whether air traffic across the North Atlantic Ocean can be rerouted such that the resulting climate impact is reduced. The project considered 400 daily flights in each direction. Eight frequently occurring weather situations were identified, based on the strength and location of the jet stream between North America and Europe. It was found that the climate impact could be reduced to a large extent, although the impact reduction potential heavily depends on the direction of flight, the weather pattern under consideration, the climate metric used to quantify climate impact, and the relative importance of climate impact and economic cost during the optimization. The way in which climate-optimal trajectories compare to their cost-optimal counterparts, is still largely unknown. This research examines how the routes are affected by the climate optimization. Two kinds of studies are performed. The first one is a case study, in which the trajectories of one combination of direction, climate metric, weather type and level of climate optimization are compared with the cost- optimal routes. The influence of each of these four case differentiators on the flights is examined as well, using a one-factor-at-a-time approach. A tool is made that can be used to analyze the trajectories of any combination of flight direction, climate metric, weather pattern and level of climate optimization. The second study is a general analysis of the REACT4C routes, taking into account all combinations of the four case differentiators. This study is conducted to unravel general trends in the way direction, metric, weather and level of climate optimization influence the way in which flights are rerouted. The following characteristics are used to quantify how routes are altered. First, the percentage of affected flights is determined. Then, the flight duration and flight distance increments with respect to the cost-optimized flights are computed. Furthermore, the shift in latitude and altitude is also considered. Finally, frequently occurring rerouting schemes are identified, and the percentage of flights belonging to each scheme is determined. It was found in both the case study and the general analysis that the way in which climate-optimized routes compare to their cost-optimized counterparts, highly depends on the direction of flight, the weather pattern and the relative importance of economic cost and climate impact during the optimization. However, the choice of climate metric proved to have hardly any influence on the rerouting strategies. Because of the substantial cross-case differences, the preferred strategy to investigate rerouting characteristics is by making use of the case analysis tool that was created. Nonetheless, the general study unravelled some general trends. The trajectories in general are altered such that the flight duration and flight distance are increased, and the cruise altitude is lowered. Furthermore, generally there are more shifts towards the south than there are towards the north. Increasing the level of climate optimization is shown to result into more extreme route alterations. Flights towards Europe are in general more often north of the original routes than in westbound direction. The climate metric used during the optimization has little to no influence on the way the routes are changed. Finally, no trends in trajectory alterations are distinguishable between the eight weather patterns.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operations","","Aircraft Noise & Climate Effects (ANCE)","",""

In this thesis, several RF circuits designed using commercial CMOS technology have been shown to be working at cryogenic temperatures. Such circuits could be easily interfaced (or integrated, in the future) with a qubit processor. The performance of the circuits is comparable to the state-of-the-art systems, currently used as control units for qubits.

Behavioral studies have demostrated that cognitive processes such as the generation of expectancy have an effect on the preparation of voluntary movements. These experiments involve motor preparation paradigms in which reaction times (RTs) decrease with the expectancy induced within a variable foreperiod (FP, time between a cue and a movement imperative signal). This behavior is believed to be related to facilitated neural activity in the corticospinal (CS) pathways of the prime mover muscles. In this study, expectancy was dynamically induced by the position and temporal probability of the response -imperative- signal (RS). Simultaneously, CS excitability was assessed by the measurement of the stretch reflex responses (SRs). Results confirmed that RTs decrease with increasing RS time-probability. Similarly, the SRs areas were also effected by the time-probability of the RS. The short latency response showed gradual increase according to RS features, while areas of the long latency response showed an abrupt increment at the time of highest probability. These findings suggest distinct mechanisms of regulation of the short and long latency responses.

(mentor); Sciacchitano, A. (mentor)","2016","The world and the energy landscape are changing at a great pace. The population is increasing, generating a higher demand for resources, new markets are emerging and Aviation Regulation is driving requirements for clean power and low emissions. Therefore, gas manufacturers are committed to reduce the specific fuel consumption by increasing the Turbine Inlet Temperature (TIT), which in turn allows to reach a high thermal efficiency. Nevertheless, the turbine blade materials have limitations in the maximum temperature due to failure, durability and structural problems. Film cooling is one of the cooling systems employed to protect the blade metallic surface and allow an operating temperature above the melting point of the materials. Air is extracted from the compressor and injected as a protective film on the blade to defend the exterior from the hot gas mixture. However, blowing air around the blade affects its aerodynamic performances. The objective of the present research is to investigate the influence of film cooling on the aerodynamics losses by testing an airfoil in the M-Tunnel of Delft University of Technology, thanks to pressure measurements and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). Experiments are performed on a NACA0012 test model with air injection from four rows of holes located on the suction side at 5%, 10%, 15% and 50% of the chord length from the leading edge. The effect of the blowing ratio on the losses is analysed on a baseline case with a free stream velocity equal to 15 m/s, an angle of attack of zero degrees, and Reynolds Number equal to 1.2 x 10^5. In addition, further experiments are conducted using different configurations of angles of attack, free-stream velocities and sealing some rows of holes. The measured losses include contributions due to flow separations, viscous effects within boundary layers and shear augmentation in wakes. Furthermore, mixing processes in wakes and boundary layers as well as the generation, growth, and mixing of vortices are taken into account. Pressure measurements are used to derive the velocity and loss profiles in the wake at 1.3 chord length distance from the leading edge. The loss profiles are symmetric for the baseline case without blowing, and the maximum losses are positioned exactly behind the trailing edge. The losses introduced by film cooling increase till blowing ratio B=0.48 and the wake is shifted to the suction side. In contrast, losses are diminished from B=0.64 to B=1.91. This trend is observed for all the experimental cases. The low momentum of the coolant at small injection rates creates high shear regions which increase mixing losses due to viscous effects. At high values of blowing ratio, the injected air has a high momentum in the direction of the flow, which fills the low momentum regions in the wake, thereby reducing losses. Mean velocity flow fields around the airfoil are presented, as a result of the PIV analysis. Low velocity areas are visible in the wake at low blowing ratios, whereas large blowing ratios create high velocity regions. Considerations about flow separation are concluded from the velocity flow fields, and the velocity fluctuations are shown as indicators of the level of turbulence. The flow is less prone to separate at high blowing ratio since it is energized and more resistant to the adverse pressure gradient. Nonetheless, large amounts of coolant entail great fluctuations near the cooling holes, which could potentially lead to unsteady loads. Furthermore, a numerical approach of the Poisson equation is implemented to reconstruct the static pressure field from PIV data. Lastly, a good agreement between the results of pressure measurements and PIV is observed thanks to qualitative and quantitative comparisons.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-10-28","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & Propulsion","","Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

This work is originated from the need to develop a tool that integrates the cycle design to a more detailed turbomachinery design. The results of the cycle design confirm its high thermodynamic efficiency and allow to calculate the mass flow needed to match the desired power output. Then, a preliminary and mean line design integrated code is developed for compressors and expanders. The preliminary design is based on the Baljé diagrams and it allows to estimate the number of stages and the diameter recommended to achieve the optimum efficiency. The mean line design provides a more advanced sizing and performance estimation, that is based on traditional relations as well as on the most recently improved correlations available in literature for supercritical fluids. The models are validated with the results of designs found in literature and with the few experimental data available. The methodology developed is applied to a case study: the Brayton recompression cycle is compared to the Rankine cycle in the solar thermal power plant PS10, a 11 MW solar tower located near Seville, Spain.

(mentor)","2016","The importance of aeroelastic tailoring is increasing continuously as the aircraft wings become more and more flexible. Incorporating aeroelastic considerations in the early part of the design process has a lot of benefits. But these require significant computational resources if accurate predictions are needed. This is more relevant these days when most of the commercial aircraft operate in the transonic regime. To predict the flow phenomena that occur at such conditions, accurate CFD results are needed. These can be computationally expensive in the early stages of design. To overcome these restrictions, various multi-fidelity approaches are gaining wide acceptance. These methods include a low-fidelity model that does bulk of the work and a high-fidelity model that provides corrections that fill in the deficiencies in the low-fidelity model. The aim is to achieve a high-fidelity result without performing as many high-fidelity computations. These become even more attractive in the context of aeroelastic tailoring as in an optimization routine performing a high-fidelity analysis is infeasible. For this thesis, a defect-correction based multi-fidelity approach has been implemented in an aeroelastic tailoring routine. The Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) was used as the low-fidelity model and SU2 was used as the high-fidelity compressible solver. The designs from the multi-fidelity approach have been compared with the corresponding ones obtained from a purely low-fidelity optimization. To correlate the effects of compressibility with the difference in design, this study was performed at 3 flow speeds; low-subsonic, high-subsonic and transonic. The results for both the subsonic cases are on expected lines, where both the designs closely resemble each other. The designs at transonic speeds show an intersting behavior where the multi-fidelity design is slightly heavier than the low-fidelity design. This was seen to be primarily due to the difference in the aerodynamic torsional moments in the two models due to the presence of a shockwave which was captured by the high-fidelity model. Based on these findings, certain conclusions have been made and recommendations for future work have been provided.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures and Materials","","","",""

The way the tool integrates selection criteria and presents patient data enables both the patient and the medical professional to see whether the patient meets with the selection criteria, hence facilitates finding the best treatment for that individual patient. The application also generates better overview on responsibilities and the progress by providing timely information on the tasks, which should be completed.

(mentor)","2016","This thesis describes the development of Voogel, a collection of bird masks with which children can experience a bird’s vision with their human eyes. Recent research showed that word of mouth marketing has lately been the most effective way of marketing for Avifauna and not other marketing programs they conduct, like flyers and posters. The goal of this project was to find out what and in which way visitors tell about their experiences at the park, with the purpose of stimulating the word of mouth marketing of Avifauna. The focus lays on their largest target group: parents with children. Avifauna has different main objectives: preservation of the park and of biodiversity, education, conservation, providing bird shelter and scientific research. Although entertainment is not seen as the main goal, visitors want to be entertained when they visit Avifauna. This is not only the case for Avifauna but for most zoos. The visitors want to interact with the animals and see them active. This is entertainment for them but it can conflict with the welfare of the animals. Still, the visitors need entertainment because the park needs revenues from the ticket sales to be able to work on their main objectives. Most people do not seem to have a realistic image of birds, this was the outcome of a survey that was done during the analysis phase. The opinion of the respondents of the survey was often based on how birds are represented in the media and how they are referred to in sayings. It is the job of the zoos to educate their visitors. Therefore Avifauna can help giving a more realistic representation of birds and help to change the prejudices, especially the negative ones. As explained before education should also be entertaining; the reason why visitors come to Avifauna. Interviews during the analysis showed that parents go to Avifauna because their children enjoy it. They love to tell about the reaction of their children during specific moments, especially about the expressions on their children’s face. These were often moments that were a bit scary for the children, because it was new for them. Seeing these different kind of emotions on their faces was something the parents loved to talk about. To get parents to talk about their experience in the park the design goal is to create an adventurous experience for the children, that shows them the fascinating and realistic image of birds and result in enthusiasm by the children. As a result the parents want to share this experience with others in a tangible way. The design needs to evoke curiosity, which evolves into fascination and astonishment during the experience by the children and results in enthusiasm that can be seen by the parents. This resulted in Voogel, a collection of bird masks that let children experience how birds can see. The bird masks let the children experience the visual capacities of a duck, an eagle and an owl, each with their own mask. The masks have a realistic look so the birds can be recognized. A fairy tale twist will trigger the fantasy of the children and make the masks more attractive for a picture. Birds have different visual capacities than humans and can see more. Putting on the mask will give the children a feeling of this difference. The user will be fascinated by what a bird is able to see. This is done by using special lenses and mirrors. Because the depth perception of the user is altered when wearing the mask the user can feel a bit disoriented. This makes it more exciting, because they have to be careful when walking. The masks are located at a special Avifauna cart where educational elements are represented. A volunteer will guide the user by telling them about the birds’ views and giving them small assignments. These assignments will help the child to get more into the role of a bird. The mask is combined with an optical illusion of 3D nest on the ground. The children are asked to find their nest, this will stimulate the walking which let them experience the differences in depth perception. This will also stimulate the photographing by the parents. The parents will often and easily share a picture with family and friends, especially if it is a cute picture of their child combined that also shows where they are and what they are doing. Testing the prototype of the duck mask with the target group showed the potential of this product. The children reacted enthusiastically and the parents took a lot of pictures. Still, some elements have to be improved. For example the information given should be made more interesting. It is expected that improving this point will increase the experience even more.","Experience; Zoo; children; adventure; birds","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2016","Mobile robots need to interact with their environment to perform their tasks. To be successful they often need to know what their surrounding looks like, and where they are located in that surrounding. The act of simultaneously estimating both the state of the robot and the state of the environment is called Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM). The SLAM problem has been intensively researched since it is one of the key prerequisites for correct functioning of mobile robots. Popular mapping algorithms use Kalman or particle filters to describe the robot state and the environment with probability distributions. When the mapped environment becomes larger these algorithms need more computational resources and have trouble recognizing known locations. This is mostly because the stored map becomes too large to process and the uncertainties have become too big to properly be described or used in the SLAM framework. This work proposes a Hybrid Metric-Topological (HMT) mapping method to solve problems regarding place recognition and computational resources commonly experienced when mapping large environments. The framework will create local maps using a particle filter and connect the local maps in a graph constrained with edges. The local environment is mapped accurately, while the relative uncertainties are stored in the edges. In this work the devised framework is called ""Forced Resampling hybrid Metric-Topological Mapping"" or FoRMeT Mapping. It is characterized by being an approximate solution to the SLAM problem that makes justifiable assumptions to be a lightweight HMT framework. The biggest innovation is the forced resampling strategy which allows the particle filter ambiguity to be stored in the last two visited local maps, while keeping all other maps in a shared topology. An implementation of the framework is devised in C++ with ROS (Robot Operating System) and tested on a real world environment containing a large loop, and a simulated large scale environment. The same experiments are also performed with the commonly acknowledged mapping algorithm ""GMapping"" for comparison. FoRMeT Mapping outperforms GMapping on all performance criteria. FoRMeT uses about 3 times less computational resources for each task and the local areas look as good as GMapping’s local areas, with exceptions around the loop closure areas where FoRMeT looks better with less discrepancies. It can be concluded that FoRMeT can close large loops, map large environments and outperform GMapping while remaining a lightweight SLAM framework.","SLAM; HMT; Mapping; Localization; Robot; Particle Filter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-10-28","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC)","","Systems & Control","",""

Further, to enable the scalability of quantum computers reducing the huge amount of interconnections that are nowadays needed to perform quantum computation, classical electronics must be placed close to the quantum processor at cryogenic temperatures (4 K). To address this, firstly a compact model for simulation of CMOS at cryogenic temperature is proposed and secondly a CMOS Low-Noise Amplifier (LNA) is designed and tested at liquid Helium temperature (4 K). The cryoLNA is the first in this technology and will be employed in the RF electronic readout of spin qubit, replacing the existing discrete amplifier used in state-of-the-art experimental setup.

(mentor)","2016","Osteoarthritis is a degenerative disease of the joints that reduces physical function and leads to chronic pain. It occurs mostly in persons from an age of 50 years of older and can be considered a disease of the aging population. Although there is no clear evidence of its effects, induced hyperthermia is sometimes prescribed to these patients with the aim of relieving the symptoms. It is hypothesized that mild hyperthermia has a direct effect on cartilage tissue, linked to the upregulation of Heat shock protein 70. This exploratory study evaluated the effects of heat on cartilage regarding possible regeneration and anti-inflammatory properties, as well as investigating two possible mechanisms to generate heat – applying High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) and using Rotational Field Quantum Magnetic Resonance (also known as the Cytotron). It was found that mild hyperthermia up to 45°C and lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation upregulate Hsp70 production on cartilage explants. The Cytotron machine did not induce hyperthermia, but its effects on cartilage tissue were similar to the effects of mild hyperthermia. Both treatments increased Hsp70 production and appear to stimulate the synthesis of proteoglycans, a molecule that is important in building healthy cartilage tissue. The HIFU protocol was effective at rising the temperature on a horse fetlock joint, but on a simplified setting the variability on the generated temperature was too high to recommend using it in the clinic. Both mild induced hyperthermia and the Cytotron machine show promise and should be further investigated as possible additional treatments against osteoarthritis.","hyperthermia; cartilage; regeneration; Hsp70; HIFU; Cytotron; heat; ultrasound","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomechanical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Selective laser melting (SLM) is an additive manufacturing (AM) technique that is used for metallic products. These products are built in a layer by layer manner by means of selectively melting and hence fusing a layer of metal powder with a laser scanning along a predefined path. The SLM process is able to create products with complex geometries, high accuracy, and within a single manufacturing step. Although SLM presents a number of advantages, the thermal loading causing residual stresses and distortions is an important issue in SLM products. Residual stresses may lead to a limited load resistance and cracks leading to impaired toughness. Distortions may cause the SLM product to be manufactured outside of design tolerances. Therefore, for an SLM product it is essential to accurately predict residual stresses and distortion in the design phase. In literature a great variety of modelling techniques are proposed to capture the physics of the process. Two most widely used approaches to model the process are the melting pool scale and the layer by layer modelling approach. The latter is a computationally efficient way of modelling but does not contain complex process history whereas the former is computationally expensive but can capture the effects of scanning strategy and other process parameters. In this thesis a novel modelling approach is presented which combines the advantages of modelling at the layer scale and the melting pool scale. The general idea is that, the source of strain, giving rise to residual stresses during the SLM process for a given scanning strategy is reconstructed from a detailed simulation and mapped onto a layer. In order to do this the eigenstrain reconstruction method (ERM) is utilised. In this method an equivalent strain source is reconstructed for a residual stress field. The reconstructed equivalent strain source or eigenstrain can be used as a building block to describe the strain source for an entire layer or product. By defining the strain source for an entire product, the residual stresses in the product can be predicted directly. The novelty of the work presented in this thesis lies in the way the residual stress field is predicted. In literature the residual stress field caused by the SLM process is directly mapped to a layer or product. In this approach it is not the stress field that is mapped to the layer or product but the strain source. The advantage of this idea is that the resulting residual stress fields fromthe strain source are continuous in the SLMproduct. Although the ERM is widely used to model 1D and 2D residual stress fields for welding and peening processes, so far no fully 3D ERM has been implemented. In real SLM products the residual stress fields are always multi-axial. Therefore, it is necessary to extend ERMto 3D which is capable of dealing with the multidimensionality of the residual stress fields. One of the requirements of ERMis the input of a reference residual stress field. Therefore an expensive numerical reference model is developed which includes the effect of scanning strategy on the residual stress and warpage of a SLMproduct. The ERM model developed in this thesis is validated by reconstructing the residual stress fields for three geometries; a line, layer and ten layer geometry. The residual stress distributions calculated by the eigenstrain are compared with the results of the expensive numerical reference model. In this model the scanning strategy is incorporated by a point by point modelling approach. The performance of ERM is evaluated by calculating the corresponding residual stress field error between reference and ERM results, which lies within 0.5-4%. It is concluded that the ERMis a suitablemethod to reconstruct equivalent strain sources or eigenstrains for predicting 3D residual stress fields caused by the SLMprocess. The contribution to the field consists of an expansion of ERMto three dimensions and a hybrid model for the SLMprocess which combines the computational efficiency of the global approach with the detail of the local approach.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","The current automobile industry is undergoing a paradigm shift from the conventional internal combustion engines to electric vehicles. Electro mobility is a greener alternative compared to the conventional engines. But one of the negative factors for the demand of electric cars is the maximum range which they can offer in a single battery charge. To extend the maximum range of electric cars Micro Gas Turbines are used due to their small size, better performance and lower emission compared to their internal engine counterparts. The automobile industry as any other industry is governed by stringent emission norms and to adhere to these emission levels, Flameless Oxidation (FLOX) combustion technology is employed. In this kind of combustors FLOX type of combustion is achieved based on high internal flue gas recirculation that is driven by high momentum of the air and fuel jet entering the combustion chamber. By doing so the chemical reactions are delayed and the combustion is rather distributed over a large volume leading to lower peak temperatures and NOx emissions. This concept has been applied on conventional gas turbines however the application of this to a liquid fueled Micro Gas Turbine offers additional challenges which affects the physical processes of atomization, evaporation, fuel/air mixing etc. The objective of this thesis is to investigate these effects computationally and validate it against the experimental data measured at aDLR (German Aerospace Center) test facility to gain better understanding of the underlying physics. Experimental data are available for a model combustor at DLR Stuttgart on light heating oil. Spray characteristics have been measured which in this study are used for validation of the combination of CFD models for turbulence, combustion and dispersed liquid phase flow. CFD results for droplet size, velocity, volume flux are compared against the measurements and additionally temperature and other flow characteristics are computed that are not measured which helps in developing further insight into the combustion process inside the burner. Further additional CFD simulation is done with higher air preheat temperature to study its effect on the combustion process. For the validation study in this thesis, 3D steady state Reynolds-Averaged-Navier-Stokes (RANS) Eulerian- Lagrangian simulations are performed where gas phase computations are performed within Eulerian framework and dispersed phase is treated in Lagrangian framework. Two different combustion models are used: combined Eddy Dissipation and Finite Rate Chemistry (ED/FR) and Eddy Dissipation Concept (EDC). These combustion models are used with two different turbulence models of Reynolds StressModel and Shear Stress Transport turbulence models with various other models for modeling dispersed phase. It was observed that the combined ED/FRmodel predicted early spatial heat release leading to inaccurate droplet velocity predictions while EDCmodel predicted proper heat release leading to better prediction of velocity profiles. Further, the applicability of Flamelet approachwas investigated through FlameletGeneratedModel (FGM) and Steady FlameletModel (SFM). While SFM predicted combustion much upstream of the combustion chamber, FGM model predicted proper reaction zone. However, the FGM model predicted early spatial heat release due to the prediction of near equilibrium chemical time scales as the Damköhler number is close to unity. Further effects of turbulent two-way coupling are investigated and are found to be important. Radiation is found to have only a minor role in this case.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","The last decade the TU Delft underwent a tremendous growth. It is not only its growth but its increasing population as well. Thus, since the last years, new buildings and parking areas were built to host all its stakeholders. Due to this ongoing growth, and in an effort of the administration to establish its vision for a sustainable campus, its interest is focused to the parking stress that the TU Delft currently faces. More specifically, parking demand has been growing along with the increase of the university’s population. Although the effects of Parking Demand Management (PDM) on people’s behavior have already been the focus of many studies, its exact effects on the traveling and parking behavior on universities’ commuters remain unclear. What is more, most of the studies consider alternatives such as on-street, off-street parking, whereas in the specific study alternative ways of transport that lead in parking demand reduction were chosen to be investigated. The purpose of this study is to shed light in the effects of different Parking Demand Management strategies and apply them in the parking demand of the TU Delft. The framework that is developed in order to confront the increasing parking demand of the TU Delft includes two parts. The first part focuses on the identification of the current parking supply and demand, followed by an estimation of the future parking demand. An observation in the parking areas of the TU Delft campus and forecasting techniques are employed to define the current and future parking supply. The results of the first part show that currently the parking demand of the TU Delft is inside the acceptable boundaries (86,5% of the total parking supply). However, according to the observations, the distribution of the volume of the parking demand differs from the distribution of the parking supply. Consequently, parking areas with less than 85% of occupancy and parking areas exceeding the parking supply are observed. Concerning the future parking demand, the results foreshadow a large increase in future. It is expected that in 2020 the demand for parking in the TU Delft campus will exceed the supply by 17,5%. The second part, is dealing with the effects of the chosen Parking Demand Management (PDM) strategies in the commuters behavior. PDM is considered the application of different strategies and policies to reduce parking demand, or to redistribute it in space or time. To be able to identify the aforementioned effects on the commuters’ behavior, a stated choice experiment is employed. As expected parking cost attribute has the highest effect on commuters’ travelling and parking decisions. Furthermore, the calculation of the elasticities of all the attributes used in the stated choice experiment, confirms the hypothesis that the price incentivizes commuters in their travelling and parking choices. More specifically, every percentage increase of the parking price will result to approximately 1,5% of decrease in Drive Alone demand. As far as searching time is concerned, it is proved to be inelastic. Every percentage increase of searching time results to less than 0,5% decrease in the Drive Alone alternative, while every percentage increase of egress time results in 0,337% decrease of the same alternative. In order to transfer the aforementioned theoretical approaches to practical results, simulations with the estimated model are realized. The results of the simulations prove that Carpooling is more preferable than Park & Ride with the initial policies. However, by reducing the cost of Park & Ride, in respect to Carpooling and by introducing minibus service to minimize its egress time their effects are managed to achieve a balance. More specifically, the model shows some remarkable reduction of parking demand due to carpooling and an increase of Park & Ride share at the same time. Finally, the simulations that take place prove that with high parking fees a total annihilation of Drive Alone alternative is possible. Finally, the two parts are combined to construct a complete plan of recommendations for the next five years. For this purpose, three scenarios based on the parking supply are developed. The first scenario considers the current parking supply to remain constant for the next five years. The second scenario implies the increase of the parking supply, while the third scenario considers the decrease of the number of parking spots in the campus. For all three scenarios parking fees are recommended and can be found in detail in Figure 22. Sustainable mobility of the university can be achieved through the application of the aforementioned parking demand management strategies at the TU Delft campus. Nonetheless, an attempt to quantify the increase in sustainability through the estimation of the reduction of the CO2 emissions is made. Briefly, for every 5% reduction of parking demand in the campus of the TU Delft, 145 tones of CO2 per year will be avoided. The successful implementation of the abovementioned framework can constitute a source of inspiration and consequently influence other institutions and organization to adopt a philosophy towards sustainable campuses. Therefore an attempt to generalize this case into other contexts is made. Not only universities’ but also organizations such as airports, hospitals, and municipalities can benefit from the application of this framework. However, it is recommended that in different contexts, the coefficients of the model, as well as its attributes should be reconsidered and adapted according to the needs of the specific occasion.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering, Systems and Services","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion provides a high performance attitude controller for multi-rotor Micro Aerial Vehicles by providing very good disturbance rejection capabilities. Flights conducted with a quadcopter revealed undesired pitch and rolling motions which occurred simultaneously with actuator saturation for instantaneous yaw angle reference tracking commands. Constrained control allocation methods can increase the system's performance by providing an effective strategy to prioritize control objectives, and redistribute control effort accordingly. Weighted Least Squares control allocation makes the constrained control allocation problem a quadratic optimization problem. An iterative solver based on the computationally efficient active-set algorithm finds the optimal control distribution for a weighted control objective. In this paper the Weighted Least Squares control allocator is used to overcome two challenges 1) increase performance by applying prioritization between control objectives and redistribute control effort accordingly, accounting for the actuator limits 2) enable flight when flying with severely compromised actuator(s).

(mentor)","2016","Double degree of Master of Science in Applied Geophysics at Delft University of Technology, ETH Zürich and RWTH Aachen University. - In 2004, Rijkswaterstaat provided geopotential differences between the benchmarks of the Normaal Amsterdams Peil (NAP) network to the Bundesamt für Kartographie und Geodäsie (BKG) for the realization of the European Vertical Reference System (EVRS). This data was found to be incorrect, resulting in inaccurate transformations between EVRF2007 and the national height systems of the participating countries. To correct the realization of the EVRS and obtain accurate transformations between the height systems, it is essential that the BKG is provided with correct geopotential information on the NAP network. In this thesis, a computational procedure has been developed to obtain correct geopotential differences. The final procedure was implemented in a MATLAB software package that was provided to Rijkswaterstaat for future computations. The old results were compared with the newly computed results, in order to obtain insight into the origin of the errors made in 2004. The impact of these errors on realizations of the EVRS was examined as well. Finally, the connection of the NAP levelling network to the neighbouring countries, and thus the Unified European Levelling Network, (UELN) was investigated. Due to the available data, most steps in the computational procedure were already predefined. Therefore, the main development was a method for predicting gravity at the levelling benchmarks. Observed gravity was reduced to surface gravity anomalies to remove height dependency. This makes accurate 2-D interpolation possible. Four methods were tested for the interpolation of these gravity anomalies: ordinary Kriging, least-squares collocation, cubic spline and biharmonic spline. Biharmonic spline interpolation was selected as the gravity prediction method for the final procedure. For potentially further improvement of the gravity prediction, two gravity corrections were investigated as well: residual terrain modelling and correcting for a global gravity field model. Both corrections were found to cause negligible improvement to the gravity prediction with respect to the uncertainty of the levelling observations. Therefore, these corrections were not used in the final procedure. Large regional differences were observed between the newly obtained results and those of Rijkswaterstaat. These differences could predominantly be explained by a mistake in sign convention of the surface gravity anomalies when restoring the observed gravity. In an updated realization of the EVRS, using the new NAP geopotential information, a tilt of several millimetres within the Netherlands and Belgium is observed. When updated data from other countries are also considered, datum points heights varied in the centimetre range. Finally, there are a total of 28 Dutch-German cross-border observations at 13 locations, evenly distributed along the border. This lead to the conclusion that the connection between the NAP and the German levelling network is strong. The connection of the NAP with the Belgian network is much weaker, with only a single observation currently known at the BKG. Although, from the data used here it seems that more connections should be readily available.","NAP; EVRS; EVRF2007; Geopotential; Gravity Interpolation; RTM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","Applied Geophysics and Civil Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2016","Due to changes in the electricity grid, and the awareness of the energy consumption, management of energy flows is an important business. For the management of energy flows, detailed information about the current flow is needed. For the integration of current sensors in the grid there is a need for non-invasive current sensors that are easy to installable. In this thesis project a non-invasive current sensor based on a Current Transformer (CT) is described. For simple installation, the sensors takes the power required for the electronics in the sensor, from the magnetic field that is created around a cable by a current flowing through the cable. Based on the combination of energy extraction and continuous current measurement a proof of concept self-powered current sensor is designed. The measured data of the current is send wireless to the operators. A study on current measurement, energy extraction with a CT, and the configuration of a sensor network, is used to create a configuration for a non-invasive current sensor. Based on the configuration a simulation model of the sensor is realized and used as first verification to check if the configuration can be used as current sensor. From the simulation model a prototype is designed and tested. For simulation of the system and analysis of energy extracting capabilities of a CT, a model is created that is, as long as the core is not saturated, accurate for the analysis in this thesis. Based on accuracy, size, cost and power losses a shunt is used to measure the secondary side current of a CT. The secondary side current is related to the primary side current, the current of which information is wanted, by the turns ratio of the CT. Fromthe analysis on the energy extracting capabilities of a CT it is concluded that at low primary current the output power of a CT is very low. There are options to increase the energy extracting capabilities of a CT. However, they all have negative influence on the current measurement. To supply the electronic parts in the sensor a AC/DC conversion stage as well as an DC/DC conversion stage are used. All topologies have influence on the measurement. Based on simulation the influence of a Schottky diode full bridge rectifier and a buck/down converter is limited and only visible at small current. The configuration of multiple measurement sensors to a network, and the communication between sensor nodes are optimized for power consumption and accurate time synchronization between sensors. A local concentrator initiates a time-slotted communication channel to which the sensor nodes are connected. The time synchronization implemented in this project is accurate with a difference in time between initiator and sensor node of about 20 &s average. For the integration of current measurement and energy extraction, isolation of the measurement and active consumption of energy is required. By using a shunt monitor with internal isolation of input and output it is possible to measure the Alternating Current (AC) current with an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) of a microcontroller. Active energy consumption is used to ensure that almost all available CT current passes the shunt. Simulation of the complete sensor showed that it is possible to measure current accurately from 10 A to 240 A. Although the accuracy of the measurement with the prototype is not as good as the simulation, it is expected that further development of the configuration will lead to more accurate measurements. Based on the research in this project it is concluded that the designed configuration can be used for current measurement from 10 A to 240 A. It is furthermore expected that changing some components can lead to current sensors that measure current within other ranges as well. To increase the accuracy some parts need small modifications but the concept of a self-powered wireless current sensor based on one CT is proofed to work.","Current sensor based on Current Transformer; Self-powered supply for electronics from Current Transformer; Current sensor for Energy Management application","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-12-31","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Due to enormous technological progress during the last decade, fully autonomous cars are closer than ever to becoming a reality. However, the precise direction this development will take is not clear yet and car manufacturers are desperately trying to come up with innovative concepts. Regarding interior design most of these concepts come down to rotating seats, a retracting steering wheel and an overload of digitally presented information, representing rather a technology push than design driven innovation. In this thesis the future desires of the user are put first. By looking at the domain of human mobility in the year 2035, the “loss of irrationality” is identified as one of the biggest issue to people in that domain and therefore serves as a starting point for design. The loss of irrationality refers to the circumstance that there are more and more laws introduced which limit irrational behavior in public spaces such as drinking and smoking. Nowadays, a car is the most common everyday object that still allows for irrational use. It is a symbol for adventure and especially popular because of its archaic attraction. However, due to steady progress in advanced driving assistance systems, the irrational aspect of driving gradually decreased over the last decades and will be completely eliminated with the introduction of fully autonomously driving cars. This is not about people being afraid of the “new rationality” to come, it is about people being afraid of letting go the irrational. And this is equally true to the user as well to the car companies, whose brand identities are built upon those irrational aspects. Taking that as a starting point, the author uses a gamification approach in order to design an interior concept for autonomously driving cars that motivates the user to embrace irrational behavior and serves the car manufacturers as a means to effectively communicate their brand identity. The final outcome of this thesis is an instrument panel for the next generation Ford Mustang of the year 2025 which will be capable of highly autonomous driving (SAE level 4). It allows the customer to add a certain personality to their car when being in autonomous mode. A different personality or character will show a different driving behavior. The car’s personality is represented by an avatar in the form of a virtual animation displayed in the instrument panel. It is only visible and active during autonomous mode in order to create a clear distinction towards the conventional mode. As part of the gamified experience, the user is given the possibility to level up their avatar. The higher the level, the more personalized the experience becomes. Although the actual game design is not included in the scope of this thesis, the author gives an overview about different game mechanics as a starting point for further development of the concept. Since the benefits of autonomous driving can only be fully realized when they go along with the widespread use of car sharing and car pooling services, all avatar related information are saved on a token. Once the avatar is connected to the car the avatar is ‘unleashed‘. While this concept can be implemented by any OEM, it can be adapted to the brand identity of the respective brand. This project gives Ford, the long time innovator in the automotive space, an opportunity to embrace a completely different approach to autonomous driving, the next big step in the industry. They would differentiate themselves from all other players in offering a unique solution that increases their customer’s brand loyalty through emotitional appeal.","autonomously driving car; interior design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

The result needed to be fitting to a coffee maker of Philips, without significant changes to the coffee machine. It was required that the proposition should include an mobile app. The approach was chosen to analyse the landscapes of coffee products and connected technologies. The Vision In Product design method was used to collect insights in products, the way users interact with these products, and the context of the products and users. These aspects were addressed in their current state and for the predictable future. A market and competitor analysis was performed to assess the brand positions and strategies for the Philips coffee brands. Existing connected coffee products offer a proposition which looks interesting on first impression. They provide little added value as the graphical user interface or functionality is executed poorly. The new design is aimed to provide added value for the user in the form of a mature and functional product. By assessing user needs and desires for both users of coffee products and connected products, correlations and relations were found. The most significant drivers for users to use products from the two domains are to exert control over the end result and to make it more convenient to reach the desired result. A strategy for implementing new propositions is presented in the connected coffee vision. This vision includes technology and functionality to be developed in future products. The first step of the vision is a new app for the upcoming Saeco range of full automated espresso machines. The designed Saeco app offers true remote control of the coffee machine, optimized for everyday use. User experience is developed and tested to allow variation in coffee use and easy comprehensible customization. Personal profiles and saved drinks are synchronized with the machine for a fluent experience, no matter which interface is used. The app is designed with a social context in mind, allowing groups of people to use the app and share favourite recipes. The result is a sophisticated design in coherency with the coffee maker and brand.","coffee machine products; app","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2016","Making foundation designs is one of the major tasks of a geotechnical engineer. Toachieve such a design, knowledge of the soil stiffness is required. Information about the soil stiffness can be obtained by either laboratory tests or in situ tests. Laboratory testing is time consuming, costly and sample disturbance is inevitable. In situ tests are done directly on the soil encountered on the site and therefore are a good representation of the in situ soil state. CPT's are the most performed in situ tests in geotechnical engineering. CPT's are used to evaluate the subsurface based on the mechanical response translated to cone resistance and sleeve friction. Therefore it is desirable to find a correlation between soil stiffness and CPT results. A lot of research has been done to correlate CPT results, such as the cone resistance, with the stiffness of sand. It has been found that these correlations are highly variable and site specific. State parameters as consolidation state have a high influence on the soil stiffness but are difficult to evaluate from CPT results only. In this thesis the correlation between cone resistance and stiffness parameters for sand is investigated based on a series of Zone Load Tests done at a site in Kuwait. In a Zone Load Test a footing is loaded in steps and the settlement of the footing is measured. First an analytical settlement analysis is done with existing methodologies which use correlation between cone resistance and soil stiffness. The predicted settlements according to these methods are compared with settlements measured in the field. Afterwards, a new site specific correlation between cone resistance and soil stiffness is proposed using regression analysis. A verification of the new proposed correlation is done with the finite element program PLAXIS 2D. The numerical calculations were done with the Hardening Soil model using an axisymmetric approach. Multiple Zone Load Tests are simulated with PLAXIS 2D where the input parameters of the Hardening soil model are obtained from the proposed correlation. The numerical calculated settlement of the footing are in agreement with the measurements in the field and therefore it can be concluded that the correlation found for this site is valid. The general application of the proposed correlation is not confirmed. The research done in this thesis is related to direct settlement. Time dependent behaviour is excluded but could be of significant influence. Carbonate sands, as encountered at the site, are sensitive for particle crushing. Particle crushing can lead to creep effects and therefore it is advised to perform Plate Load Tests to get better insight in the creep behaviour in the sand fill.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Driegen, F.J. (mentor); Takken, E.H. (mentor)","2016","Diesel engines have a bad reputation if considered for propulsion in fast naval combatants. Compared to gas turbines, propulsion systems with diesel engines are regarded to be heavy, prone to thermal overloading and suffer from poor maneuverability. However, diesel engines are efficient and require less expensive maintenance, offering the possibility of significant reduction in operational costs and fuel supply dependency. This research investigated whether the acceleration performance and the thermal loading can be improved with diesel hybrid propulsion in a CODLAD configuration. The performance and thermal loading was evaluated with dynamic simulation models representing different configurations of propulsion plants for the future M-frigate of the Royal Netherlands Navy. The study demonstrates that fast naval combatant with diesel hybrid propulsion can accelerate as fast as gas turbine driven vessels. To fulfill the desired NATO standards for acceleration maneuvers an adaptive pitch control strategy in combination with controllable pitch propellers is required. This will enable a fast ramp up of diesel engine speed to provide maximum power without overloading the engine thermally. Furthermore, the electric drives need to assist the diesel engine during the acceleration maneuver for optimum acceleration.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-10-27","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine & Transport Technology","","MSI/Marine Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2016","In computational aeroelasticity, unsteady aerodynamics is computationally expensive compared to the structural calculation. This problem becomes more severe for prediction of flutter or Limit-Cycle oscillation (LCO), which requires multiple runs of simulations at various flow conditions. The former can be captured by linear computational-aerodynamic-fluid (CFD) solver, while the prediction of the latter requires nonlinear CFD solver. Reduced-order modelling (ROM) techniques for unsteady aerodynamics have been investigated extensively. Among these ROMs, Auto-Regression with eXogeneous variables (ARX) has been applied to predict the flutter behaviour successfully for relatively complicated test cases. Motivated by the nice performance of ARX, whether other linear system identification methods, such as Auto-Regression Moving Average with eXogeneous inputs (ARMAX), Output-Error (OE) and Box-Jenkins (BJ), are effective as linear ROMs is investigated. When it comes to the nonlinear ROM, the linear information is expected to use. A polynomial-based state-space model, extended from linear system identification, is defined to combine the linear part with nonlinear functions of the state and input. A direct requirement for the linear method is the representation in state-space form. The nonlinear functions compose of polynomials of degree equal or greater than $2$. The coefficients of this nonlinear model are obtained by solving an optimisation problem with a Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm. Furthermore, we assume that the linear method is capable of capturing the flutter and keep the linear matrices constant during the nonlinear optimisation to reduce computational cost. As for the test case for LCO, an analytical Van-der-pol (VDP) oscillator is selected. The nonlinear ROM is built to replace the nonlinear term in VDP. Coefficients of the nonlinear ROM are obtained by solving an optimisation problem and the validation is carried out by reproducing the VDP oscillation. Another important factor for a fairly accurate ROM is the training signal. Different training signals are examined to reproduce the VDP oscillation. After checking the theoretical representation and the numerical solution algorithm, ARX and ARMAX are selected as linear ROMs for two reasons: the construction of state-space representation is explicit; ARMAX model is a variation from ARX by adding averaged error terms without changing the stability of the system. The comparison is carried out in two test cases. In the analytical test case, ARX and ARMAX can reproduce the training signal very well after an order selection and capture the flutter boundary. For the second test case, using CFD data, ARX and ARMAX match training signals well, but for test signals, ARMAX shows a lower fitness caused by overestimation of error contribution. For the nonlinear training, the optimiser can follow the nonlinear behaviour of the reference output, which demonstrates significant error reduction compared to the linear model. The validation of the ROM is examined for different training signals: chirps, random phase multi-sine, sequential sinusoids and multi-chirps. Chirps and sequential sinusoids fail to reproduce VDP. For most cases, random phase multi-sine is unable to follow VDP oscillation. Although the bounded oscillation is predicted for certain cases, repetitive tests are not consistent. For the multi-chirps, the optimiser is changed to accustom the cost function. With a couple of tests, this signal can deterministically reproduce the bounded oscillation, but the accuracy is not high. Another assumption that typical frequencies at flutter and LCO are not far apart is considered. Sequential sinusoids with narrow frequency band and wide amplitude range are applied to construct the nonlinear ROM in both random and deterministic cases. The frequencies and amplitudes are randomly chosen with the frequencies predetermined in the random case, while frequencies and amplitudes in the deterministic case are scattered uniformly. The LCO behaviour is predicted quite well in terms of amplitude and frequency in the bounded phase but not in transitional stage for both the cases. Repetitive tests are required for the random case. This study applied ARX and ARMAX as the linear ROM for flutter prediction and built the polynomial-based nonlinear ROM for predicting LCO. The observation that narrowing frequency range and widening amplitude range increase the chance of capturing LCO can be used for nonlinear training signal design.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & Propulsion","","","",""

(mentor); van Rhee, C. (mentor)","2016","The world is rapidly embracing networked technology and transitioning into one of hyperconnectivity, a term first coined by social scientists Anabel Quan-Haase and Barry Wellman. Increased connectivity provides benefits such as automation and, remote access and control of networks and equipment, thereby decreasing operational costs. Maritime and offshore companies are increasingly automating their vessels and platforms to reduce the required workers on-board and centralise platform control. With this tight coupling of complex ICT and industrial control systems however comes an increase in risks. These risks are further increased due to the application of security controls. Where in mechanical and structural engineering the focus lies on failure (e.g. safety factors), this is not necessarily the case for ICT related systems, which are often only verified to be working as specified and expected. Unexpected behaviour is not taken into consideration. Thus, while most vessels and platforms depend on automated systems, it seems little is being done to protect them from cyber incidents and attacks. The impact of security breaches on these systems can be disastrous due to the potential for physical damage to people and planet. This is especially true within the oil and gas industries. For example a fire at the Piper Alpha production platform in the North Sea in 1988, caused by an oil and gas leak, resulted in the loss of 169 lives. While computer viruses or worms might not directly injure people, or destroy equipment, automated control systems can. This work thus focusses on the area where mechanical systems meet automation systems, a field called industrial control systems. An investigation into the current state of cyber security within the dredging industry has been conducted, which was followed by a threat analysis on industrial control systems. These systems operate at the heart of the dredging industry. This has revealed that malicious software can cause physical damage to equipment and injury to people. In an effort to improve the current state and help prevent cyber incidents from occurring the following research question has been formulated: Can adversaries operating on Control System infrastructures be detected by an Intrusion Detection System which is monitoring the physical state? To answers this question a novel intrusion detection system is designed which takes advantage of the physical state of the processes. This new concept deviates from other systems in that they obtain information from the network, as opposed to the physical process, where the data cannot necessarily be trusted. Additionally, when malicious events or cyber incidents occur within or behind the controller (PLC), the control network does not necessarily contain the required information detailing ongoing attacks. Looking at the physical system then allows for malicious attacks and cyber incidents to be detected by observing anomalous and unexpected behaviour of the monitored physical process. This enables the detection of advanced malicious threats which would be missed otherwise. The required information on the physical state of the process is obtained on the last line, between the controller and field devices.","intrusion detection system; dredging; offshore; industrial control systems; cyber security","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

On the other hand, market has a continuous demand for more cost efficient designs. Therefore, the need for more sophisticated computational tools arises. In these tools, the inherent flexibility of the structure is involved in the calculation of its loading and response, introducing the aspect of \textit{fluid-structure interaction}. The objective of the current study is to produce validation data for computational tools capable of modelling fluid-structure interaction (e.g. ComFLOW). To achieve that, an experiment is designed, conducted and its results are processed to assess their reliability. The designed arrangement includes a cylindrical flexible plate made of PTFE, placed horizontally inside a fully transparent container partly filled with water, while being attached to the bottom of a rigid cylindrical structure. The assembly is imposed to sinusoidal vertical oscillation using an electromagnetic linear drive. Due to the small scale of the arrangement and the small weight of PTFE plate, only optical instruments are used to measure structure's response. Specifically, the response of the flexible plate is measured using two instruments: a single-point laser Doppler vibrometer, that measures the velocity at a specific point of the plate and a stereoscopic set of cameras that can measure the displacements of the plate with high spatial resolution using 3D digital image correlation method. The rigid body motion of the assembly is monitored by a laser distance measurer and the imposed force is measured using a load cell. The investigated parameters include characteristics of oscillation (amplitude and frequency), the thickness of PTFE plate and its submergence depth. The results are analysed and additional tests, required for identifying noise components, are described. Using the results of these tests, a low-pass filter was applied to the measurements of the vibrometer. Having these measurements filtered and numerically integrated, cross-checking between the displacements coming from the vibrometer and digital image correlation is carried out. The results reveal that the effect of noise coming from the linear drive can not eliminated at the full extend. Once the whole process is completed, conclusions are drawn and possible actions to improve the current set-up for a next series of experiments are recommended.","Fluid-Structure Interaction; ComFLOW","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology / Ship Hydromechanics and Structures","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

The challenges relate to the difficulties of finding contributors and the struggles to keep members actively engaged. This thesis presents three different designs that support people in building a thriving community. The designs stimulate people to perform the right activities for the community’s development and motivate people to contribute to the community.","Internet of Things; communities; decentralized network; gamification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovatie Management","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Vallery, H. (mentor)","2016","In the elderly population, falls are one of the major causes of injuries. Fall detection algorithms for wearable devices in the literature were found to focus on differentiating Activities of Daily Living (ADL) from falls, rather than on early fall detection and prevention before impact. This thesis work was aimed at providing accurate estimates of human motion parameters like translational velocities of the center of mass, so as to aid early fall detection algorithms in the future. An algorithm which fuses visual and inertial data obtained from a sensor setup consisting of a pair of cameras and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) was developed. An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) framework was used for sensor data fusion. A neural network was trained to map motions of interesting points or features obtained from image processing, to actual motion of the sensor setup attached to the hip of a person. This neural network provided the correction term to the EKF in the form of 3 dimensional(3D) translational velocities which is an important motion parameter for the detection of falls. First, this algorithm was trained and tested for hand-held sensor setup motions. Acceptable velocity tracking was observed for slow motions. Then the algorithm was trained and tested on motions of a test subject. The accuracy of estimation of 3D translation velocities and in particular the vertical component of the 3D velocity was studied for two distinct sets of activities or motions namely the walking motion and the sitting down/standing up motion. It is shown that the combination of the EKF and the neural network is capable of reacting and tracking the velocities for the sitting down/standing up motion.","Human Motion Estimation; Visual Inertial Sensor Data Fusion; Extended Kalman Filter; Neural Networks","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","To date, autonomous robots have been widely used and appear huge advantages in dairy farming that is a labor-intensive industry. Vector is an automatic feeding system developed by Lely to feed cows accurately and flexibly with minimum labor requirements in dairy farms. As the autonomous mobile robot of the Vector, the Mixing and Feeding Robot (MFR) is able to automatically distribute feed for cows based on a reactive navigation system. However, since the reactive approach only responds to stimuli at the moment, MFR is susceptible to errors in the barn environment like the temporary loss of valid ultrasonic or inductive sensing; without following a fence or a metal stripe, MFR is quite limited in its ability to navigate. In this project, a hybrid navigation system is proposed combining the reactive navigation currently used on MFR and the map-based navigation consisting of mapping, localization and path planning. Due to MFR's incapability to build a map of the environment with current sensors, a laser scanner is added for map building. Based on Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL), the Striped-based Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization algorithm (SAMCL) is proposed for MFR to localize itself based on the map. Moreover, a control strategy is developed to switch between the reactive navigation and the map-based navigation accordingly. To evaluate the performance, the hybrid navigation system is tested in the simulation model built by the robotics simulator V-REP and it is concluded that the proposed navigation system improves MFR's error-tolerant capacity and navigation performance.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-10-25","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","Embedded Systems","",""

(mentor)","2016","With the bandwidth of the ECG signal extending from sub-Hz to 200 Hz, a major challenge for an ECG readout system lies in implementing the high-pass (HP) cut-off frequency as this translates into the realization of large time constants on-chip.Although techniques such as those based on the use of pseudo-resistors to obtain very large time constants exist, they are heavily limited in both linearity and accuracy, which clearly dictates the need for alternative structures. A structured electronic design approach based on state-space forms is proposed to develop HP ∆Σ converters targeting high accuracy of the HP cut-off frequency. Based on transfer function calculations, the various specific HP ∆Σ topologies namely, biquad, observable and controllable canonical and orthonormal HP ∆Σ, can be made to satisfy the desired HP signal transfer with 2nd order noise-shaping. In order to establish the noise contributions of the integrators, intermediate transfer functions, viz., from the system input to the integrator outputs, and from the integrator inputs to the system output, respectively are mathematically derived and evaluated. The evaluation of the intermediate transfer functions show that the orthonormal topology is better than the observable canonical HP ∆Σ topology in terms of noise. Simulations conducted in MATLAB confirm the noise behaviour of the integrators and show that, apart from the first integrator, the HP integrator significantly contributes to the total noise. Secondly, the noise and the harmonics at higher frequencies from the HP integrator are low-pass filtered. A 2nd order orthonormal HP ∆Σ modulator with a sampling frequency of 128 kHz for a bandwidth of 1-200 Hz to be implemented in 0.18 um AMS technology achieves a resolution of 12-bits at the HP cut-off frequency of 1 Hz which is a major improvement over pseudo-resistors at the cost of higher area and power consumption. A robust, area-efficient and parasitic insensitive large time constant switched-capacitor Nagaraj integrator leads to a HP cut-off frequency realization determined solely by the ratio of capacitors with an accuracy upto 1%. In conclusion, HP ∆Σ topologies that can be used to realize very large time constants with high linearity and accuracy which shows a major improvement over the conventionally used topologies that employ pseudo-resistors are proposed.","ECG; State-space forms; High-Pass ∆Σ; orthonormal topology; delta-sigma ADC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics / Bio-Electronics","","Microelectronics","",""

Realizing the three values are important, and the design of open government data portals should be able to accommodate the values. However, how the open data portals should be designed in order to accommodate the three values is still unclear. Existing principles of open government data focus on the data itself, rather than how open government data portals should be designed with regard to the values of transparency, privacy, and information quality. Therefore, there is a need for explicit design principles for incorporating these values into the design of open government data portals. This research does qualitative research on open government data portal design principles. The approach taken involves reviewing literatures to find out the dimensions of transparency, privacy, and information quality which are relevant to open government data portal design. Next, design requirements from open government data portals are obtained through interviewing five academic researchers from TU Delft while focusing on the dimensions of transparency, privacy, and information quality. Then, design observation is done on five selected open government data portals, focusing on the implementation of design requirements acquired in the previous phase of the research. Lastly, principles are formulated from the findings obtained from each phase of this research. The result of this research project is a set of design principles which serves as a guideline on how to design open government data portals that incorporate transparency and privacy while ensuring information quality.","design principles; open data; open government data; transparency; privacy; information quality","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering, Systems and Services","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor)","2016","Every year number of prematurely born infants grows. Most underdeveloped organ after birth is brain. Therefore its monitoring is very important, especially as it can provide indications about health state in a future, both short and long term. Non invasive method of brain monitoring is EEG recording. However tedious process of system set up and short time of recording discourage doctors to use it in daily care. Good alternative is aEEG measurement. Number of electrodes is reduced to 5 including ground node and signal interpretation is much easier. Main advantage of the system is high correlation between aEEG readouts and raw EEG signal. Although aEEG is already well known and accepted in neonatology, it is still not used to monitor every patient. Problem is high price of a device starting from 30000 euro. In a result, hospital is not able to provide proper monitoring for each and every patient. For this reason, main task of this thesis is to propose cheaper version of a system. The system can be divided into two prats. Analog front end and digital part providing signal processing. There are plenty of cheap development boards that can be used as digital part, therefore focus of this project was set on analog front end. In order to propose cheap design, minimal requirements have to be specified. Two tests were performed. First one was to identify interferences disturbing aEEG recording in the worst case scenario, when patient is inside an incubator and all monitoring devices are turned on. For this purpose, a phantom mimicking neonate’s body conductivity and size was constructed. Results showed that differential method of obtaining the signal is necessary for biosignals which amplitude is in 𝜇V. Only registered interference was 50Hz spike coming from the mains. Noise floor peak to peak amplitude was measured on 1𝜇V level, while magnitude of 50Hz spike was on the level of 9𝜇V for devices turned off and 25𝜇V for devices turned on. Big influence on the recording has phantom location as well. If phantom was in direct neighbourhood of devices connected to power line, 50Hz spike raised to 90𝜇V level and several harmonics of the main tone appeared. By putting phantom 2 meters away, main tone’s magnitude dropped to 2𝜇V level and all of the harmonics were gone. Second performed test was resolution test. Real raw EEG signal was applied on the Simulink model analog to digital converter in order to identify what is minimal number of bits required for proper signal acquisition. Tests showed that in order to keep the number of bits low, amplification of the signal is required. For signal directly applied on the ADC 18bit resolution was required for proper signal acquisition. Amplification by factor of 1000 allowed to reduced this value to 7bits. Proposed system consists of amplifying stage realising 60dB gain with high pass cut off filtration and ADC. Amplifying stage is realised by amplifier providing 35dB gain with filtration below 2Hz and second amplifier realising 25dB gain. ADC is implemented by continuous time second order Sigma Delta Modulator. Proposed system was designed in CMOS 0.18𝜇 and h18a6am technology. Tests of full system showed SNR no lower than 51dB, power consumption of 217.5𝜇V. Input stage has CMRR of 113dB and input impedance above 2.25GΩ for the bandwidth 2-15Hz. System reliability was checked with corner analysis and wide range of temperatures. Results showed small variations of SNR.","aEEG; neonatology; continuous time sigma delta modulator; analog front end","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","","",""

(mentor); Bakker-Wu, S. (mentor)","2016","In the past years the Chinese market has experienced a significant growth in the purchase of Infant Milk Formula and the sales of such product are expected to keep increasing by 10-15% of their current volume. The main reasons that explain this growth are: Implementation of the second child policy (with an expectation of 8 million extra babies born per year) Difficulties and taboos associated with breastfeeding in China Increase in the average household income All over the world, when it comes to IMF there are four needs that are required to be delivered through various packaging features: Convenience: allow “one-hand-operation” during the preparation of the baby bottle or simplify the overall process. Accuracy: achieve an accurate dose with every scoop. Freshness: guarantee the quality of the IMF, avoiding moisture, the formation of lumps or the presence of external agents. Hygiene: avoid hand contact with the IMF or avoid the powder spillover when preparing a baby bottle. The constant pollution, the extreme weather conditions in certain areas and previous food safety incidents caused a shift in the priorities of IMF pack needs for Chinese users, being hygiene and freshness their top priorities. Users understand that failing in providing such needs would have direct impact on the baby’s health. Furthermore, the China market is highly complex and experiences a fierce competition with over a hundred IMF brands, both local and imported. Among the premium and ultra-premium market segments, brands offer different packaging features aiming to solve user’s concerns regarding the hygiene and freshness of the product. However, in the mainstream segment almost all brands use the same the packaging format, the snap cap can, with no real differentiation among them and presenting unmet IMF pack needs in terms of hygiene and freshness. After diving deeper in the analysis of such pack needs, the following mission statement was established: To update the IMF snap cap can packaging format in a way that improves the hygiene and freshness perception of the main target group, Chinese mothers and grandmothers, whilst achieving differentiation by means of providing a packaging concept that: Will reinforce user’s confidence of the product remaining fresh from opening to emptying with the standard IMF shelf life once opened (aprox. 30 days) And / or Will allow users bring powder from the can to the bottle, avoiding hand contact with the powder. With this in mind three different concepts were developed: Concept 1 Design goal Solve the hygiene need of reducing the amount of powder spillover produced when scooping and pouring, improving the interaction between scoop and users, enabling them to feel in control. Solution A new scoop design with: an ergonomic handle which defines the placement of the thumb, granting users a proper grip of the scoop and allowing them to feel in control. a lowered handle position, reducing the chances of powder spillover during the pouring action. a modified edge of the scoop´s cup allowing to level making use of the O-shape rim. a gap between the handle and the scoop´s cup, allowing to tap off any possible accumulated powder in the handle Concept 2 Design goal Solve the hygiene need of avoid hand contact with the IMF when reaching for the scoop, providing a defined location of the scoop for the first-time opening of the can as well as a scoop storage solution for regular use that is outside the powder and is suitable for the snap cap lid. Solution When opening the IMF can for the first time, users will find the scoop attached to the rear side of the peel-off by means of a blister pack. Once the peel-off is removed and the blister pack is opened, the scoop will be stored in the snap cap lid for regular use. Aiming to solve the need of convenient scoop storage solutions, the attachment system consists of a central pin in lid which enables an easy and quick storage with no need to orientate the scoop in a specific direction. Concept 3 Design goal Reinforce users confidence that the product will remain fresh from opening to emptying Solution Maintaining the standard 127 mm can diameter two independently sealed sections are created by seaming a sub-compartment onto the can. This sub compartment incorporates two peel-offs: one located at the upper part and a second one in the lower end. Each section provides 400g of product, resulting in a total of 800g. After finishing the first 400 grams, users would be able to remove the second peel-off, accessing the second compartment of completely fresh product which has been protected against moisture and any possible external agent whilst using the first half of the product. After evaluating all three concepts, the one that best balances the three pillars “Consumer-Business-Technology” is Concept 2, which should be taken into the next development stage.","infant milk; formula packaging","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","This thesis presents and discusses a loading concept to improve the efficiency of loading containers to deep-sea vessels at maritime container terminals. The efficiency includes the overall service time to handle a deep-sea vessel at the quay of a container terminal. Nowadays, the terminals are threatened by overcapacity due to a decreasing growth of container throughput and the vessels becoming larger. Shipping companies benefit from shorter times spend in the harbour and therefore put pressure on the process of handling the vessels. The container terminals have to invest heavily to meet the demands of services requests of the shipping lines. Researching literature about improving the loading process, it turned out that the bottleneck of the service time at container terminals can be found in the loading of the vessels. The loading of containers to the deep-sea vessels is more complex than discharging the containers from the deep-sea vessel. This due to the applied loading sequence that has to be retained during the loading, which is necessary for a couple of reasons: the weight distribution of the containers over the vessel and the locations of special containers, for example container that contain dangerous goods or have to be connected to the power for climate control, have to be placed carefully. An optimal solution for the loading process is not found yet. As a consequence of the complexity and the number of different variables that have to be optimized in this one process. Different situations as loading an airplane or truck and the handlings in warehouses offer partly solutions that could be used to the loading process of a deep-sea vessel. These solutions are helpful in a way of identifying important influences, like the reachability of goods in warehouses and the different moments of arrivals of goods which can cause problems during the loading sequence of the various transport means. Research in the literature focussing on the loading process at maritime container terminals shows that especially the output of the stacking yard crane, that facilitates the yard, delays the loading process. A promising concept of loading that is mentioned in literature classifies containers in categories. An improvement of 5% in performance of the utilization of the quay crane during loading, compared to a situation without categories is mentioned. The loading concept that is researched is a less compelling way of loading compared to the current situation and according to further research improvements of the loading process are shown. However, the research that is done uses assumptions on the loaded containers and only one way of classifying the containers is tested. Furthermore, no attention is payed to the changes in the process of loading the containers on board of a deep-sea vessel. Lastly, the research is done 15 years ago, the performance of the equipment and the size of the vessels is changed over time…","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

(mentor)","2016","New concepts for support structures of offshore wind turbines have gained interest in the industry and are examined for intermediate and deep water depths in order to unlock new offshore potential markets. One of the main proposals that has already been commercialized is the three or four leg full height lattice structure. The fatigue assessment of such structures is of primary significance, since it is one of the main design drivers. A Frequency Domain (FD) framework is developed in this study with the ability of analysing several topologies of lattice structures for dynamic and fatigue assessment. The concept of the model relies on the natural frequencies and modeshapes estimation with the employment of the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and the fatigue damage prediction due to wind and wave loading with the utilization of a Transfer Function (TRF) that relates the input spectrum to output stress spectrum for a member of the structure. Furthermore, the method of mode superposition is adopted for the calculation of the response of the structure. The benchmarking of the model for the dynamic analysis with ANSYS for a reference structure and turbine yields sufficient results with errors around 5% for the two first natural frequencies and even smaller for the higher modes. A case study of the structure developed by the Dutch company 2-B Energy is performed and the fatigue damage values as well as the stress spectra as computed by the DM are compared with the equivalent results calculated by the Time Domain (TD) software package GH Bladed for three different members. The DM produces satisfactory results for all the members for cases with low or medium environmental loading and less accurate results, which are pointing in the right direction, for the cases with high environmental loading. With the utilization of the DM for a preliminary analysis of a structure a significant amount of time (several hours) can be saved.","Windenergy; Fatigue Assessment; Full Height Lattice Structures; Offshore Wind Turbine Support Structures; Dynamic Analysis; Frequency Domain; Offshore Wind","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & Propulsion / Wind Energy","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor)","2016","In the Netherlands, flood protection has always been a key issue to protect settlements against storm surges and floods. Around 60 % of the country is potentially affected by flood from the rivers and the sea. Most of the flood-susceptible areas are low-lying polders. Whereas flood protection has traditionally been focused on structural measures, nowadays the increasing availability of system-wide, real-time data acquisition, and disturbance forecasting systems enable the use of advanced new control methods. In polders, normally flooding is prevented by pumping stations that pump water out of the system. In drier periods, water can be let into the system using inlets. In the Netherlands there are still many inlets that are not automated but controlled by a human operator. As a result of this, the inlet configuration can only be changed when the human operator travels to the location of the inlet. The operator's work is to perform inspection, configuration, and maintenance tasks on all local water engineering structures. The operator is responsible for various pumping areas and is therefore not always available to change the configuration of the inlet. Previously, there was not much attention for inlet control because the pumping stations have enough capacity to pump the added water away. The surplus of water that is let in, has to be pumped out again, which is a waste of energy. Nowadays, energy consumption reduction receives increasing attention and a more sustainable control strategy for the inlets is preferred.

(mentor); Hoving, J.S. (mentor); Spierenburg, S.E.J. (mentor)","2016","This thesis entitled ""Modelling of cyclic degradation - Development of a cyclic accumulation model and the application to a gravity based foundation"" presents a new soil model to analyse the behaviour of undrained soils subjected to cyclic loading. Cyclic loading on offshore support structures for wind-turbines results in complex design challenges, and current codes and standards offer limited guidance on the assessment of undrained cyclic soil behaviour. To assess the undrained cyclic behaviour, a new procedure is being developed within the finite element software Plaxis, the UDCAM-S procedure. This new procedure is designed to asses the undrained cyclic behaviour of clays in the design of offshore support structures. This study focuses on the development of this procedure and the application to a gravity based foundation for a large wind-turbine placed on clay. Large cyclic wind and water loads acting on the turbine are transferred through the structure to the foundation, resulting in cyclic shear stresses in the clay. These shear stresses lead to an increase in pore pressure due to the restriction of pore pressure dissipation, and thereby a decrease in effective stress. With each cycle, shear strains are developed due to the decrease in effective stress: the average, cyclic and permanent shear strains. Permanent shear strains accumulate as a result of accumulated pore pressures due to cyclic shearing of the soil, the irreversible deformations of the soil. With the accumulation of pore pressures and plastic shear strains the soil degrades in terms of the undrained shear strength and the stiffness of the soil. The degradation of the soil as a result of a design storm is determined with the UDCAM-S procedure. The design storm is simplified by analysing the cyclic loads in terms of load parcels, to use the load data in the strain accumulation procedure (Andersen, 1976). With the result of the strain accumulation procedure, the degraded behaviour of the soil can be determined by means of scaled contour diagrams for the behaviour in direct simple shear, triaxial compression, and triaxial extension. Parameters of the NGI-ADP soil model in Plaxis are fitted onto the degraded stress-strain curves, resulting in a parameter set accounting for the degradation of the soil by the given design storm. The results of the UDCAM-S procedure have been used to model the influence of cyclic degradation on the stability of gravity based foundations. The investigated cases gave insight in the influence of the different steps in the UDCAM-S procedure on the outcome of a finite element analysis. It has been found that VHM capacity of gravity based foundations can be reduced significantly by large equivalent number of cycles for a design storm. As the soil strength decreases with increasing equivalent number of cycles, the maximum moment resistance is mobilized at lower vertical loads. This results in a large reduction of the HM capacity at higher vertical loads. The same effect has been found on the stability of the foundation for different widths of the foundation. The equivalent number of cycles is the dominant factor influencing the stability of the foundation. This is due to the accumulation of large strains due to a design storm, resulting in a softer clay.","soil degradation; cyclic behaviour; clay; GBF; strain accumulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-Engineering","",""

The city council of Walla Walla saw this as an opportunity to further develop this channel. Their desires include conservation of the fish ladder, enabling to sail by boat and to prettify the spillway. A Sobek 1D model was built to give a proper insight of the current situation. To verify the model calibration was done by using USGS data and GIS maps of the Walla Walla council. Also various design alternatives were specified to see which form of recreation is most feasible. The results from the model in the current situation showed that the water depth was too low while its velocity was too high for the different vessels. To solve this issue, an upgrade for the concrete spillway was proposed. By roughening the riverbed and placing groynes into the creek, the water depth increased and the water velocity dropped, according to the improved model. However, the design is a rough sketch that forms the base for a more detailed study. It is recommended to continue improving the model to verify the results which are presented in this report to be sure the proposed upgraded design will contribute to the desires.","River improvement; Sobek; Washington State","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","46.068084, -118.328963"

(mentor)","2016","In recent years, the Material Point Method has emerged as a promising alternative to the Finite Element Method for solving problems involving localised deformations, large displacements or rotations, fracture, contact/impact problems and others. FEMhas been a staple of engineering disciplines both in academia and industry for decades, however its shortcomings make it less suitable for certain applications in geotechnical engineering. MPM, bridges the gap between Finite Elements and meshless methods by using a reference background grid and moving material points to represent the discretised material. This gives it the capacity to faithfully reproduce behaviours which would be difficult to capture without involved procedures with other presently availablemethods. In this work, methods of modelling contact between deformable continua were explored in the context of theMaterial PointMethod with the goal of producing usable code applicable to geotechnical engineering scenarios, thus supplementing the work of the Geo-Engineering section at TU Delft. A dynamic, explicit computational framework was developed in the FORTRAN programming language allowing efficient modelling of multi-body interactions using different contact conditions. The influence of decisions regarding the contact logic, definition of surface normals and variable update procedures were compared. Coupling between FEM and MPM was explored for solving problems involving regions with small and large deformations. The work presented here aims to extend the applicability of theMaterial PointMethod to soil-structure interaction problems. In addition to the contact algorithms explored, an alternative method for material point generation using Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations was explored. This allowed for improved distribution of material points over domains of generic shape, while achieving results similar to a FEM-based approach, which uses Gauss Points. Placing material points at the integration points brings the inherent disadvantage that complex domain shapes cannot be easily discretised using a structured grid. The ability of the two methods to reproduce a uniform density field was compared and the novel approach was implemented for a contact problem - an elastic collision between two disks. Results showed a the potential of the CVT-based scheme for use in further analyses.","Material Point Method; MPM; explicit MPM; contact mechanics; soil structure interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-Engineering","",""

De stroomsnelheid en daarmee de erosie nemen toe. Er ontstaan grote ontgrondingskuilen, die het risico op het bezwijken van de oever vergroten. Om dit erosieproces tegen te gaan wil Rijkswaterstaat bomen uit de uiterwaarden gaan gebruiken om de bodem mee te beschermen. Echter kunnen de bomen hinder opleveren voor de scheepvaart als ze in de schroef terecht komen. Om veiligheid te garanderen is informatie nodig over de kritieke stroomsnelheid van de boomstammen. De hoofdvraag van dit onderzoek luidt: In hoeverre kunnen boomstammen toegepast worden als bodembescherming om erosie en ontgronding te voorkomen. Verschillende bomenconstructie worden op schaal getest aan de hand van experimenten in de laboratorium goten in Stevinlab III te Delft. Per constructie wordt gekeken naar het bezwijkmechanisme, de kritieke stroomsnelheid en turbulentie. Ook wordt er onderzocht of de kritieke stroomsnelheid van boomstammen beschreven kan worden met formules op basis van Izbash en op basis van Shields. Uiteindelijk wordt het schaalmodel vertaald naar de werkelijkheid. Uit dit onderzoek komt naar voren dat boomstammen kunnen worden toegepast om de bodem mee te beschermen op basis van de kritieke stroomsnelheid en de turbulentie. Het toepassen is echter niet op elke plek in de rivier mogelijk en er zal dus voor elke situatie gekeken moeten worden wat de maximale stroomsnelheid is in de rivier en welke constructie van boomstammen het best gebruikt kan worden. Wat op valt is dat de bomenconstructies bestaande uit één laag de hoogste kritieke stroomsnelheid behalen maar een lage relatieve fluctuatie intensiteit. Voor de constructies met meer lagen is het omgekeerde het geval, de kritieke stroomsnelheid is lager maar de relatieve fluctuatie intensiteit is hoger. Er wordt aangeraden om in een vervolgonderzoek de nauwkeurigheid te vergroten. Dit kan door te werken met een bredere stroomgoot, grotere boomstammen en betere snelheidsmeters. Voor het gebruik van formules om de kritieke stroomsnelheid van boomstammen mee te beschrijven is verder onderzoek nodig. Uit dit onderzoek komt naar voren dat de formules nog niet correct zijn.

(mentor)","2016","Wind energy has recently come to constitute more than 10% of the electric power consumed in the EU. As the wind industry is rapidly growing, wind turbines grow larger and new models are soon expected to reach ratings of 10 MW. The development of offshore wind farms is another major trend in the industry. Offshore farms are particularly suitable for installation of large turbines, able to utilize the stronger winds available. However, in case of an offshore failure, it could require weeks to access and repair the turbine. Even in onshore farms, the turbine size cannot allow frequent disconnections. In this context, increasing turbine availability emerges as a critical issue: Modularity is seen as a promising approach to respond to this need. Modular systems can be decomposed into a number of independent 'modules' or components. Such systems can have their faulted modules bypassed and continue operation after fault, increasing system availability. Less frequent and easier repair can also achieved. Different levels of modularity have been proposed: Systems with modular converters or systems with modularity both in the converter and machine, with possible levels of modularity in the machine itself. Focusing on the machine-side of modularity, this thesis aims to produce a comparative study of the main modular machine topologies proposed in literature. The first step to address this problem, is to propose some promising machine topologies, suitable for modular design. Subsequently, a 2-D analytical model is developed, able to account for different types of winding. The model calculates important quantities to evaluate electromechanical performance (Back-EMF, Power, cogging torque) and efficiency (iron loss, copper loss). Analytical modelling results are validated by means of FEM modelling. The validated analytical model is then used to carry a first level comparison of numerous modular winding machines. The designs which perform best in terms energy yield, efficiency and cost are promoted for a second level comparison, where further modularity is introduced. This time, the machine stator is segmented and different segmentation ideas are applied. The segmented designs are compared by means of FEM. After the optimal design is selected, the flux gaps introduced in the stator core are considered, and the influence of gap width on the machine performance is investigated.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Power Processing","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Exploitation of unconventional resources could prolong the gas production in the North Sea. Low-net-to-gross fluvial intervals have tough-gas reservoir potential in thin-bedded crevasse splays. To assess economic risks associated to the development of these reservoirs, a reliable depositional model is required. Sparse areal data availability for reservoir models commonly results in the use of stochastic interpolation. Numerical models offer the possibility to support these methods with proven physical concepts. To this end, simulations were conducted with Delft3D process-based modelling software. Input parameters and the validation data sets for these models are derived from outcrop studies in the present-day R\'{i}o Colorado fluvial system in the Altiplano Basin, Bolivia. In total 174 simulations were run, of which five models were analysed in detail. The model output consists of discrete morhpological, hydrodynamical, and grain-size data. Petrophysical parameters where derived from continuous grain size distributions parameters. This study demonstrates a statistical approach to extract these from discrete grain-size data. A sensitivity study shows that using the right size and amount of grain-size classes is crucial to minimize errors. Simulations demonstrate the effect of different conditions through their direct influence on physical processes. Crevasse-splay formation only occurs for water levels that are higher then the base of the levee breach and lower then the top of the levee. The resulting morphology is dependent on the relation between the driving hydrodynamic gradient and the counteracting frictional forces. Both outflow from the river onto the floodplain and reflux of water back into the river leads to an erosional channel network. Crevasse channels, together with their related overbank and mouth-bar deposits, form the architectural elements that make up crevasse splays. A quantitative comparison was made between field and simulated data. It shows that the model overestimates the grain size as sediment is transported away from a channel. The conclusion is that this model is not valid for quantitative purposes. The process-based model with its current abilities and limitations can be used as a tool for heuristic research. It allows the study of the different governing processes. These ideas should be taken back into the field to test, validate, and further study the exact morphodynamics of the system. Resulting concepts can be used to accurately predict the crevasse-splay architecture and corresponding sedimentary trends. Subsequently these can be used as an input in reservoir models to improve their reliability.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering and Geoscience","",""

(mentor)","2016","This thesis is part of a project that focuses on developing an optimisation framework for dynamically scaled flight testing. The optimisation framework must design the scale model and the flight test such that the performance of the scale model is representative to the full-scale aircraft. The similarity in the performances between the scale model and the full-scale aircraft is achieved by altering the geometry, the mass distribution and the structure of the model, which are related to the aerodynamic, flight dynamic and structures disciplines respectively. This thesis contributes to the aerodynamics optimisation framework by focusing on the development of a parametric model that is capable of deriving the stability and control derivatives. The research goals of the thesis are mostly related to the construction of a parametric aircraft model for the aerodynamic solvers that are based on a first order panel method like VSAERO. The most important goal is how to model the trailing edge moveables for a first order panel method for deriving the control derivatives. This thesis will investigate three options for creating the moveables. The first option (’normal rotation’) is a mathematical operation in VSAERO that rotates the normal vectors of the body panels that represents the moveable. The second option (’transition surface’) is a wing with a moveable model that has transition surfaces between the wing and the moveable in the spanwise direction. The third option (’gap’) is the same model as method two, but instead of transition surfaces, there is a gap between the wing and the moveable. The second research goal is to compute the stability & control derivatives of the parametric model and investigate the accuracy of these derivatives. Out of the three modelling options, the wing with a moveable model that has a gap between the sides of the moveable and the wing was useless in VSAERO. The model was unstable due to the presence of the gap. The gap creates a very low pressure locally, which accelerates the surrounding airflow to a ridiculously high value. The difference between the ’normal rotation’ and the ’transition surface’ models is the location of the moveable suction peak. The suction peak of the ’normal rotation’ model is located on the wing in front of the start of the moveable, while the suction peak of the ’transition surface’ is located at the start or slightly behind the start of the moveable. The effect of different locations of the suction peaks is that a suction peak on the wing will generate less induced drag than a suction peak located on the deflected moveable. The results of stability & control derivatives for the ’normal rotation’ and the ’transition surface’ modelling options were quite acceptable with the static derivatives as the most accurate derivatives with an average error of seven percent. The control derivatives, on the other hand, was the least accurate with a mean error of 40 percent. The overall performance of the two moveable modelling options is that they were performing equally well when only the accuracy of the derivatives was observed. The ’transition surface’ modelling option was more accurate in the prediction of lateral stability derivatives and the longitudinal control derivatives than the ’normal rotation’ option, while the ’normal rotation’ option was more accurate in predicting the longitudinal stability derivatives and the lateral control derivatives. But the deflection of the rudder produces side force, yaw moment and roll moment coefficients that are less accurate for the ’normal rotation’ option then for the ’transition surface’ option. The ’transition surface’ modelling option is the better option for modelling the moveable because it produced more accurate aerodynamic results than the ’normal rotation’ modelling option. Both moveable modelling options have its strengths and weakness when concerning the prediction of the stability and control derivatives, and neither of the two was considerably better. Thus based on the accuracy of the aerodynamic characteristics, the ’transition surface’ modelling option is the best option for modelling the moveables of a first order panel method solvers like VSAERO.","parametric model; parametric modelling; moveable modelling; control surface modelling; first order panel method; VSAERO; stability and control derivatives","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & Propulsion","","","",""

(mentor); Fernandez Villegas, I. (mentor)","2016","The use of high quality fiber reinforced composites is increasing in the aerospace industry. The high specific stiffness, high specific strength, low density and the ease to tailor the material properties make composites very interesting. Manufacturing aircraft without joints is practically impossible. To make maintenance, inspection and repair possible, joints are inevitable. The application of high-performance composites is not limited to the aerospace industry. Some other applications in which composites are utilized are: cars, trains, ships, wind turbines, oil platforms, oil pipes, prostheses in health care and bridges. The property that thermoplastics can be reheated and reshaped can be used to join them. The welding techniques are called fusion bonding techniques. Heat softens the material and when two substrates are in inti- mate contact, intermolecular diffusion between them takes place. The entanglements of the polymer chains between both substrates ensure the strength of the joint. Ultrasonic welding is a very promising joining method for thermoplastic composites because of the short cycle time, low cost, in-situ monitoring, possibility to automate and the high quality and high strength of the joints. Up to now, only lap shear samples have been welded and the research is limited in single welds. However to join larger structures in aerospace, multiple welds next to each other are needed: this is called sequential welding. To develop sequential ultrasonic welding at first preliminary sequential experiments are performed by welding one spot after another to find the conditions required for the welding process. It seemed that individual welds need to be isolating with dampers on both side of the sonotrode to prevent individual welds from influencing each other. Experiments together with a solid mechanics model demonstrate that damping of individual welds is an effective strategy to prevent welds from influencing each other. A new welding fixture is designed by Fokker Aerostructures to controllably dampen the vibrations on both sides of the sonotrode. The redesigned weld fixture made it possible to make repeatable, high strength weld for weld pitches 35 mm and 20 mm. For the damped welds, a reduction in the total welded area was found. A large part of the flow fronts in the joint was detached from the substrates and contained parts of unmolten energy director. The presence of these large detached flow fronts might be caused by the laminates being bent around the energy director, creating a leaf spring system damping the amplitude of the vibrations. A larger welded area was in- deed obtained by welding with increased amplitudes. It is recommended to perform an optimization study to find more suitable weld settings to eliminate the detached flow fronts completely.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-10-24","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures & Materials","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","With the current view on sustainability and global warming, renewable energy sources are becoming more and more important. One of these environmental friendly energy sources is wind energy. To make the price of wind energy more competitive compared to other energy sources, the current trend in the industry is to increase the rotor diameter of the turbines. However, with these larger turbines the loads and oscillations due to instabilities such as flutter also increase. By reducing this, the required maintenance is decreased and the lifetime increased, thus lowering the cost of wind energy. One of the solutions to obtain load reduction is by using a smart rotor, which is an airfoil with the ability to actively influence the airflow. One type of smart rotors that is used in this research is a morphing airfoil, which can morph its shape using piezoelectric actuators. However, this system is highly non-linear and therefore the classical method of control is not possible. A data-driven approach is used in the form of Gaussian Process regression. This is a versatile method that can be used in machine learning. It has stochastic properties and is able to deal with uncertainties and non-linearities. This algorithm is then used to obtain the optimal gains of a fixed-structure controller. This algorithm is used on a flutter model, which simulates a smart rotor using a flap to influence the airfoil. This model is not as non-linear as a morphing airfoil, but is the most relevant theoretical model available to test the algorithm on. With the GP controller tuning algorithm, an optimal controller was obtained that could remove the instability of flutter. To do experiments with the morphing airfoil prototype, an experimental setup was designed and attached to a small closed-loop wind tunnel. Unfortunately, this setup had lots of friction, which makes it not possible to obtain instabilities such as flutter in the wind tunnel. Therefore, the performed experiments are reference tracking and disturbance rejection, where the disturbance was generated by one side of the airfoil and countered by the other side. The Gaussian Process controller tuning algorithm was able to tune the gains for a PI and PID controller for these objectives with reasonable performance. Concluding, it can be said that morphing airfoils shows potential and can influence the wind flow in such a way that it is comparable to other smart rotor designs that, for example, make use of flaps.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC)","","Systems and Control","",""

Myanmar suffers from yearly floods that have a huge impact on the population. Making an area flood proof is therefore one of the objectives of the civilian government. In this report ‘flood proof’ is defined as a status that shows that an area is prepared to control the effects of a flood. To achieve this goal a general framework has been created. This general framework guides the reader through multiple analyses, a development of alternatives, an assessment and an implementation. It has the objective to be transparent, reproducible, elementary, based on existing methods and based on data. To test this general framework on these criteria two cases with different research areas are chosen namely, case I: Nyaungdon and case II: Dala. The report is therefore developed as an incremental and iterative process. In this report a range of alternatives has been taken into account, that includes more than only the hydraulic measures. To implement the Dutch method of treating a (potential) flood a multi-layer safety approach has been used. This approach consist of three layers namely, prevention, spatial solutions and crisis management. All the alternatives of this report can be classified into one of these layers. The analysis phase of the general framework has been focussed on four specific analyses. The four specific analyses are a flood risk analysis, an actor analysis, an evacuation analysis, and a future scenario analysis. These analyses combined with the general analyses lead to the development of alternatives. The method that has been used to determine the relatively best alternative is the multi-criteria analysis. Most of the time it is preferred to combine several alternatives in packages to generate the best possible solutions. After these solution packages have been created for every research area an implementation has been done including an adaptive strategy. The data that has been used in this project is gathered by interviewing experts, conducting surveys and reading reports and researches. Due to a lack of data, a lot of assumptions have been made. An overview of the lacking data is given that is necessary to complete further research.","Myanmar; flood proof; flood protection framework; flood risk; Ayeyarwady delta","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Transport, Infrastructure & Logistics","Multidisciplinary Project CIE4061-09",""

(mentor); Metrikine, A.V. (mentor); Alvarez Grima, M. (mentor); Wambeke, T. (mentor)","2016","Mobile jack-up units remain favourable in the offshore industry due to its capability to self-install and ability to work in moderate water depth. Prior to its mobilization to the site location, it is required to have a site-specific assessment (SSA). The SSA will identify any potential problems related to foundation conditions during installation. One of the important site specific assessments before deploying jack-up units is the preload check, which is carried out to predict the load-penetration response. The offshore industry has published the ‘Guidelines for the Site Specific Assessment of Mobile Jack-Up Units’ (SNAME 2008) and more recently, the International Standard Organization has published ISO 19905-1: 2012 in order to standardize jack-up assessment procedures. The guidelines adapt the framework used for onshore application following conventional bearing capacity theory to assess spudcan penetration depth. However, these guidelines are limited in discussing the approach in working in multi-layered soils. The conventional procedures described in the guidelines may not be sufficiently accurate since the methods cannot take a proper account of the nature of continuous spudcan penetration process. In practice, a layered system is commonly encountered and the installation process can be hazardous, with the potential of punch-through failure when the spudcan penetrates into strong over weak materials. A better understanding is therefore required. This thesis proposes that an analysis based on numerical modelling can be one possible alternative in evaluating spudcan bearing capacity in the layered system. This study presents the application of a finite element modelling approach, called Press-Replace (PR) Technique, which is based on a small strain geometry update procedure. This technique can be applied in any geotechnical software that is currently available for engineering practice. The PR Technique is employed to investigate the performance of penetrating spudcan foundations on homogeneous soil (sand and clay) and two layered soil deposits (sand overlying clay). The numerical method is firstly verified against previous experimental and numerical test data. A parametric study is also conducted to see the influence of normalized soil properties and geometry on the load penetration curves. Overall, the modelling approach used in the present study shows a good agreement, compared to other published results. The PR Technique shows its capability to simulate the penetrating spudcan foundations. In addition, several interesting findings are identified based on the parametric study: (i) the stress-level-effect and the prominent influence of dilatancy angle on the spudcan penetration in sand; (ii) the difference of soil flow mechanism in clay that leads to the attainment of the bearing capacity factor in deep penetration; and (iii) the onset of punch-through in double layered case that is highly determined by the sand thickness ratio. Lastly, some design charts are presented for all the investigated cases in the present study. These charts might be used to generate full spudcan bearing resistance-depth curves in sand, clay and sand overlying clay.","Spudcan; bearing resistance; load penetration response; layered soil deposits; punch-through; PR Technique; geometry update","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering (Bottom Founded Structure Track)","",""

(mentor)","2016","As part of the effort to reduce the cost of offshore wind energy, this MSc Thesis deals with the layout optimization of an Offshore Wind Farm affected by wake effects, cable topology and support structure variation. The main objective of the current MSc Thesis is to investigate how important each of these aspects for the layout optimization is. The final outcome of the project is an optimization tool that tries to find the optimal Offshore Wind Farm (OWF) layout in terms of the lowest Levelized Production Cost (LPC). This optimization tool depends on the analyzer algorithm, which calculates the objective function of the optimizer. The analyzer consists of three different elements that are combined together so that the Levelized Production Cost will be calculated. Thus, the objective function will be the LPC. The analyzer elements are the wake effects, cable topology and support structure variation. For the support structure variation, part of the MZ Tool developed by professor Dr. Michiel Zaaijer is used. Using this tool, the support structure dimensions and costs can be determined. Regarding the cable topology, a hybrid approach between Planar Open Savings(POS)and Esau-Williams(EW)heuristics is used so that the performance of EW can be improved for multiple cables and lower infield cable cost will be achieved. Finally, the Jensen wake model is used in an algorithm so that the wake effects can be determined. The output of that algorithm is the annual energy yield and the LPC. The optimization tool is based on the Genetic Algorithm(GA)logic. The performance of the optimization tool is evaluated both cost and time-wise by implementing four scenarios. In these scenarios some parameters of the GA are changed so that the behavior of the optimization tool can be examined. Finally, different case studies, related to the seabed shape and to the three ingredients in the analyzer, are examined. These case studies will show how the changes in the analyzer can affect the optimality of an OWF. More specifically, it is found that all three elements in the analyzer affect the layout optimization. In addition, it is concluded that the support structure variation has the largest contribution to the layout optimization compared to the cable topology. Regarding the computation time, it is higher in the case that there is support structure variation, since it takes more time for the analyzer to calculate all the costs.","Windenergy; layout optimization; offshore wind energy; support structures; cable topology; wake effects; genetic algorithm; wind energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & Propulsion / Wind Energy","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor)","2016","The large-scale 3D printing technology created by a group of partners led by DUS Architects allows fabricating components made of thermoplastic polymers with Fused Deposition Modelling technique. These components can be used as moulds for concrete elements, providing freedom of form and unprecedented optimization opportunities. In this report the author investigates general applicability of the concept and makes an attempt to establish the relationship between laboratory tests, computational modelling and the design of an end product. This is achieved by developing a streamlined framework for processing the experimental outcome and using it in finite element simulation to find mould geometry, which deforms into the desired shape after casting the infill. The content of this report is contained in three factual sections. First of them covers preparation of the experiments and interpretation of their results. Main focus is put to mechanical response of the 3D printed cross sections in property tests (tensile, flexural, shear, creep, thermal sensitivity) and scale mould setups. Systematization of the output includes introduction of the print quality classes, which is a way to accommodate high variability in geometrical precision of the printer. Second part of the document describes and validates the proposed numerical approach using a triple-layer composite shell element with adjustable layer thicknesses. Implementation of the latter is driven by the inconsistence in cross-sectional stiffness parameters of an extruded wall in each direction. Next, the design method utilizing mentioned modelling technique is proposed. It is based on the principle of applying initial negative deformation, which compensates the excessive deflections that occur after casting the concrete. The above solutions are implemented with Python programming language and wrapped together in Rhinoceros 5.0 software with Grasshopper plugin. Finally, applicability of the framework is validated by the case study experiments on predeformed moulds. The discussion and conclusions argue that the use of the 3D printed components as forms for small concrete elements is feasible, but it is likely to exhibit issues with scalability. The test scheme is considered sufficient yet the print quality issues are highlighted. Likewise, numerical modelling technique and design method are acknowledged along with their drawbacks being mentioned. In the end, a list of potential improvements is given, including extension of the test scheme, development of a custom element formulation, changes in software implementation or alteration of the design procedure to enable its application to other problems.","predeformation; 3D print; polymer; form; concrete; testing; mould; design; modelling; shell","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-10-21","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Increasing demands for mobile internet access have led to exponential developments in mobile communications technologies. The next generation mobile technology is expected to exploit electronic beam steering and to have a higher operating frequency to facilitate a higher bandwidth. This places a heavy burden on the base station antenna arrays, which should be sparse to accommodate passively cooling the system. Conventional sparse array topologies suffer from undesirable radiation pattern characteristics such as grating lobes. Therefore, this work focused on exploring methods to synthesize the antenna elements' geometrical parameters to enhance the radiation pattern and to explore the limitations that arise due to the array's sparseness. To this end, both a deterministic and a stochastic method were proposed. Starting with an analytical window function as a continuous current distribution and approximating this by adjusting the antenna elements' radial coordinates results in the fact that the desired window's radiation pattern is only approximated in a limited field of view, depending on the sparseness. Full electromagnetic wave simulations are performed to show that downscaling the topology to make it more dense gives rise to increased coupling effects that deteriorate the array's performance. In addition to the deterministic method, a genetic algorithm optimization method is employed to stochastically obtain the optimal current distribution window. Approximating the optimal continuous current distribution again leads to the array factor following the optimal window's radiation pattern in a limited field of view. Furthermore, it is shown that for the conditions used in this work, the optimum continuous current distribution is also the optimum current distribution for finite element arrays, implying that only one optimization needs to be executed when designing such an array. Concluding, the applicability of density tapering to sparse arrays is limited. The inherent undersampling causes a limited realization of the window function's characteristics. Density tapering does improve the absolute performance of a sparse array in terms of peak sidelobe level, but may be useful if the region of interest is concentrated near the main beam. The requirements and in particular the region of interest of the application determine whether density tapering can be effectively employed.","antenna array; sparse array; density tapering; space tapering; optimization; genetic algorithm; feko; planar; spiral; sunflower; mutual coupling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","Microwave Sensing, Signals & Systems / track: Telecommunications & Sensing Systems","",""

This R-effect can be accounted for by means of plasticity induced crack closure: A plastic wake behind the crack tip causes the crack to close before a zero tensile load is applied. As such ΔK is adapted to an effective ΔK, ΔKeff. If ΔKeff is used for similitude the R-effect disappears.These theories have recently been disputed and an alternative, SER dominated FCG description model has been proposed. This research discusses the confusion about using ΔK for similitude and approaches FCG also from a SER perspective. Experiments are designed and executed in air and vacuum environment to obtain a better understanding of fatigue, the R-effect and crack closure. The experimental results show that ΔK is an improper similitude parameter and that the R-effect is an artefact of choosing ΔK for similitude. Instead of that, fatigue should be approached from a SER perspective. Furthermore the research shows that the R-effect is not caused by (plasticity induced) crack closure.","G; FCG; R-effect; Stress Ratio; Crack Closure; Plasticity Induced Crack Closure; SIF; SER; Strain Energy Release; Fatigue; ΔK; ΔKeff","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures and Materials","","","",""

In answer to these worries, serendipitous recommendation systems have been developed to help users make surprising and pleasant discoveries outside of their typical online content sphere. In this thesis, we investigate whether serendipitous recommendation system do indeed help break the filter bubble effect. In contrast to previous work, we investigate this question on one large-scale live experiment. We find that serendipity partially mitigates the filter bubble effect, but that users are more responsible for their own filter bubbles than algorithms. Further, we search for user characteristics that can be used to identify users more likely to experience the filter bubble effect. We find that users spending more time on site are less likely to experience the filter bubble effect.","filter bubble; serendipity; recommender system; content diversity; user experience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Eight million tons of plastic enters the ocean every year, causing damage to the environment, to human health, and to the economy. Due to rotating currents, called 'Gyres', large quantities of that debris accumulate in five areas around the world. In an attempt to clean up the most polluted area, being the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, Boyan Slat (founder of the Ocean Cleanup) proposed to install a fixed moored, 100km long, v-shaped barrier, to passively catch, concentrate and extract the plastic. However, from an offshore engineering perspective, it seemed as if there could be cheaper and more efficient alternatives, to achieve the same goal. The research proposal that followed this insight led to the start of this thesis, with the objective of developing a conceptual design, and thereby assessing the feasibility. This objective was accomplished by first analyzing all possible cleaning strategies and strategy specific concepts in a high level and structured process. Using methods such as brainstorming, multi-criteria analysis (MCA), and morphological overviews, strategies and concepts were developed and evaluated. Finally four strategies were proposed, of which a passive concept with sea-anchors, driven by ocean currents, was selected as the most promising strategy (Figure 2). Subsequently, a completely flexible concept which uses hydrodynamic lift to force the barrier open perpendicular to the flow, was selected for feasibility analysis using a numerical model (Figure 3). Besides that, an experimental test program was proposed to evaluate another concept which uses a large surface covering membrane. The feasibility analysis of the concept, was subsequently divided into two steps. The first step focused on the design of a suitable sea-anchor to generate stable lift. For which a three-dimensional model was constructed using a lumped mass approach, in which the system is build-up out of massless springs and all forces are superimposed on the nodes, being; mass, buoyancy, tension, drag, and added-mass. The model was subsequently used to simulate the behavior of a 'Window-shade drogue' (sea-anchor for meteorological research) to partially validate the model. After which the sea-anchor design was adapted to show that stable lift can be generated. Besides this, a one-degree of freedom model gave insight into the parameters required to ensure anchor stability. The second step focused on the construction and evaluation of a three-dimensional model of the complete concept, and multiple variations. It is shown that the high level selected concept is not feasible, and that the efficiency both in terms of current following capability as in shape retainment, is low. The completely flexible concept is not able to adequately follow a median changing current direction of 16 degrees/hr at 0.17 m/s, leading to entanglement of lines and a collapse of the system. Following from these results, a new concept is proposed which requires torsional and bending stiffness to prevent entanglement, and uses a two sided catching mechanism to catch plastic from all directions.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-10-20","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore engineering","","","",""

One of the most well-known forecasting techniques, the ARIMA, does not suffice the long-term forecasting task due to the mean convergence problem. Therefore, this research empirically assesses the alternative solution based on the Gaussian process (GP) regression. This study presents two approaches of Gaussian process regression for our problem: the structure modelling and the autoregressive approach. These techniques are evaluated on two synthetic datasets and two real-world datasets, which are the wind speed and electricity consumption dataset. From the experiment, it can be concluded that the GP-based forecasting techniques show more favourable long-term forecasting performance than the ARIMA model, particularly in cases where the data contain apparent trend and season. The experiment also demonstrates that the structure modelling method slightly outperforms the autoregressive approach for long-term forecast and offers a benefit that the autoregressive model does not have, which is the interpretability of the model.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems / Computer Science","","Media and Knowledge Engineering","",""

(mentor); Verhaegen, M. (mentor)","2016","Optical fibres are ideal for local light delivery in hard to access places due to their flexible nature and small size. In most applications, such as microscopy, micromanipulation and endoscopy, it is desired to obtain and maintain a specified intensity pattern at the fibre output. Multimode fibres (MMFs) are capable of carrying a large amount information encoded in the complex coefficients of the superimposed propagating transverse modes. The main obstacle of using MMFs for these purposes is the fact that the small imperfections and impurities in the fibre along with bending causes dispersion and coupling between the modes. As a result the intensity distribution at the fibre output becomes randomised, known as a speckle pattern. The speckle pattern of a stationary fibre is time-invariant and the transmission characteristic of the MMF can be fully described by typically a very large nonsparse complex transmission matrix (TM). However, when the fibre is moved or disturbed the transmission matrix changes making dynamic operation in real time difficult to achieve. A desired output intensity pattern can be obtained by controlling the phase of the light field at the MMF input with a spatial light modulator (SLM). The SLM settings can be computed directly by optimising a specified objective intensity at the MMF output, or by retrieving the TM first and subsequently deduce the associated SLM phases. In this thesis alternative ways are explored to identify a light transmission model that is able to exploit the high resolution of state of the art spatial light modulators by using intensity measurements only. The proposed methods in this report rely on basis expansions into the fundamental transverse fibre modes, as well as into the Fourier basis, resulting in a significant reduction of the problem’s dimensionality. Also an iterative learning control strategy is proposed to compensate for small fibre movements during and after the identification process.","fiber optics imaging; wavefront shaping; spatial light modulator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-10-19","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC)","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","A decade of extremely high and volatile copper prices has disturbed industries and raised the need for an extensive understanding of current predictors by means of indicators, signals, events and developments concerning the copper market. The goal of this research is to find a suitable method to prioritise events (including developments) on their impact on the copper market and to identify the root causes for these impacts. In order to asses future scenarios, this study can be used to identify predictors, which will improve the understanding of the dynamics of the copper market. In this research a large set of open data sources was analysed. This data was retrieved from USGS,World Bank, company reports, commodity reports and scientific researches. Furthermore, 29 case studieswere analysed on various topics. These case studies consist of time series analyses, logical reasonings and assessments on future potential impacts. By interviewing external experts, different perspectives on the coppermarket were identified. Eventswere prioritized on the impact each caused on the copper market. To quantify this impact, a new indicator was developed. This indicator was derived from a surprise component, which was defined from literature. The surprise component indicates the effect of economic news on the commodity markets. The surprise component includes the market uncertainty at a specific moment in time and the deviation of the actual price from the expected price. The general idea of the developed indicator is to include the duration of an event. This is realized by a summation of the consecutive surprise components within this duration. Because the deviations are generally larger for long term events, a linear bias occurs. This bias was eliminated making the newly developed indicator also suitable for expressing the impact of long termevents. This indicator enabled the first step in the root cause analysis and identified the events which caused the most impact, such as major wars, economic booms and technological developments. However, other types of events have caused more severe price shocks (a deviation from the expected price which is more than the standard deviation). The cyclical nature of the market, financial crises and a rapidly transforming climate for investment in a supply region are considered to be events causing the most severe price shocks. To identify the root causes for the events’ and developments’ impacts, associated indicators and signals were determined. By means of the case studies, those indicators and signals could be objectively valued. Fromthe identified root causes, awarenesses of additional complexity are revealed. For example, it is assumed that economic growth in China will affect the copper market significantly. However, due to China’s current status in several economic indicators, the significance of this impact is questioned. Economic growth in underdeveloped regions, such as India or Sub-Saharan Africa, will affect the copper market more significantly. Another key example is the recycling industry, which is much less matured as common statements make one believe, since the recycling efficiency continues to stay below 35%. The case studies verified the indicators and signals and have provided information on the likelihood, future progress and impact of events affecting the copper industry. In order to assess the current relevance and significance of the studied indicators and signals, each was brought into today’s perspective. It is presumed that certain indicators and signals might have changed in significance. First; the oil price, this study proves that pre-2000 events on the oil market only caused minor impacts on the copper markets. However, causal relations were deduced between the recent oil peak and the high marginal costs of copper. This suggests a possible increase in relevance of the oil market affecting the copper market. Secondly, the newly developed incentive for a transition to a sustainable society with an efficient use of energy. This will require appliances with a high content of copper. Massive embracing of these new appliances could boost the demand for copper. Lastly, the impact of an increase in demand due to wars. While the copper market is growing rapidly, magnitude of war would need to increase to affect the market with the same impact. The assessments for today’s significances show that new drivers will enter the market and old drivers could reduce. This study revealed that the copper market was subject to both random and non random events. Pattern recognition does not seem a suitable tool to provide an understanding the behaviour of the copper price, but comprehending the root causes and the consequences of the events is of use. This study defined a set of indicators and signals (e.g. U.S. dollar currency index, discount rate and gold price)which stakeholders can use to optimize risk analyses. Monitoring and stimulating the development of alternative sources for copper, including recycling and deep sea mining, will enable the possibility to bypass risks. Lastly, indicators and signals, related to the sustainable energy transition, economy, company strategies and new innovations in processing and extraction technologies, will indicate how the balance in supply and demand will develop. This study improves the understanding of current dynamics of the copper market and the identified set of predictors will benefit stakeholders to improve their strategies. Updating this study will ensure industries are prepared for future market fluctuations.","Copper; Market; Behaviour; Analysis; Volatility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","","",""

This thesis considers the problem of post-processing extreme precipitation forecasts in Friesland from the numerical weather prediction model HARMONIE. Assuming forecasts are accurate, it is natural to assume a linear relationship between the precipitation observations and the forecasts. However, in practice this relationship is not linear, due to large uncertainties in the modelling process. To deal with this problem of non-linearity a non-parametric common shaped tail estimator (CST) is proposed to adequately estimate the non-linear shape of the relationship. Performance of the CST estimator is shown and compared to other extreme quantile estimators from the literature in an extensive simulation study. The estimators are also compared using the quantile verification skill score on a three year precipitation dataset in the province of Friesland.

Such a system has been developed for UAV teleoperators which incorporates haptic feedback on the control stick based on a Collision Avoidance System (CAS). When nearing obstacles, the operator gets redirected by the haptic feedback and so avoiding a possible collision. However from previous and similar studies it was stated that haptic interfaces have a low user acceptance due to the limited knowledge and insight of the pilots on the automation. To improve the acceptance of the haptic feedback system this research adds additional visualizations to an existing interface. In order to evaluate these newly designed visuals, a human-in-the-loop experiment was performed. Results show that there were no significant differences between the different configurations, however, acceptance questionnaires filled in by the participants revealed that they preferred operating an UAV with additional visualizations. This means that raising the acceptance of the haptic interface was accomplished without deterioration of the operators safety, performance and workload.","Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV); haptic interface; haptic feedback; tele-operations; collision avoidance; artificial force field; human-machine interaction; acceptance tactile feedback; haptic shared control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operations","","ATM, Airports and Safety","",""

(mentor); Langendijk, P. (mentor); Schipper, H.R. (mentor)","2016","This thesis discusses the connections between high-strength concrete columns and normal-strength concrete floors. In practical design, considering the advantage of high-strength concrete in taking compression, a continuous HSC column is intersected by NSC floor. It is of great interest to understand the mechanism of load transmission through such type of connection and summarize the general behavior of that. Moreover, it is necessary to investigate possible parameters which may have impacts on the loading capacity. Firstly, literature study was carried out to know existent solutions to this problem. Previous papers and standard codes in different regions were reviewed. Laboratory experiments and proposed equations from literature review were analyzed in this thesis. Different equations were compared, and impacts of parameters were discussed. Seeing deficiencies in previous researches, a numerical experimental program was proposed to investigate the stated problem. Considering advantages in simulating concrete structures, ATENA program was selected as a tool for finite element analysis. Before the parameter study, in order to investigate the general behavior of the connection between HSC column and NSC floor, one standard specimen was constructed. As for the standard specimen, all settings were in accordance with common designs. Only a monotonic load was applied to the structure. The observation and results during the process of loading were recorded and analyzed in this part. The mechanisms of load transmission through the connections were conceived. After that, a parameter study was conducted based on the standard specimen. Four parameters were selected by setting four series of specimens. From series A to D, variables in each series were the concrete strength, the flexural reinforcement in the floor, the aspect ratio (the ratio between the slab thickness to the column width), and the floor loading. Through variable control, each parameter was investigated and their impacts on connections were discussed. At the last, conclusions were drawn regrading to numerical tests. Guidelines for designing a connection between high-strength columns and normal-strength floors were proposed.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Ruiter, I.A. (mentor); Vrielink, K. (mentor)","2016","With the Netherlands moving more and more towards a circular economy, stricter waste management policies and regulations demand developments in the household waste separation sector. The more household waste that is collected in separate fractions, the more waste that can be reused or recycled into valuable material again, rather than ending up at the landfill. Dutch waste system developments like Reversed Waste Collection and ‘polluter pays’ systems are implemented more and more by municipalities and have ensured that low-rise waste separation has reached a reasonable level. However, high-rise still lags behind significantly due to the influence of various contextual factors on separation behaviour. The initial aim for this graduation project was to design an incentive system in order to stimulate household waste separation in high-rise areas. A deprived high-rise neighbourhood in Arnhem was chosen as a case study for this project, under the important condition that the designed solution would be applicable in other high-rise areas as well, in order to be cost effective. After extensive analysis of waste systems, separation behaviour and high-rise contexts and exploration of different ideas and concepts, the conclusion led to a change in the design direction. On the one hand, it seemed impossible to develop an innovative ‘one size fits all’ solution for every high-rise area, because of the great discrepancies between high-rise contexts, its residents and the corresponding waste systems. On the other hand, municipalities often implement a waste system citywide, while the aforementioned context differences indicate that one type of system will not affect every high-rise context. In other words: in order to stimulate high-rise residents to separate their waste, context-specific – customised – solutions are needed. In addition to basic waste systems and facilities, many so-called intervention strategies exist that could somehow stimulate someone’s separation behaviour. These interventions exist in various shapes and sizes and nowadays, municipalities experience difficulties with finding a clear overview of all possibilities as well as searching for the right (combination of) interventions for a particular neighbourhood. The ‘Maatwerk voor Afvalscheiding’ (MvA) toolkit is therefore developed to support municipalities in finding a context-specific addition to the existing waste system, in order to eventually stimulate high-rise waste separation behaviour. A toolkit session should be held by a project group, not only participated by the municipality and its cooperating waste management company, but also with social stakeholders like a social housing company, a welfare organisation, a neighbourhood platform and perhaps even high-rise residents. These parties are more involved in the particular high-rise area, allowing the project group to make a more substantiated decision. Individual usability tests have indicated that potential users are very enthusiastic about the MvA toolkit and find it a relevant and welcome development in the field of high-rise waste separation. Further development is needed in order to complete the toolkit and pilot sessions with project groups have to find out whether a realistic discussion and outcome can lead to a context-specific addition to the waste system. For now, the MvA toolkit seems to be a promising design and chances are that this project will be continued.","waste system; high-rise; household waste; waste separation; waste interventions; toolkit; customisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Molenaar, W.F. (mentor); Hofland, B. (mentor); Van Almen, M. (mentor)","2016","Navigation locks are used to transport vessels between waterways with different water levels. In the nearby future many navigation locks will be renovated or replaced. During the design of a new lock still some unknown factors are encountered. One of these factors is the vibration of the valve. The valve is part of the filling and emptying system that is responsible for the levelling of the water in the lock chamber. The most used valve type is a vertical-lift valve. During the filling and emptying of the lock, water flows with high velocity underneath the valve. The flow of water can cause vibrations. These vibrations are called flow-induced vibrations and could lead to failure of the valve system. Possible failures are for example that the operating machinery will not be able to open the valve or that the valve will hit other elements due to the vibrations. As a consequence the lock gate complex cannot meet its requirements anymore. Several types of flow-induced vibrations can be distinguished. This distinction is based on the cause of the vibration. This research only focussed on vibrations due to turbulence and instability of the flow. The above-mentioned types can be experienced in two directions. The two directions are in-flow (horizontal in the direction of the flow) and cross-flow (perpendicular to the direction of the flow). A valve is more likely to vibrate in a vertical direction than a horizontal direction, because the majority of the valves is positioned in a niche of a gate or culvert. Currently not much information regarding the flow-induced vibrations due to turbulence or instability of the water flow is available and the information that is available is often out dated. The shape could have an effect on the flow-induced vibrations. This seal has to ensure the water tightness of the valve. No research has been done on the effects of the seal shapes, which are used nowadays, on the dynamic behaviour. Therefore, the information of the effect of seal shapes as used in practice is missing. In the current situation a guideline involving the natural frequency of the valve system is used. This guideline states that the natural frequency of the valve has to be larger than three times the excitation frequency. Therefore, the main research question of this research is: What is the effect of the shape of the lower edge seal on the vertical flow-induced vibrations of a valve in a filling and emptying culvert? The vibration phenomena have been investigated by means of a physical model. A simplified scale model of the valve is constructed and tested in a current flume under varying conditions. The varying parameters during these tests are the flow velocity underneath the valve, the stiffness of the vertical suspension, the gate opening underneath the valve and the shape of the lower edge seal. Four different seal shapes have been tested. The tests have been executed under steady state conditions. In addition to the steady state tests, free-decay tests (to determine the natural frequency and damping) and tests to determine the contraction have been executed. The physical tests showed that the shape did have an effect on the presence of the flow-induced vibrations and on the amplitude of the vibrations. However some other parameters influenced the vibrations. For example the relative gate opening and the Reynolds number. The study has proven the presence of the flow-induced vibrations. However, the executed physical model test should be optimized to get a more accurate view on the different phenomena. Also should the effect of certain parameters (Reynolds number, water levels) be further investigated.","Flow Instability; Flow-Induced Vibrations; Valve; Physical Model Test","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Vink, P. (mentor)","2016","Persons spend on average one third of their life asleep. Getting enough sleep has a major impact on how a person looks, feels and functions on a daily basis. However, over the past century, there has been a consistent rapid decrease in sleep quality and an increase of sleep complaints among children, adolescents and the middle-aged population. Occasional sleep difficulties are normal, but evidence from various countries continues to demonstrate that recurring troubles with initiating or maintaining sleep – commonly referred to as insomnia – is often a highly persistent condition, affecting one in three adults. Pharmacological therapy has been widely used to treat sleep onset issues. However, the usefulness of these pharmaceutical agents for a long-term intervention is limited by their adverse side effects. Due to the limited amount of non-pharmacological and scientifically proven solutions for insomnia currently available on the market, there exists an unmet need for an effective, non-obtrusive and risk-free sleep inducing solution to support behavior and lifestyle change in problem sleepers and stressed individuals at a low threshold. Based on the observation that certain individuals fall asleep more easily when riding in a car or train, this project hypothesizes that the combination of auditory- and vibrotactile stimulation is an effective method to promote fast sleep onset and counteract high arousal or stress levels during to the process of initiating sleep. A Latin square, placebo-controlled, within subject design was executed with sixteen healthy normal- sleeping adults using both objective and subjective measurements of sleep onset latency and subjective measurements of change in stress and arousal levels. A Multiple Sleep Latency Test protocol was followed, which involved a full-day test that consisted of four scheduled daytime sleep attempts separated by a two-hour interval. The premature findings of the executed study provide some scientific basis for understanding the direct relationship between the combination of auditory- and vibrotactile stimulation and sleep onset latency. Although the objective measurements of this study demonstrated no statistically significant differences, there exist promising subjective effects, which stipulates a first step into the direction that monaural beats and vibrations can be used to improve and maintain health and wellbeing. To conclude, a product that utilizes monaural beats and vibrations during to the process of initiating sleep fills the need for a non-obtrusive, risk-free and easy-to-use sleep inducing solution. Although a selection of auditory- and vibrotactile parameters was found to be effective, the outcomes of the conclusive questionnaire indicated large discrepancies in how participants experienced the stimulation conditions, i.e. there were diverse subjective reports of having both increased difficulties as improvements with getting into sleep and/or maintaining a relaxed state of mind. Hence it can be concluded that the usefulness of monaural beats and vibrations depend heavily on personal preferences and are not conform to the one-size-fits-all approach. For that reason, persons who are suffering from insomnia and looking to enhance their sleep experience should be able to identify and use sound and vibration characteristics they enjoy as a self- administered complementary intervention to facilitate fast sleep onset and counteract high arousal or stress levels during to the process of initiating sleep. Moreover, there are an increasing number of companies that are launching products and applications that employ sensory stimulation techniques to improve sleep, but do so without providing any supportive evidence. In addition to that, many persons are still skeptical how much benefit wearables and sleep trackers really offer, as currently all they are focused on is collecting and displaying data. SoundSleep, the concept developed in this graduation project, intends to go beyond that, by enhancing a person’s sleep quality without having to spend more time in bed. This product encompasses a non- invasive mattress cover packed with smart responsive technology, which is able to provide a fully personalized- and invisible experience of monaural beats and vibrations. The incorporated technology is able to accurately track sleep and deliver stimulation to preferred parts of the body without the user having to be fixated to a device during the night. Hence SoundSleep enhances the sleep experience rather than limits the user in terms of sleeping positions and freedom of movement. What is powerful about SoundSleep is that it keeps sleep as much as possible to the basics; upgrades an object that is extremely familiar to all of us; functions on any mattress and hence every body; and does not require any new behaviors or complicated installations.

(mentor)","2016","From the bacteria living on a keyboard to algae surviving in snow, microorganisms can be found virtually everywhere on the planet. Due to their small size, microorganism swim in the low Reynolds number regime, which has important consequences for their swimming strategies. For motility, these organisms commonly use long slender filaments known as cilia or flagella, located at the exterior of the cell. Eukaryotic flagella are active structures with molecular motors distributed along their length. The precise mechanism of self-organization of the beat is still unknown. This study focuses on the changes in kinematics, forces and rate of work when subjecting the eukaryotic microalgae C. reinhardtii to imposed flows. C. reinhardtii cells are clamped using a micropipette and subjected to a periodic flow generated by a piezoelectric element. Video recordings are processed using a custom-made Matlab script that uses Gaussian background modeling and principal component analysis to recover the flagellar waveforms. An accurate boundary element method computational code is used to calculate the forces on the cell body and flagella. When beating in absence of a background flow, we found a viscous rate of work of 69 fW RMS, with a peak of 110 fW, much higher than suggested by existing literature. The rate of work to deform the elastic flagella is 176 fW RMS with peaks of -360/+160 fW. The elastic forces dominate the overall power profiles, so that the instantaneous power is mostly determined by the kinematics rather than the viscous dissipation. Flagella can cease to beat altogether if the applied load is high enough. No such “stalling point” has been found, however the cell did show a truncated stroke with a 30% decreased amplitude and a 10% increased frequency when beating in antiphase with a 3 mm/s flow. This stroke pattern is similar to antiphase beating in the ptx mutant of C. reinhardtii and phase slips in wild-type cells.","eukaryotic flagellum; low Reynolds number; Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; Boundary Element Method; kinematics; rate of work; synchronization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","","","Process and Energy","",""

(mentor); Nick, H.M. (mentor); Peksa, A.E. (mentor)","2016","Experimental studies and three dimensional finite element core scale and field scale models were used to study the effect of calcite dissolution on low-enthalpy sandstone geothermal reservoirs. A series of core flooding experiments were conducted, monitoring the porosity and permeability at 150 ◦C and 20 bars back pressure to see the effect of calcite dissolution by Glutamic acid Di-Acetic acid (GLDA). These experiments are supported by the critical salt concentration and critical fines migration velocity tests in order to ensure that any pressure variations in the core is due to the injected chelating agent and not due to other mechanical effects or chemically damaging reactions. This data obtained is then used in a core scale finite element model to obtain the corresponding kinetic and dissolution parameters. These parameters are then implemented on a field scale (homogeneous and heterogeneous) reservoir model to see the effect of calcite dissolution on the well productivity. Process based facies modelling is utilised to construct realistic heterogeneous reservoir models. In an effort to understand the effect of flow direction in the reservoir, samples were tested for the critical velocity of fines migration in three directions and it was observed that the critical velocity of fines migration in the different samples were similar, showing the homogeneous nature of the samples. From the homogeneous field scale model, for a given volume of acid injected, the effect of calcite dissolution was analysed for 5, 10, 30 and 50% calcite concentration in the reservoir. The estimated values of well productivity and equivalent permeability for 10, 30 and 50% calcite concentration were found to be in a decreasing order with 10% having the highest value. Interestingly, in the case of 5% calcite concentration the well productivity and equivalent permeability were estimated the lowest. In the case of power required by the pump the 5% calcite concentration required the highest power while the 10%, 30% and 50% were found to be in a increasing order with 10% calcite concentration requiring the least power. Although the acid penetration for the 5% calcite concentration was the furthest, the permeability improvement was too low to have a positive impact on the equivalent permeability, well productivity and power required by the pump. From the heterogeneous model, it was observed that the lifetime of the reservoir increases with increasing stimulation. This model could be used as a predictive tool for estimating the lifetime increment for a given volume of acid injected. Our simulation results show that the penetration depth (acid front) of acid is highly affected by the radial flow characteristics in field scale simulations, as the penetration depth is not linearly correlated to the volume of acid injected.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-10-18","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

(mentor); Huisman, S.M.H. (mentor)","2016","Motivation: Reversible epigenetic modifications that happen on the DNA’s histones, namely histone modifications, play an important role in gene regulation by controlling the accessibility of different functional genomic regions. Such modifications have been measured and primarily studied on genes or their promoters, but a currently interesting and less studied category of functional elements are enhancers. Enhancer regions can be found virtually anywhere along our non-coding DNA and through looping towards the promoters of target genes they contribute to their normal ex-pression patterns. Abnormal epigenetic signatures and somatic mutations in those regions can interfere with the en-hancer’s looping procedure and result in irregular gene expression patterns, a crucial contributor in cancer develop-ment. Results: In this paper we propose a method which utilizes epigenetic information across multiple cell types, to form reliable enhancer – gene pairs. The formation of each pair is based on the multiple correlation between epigenetic mark enrichment of an enhancer set and a gene’s expression. The pairing procedure deals with the increased computational requirements caused by the multi-dimensional nature of the data and constructs pairs which follow the literature notion of frequent linearly proximal enhancers. The distribution of distances of each pair’s elements, showed different results in regulation proximity between our method’s pairs and a number of randomized sets of pairs. These pairs are assem-bled into multiple enhancer-gene (EG) networks which include multiple connected subnetworks of different sizes. On each EG network we overlaid non-coding somatic mutations and found that enhancers of cancer census genes have a higher percentage of mutated enhancers as well as more regulating enhancers, than non-cancer genes. The mutation percentages and the within-pair distances showed different behaviour among chromosomes as well as epigenetic marks. Finally, we inserted these into network databases so that they can accept queries and be easily extendable. Conclusion: The core of this paper deals with the subject of enhancer cis-regulation and we have performed analyses in order to link regulating enhancers to their target genes, a recent and increasingly important task since the availability of high quality data. The subsequent EG networks depict the circuitry of regulation within a cell’s nucleus as well as the mutational landscape and are excellent candidates for further exploration of either the role of specific enhancers in gene misregulation during cancer or more generic characteristics of cancer related enhancers that affect cancer driver genes.","Epigenetics; Gene Regulation; Enhancers; EG networks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems","","Pattern Recognition and Bioinformatics","",""

Among these are the MOX and polymer based sensors. However, the MOX sensors have larger power consumption and poor selectivity. The main drawback of the polymer based gas sensor is the short lifetime and drift in measured signal over its lifetime. In this thesis work, aMetal Organic Frameworks (MOF) MEMS gas sensor is designed and fabricated. The sensor requires a micro-hotplate and an Interdigitated electrodes (IDC) capacitor where the IDC needs to have capacitance values in the pico-farad range. This is achieved by using modeling and FEM simulations to arrive at the final design. Before the final device first a proof of concept design is developed and fabricated. This has the purpose of proving the in-situMOF growth method for obtaining the sensing layer used as the dielectric of the IDC capacitor. The microhotplate is designed to be as low power as possible not exceeding 20mW. The design is derived from design rules and FEM simulations to arrive at the design parameters in order to achieve not only low power consumption but also high temperature uniformity. The membrane and micro-hotplate are designed to be efficient. The designed device is fabricated in the EKL and MEMS labs at the TU Delft while keeping the process flow as simple as possible. Both the design and the fabrication are developed to be a baseline for developing such gas sensors. The successful process developed during the project has produced >95% yield in final micro-hotplate and IDC devices. The devices show successful preliminary gas measurements for different concentration methanol.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-10-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","Electronic Components, Technology and Materials","",""

(mentor)","2016","The modern world is facing challenges like the depletion of fossil fuels and the rising demand of energy while decreasing CO2 emission to counteract climate change. As the vast majority of mankind populates (mega-)cities, one option of tackling these challenges could be the installation of photovoltaic/thermal(PV/T) hybrid-solar systems on the facades of skyscrapers. This thesis investigates this option using Hong Kong as the study site due to the fact that it is one of the most densely populated cities in the world packed with high-rise buildings. The PV/T hybrid solar panel technology encompasses both a solar collector and solar cells. The heat produced by the solar cells can be used to heat up water and such heat can be transferred away from the solar cells, which increases the electrical performance. Our envisioned system will be installed on a commercial skyscraper the International Commerce Centre(ICC) and includes PV/T hybrid-solar panels, micro-inverters, pumps and heat storage. The main question of this thesis is: What are the opportunities for hybrid building integrated photovoltaic/thermal solar systems in the city of Hong Kong? The primary objective is to model such a system for a skyscraper in Hong Kong and investigate the thermal and electrical performance. The secondary objective is to assess the likely economic and environmental costs. The building is modeled in SketchUp. It will allow solar irradiance and shadowing effects to be taken into account following Sun's path. The exact position of the building with its facades orientation relative to the position of the sun and meteorological data from Meteonorm, are the inputs of the irradiance model running in Matlab and of the thermal model running in TrnSys. We have deployed the Perez model and taken into account the albedo component for modeling the diffused irradiance. The results of the irradiance and the thermal model are inputs for the total hybrid-solar system model, which outputs the electric and thermal yield and the water temperature as function of altitude on the building's facade. The simulated efficiencies in our hybrid-solar system are 53.1% for the thermal part and 16.5% for the electrical part. We have found that the temperature of panels does not exceed 40°C, which benefits the overall electrical efficiency. On the ICC 19,808 panels can be installed without covering any windows. According to our study, which does not take into account hydraulic losses when scaling up the hybrid-solar system to the whole building, the annual electrical and thermal energy yield are 3.39 GWh and 12.5 GWh, respectively.

(mentor)","2016","The Double Slip Joint (DSJ) is a new design concept to connect the transition piece to the foundation pile of an offshore wind turbine. It potentially offers high dynamic strength and reliability at a lower cost of installation and maintenance compared to other conventional techniques thereby contributing to the decrease of the cost of the wind energy. The design is based on a self-locking principle through vertical settlement of the joint. The objective of the thesis is the further development of a DSJ which is optimized for fabrication, whereby the rings are produced by rolling. First, the geometry of the Rolled DSJ scale model is designed. Second, a rolled-DSJ scale model with a larger wedge angle and ring thickness has been built and five experiments including multiple tests were conducted. Third, the rolled-DSJ is excited by a high frequency load and modelled in ANSYS in order to investigate the dynamic behaviour under settlement. The Rolled DSJ has the same settling behaviour and principle with machined DSJ. The self-locking principle of both types of DSJ (machined and rolled DSJ) under various loading conditions is confirmed experimentally. Settlement depth increases when horizontal/vertical loads exceed previously applied loads or when the direction of the applied load is switched. Installation of DSJ underwater seems not to influence the settling behaviour. An extreme settling depth could be reached when the vertical load is against only by the normal force from the ring. Compared with low frequency excitation, higher frequency excitation yields shorter installation periods at lower amplitude. However, in reality, large amplitude loads required for settling have frequency below 0.5 Hz, the settlement of DSJ per cycle should be similar to quasi-static behaviour. First the reader is introduced into the subject, the project definition and the approach is presented. Afterwards it is described how the scale model was designed and fabricated. The loading strategy is explained for five experiments and the results and interpretation are presented. Then, a FE model of the prototype is developed in ANSYS and a parametric study is performed. Conclusions are reached and recommendations for further testing, numerical analysis and development of the DSJ are given.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-10-17","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Current X-ray machines use lower radiation doses which introduces noise to the output images. Therefore such systems need to enhance the image and reduce the noise via different algorithms to provide the best possible output. In addition, it is crucial to accelerate these image processing algorithms as the output is intended to be a real time video (uoroscopy). Such systems are used for example in surgeries for implants or other medical examinations and there is a need to provide constant performance, otherwise they may lead to injuries or fatalities due to latency issues. Currently, such systems often rely on server PCs to implement the image processing chains. Since PC hardware needs to be replaced regularly during the lifetime of an X-ray machine, this increases the maintenance cost as well as the overall cost of the machine significantly. Therefore, we need to provide a framework that would allow us to develop the algorithm only once and then enable us to port it to a new platform, while the performance is ensured. In order to do so, a high performance framework solution was investigated. A number of alternative solutions were investigated and the most attractive framework was selected to be the Open Computing Language (OpenCL). OpenCL provides the means to develop the image processing algorithm once and port it to different platforms, changing only the target platform from the OpenCL API. During this thesis exploration we were able to redevelop a high quality algorithm provided by Philips Healthcare from a Matlab model to OpenCL in an optimal time period, while we investigated portability and performance. We first developed a tool chain that enables transformation from Matlab to OpenCL. Furthermore, 11 image processing kernels which constitute the algorithm were developed in OpenCL performing a speedup of up to 150x in some cases. We were able to run the algorithm on three different hardware platforms using the same OpenCL kernels and achieve a speedup up to of 36x compared to the baseline implementation in C.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Quantum Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","This research focuses on the marine litter propagation in port environments, where several aspects influence the marine litter movements. Many studies in literature confirm that the biggest part of solid litter on a global scale is transported via rivers, and originated from land bases sources. The items vary in many materials but plastics certainly account for the vast majority. Drifting towards the ocean, the marine litter flows through port areas, which are the main link with the inland waterways. As seaports are generally designed like tree structures with many branches, the marine litter gets divided when entering a port area. A part of the litter accumulates at the ends of these branches, and a part passes through the port area towards the open sea. Port authorities consider the implementation of both static and dynamic cleaning solutions that have recently be invented. When placing the static cleaning solutions at certain positions, it would be most efficient when the marine litter accumulation locations are known. Therefor, this research proposes a propagationmodel in order to simulate the marine litter movements inside port areas. Given the complexity of the port environment and the the dynamic movements of marine litter, the propagation model incorporates a hydrodynamic model. A hydrodynamic model can be used to describe, define and simulate water movements in environments such as port areas, in order to achieve the most realistic results. A specific case study is performed in order to verify the application of the generic model, and hereby a hydrodynamic model of the case study environment is developed. The model is developed using the Delft3D hydrodynamic modeling software of Deltares, and it is imposed to boundary conditions in order to accurately describe the water flow. The main boundary conditions are the variable river flow rate and water levels, which are fluctuating due to the impact of changing tides. The developed model has been validated by comparing simulation results with real life measurements. The model output was hereby compared to data regarding the water level, obtained from Rijkswaterstaat, and measurements of both the water level and the flow velocity, obtained from the case study port authorities. From these comparisons it is concluded that the developed hydrodynamic model accurately describes the water flow in the port area. A particle tracking tool is used to discharge separate particles and to track their path in time, in order to simulate the marine litter propagation within the port area. During the time of this research very few quantitative data regarding marine litter inside port areas was available. Therefor, a number of scenarios have been proposed in order to determine how the litter items behave under the influences of the different aspects. By distinguishing between litter items floating at- and drifting below the surface, and imposing several wind conditions, the impacts of these and other aspects are investigated. Overestimated discharge input values are chosen such that the discharged particles accumulate at several locations. From analyzing the simulation results of the different scenarios, it is concluded that the port structure affects the movements of marine litter, and that tidal ranges affect the marine litter inside port areas on a relatively short term. Furthermore the impact of wind conditions is a dominant factor for the movements of marine litter floating at the surface, and the river flow is dominant for litter items drifting below the surface level. A number of accumulation sites are found, but naturally they vary per scenario since the different aspects influence the marine litter. This report displays the knowledge that has been acquired during a literature study, from which decisions for the modeling approach are made. It demonstrates the potential of hydrodynamic modeling and explains the process of developing a propagation model. Since researches regarding marine litter propagation in port environments are relatively young and few quantitative data is available to date, much potential in this topic exists. Therefor, the findings of this report can be taken further in the strive for creating a cleaner environment.","","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Transport Engineering and Logistics","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","The oil and gas industry uses dedicated computer models to design their production systems, which typically includes the reservoir, wells, pipelines, and processing facilities (such as separators, compressors, pumps). In these models, the well and the reservoir are often considered as separated systems that communicate with each other through the near wellbore region. The size and geometry of both systems are often completely different yielding distinct spatial and temporal characteristic length scales. Typically, well phenomena are in the order of seconds to hours, whereas reservoir phenomena range between days and years. This motivates the approach to treat both systems separately, as the dynamic response of one system is hardly influenced by the other system. However, there are certain dynamic flow phenomena where the transients have compara- ble time and length scales, such that a coupled simulation approach is necessary. The goal of this project was to extend the Shell single phase well-reservoir simulator to two-phase flow for simulation of well reservoir transients. To achieve this goal, four different steps were identified: a literature study was carried out, a two-phase reservoir model has been developed, an existing well code has been mod- ified to include a two-phase drift-flux model, and the coupling between the well model and the reservoir model has been designed. This research is conducted in the team of Shell Projects & Technology, as part of a master graduation project at the Delft University of Technology. The project has been finalised within a period of 11 months. The two-phase immiscible reservoir equations have been discretised in space using a second-order accurate finite volume method. Second-order time integration was obtained using implicit BDF2 time integration, which is necessary due to the stiff character of the reservoir equations. The well model uses a drift-flux formulation. An existing well code, which is a second-order accurate finite volume method, has been modified in order to be coupled to the reservoir. Again, BDF2 time integration is employed for the temporal discretisation. The coupling has been realised in a monolithic fashion. The coupling with respect to single phase flow has been modified to accommodate the drift-flux model. The coupled simulator showed no difficulties in run- ning simulations with either very small time steps (seconds) or large time steps (years). This stable behaviour is greatly desired, since it enables solving different types of applications with one single simulator. Two different academic cases have been investigated: a production ramp-up (focus on well transients) and a water flooding case (focus on reservoir transients). Based on these cases, the following can be concluded. When considering the dynamics in the well, the transients in the reservoir need to be taken into account. The comparison of the coupling with a dynamic reservoir and an Inflow Performance Curve (IPC) showed that the transient behaviour in the well was calculated incorrectly when an IPC was employed, stressing the need for a coupled simulator. When considering dynamics in the reservoir, the transients in the well have a negligible effect on the dy- namics in the reservoir. The characteristic time scales of the reservoir are generally larger (several orders in magnitude) than the time scales of the well. In this case, the need for a coupled simulator is less evident. The long term goal of Shell is to extend Compas, which is their in-house dynamic multiphase pipeline and well simulator, with a dynamic reservoir model. The two-phase model for the well that is available in Compas is different from the drift flux model used in this study. Shell is particularly interested in simulating liquid loading and in designing intelligent systems, such as smart wells. The coupling through multiple coupling points is essential. Therefore, it is recommended that the reservoir model should be extended to multiple layers. Second, the focus of this study was on development and verification of a dynamic two-phase well-reservoir code. The performance of the code has been tested using academic test cases. However, the real validation of the model has not been considered. It is thus recommended to validate the model using experimental and/or field data.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & Propulsion","","","",""

(mentor); Jepma, E.J. (mentor)","2016","This thesis presents the conceptual design process of a new intervention to stimulate pro-environmental disposal behaviour. Littering is a growing problem in the world. Research shows that the brand which is found most between the litter in the Netherlands is Red Bull. Although many interventions have been applied to try to change behaviour of litterers in the Netherlands, the littering behaviour of the Red Bull consumer remains a problem. This thesis concentrates on the question how the Red Bull consumer can be stimulated to dispose their can in an environmental friendly way. Different studies have been conducted within a cultural and social design approach. This is done in order to identify the different elements that influence the consumption and disposal of the Red Bull energy drink within the Dutch culture. From the analysis it appeared that (at the moment of purchasing a Red Bull can) as good as every Dutch consumer has the intention to dispose the can in an environmental friendly way, but the problem is that they do not always act according this intention. From these insights the aim emerged to strengthen the attitude of the Red Bull consumer towards the social norm of appropriate disposal behaviour. The final proposed concept Halo motivates users to behave according to their intended behaviour. At the moment of purchase the Red Bull consumer is offered to choose between the Halo edition; a limited edition with a golden wrap on top of the can, and the original edition. By choosing the Halo edition he or she promises to himself to dispose the empty can in an environmental friendly way. In this design the golden wrap is the mark that represents the good behaviour. The golden wrap not only reminds the user during the consumption to keep his promise. By choosing a remarkable packaging this person is also able to propagate this intended behaviour to his social environment. To communicate the concept and explain the function of the new design, a movie is presented on the vending machine or fridge, The understandability of the concept has been tested among different levels of education, who positively responded to both the new appearance and the idea behind the concept. Finally, the feedback from users and experts are used to evaluate and reflect on the introduced concept. Further recommendations are made to optimize the user experience of the initiated concept.","design; behaviour; sustainability; social design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

Zoos have the potential to inspire, educate and influence a lot of people regarding wildlife conservation. Dierenpark Amersfoort, the most child-friendly zoo in the Netherlands, founded the Wildlife Fund. This fund raises money for the wild counterparts of animals in the zoo and supports conservation projects across the world. However, the Wildlife Fund is not clearly visible in Dierenpark Amersfoort. The challenge of this project was to design a product that increases Dierenpark Amersfoort’s visitors’ awareness of the Wildlife Fund and inspires them to take action regarding the conservation of wildlife. The concept uses storytelling to get visitors acquainted with Olly, a young elephant. Olly is the personification of the Wildlife Fund. His animal friends in nature are threatened, but Olly is determined to save them. He travels the world to help endangered animals. During his missions, Olly discovers that each animal has superpowers. He wants to share his adventures and these amazing facts about animals with the zoo visitors. Large totem poles that display all animals the Wildlife Fund has done projects for stand at the zoo entrance to catch the visitors’ attention. In the zoo, visitors can find out how Olly saved his friends on Wildlife Fund signs. Children can discover the superpowers of the animals Olly has helped, hidden in totems throughout the zoo. Moreover, they learn that they can help Olly with his mission by creating homes for Dutch animals in their own garden. At the zoo shop, visitors can buy a do-it-yourself kit to build such an animal house. The profits of these kits go to the Wildlife Fund, which means that the visitors contribute to the conservation of wildlife both close to home and far away.","wildlife conservation; free choice learning; education; zoo; experience design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2016","This research aims at improving the performance of Helmholtz resonators by adding resistance using additive manufacturing. Current use of Helmholtz resonators is focused on tonal applications and modal issues, because of the frequency specific behaviour. A normal Helmholtz resonator curve has a decreasing bandwidth when the peak increases. The research has been conducted by creating different samples, using the printing technique of stereolithography (SLA) and testing these in the impedance tube. Simultaneously the samples are modelled and analysed in Comsol. Starting from a theoretical research, the focus has been two-sided. First a possibility of adjusting the impedance of the absorbing mechanism was investigated, resulting in samples with larger squared geometrical adjustments. The results showed no significant improvement and very low velocity within the voids of the Helmholtz resonator's neck. Changes in the absorption coefficient were related to the reduction of the orifice radius, as was also predicted by analytical solutions. The second focus was the option of increasing the boundary layer thickness. This has been investigated by squared and triangular geometries with similar thickness. Results showed that there was no increase in boundary layer thickness and absorption coefficient. From these results it was possible to conclude that resistance is effective in the travelling direction of the plane wave, leading to a different iteration in the process. Surface area increase effects were researched by adding finned structures into the neck of the Helmholtz resonator and by using curved orifice patterns. Additional research on extending the fins within the volume proved not to be better performing. The results for the curved orifice showed an increase in absorption coefficient without adjusting the resonating frequency. By using the simulations in Comsol Multiphysics it was possible to predict the trend of the absorption coefficient curve, but additional research needs to be done to be able to rely on these results. From the research it can be concluded that there is a high potential for resistance based performance improvement by increasing the surface area of the Helmholtz resonator neck. The height of the absorption coefficient curve can be increased without decreasing (and thus enlarging) the bandwidth, allowing for an easier combination of resonators to create broadband absorption.","sound absorption; acoustics; additive manufacturing; helmholtz resonator; resistance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Groot, K.J. (mentor); Pecnik, R. (mentor)","2016","A comprehensive understanding of the stability of shear flows is a fundamental problem in fluid mechanics and it has been a subject of both theoretical and practical interest in engineering research. A key aspect of these dynamic flows is the behaviour exhibited by the instabilities as it evolves from initial small perturbations of an equilibrium state, and may lead to fluctuations. In order to control these fluctuations, a study on the spatial and temporal evolution of the perturbations must be carried out. The objective of this thesis is to perform the spatio-temporal stability analysis on the plane, incompressible shear layers representing confined and unconfined shear flows. The analysis requires the estimation of the response of the flow to the initial perturbations for fixed values of relevant parameters. The numerical tools are developed for the low order piecewise linear profile approximations to the shear layers. The influence of typical flow features, like single and multiple shear dynamics, on the stability behaviour is studied and the convective/absolute instability boundary for various parameter combinations are identified. After validation for the analytical models, the numerical tools are extended to the non-analytical models. The analysis is then performed for higher order approximations of the experimental base flows in order to validate the results from the toolkit. A variation of the flow features and variables can change the stability behaviour of the shear flows. The single shear layer dynamics cannot contribute to absolute instability in the absence of a dispersive medium, like surface tension. The surface tension acts as a stabilising mechanism for perturbations of short wavelength. The multiple shear layer dynamics dictates that the unconfined jet or wake flow is more unstable than the single shear layer with equivalent parameter values, and that very high values of surface tension stabilises all perturbations. For confined jet or wake flows, the varicose mode perturbations are found to be highly absolutely unstable in the strongly confined dense inner flow limit. The temporal branches obtained from the toolkit match with the Linear Stability Theory (LST) results. This is a key result that allows the extension of the numerical tools developed for the low order analytical models to be applied to the non-analytical models obtained for higher order approximations of the experimental base flow.","instability; shear flow; dispersion relation; , local stability analysis; local stability analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","","",""

Aside from quantifying this uncertainty, another objective of this research is to develop a framework for optimising the sampling density, as the availability of samples for geotechnical site characterisation is often limited. The development of the framework is based on real data, concerning a heavy mineral sand deposit: this data, however, proved to be insufficiently dense for uncertainty analysis. Therefore a decision was made, based on this observation, to create a virtual reality in high density which allows for performing the desired investigations. The assessment of geotechnical risk consists of multiple steps: data interpretation and preparation, geostatistical simulation, data processing and, lastly, analysing the results. During preparation the geotechnical units were identified, suitable simulation methods based on literature were chosen and the decision was made to generate a virtual dataset. For continuous properties Sequential Gaussian Simulation was used; in case of a categorical or a discrete property, Sequential Indicator Simulation was adopted. The simulations result in 100 realisations, for each simulated property: unit top and bottom boundaries, SPT 𝑁 values and the locations of indurated zones. These realisations then allow for analysing possible distributions and the uncertainty related to these parameters and their propagation through transfer functions. Five different sampling strategies were implemented: three regularly spaced grids (100, 250 and 500 m) and two clustered grids (500 m regularly spaced with preferred zones). After combining the various simulation results, the effect of these grids is assessed by investigating the inferred variograms, RMSE, P90 and P10 values and distributions of production forecasts. It is observed that the geostatistical methods are suitable for geotechnical risk analysis and, generally, an increase in sampling density leads a decrease in prediction uncertainty. However, the absolute number of samples is not directly related to this trend: preferred samples and their locations should also be taken into account here, as their effect proved to be less predictable.","dredging; wet mining; geotechnical engineering; site investigation; risk analysis; production forecasting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-10-14","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Kobus, C.B.A. (mentor)","2016","The energy transition is characterised by the growth of intermittent and thus non-steerable energy sources such as solar photovoltaic and wind. The technology development in the PV sector enables consumers to move beyond passive consumption of electricity towards becoming active producers of their own energy. This led to an increasing number of prosumers who represent an important segment of the energy market and change the former energy system into a more decentralised one. When demand is low, surplus of energy is fed back into the mains power grid – currently for no loss in money for prosumers. These developments lead to the challenge of balancing energy supply and demand. Solar energy and energy storage are seen as a major opportunity for integrating renewable energy in residential areas. This is why Eneco became the first supplier of the home battery Tesla Powerwall in the Netherlands. Implementing Powerwalls at residents’ places and connecting them towards a battery swarm, called Tesla Powerwall Swarm (TPS), offers the added value of providing primary reserve capacity to balance frequency disruptions of the mains power grid; implying that customers would share parts of their battery with the utility. Therefore, there are several uncertainties towards consumers’ reactions and acceptance of such a system. The goal of this project is to analyse consumer perceptions towards Tesla Powerwall in order to create future product acceptance. The research questions are related to (1) the extent to which independence from energy suppliers is desirable for customers, (2) the brand influence of Tesla on the acceptance of home batteries and (3) perceived gains and pains of customers regarding Tesla Powerwall Swarm (TPS). To investigate consumer perceptions towards TPS, a qualitative study with 13 participants is conducted in the Netherlands, using in-depth interviewing methodology. Participants’ main drivers and barriers to accept TPS are assigned to the innovation characteristics based on the diffusion of innovation model. The outcomes are used to give recommendations on how to improve consumers’ perceptions towards TPS and on future target groups. The two main implications are as follows: (1) In order to create product acceptance and to stimulate long-term relationships between Eneco and customers, TPS needs to be implemented on the market as a Product-Service-System. (2) ‘Focus on the right target group at the right time. Both implications are converted into one roadmap which illustrates short-term and long-term actions to be taken by Eneco.","consumer perceptions; Tesla Powerwall; energy storage; battery swarm; product acceptance; energy transition; home battery; consumer research; diffusion of innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

Numerical models however are often subjected to a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, especially when dealing with large geographic scales. In this study a new strategy is proposed for simulating storm-induced coastal inundation on dissipative beaches with a simplified shallow-water flow model named SFINCS that is forced with water-level time series along an offshore boundary in the shallow nearshore region. By extending the model domain into the surfzone, the processes of wave runup and overtopping can be simulated in an efficient way using a two-dimensional alongshore-continuous model. SFINCS is validated for a number of one-dimensional and two-dimensional test cases using the process-based Xbeach model as a benchmark for validation. Runup predictions by SFINCS on one-dimensional planar beaches compare well with Xbeach after applying a correction for the short-wave induced setup at the offshore boundary. This correction can be estimated in advance using a newly derived empirical parameterized model. The accuracy of SFINCS in predicting mean overtopping rates on simple beach geometries is comparable to that of empirical models often used in the design of coastal protection works. SFINCS is able to accurately predict the maximum flooding extent for a number of storm scenarios at the case study site of La Jolla along the U.S. coast of Southern California. Predictions of the maximum flood depth correspond well with Xbeach, whereas maximum velocity magnitudes are significantly overestimated locally which can form a limitation for flood damage assessments. Future challenges include the efficient generation of wave boundary conditions for SFINCS and implementation into a larger modeling framework.

After a successful flight test with a multirotor Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV), the question arises whether this technique can be used to successfully design a Flight Control System (FCS) for aircraft in general. This requires additional research on aircraft characteristics that could cause issues related to the stability and performance of the INDI controller. Typical characteristics are additional time delays due to data buses and measurement systems, slower actuator and sensor dynamics, and a lower control frequency. The main contributions of this article are 1) an analytical stability analysis showing that implementing discrete-time INDI with a sampling time smaller than 0.02s results in large stability margins regarding system characteristics and controller gains; 2) a simulation study showing significant performance degradation requiring controller adaptation due to actuator measurement bias, angular rate measurement noise, angular rate measurement delay and actuator measurement delay; 3) the use of a real-time time delay identification algorithm based on latency to successfully synchronize the angular rate and actuator measurement delay together with pseudo control hedging (PCH) to prevent oscillatory behavior; and 4) recommendations regarding control modes, assessment criteria and PH-LAB Cessna Citation specific issues to be used by future contributors to a flight test with INDI on the PH-LAB aircraft.","Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion; Aircraft Attitude Control; Stability; Robustness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-10-14","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operations","","Control & Simulation","",""

(mentor)","2016","With the upcoming trend in electric aviation a good model that describes how the solar spectrum depends on altitude and solar zenith angle can ease the design process significantly. Knowing what solar spectrum to expect makes it possible to design the solar system of an aircraft more efficiently as the optimal incoming energy is included in the weight estimation. However, not only solar powered aircraft bene t from this model. Solar systems in rural mountain areas can use this model to predict more precisely the energy yield of solar systems and their return on investment. In this thesis a model for the prediction of the solar spectrum for various altitudes and solar angles is proposed. This model, that uses the physics of Rayleigh scattering and light absorption to determine the solar spectrum, is found to be accurate for clear skies without clouds and low turbidity. This is because when clear skies are assumed the majority of light interaction can be described by Rayleigh scattering and light absorption. To obtain reliable spectra at cloudy days one needs to include Mie and non-selective scattering to the model. To prove that this model can ease the design process of solar powered aircraft a case study has been performed that focuses on the design of a two-manned solar powered aircraft capable of crossing the globe. This aircraft, also known as a Very High Endurance Solar Powered Aircraft (VHESPA), has been subject to a new weight prediction model. This new weight prediction model has been based on the model proposed by Noth that uses reference solar powered aircraft together with battery and propulsion technology research to come up with a first order weight estimation of solar powered aircraft. To con rm the correctness of this model the designed aircraft has undergone a simulation that reproduces the incoming solar power as well as the power required for continuous flight and the power choices that need to be made throughout the day. It has been found that an aircraft designed using this new weight estimation model gives a reliable first order solar powered aircraft design.","Solar Powered Aircraft; Light; Solar spectrum; Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy / Photovoltaic Materials and Devices","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Though space exploration is an expanding topic, the future missions to the Moon are the firsts to have humans and automated systems working together to explore new terrains. Preparing the future of human-robotic integrated space operations is a stepping stone for lunar missions, and the current study aims to lead the way towards the next giant leap for mankind. While many studies and experiments focus on the realisation and feasibility of human-robotic activities for space applications, there is a gap in knowledge when it comes to the direct preparation of such operations for near-future lunar missions. In order to prepare such activities the performance of both human and system must be assessed, and this requires either regular highly expensive experiments to obtain performance data, or an innovative and lean assessment approach. The proposed method is the performance analysis and modelling of future integrated human-robotic space operations, using existing data from experiments conducted aboard the International Space Station in which a crew member controls a rover located on Earth. This situation creates the ideal scenario for an analogue experiment above and beyond its original objective. By gathering such experiment data and performing a time analysis of the performance, time estimations are made for a set of tasks and the results can be applied to various scenarios of operations without the skyrocketing cost and crew time. The results of this method demonstrated that it is possible to analyse the time of previous experiments to gain insight on the command time of the human operator and the execution time of the system and that a preliminary tool can be developed to assess the command time and execution time for future operations, based on obtained data from previous experiments. Using the time averages of the data from previous experiments, the gaps are filled of data that was not recorded or incorrectly recorded due to error, under the conditions of the assumption. Expanding on this outcome, it can be implemented to simulate mission specific conditions and results. Using existing parameters, this analysis holds potential to pave the way for the future of experiment preparations such that they in turn prepare the road for future missions to the lunar surface.","Human spaceflight; Human-robotics; Space exploration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","Aerospace Engineering","Control and Operations","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","When a shipwreck lies in an undesirable place it can be lifted out of the water or moved to larger water depths(scuttling). Commonly used methods for this procedure are the use of floating sheerlegs, crane ships or chain pullers. Floating sheerlegs and crane ships can be used for lifting the shipwreck through the water column, where chain pullers are mostly used to move the shipwreck to larger water depths. The scuttling procedure will be the main focus of this thesis. Due to the enclosed water in the shipwreck, the dynamic mass is relatively large compared to the submerged weight so the dynamic behaviour will play an important role during the lift procedure in waves. Especially swell conditions can cause large heave motions which causes high peak loads at the shipwreck and the lift system. Therefore a new concept needs to be designed to reduce the peak loads and increase the workability. With the help of a concept analysis the chain pullers on a barge are chosen as the lift unit. For this lift unit five different groups of load reduction methods are defined namely Active Heave Compensation (AHC), Passive Heave Compensation (PHC), Hawsers, Fenders and additional buoyancy. For these load reduction methods six different systems are defined which has led to a broad scale of possible concepts. The hydrodynamic properties of the barge and the shipwreck are determined with Ansys AQWA. To get a first insight in the dynamic behaviour and the performance of the load reduction methods a Matlab model is made. Here the barge is modelled as a 3 Degrees Of Freedom (DOF) system (heave, roll and pitch) and the shipwreck as a 1DOF system (heave). From the results can be seen that the PHC can fulfill the load reduction criteria sufficiently and will be chosen as load reduction method. With the help of a Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) the different systems are ranked based on ten different criteria and one system is chosen as concept. For the chosen concept an OrcaFlex model is made to model its dynamic behaviour in more detail. The barge and the shipwreck are now each modelled as a 6DOF system and the mooring lines are also added to the system. Beside that the response to irregular waves can be calculated with frequency dependent added mass and damping values of Ansys AQWA. The PHC is now modelled as a spring dashpot system based on experimental data from companies. Beside that the linear soil model is extended with a friction force and also a non-linear soil model can be implemented to take into account suction forces The natural frequencies of the coupled system (barge+shipwreck) without the PHC are in the range of the wave frequencies for the anti-symmetric mode of surge and sway and for the symmetric mode of heave, roll and pitch. The response in regular and irregular waves shows that there is a significant reduction of the maximum tension after implementing the PHC system. After performing a workability study can be seen that at Hs=2m and T=8.5 sec the peak tensions are still below the maximum peak tension for the base case scenario. From the sensitivity analysis can be concluded that a small change in added mass and submerged weight of the shipwreck can have a significant influence on the chain tensions. Frequency dependent added mass and damping of the shipwreck gives different dynamic behaviour and also can have an influence on the chain tensions and workability. For the linear soil model the soil stiffness barely has an influence on the chain tensions. Suction forces can have an influence on the chain tension dependent the type of soil and the penetration depth.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-10-14","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Kirby, G. (mentor); de Rijk, G. (mentor)","2016","Future high-energy physics demands higher magnetic fields to attain higher beam energies and thus needs novel superconductingmaterials in accelerator magnet applications. Current superconductors operate in the temperature range between 1.8 and 4.2 K and attain 8 T in modern operational machines. Meanwhile, prototypes have been built to operate up to 12 T, which approaches the foreseen maximum attainable practical dipole field of 16 T of modern low temperature superconductors. In the framework of the long-term European development project Eucard-2, within the work package ’Future Magnets’, the technology for dipole magnets in the 16 to 20 Tesla range is explored. High Temperature Superconductor (HTS) materials have the ability to provide these high magnetic fields, but are in an early stage of development. In the recent past, significant improvements have been achieved by increasing current density and reducing cost, which implies the conductors’ future potential. The superconducting regime stretches much higher in both temperature and flux density compared to modern Low Temperature Superconductors (LTS), offering a new range of operating regimes. Higher current densities can be reached at the same operating temperature or, equal current densities can be reached at higher temperatures. The increased operating current density reduces the required conductor volume which leads, consequently, to more compact designs, while a higher operating temperature poses less restraints on the cryogenic cooling facilities. This versatility offers great potential for future magnet applications, however complicates thermal stability. Higher current densities and larger thermal margins result in very local normal zones with high peak temperatures endangering the magnet’s integrity. Adequate protection is therefore essential for safe operation especially in high energy density applications, such as multi-strand cables in accelerator dipoles. A quench should be detected sufficiently in advance, allowing time for the protection measures to take effect. Earlier studies showed traditional voltage detection not to be sufficient, causing permanent damage before the quench is identified. This reportwill explore the possibilities for quench detection for HTS magnets, by studying the underlying quench phenomenon in multi-strand Roebel cables using calculations and experiments to discover new possibilities for robust detection methods. Within this thesis, the multi-physics phenomena preliminary to a quench are analysed using a numerical model and various analytic models. To describe the quench behaviour, the stability of the superconductor is analysed as function of the operating current and cable andmagnet properties. Although this analysis focuses on Roebel cable, the locality of HTS quench reduces the influence of the exact cable geometry at hand. As is shown, a quench is predominantly dependent on the local thermal behaviour at the quench location and the macroscopic magnetic and electric properties of the magnet and cable, such as self-induction and interstrand resistance. LTS quench methods are therefore fairly cumbersome for makingHTS quench calculations. Due to its locality, the quench is difficult to detect especially at high current densities. Detection bymeasuring directly the quench itself, e.g. temperature and/or voltage, cannot cover its entire operating domain. However the effects of a quench, in particular the current redistribution, will be proven to have measurable effects on a much larger scale. Based on the model, a novel quench detection design to identify a quench in a preliminary stage is presented. To demonstrate the quench detectionmethod, a prototype is implemented in Feather-M0.4, a HTS racetrack coil with the goal to explore quench behaviour. A compactRIO was used for sensor data acquisition to verify the model and to validate the quench detection. The magnet tests encountered several practical problems for validating the quench detection design, including the ability to reach the higher current densities and artificially quenching themagnet. Although the test only delivered preliminary results, the quench detection design is implemented in FeatherM2 based on its promising potential.","Quench; Detection; Protection; High Temperature Superconductors; HTS; Accelerator; Magnet; Multi-Strand Cable; CERN","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

N. A. M. (mentor); Jäggi, A. (mentor); Arnold, D. (mentor)","2016","The modelling of non-gravitational forces acting on a satellite (especially a GNSS satellite) started half a century ago. Their modelling to low Earth orbiters (LEOs), however, are more recent because of the dominating atmospheric drag, the modelling of which requires the precision of recent atmospheric models. However, this is not an issue for precise orbit determination (POD), as of the method used to compute the reduced-dynamic orbit. The method is using piecewise constant accelerations (PCA), which are absorbing the non-conservative forces that are not modelled. One expects the implementation of non-gravitational forces to reduce the amplitude and mean values of the PCA of the satellite's reduced-dynamic orbit. In this thesis assignment, four non-gravitational forces has been considered large enough for improving the POD of GPS-based LEO using the Bernese GNSS Software: the aerodynamic forces, the solar radiation pressure and the reflected and emitted Earth radiation pressure. For each force, a modelling method has been chosen and implemented in the Bernese GNSS Software. The impact of the modelled non-gravitational forces has been evaluated with Swarm and GRACE LEOs with all the available validation and comparison methods: PCA, accelerometer data, GPS observation fit, satellite laser ranging observations and K/Ka-band ranging measurements. As expected, the implementation of all the forces reduces the standard deviation of the PCA in each direction, for both Swarm C (-8% in radial, -56% in along-track and -22% in cross-track) and GRACE A (-73% in radial, -75% in along-track and -20% in cross-track). Regarding the mean values for Swarm C a large reduction is observed in: along-track (-129%) and cross-track (-97%) direction, but the mean acceleration in radial direction increase by a few percent (7%). For GRACE A, the mean values of the PCA are reduced along each orbital axis (-88% in radial, -112% in along-track and -23% in cross-track). In addition to the PCA reduction, the precision of the reduced-dynamic orbit has also been improved by the modelling of the non-gravitational forces. In terms of values the a posteriori standard deviation of unit weight of 1.96 mm has been reduced to 1.93 mm for Swarm and from 2.3 mm to 1.45 mm for GRACE. Finally, different parameterizations of the aerodynamic forces have been carried out in order to determine the best atmospheric model and gas-surface interaction algorithm for LEO POD improvement. The impact of a horizontal wind model has been tested. More specifically: modelling the gas-surface interaction with Goodman's model using the DTM2013 atmospheric model with the horizontal wind correction HWM14 have shown the best results in LEO POD.","Swarm; Bernese GNSS Software; GRACE, K/Ka-band ranging (KBR); LEO POD; Non-gravitational forces modelling; piecewise constant accelerations (PCA); reduced-dynamic orbit; Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Astrodynamics and Space Missions","","","",""

This thesis describes the closely intertwined implementation of compressed sensing with parameter mapping (CS-PM) in the DW-CSI processing pipeline to accelerate its acquisition. The CS-PM algorithm enables DW-CSI to acquire less measurements (sample under Nyquist) and subsequently reconstruct the missing samples with the use of a custom designed, model-based sparsifying dictionary. As proof of concept, CS-PM was evaluated on the water signal of a non-water-suppressed DW-CSI scan. The results of the integration of CS-PM in the DW-CSI processing pipeline already indicates a feasible acceleration factor of 1.5 (scan time reduction of ca. 20 minutes) along with valuable insight to further improve the performance of DW-CSI in combination with CS-PM.","MRI; diffusion; chemical shift imaging; scan time reduction; compressed sensing; parameter mapping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","Circuits and Systems Group","",""

(mentor); Hicks, M.A. (mentor); Sluys, L.J. (mentor); Gonzalez Acosta, L (mentor)","2016","Many different numerical methods are being used for geotechnical calculations, of which the most commonly used is the finite element method (FEM). The material point method (MPM) is a variant of FEM, in which the continuum is discretised twice. The second discretisation are the material points that carry the state variables and move freely through the grid as the body deforms. Because of this, mesh distortion, one of the problematic features of FEM, will not occur. Two of the largest issues that exist in MPM are related to the efficiency and accuracy of the method. First of all, execution times are high, especially in the search algorithm, i.e. locating the material points with respect to the grid cells. Second, although stress calculations seem globally correct, stress oscillations occur. In this research, MPM has been improved with regard to these issues. The efficiency has been improved by implementing the local neighbours of neighbours method. This algorithm starts with looking for the material points in their previous location and the surrounding area. In case they are not found here, a brute force search is performed. This method can lead to a time reduction of around 75% to 95%, depending on the magnitude of displacement. The neighbours of neighbours method does take up more storage. The brute force method, which is the lowest in memory usage, costs approximately 12% less storage. It has been discovered that three causes exist for stress oscillations in MPM. These are non-optimal locations of stress recovery, discontinuous shape function gradients at element boundaries and difficulties with the assembly of the stiffness matrix when material points cross elements. In this research, the errors due to the first two causes are greatly reduced by implementation of the composite material point method (CMPM). In CMPM, the continuity of shape functions is increased by extending the amount of nodes contributing to the interpolation process to either nine or sixteen. As CMPM leads to a great improvement in stress representation throughout a continuum, it is recommended to further develop and extend its implementation. Summarising, in this thesis the efficiency and accuracy of MPM have been improved by changing the search algorithm and stress calculation.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geo-engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Van der Heiden, K. (mentor); Keijdener, C. (mentor)","2016","For more than a decade Jumbo has been active on the offshore market performing offshore installation projects with their two DP2 J-class vessels. However, the offshore market is a continuously growing and changing market and in order to keep up with these changes, Jumbo needs to innovate and investigate new activities within this offshore market. With a growing amount of old offshore platforms which need to be removed together with the low oil price of this moment, Jumbo sees new opportunities in the offshore platform decommissioning market. In order to compete in this platform decommissioning market, it must be investigated how Jumbo can enter this specific market. To understand the requirements for the optimal lifting solution for Jumbo to decommission offshore platform, first research to the offshore decommissioning market has been done. After this the infrastructure of the platforms in the North Sea, existing lifting concepts and the company itself have been analyzed and investigated. With the information obtained, the design criteria for the lifting concept were defined and multiple concepts were designed. These designs were evaluated against the design criteria with the use of a multi criteria analysis. The final design is a concept which uses two existing J-class vessels which are connected to each other with two lifting beams. The concept lifts the topsides via a reverse float-over operation. To simulate and analyze the motion behavior of the concept during operation, a model in Matlab and Simulink has been created. The model can be divided into three main parts, the model of the beam, the model of the topsides and the model of the ships. In order to analyze the motion behavior of the beam, the beam has been modeled as a discretized beam using finite difference. This numerical model was analyzed and verified with the analytical solution. The topsides was considered to have three degrees of freedom namely, heave, roll and pitch. Then the beam model and the topsides model were coupled to each other to create the system model and the natural frequencies of this model were determined. To see the motion behavior of the system in a sea state, an existing model of the vessels motion was used as an input to the system model (heave, roll and sway motions of J-class). In order to see the effect of the important pitch motion of the ships on the system model, the pitch motion was added to the ship model in a simplified way. Lastly, this ship model was combined with and coupled to the system model. To examine the model, the maximum allowable stresses in the beam considering a DAF of 2 were taken as a limitation. Corresponding to these maximum allowable stresses of 440 MPa, a maximum deflection of the end of the beam was set to 0.3 m. For different environmental conditions the maximum beam deflections were determined. These environmental conditions were determined by analyzing met-ocean data at a specific location in the North Sea. The simulations were done for three different wave headings (90°, 135° and 180°), Tp from 4 to 10 sec and Hs from 1 to 4 m. The results showed that the maximum deflection of the beam ends and thus the maximum stresses stay for most environmental conditions within the limit of 0.3 m. For beam waves with Tp = 4 s the maximum allowable deflection is exceeded at Hs = 3 m and Hs = 4 m. For head waves with Tp = 4 s the maximum deflection is at the limit with Hs = 4 m. Operating in head and beam waves with Tp = 4 s should be avoided and the large beam deflections can be related to the fact that the system has a natural frequency at 0.25 Hz. For the other conditions the motions and stresses in the beam are within the limit. This project forms the foundation of a concept for single lift platform decommissioning. Although further research in for example a motion compensating system and the vessel interaction is necessary, it can be concluded that the concept looks promising and could be a possibility for Jumbo to enter the decommissioning market with relatively low investments needed.","Jumbo; Decommissioning; offshore platforms; single lift","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-10-13","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","","","",""

Often, however, digitalisation is applied rather by copying existing (competitive) products, leading to inauthentic additions without any real value for its users. Next to its main product – the form design magazine – the publishing house Verlag form GmbH & Co. KG, too, is looking for new ways to find meaning in a more and more digital world allowing the company to (re-)positioning itself in the domain of design communication and inspiration. Here, the company is not only aiming to create an all-embracing label representing high standard, great authenticity, and sustainability concerning all aspects of a designer’s life, but also to form an independent institution giving orientation within an academic and economic context. Based on this, the Vision in Product Design method was used as a framework to a create a future vision to enable creative professionals and experts from various fields to gain new insights outside of their comfort zone and to nurture an inspiring dialogue. With all activities and processes relevant to this field, information and knowledge seem to be the key – either when browsing for inspiration or looking for a specific piece of information. Hereby, we often tend to forget the great amounts of information we already own, leading to much information existing outside of our own or other’s reach and end up being wasted. Based on this phenomena, form tracks aims to enable users to create their own deep web of information by archiving all elements of their research sequence automatically and at the same time giving them access to the know-ledge gathered by others within an exclusive network of professional designers, experts, and people interested in design – all curated based on the experience and professional network of the form publishing house.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","SPD","",""

The considered minimization problem is called the Total Schedule Duration with Dependent resource, Multiple Time Windows and European drivers’ legislation problem, i.e., the TSDDMTW-EU problem. A literature study is given on this TSDDMTW-EU problem. Different solution approaches and Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILP) are discussed regarding in the scope of our project. We compose a model for the TSDDMTW-EU problem by giving a MILP, based on a model by Kopfer and Meyer(2008). Two different modeling approaches are suggested which are assessed on their performance. Furthermore, we prove that the TSDDMTWEU problem is NP-hard, and to conclude, a heuristic is evaluated with respect to its performance in objective values. Our main research contributions can be given by the following three aspects. First, a MILP is given for the complete European drivers’ legislation. All extensions in the legislation regarding a single truck driver are included. Second, knowledge is gained on the influence of dependent truck drivers on a Total Schedule Duration problem. And finally, we prove that adding the complete European drivers’ legislation to a problem, results in a NP-hard problem.","NP-hard; MILP; optimization; Europen drivers' legislation; dependent resources; schedule duration; multiple time windows; heuristic, complexity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied Mathematics","","","",""

The municipality, academia, and private enterprises see in these processes promising opportunities to involve different actors, especially citizens, and their visions in order to develop innovation and sustainable solutions for urban complexities. However, implementing ULLs and understanding co-creation processes is still an area to explore; the concepts lack consensus. This thesis report aims to understand not only how they are being implemented, but also whether they really acknowledge the promise of innovation. In order to do so, the starting point is to explore ULLs in two manners. The first is to analyze its elements, where co-creation is one of the most important. The second is to analyze ULLs as a niche that promises innovation. Within the ULL, the concept of co-creation at the theoretical level brings two promises. It includes different actors from different domains to create knowledge, services or products; but it also brings the promise of incorporating citizens. This thesis investigates how co-creation processes take place and what they bring to the ULL implementation. Its aim is to understand and present in a tangible manner this process in order to operationalize it and find whether it represents learning for innovation.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Management in the Built Environment","","Industrial Ecology","",""

(mentor); Mugge, R. (mentor)","2016","While consumers like the idea of sustainability, they do not always opt for “green” products and packages. This is partially due to the lack of access to these alternatives either due to high pricing or unavailability in stores. In addition consumers do not believe green claims in advertisements and on packages due to companies greenwashing their products. Lastly, consumers often believe sustainable products are functionally inferior leading them to purchase the non-sustainable alternative. However sustainability is often an advantage in products where gentleness is valued as sustainability is associated with attributes such as compassion, mild, and caring. Design or styling can reduce the effect of the last two barriers to green consumption. Improving aesthetics have shown to increase product evaluation (Luchs et. al., 2012). In addition, holistic packaging design elicits certain brand and package impressions. By extension, the same can be done to help consumers understand the sustainability of the packages by uncovering which styles elicit such a perception. Magnier and Crie (2015) have already done so on an analytical level (e.g. structural, graphical, and informational elements), study one will do so on a holistic level while using designers, and will result in design guidelines for triggering a sustainable perception. The guidelines were formulated from the four high level themes that resulted from the exploration. These are Natural, Elegant and Refined, Honest and Genuine, and R.R.R. (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle). These are holistic and interdependent guidelines that refer to the styling of the packages. While the first three styling guidelines can be used to mislead consumers in believing a non-sustainable package is sustainable, the last design guideline encompasses the technological aspect of the sustainability of the packages.","holistic design; packaging design; sustainability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovatie Management (PIM)","","","",""

For tight reservoirs such as shales, fracturing will become the main source of improving the permeability. It is therefore vital to conduct research into the behavior of fractures in the reservoir. The aim is to study how fractures develop in terms of fracture size, coalescence, patterns and in which dimensions they often occur. Often the importance of the behavior of these fractures and their contribution to flow in reservoirs also formed part of this research. In this investigation, the Posidonia shale core was examined using three different layering orientations. The three different layer orientated shale cores were subjected to axial loading in order to induce fracturing. These induced fractures were created in two ways. The first was by axial loading until the core reached maximum failure. The second involved loading in stages and scanning the core after each loading stage in the micro-CT scanner. This procedure was repeated until maximum failure was reached. An Indiana limestone core and sandstone core were also analyzed. The behavior, coalescence, frequently seen fracture patterns, angle with respect to the z-axis and apertures of the fractures were studied and compared. This was performed in both a quantitative and qualitative matter using the commercial Avizo® Fire software at TU Delft. A small part of this study touch on the modeling of the observed shear fracture pattern from a shale core preformed in Abaqus. The results from the fracture analyses shows that the largest fractures are seen in the shale cores, for which the fracture initiation was created by one loading stage until failure. Another observation shows that there is clear set of different fractures that is seen for each distinctive layered core. From the observed patterns a simple 2D simulation is built in Abaqus. From the simulation is seen that for cracks under a certain angle, the master fracture is intersected by a 300 smaller fracture, the results in opening of the master fracture. This is also the case in the 2D slice, which is a representation of the 2D-model fracture configuration.","Posidonia Shale; Sandstone; Limestone; Fracture analyses; Avizo®Fire; Fracture mode; Fracture angle; Abaqus modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","","",""

In this study we investigate if available models for low salinity fluids can be modified and redeveloped to describe the behavior of streaming potential coefficient and zeta potential for carbonated water flooding in reservoir rocks with very small clay content. The model presented in this work follows the approach of Glover et al. published in 2012. The developed theoretical model suggested here is sensitive to salinity, temperature, reservoir rock properties and fluid properties, while the main variable is pore fluid concentration. For the verification of the theoretical estimations, core flooding experiments were performed with different CO2-enriched solutions in Fontainebleau sandstone sample. From comparison of the experimental measurements with the theoretical estimations, it was observed that the model can produce estimations of ζ potential and streaming potential coefficient (CS) as a function of pore fluid concentration within a pH range of 4 to 7. Moreover, it was observed that for the correlation a coefficient introduced by Glover et al. in 2012 had to be implemented.","CO2; Carbonated Water; Fontainebleau; CWI; Zeta potential; Streaming potential coefficient","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Applied Earth Science / Petroleum Engineering & Geoscience","",""

Users are now exposed to an increasing amount of information on a wide variety of topics that is shared by others (Crampton, 2015), causing them to retreat into more personal online communities that preserve with theirs social needs to engage with relevant people and content (Crampton, 2015). Domain-specific SNSs, is such a community that focus on smaller group of users with very specific interest and social connections (Yue et al., 2009). However, knowledge on managing engagement in SNSs is limited to loosely studies on various social components that describes engagement in SNSs within a general context (Ngai, Tao, & Moon, 2015). Those studies lack to frame the various components into an actionable prescription to improve engagement of SNSs in a domain-specific context. To fill in this knowledge gap, a conceptual framework is proposed based on a study of social mechanisms among participants of a domain-specific SNS for music festival visitors. The conceptual framework insists that four social components are relevant to explain engagement through Like activities; praise, social comparison, reciprocity and social capital. Researchers can use the conceptual framework to extend and build new knowledge upon regarding engagement in domain-specific SNSs.","Persuasive Technology; Social Networking Service; Online Communities; Information Sharing; Social Media Credibility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Researchers at Delft University of Technology have recently developed an algorithm for optimizing noisy, expensive and possibly nonconvex objective functions for which no derivatives are available. The data-based online nonlinear extremum-seeker (DONE) was originally developed for sensorless wavefront aberration correction in optical coherence tomography (OCT) and optical beam forming network (OBFN) tuning. In order to make the DONE algorithm suitable for large-scale problems, a parallel implementation using a graphics processing unit (GPU) is considered. This master thesis aims to develop such a parallel implementation which performs faster than the existing sequential implementation without much change in obtained accuracy. Since OBFN tuning is a problem that may involve a large amount of parameters, an OBFN simulation is to be used to compare the parallel implementation to the sequential implementation. The key of the DONE algorithm is solving a regularized linear least-squares problem in order to construct a smooth and low-cost surrogate function which does provide derivatives and can be optimized fairly easily. This master thesis first discusses the basics of parallel computing, after which several linear least-squares methods and several numerical optimization methods are investigated. These methods are compared and the most suitable methods for parallel computing are implemented and tested for increasing dimensions. The final parallel DONE implementation combines the recursive least-squares (RLS) method with the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) method and optimizes the largescale OBFN simulation almost twice as fast as the sequential DONE implementation, without much change in obtained accuracy.","derivative-free; optimization; numerical; algorithm; linear; least-squares; random; fourier; expansion; rfe; data-based; online; nonlinear; extremum-seeker; done; parallel; parallelization; graphics; processing; unit; gpu; compute; unified; device; architecture; cuda","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC)","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Randomly occurring torque transients have been detected in the reaction wheels of several spacecraft. The causes of the transients are presumably cage instabilities and oil jogs occurring in the ball bearings of the wheels. Within high precision pointing missions these disturbances significantly impair pointing-stability performance. Hence, the goal of this thesis is to investigate how the impact of wheels’ disturbance transients on the pointing performance parameters can be minimized through the implementation of dedicated control strategies. Eventually, the capabilities of the Precision Pointing Control Design tool developed by Airbus Defence and Space can be further extended and improved with respect to friction torque instabilities. The torque profiles generated by friction instabilities have been characterized by the means of a pseudo-power spectral density formalism allowing to analytically perform accurate pointing error analysis and evaluations, following the ECSS standard. Moreover, two different solutions have been investigated and implemented on a reference case study mission. While the first one consists in the optimization of the controller’s integral bandwidth with respect to the disturbance transients, the second solution considers the design of a wheel speed control loop. The implementation of an inner control loop nested in the global attitude control loop turns out to be the most promising strategy for handling disturbance transients. However, the research shows that angular rate sensors are a crucial element for the pointing performance and stability of the whole control loop. Therefore, at the end of the thesis, guidelines to further optimize the in-house control design tool and to characterize the pointing error sources analytically are presented. Additionally, in order to pave the way for a practical implementation of the wheel speed loop strategy, the specific requirements regarding the rate sensor that should be provided to the wheels’ manufacturer are discussed.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","This thesis introduces an approach for determining the parameters of aggregated dynamic equivalents for active distribution system from a reference set of signals associated with various disturbances using mean-variance mapping optimization (MVMO) algorithm. As the penetration of renewable energy sources in the LV and MV network increases, it has become extremely important that we have models that mimic actual system response with least computational overhead for bulk transmission system studies. Full scale detailed, complex, interconnected models are most accurate but carry significant simulation time, making analysis unfeasible. Dynamic equivalents (DE) are simplified representations of larger models that mimic the dynamic response of those models. They can be used to replace the neighbor area in a study while the area of focus is modeled with great detail. This reduces the computational burden. Our test system is a small part of the German MV/LV network whose dynamic equivalent is identified and compared. The dynamic equivalent is a Western Electric Coordination Council (WECC) developed distributed PV model (PVD1). This identification is done with the use of MVMO algorithm that utilizes a single parent crossover and a unique mapping function. The results show an almost identical response with good normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) between the detailed and aggregated model. The MVMO shows fast convergence and accurate results.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy (ESE)","","","",""

About three billion people live and work within a couple of hundred kilometers from a coastline. In addition the coast is an important breeding zone for marine species. This is also the case at Lake Bardawil. Lake Bardawil is a relatively large lake on the north-west coast of the Sinai Peninsula. Almost all people around Lake Bardawil are involved in the fish industry hence they fully depend on the ecology. Currently there is a strong decrease in fish rates. When this trend carries on unemployment will be a definite consequence. Without income, the locals will be more vulnerable to for example terrorist groups. This situation can be described as an ecosystem in collapse. In order to stimulate the fish population by influencing the hydrodynamics of Lake Bardawil, a research is performed in close coorperation with IMARES. In this research a connection between hydrodynamics and the fish population rate is made. These processes can be positively influenced by changing the geometry of Lake Bardawil. The change of geometry is divided in four phases. In order to investigate the impact of these adaptations a Delft3d Flexible Mesh model is made.

It can be concluded that the four phases will increase the tidal prism, increase the depth and decrease the salinity.

It was found that for wings of relatively high stiffness, unsteady aerodynamics is not important to take into account during gust response modelling. The difference between unsteady and steady aerodynamics was found to not be more that 5%.

(mentor)","2016","A study by the Building Performance Institute Europe(BPIE) stated that upgrading old housing stock to higher energy efficiency through renovations and smart interventions would be a significant step towards meeting Europe’s Greenhouse Gas (GHG) reduction goals. Since 2011 Shell Global Solutions is investigating deep decarbonisation strategies for the residential sector through the EcoGenie project. The EcoGenie project constitutes an extreme learning position in order to determine cost-effective, socially beneficial and renewable options for residential heating systems for the immediate future. The Shell EcoGenie house has been under operation for the last 4 years where it is being used to test out new energy technologies available in the market and collect data about the energy use, occupancy and indoor climate. Based on the work of Bacher and Madsen, 2011, this research investigates the complexity and accuracy of dynamic thermal modelling with the objectives to predict the future heating demand and to identify sources of heat loss in the house. Using indoor/outdoor climate data, energy consumption data and prior knowledge about the heat transfer mechanisms, an initial thermal model is developed and its parameters are estimated by applying statistical solution algorithms based on the maximumlikelihood method. The estimated parameters represent physical properties of the building such as window area, heat capacities and thermal resistances. A hierarchy of models with increasing levels of complexity is investigated and suitable models are identified based on maximum likelihood values, statistical tests, data size and physical interpretation of the properties. The estimated parameters are discussed to understand the heat dynamics of the house. It is concluded that the heat capacity of the building envelope and its interaction with its adjacent components (indoor and outdoor air) significantly influences the heat dynamics of the house. In addition, a thermal resistance mechanism to model the effect of air leakage in existing houses, i.e. unwanted exchange of warm indoor air, is proposed and successfully applied. Future research is required to differentiate and to quantify conductive and convective heat transfer mechanism of air leakages. This research proposes a thermal model that forecasts the thermal behaviour of a residential building - the EcoGenie house - to predict its heating requirements for up to 48 hours. Additional sub-models are investigated to account for meaningful physical model boundaries and model improvements that simulate the heating system’s control mechanisms are tested with the objective to improve prediction accuracies. Further research should be considered into simulating controllers that can capture effects of rapid temperature changes, both indoor and ambient temperatures. Finally, and with an outlook to future management of smart grids and smart cities infrastructures, future research is needed to investigate and to build a library of thermal models which includes a large cross-section of existing building archetypes to account for diverging structural and physical properties of the building stock. The aggregated heating energy demands of buildings will be instrumental to ensure integration of and safe and secure supply of renewable energy sources.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy / Intelligent Electrical Power Grids","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor)","2016","Although mangrove forests have proven to contribute to wave dissipation significantly, these ecosystem are threatened mainly by the expanding aquaculture. International or nationwide applied greenbelt policies are often used for the preservation of the mangroves and hence the flood hazard reduction, without taking local (hydrodynamic) conditions into account. Therefore this research developed insights in the mangrove forests' effect on waves and their contribution to flood hazard reduction as function of forest width. This is done by setting up a globally applicable tool for determining the governing storm wave and water level conditions at the seaward edge of the mangrove forest and the wave attenuation in the forest itself. In contrary to greenbelt policies, the developed method enables the option to locally review on required mangrove forest widths. The application of the wave transformation model SWAN-2D with offshore global wave data from ERA-Interim significantly increased the prediction accuracy of nearshore wave conditions compared to the direct use of ERA-Interim. This holds mainly for the sheltered and shallow locations like embayments, estuaries and behind barrier islands, in which mangroves are located. For less sheltered and deep conditions, no improvement of the ERA-Interim data with the additional use of SWAN was observed. The attenuation in the forest depends on the highly varying physical characteristics of dimensions of the mangrove trees. The large variabilities were included in several vegetation sets, prior to their implementation into a 1D stationary XBeach model. From a comparison with wave height measurements, three characteristic mangrove species were selected. By combining these species, typical coastal interspecific patterns were composed, representing a young dense and an old sparse forest. In addition, bathymetric and hydrodynamic conditions, which are common for mangrove forests, were imposed to the model. It appeared that a 100 m dense forest is potentially able to dissipate waves to acceptable levels, while sparser forests might need 450-900 m. The model also indicated that the effect of landward deforestation on a sloped profile results in a higher wave exposure for the area behind a forest than seaward erosion, although it does not take the effect of breaking and uprooting of trees into account. The method to determine the required forest and evaluate on maintained greenbelt policies was tested on three case study locations, which differ in hydrodynamic conditions and forest characteristics. The policies appeared to result in different levels of hazard for the hinterland, underlining the great uncertainty of acceptable mangrove buffer zones for coastal zone management. The application of global (open source) data, SWAN-2D and XBeach-1D provides the set-up of a (quick) hazard assessment tool. The inclusion of local conditions improved the prediction ability compared to the conservative use of greenbelt policies.","mangroves; forest width; global application; wave attenuation; hazard reduction; SWAN; XBeach; greenbelt policies","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-10-06","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Closure dams are structures that are used to close off basins, usually from the sea. A sand closure is the construction of a closure dam made out of sand. During the last stage of a sand closure, there is a closure gap through which the tide forces a current with flow velocities up to five metres per second. The flow pattern that occurs during a sand closure is three-dimensional. Furthermore, the sediment transport does not reach an equilibrium due to the constantly changing flow conditions and gap geometry. During sand closures, large amounts of erosion occur. Because the main costs of a sand closure lie in the transportation of sand to the building site, it is important to know how much sand is needed for the sand closure and how much sand is loss during the closing process. The quantification of the sand loss still requires attention. The currently used models require calibration factors, which are not known beforehand, to give a reasonable prediction of the sand loss. A model that can be applied to any sand closure and does not require calibration factors is desirable. To achieve this, the different processes that occur during sand closures should be parameterized and need to be quantifiable by a model. In this study the important processes of a sand closure are identified. With the results of this study, the sand loss prediction can be improved by considering the processes that are expected to have the largest contributions to the sand loss. It was found that the amount of turbulence in the flow has a large impact on the erosion. There are two mechanisms that appear to have the largest impact on the erosion during a sand closure. The first mechanism is that during a sand closure, mixing layers originate from the heads of the dams. These have higher turbulence intensities than the main current, which causes strong vertical mixing, so the sediment particles are brought up higher into the water column. It was found that possibly, these higher turbulence intensities also lead to pick-up rates orders of magnitude larger than the ones predicted by the current pick-up equations, although it is not known if extrapolating the formula of the TKE method, designed for river flow, to higher turbulence intensities is justified. Because the magnitude of the turbulence intensities seems to have a large influence on the predicted erosion velocity, it may be important for the total erosion at the closure gap. The second mechanism is that the flow is contracted downstream of the closure gap. This increases the flow velocities of the main current. Unfortunately, it is unknown what the impact of these higher flow velocities is on the turbulence at the origin of the mixing layers. It is desirable to be able to model the important mechanisms that occur during sand closures in a numerical model. The contraction of the flow behind the closure gap is already modelled by most two-dimensional and three-dimensional numerical models. It is advised to look further into the pick-up rates of sediment at higher turbulence intensities. Since there is no satisfactory formulation for the pick-up of sediment that can be implemented into a numerical model directly and the erosion at the origin of mixing layers is found to be most influential, it is recommended to carry out a physical scale model to quantify the pick-up of sediments at the origin of a mixing layer. This will be the subject of a forthcoming MSc thesis.","","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Coaches can benefit from objective information about playing styles applied in football matches. In this work, two methods for determining (characteristics of) the playing style of a football team in a certain match based on statistics of ball actions are constructed. The first method assigns a match to one of four commonly applied playing styles in football based on a set of benchmark matches. Within this method, a relevant variable set with respect to the playing style of a team is selected based on the so-called minimum-redundancy-maximum-relevance algorithm. This algorithm makes use of mutual information as a measure of relevance. The mutual information between variables is estimated by the so-called Kraskov and adjusted Kraskov estimator. After a relevant variable set has been found, matches are assigned to one of the four playing styles by the use of a combination of a hierarchical scheme of K-means clustering and 1-Nearest Neighbors. The second method focuses on general playing style characteristics of matches as opposed to labeling a match with a specific playing style. This way, details about the playing style in a match can be obtained without limiting to the four prior labeled playing styles. Using principal component analysis combined with domain knowledge, three characteristic variables are created which together give a general overview regarding the playing style applied in a match. Application of both models on different sets of matches show satisfying results which agree with domain know-ledge. These models can be used to provide football coaches with information regarding playing styles applied in matches. Coaches can use this information in order to both evaluate their own team as well as analyze their opponents.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics","","Probability, Risk and Statistics","",""

Based on the CD practices at ING and its delivery pipeline we have created Spectata, a tool that helps development teams assure the quality of their unit test code. Every time a change in the code is made Spectata calculates metrics that reflect the adequacy, fault finding effectiveness and maintainability of the test suite. It provides a quality verdict on those aspects, recommended refactorings and a detailed comparison with the quality of prior builds. To evaluate Spectata we perform four case studies in which we compare Spectata’s verdict and recommendations to ones given by the developers and ourselves.

(mentor)","2016","Due to its inherent dynamic stability the Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) is a strong candidate for large (10-20 MW) floating offshore applications. However, there is room for improvement considering the VAWT’s aerodynamic and structural performance, so as to increase its cost-effectiveness. This thesis explores the VAWT’s potential of enhancing its performance, using active pitch control, in terms of the following three objectives: 1.) power maximization, 2.) power minimization, and 3.) thrust relief. For this purpose the Modified-Linear Actuator Cylinder Model (Mod-Lin ACM) is used as optimization tool. Another inherent feature of the VAWT is that its blades experience large angles of attack, and it is believed that dynamic stall effects will play a significant role in the optimization. The quasi-steady aerodynamic force coefficients in the Mod-Lin ACM are therefore replaced by their dynamic equivalents, which are obtained from a Beddoes-Leishman type dynamic stall model. The phenomenon of leading edge separation is modelled separately, as “plug-in” to this dynamic stall model, following the formulation presented in. The analysis in this work is carried out for the symmetrical NACA0018 airfoil. The achievable increase of maximum power is only 1%, which is even less when unsteady effects are considered in the optimization. For power coefficients at tip-speed ratios and solidities other than the initial optimum point, increases up to 15% are documented. This implies that values close to the initial maximum power can be achieved for lower solidities, decreasing the total weight, and therefore the cost, of the VAWT. A close correlation between the potentials of power increasal and thrust alleviation is found, which is caused by the fact that local power losses due to thrust relief must be compensated on other peripheral positions. Therefore, in order to obtain the highest trust reductions the optimizer will maximize the local power production on the energy efficient parts of the rotor, similar to the power maximization target. Depending on tip-speed ratio and solidity, the given pitch allowance is able to decrease the power production between 65% and 100%. Generally, the decrement is only enhanced by any occurring unsteady effects. This reveals the potential of using the VAWT’s blades as air brake.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & Propulsion / Wind Energy & DTU Wind Energy","","European Wind Energy Master (EWEM)","",""

GOMEA is considered to be state of the art, but currently no version of GOMEA for real-valued variables exists. In this thesis, we design a real-valued version of GOMEA, for both single-objective and multi-objective optimization. Our novel GOMEA variant is then applied to the Deformable Image Registration (DIR) problem, which was adapted to allow for efficient partial evaluations. DIR concerns the calculation of a deformation that transforms one image to another, and is of great importance for many medical applications. Experiments are performed to assess GOMEA’s performance in black-box and grey-box settings on a range of single-objective and multi-objective benchmark problems, including comparisons with it to the state-of-the-art real-valued optimization algorithm AMaLGaM. From the results of these experiments, we find that GOMEA performs substantially better on all considered single-objective and multi-objective benchmark problems in a grey-box setting, in terms of required time and number of evaluations. Moreover, the improvement becomes larger as problem dimensionality increases. In a black-box setting, GOMEA still performed better than AMaLGaM in terms of time, and comparable in terms of the number of evaluations. On DIR problems, GOMEA achieved solutions of similar quality while achieving a speed-up of up to a factor of 1600.","optimal mixing; evolutionary algorithms; deformable image registration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Algorithmics","",""

(mentor)","2016","Green water has a significant effect on safety and on structural strength of an FPSO. Green water mostly occurs at the bow of an FPSO because of the weathervaning capability. When the waves, current and wind are not co-directional, it can occur that waves are coming in on the side of the FPSO. When designing an FPSO for a benign environment, classification society rules are available to determine the measures which have to be considered against green water along the side. When the probability of green water and the freeboard exceedance along the side are actually known, no potentially unnecessary measures, implied by classification society regulations, have to be implemented on the FPSO. This study dealt with the probability of green water occurrence and most probable maximum freeboard exceedance along the side of the Petrojarl 1. Specifically, the effect of the various ship motions and the free surface elevation on the probability of green water are researched. The probability of green water occurring along the side of the Petrojarl 1 is analysed with linear 3D diffraction theory. The analysis is performed for the conditions in which the vessel will be operating. The probability is based both on the second order Forristall distributionand the linear Rayleigh distribution to determine the effect of the distribution on the probability of green water occurrence, because the Forristall distribution accounts for the second order wave effects in the incoming wave. The free surface elevation along the side of the FPSO under a certain relative wave angle proved to be of great importance. Therefore the free surface elevation is validated with measurements performed at MARIN for the free surface elevation along a plate. Finally, the relative wave angle also affects the probability of green water. This study dealt with the influence of the relative wave angle for the green water probability along the side of the Petrojarl 1.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-10-04","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine & Transport Technology","","","",""

(mentor); Gerspach, F. (mentor)","2016","Offshore pipeline installation is limited by pipeline integrity during the laying process. Pipeline integrity is evaluated with the help of buckling checks, which help determining the feasibility of pipeline installation for a given sea condition. The operational limit of pipeline installation is determined during project preparation, by outlining a limiting sea condition (A standard, undirectional wave spectra) beyond which pipeline damage is assumed to occur. Therefore, the installation process is interrupted during such a sea condition and the pipe is abandoned. The pipe is recovered when the weather improves, for further installation. This entire process is termed as Abandonment and Recovery (A&R) operation. In reality, the offshore sea conditions encountered during operation are different in nature, when compared to the sea-state outlined during project preparation (non-standard, multidirectional sea spectrum). This creates an uncertainty in the decision making process for pipeline abandonment. In order to overcome this, an A&R criterion is desired, which is insensitive to the sea-state definition. The criterion should be based on vessel motion parameters. The goal of this thesis is to predict the extreme response of pipeline based on vessel motions, in order to evaluate the integrity of pipeline for a given environment. Three statistical models were developed during the course of the study, to predict the extreme responses of pipeline using one or more input parameters among all the vessel motions; for a given installation case. These models require the generation of a database for each installation case, the output of which results in predictive formulas with a certain degree of confidence. The report consists of two main parts. The first part describes in detail, the procedure employed for a given installation case, right from database generation to data gathering and postprocessing analysis, resulting in three statistical models that predicts the extreme response in the sagbend part of the suspended pipeline. This procedure/method has been generalised for any type of installation case (small and large water depths, flexible and stiff pipelines). The second part of the report shows the results of the procedure, for two sample installation cases; one in deep water and the other in shallow water. The models are validated for different kinds of randomly chosen sea-spectra, that are assumed to be representative of the offshore environment. This is then followed by the analysis of results and discussions about various aspects of the procedure, adopted in this research.","Offshore pipelines; vessel motions; S-lay method; pipeline integrity; sagbend; statistical modeling; multiple regression; deep water pipelay; shallow water pipelay; Orcaflex; OFFPIPE","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-10-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Maritime and Transport Technology","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

(mentor); Boorsma, A. (mentor); Van 't Veer, R. (mentor)","2016","Wave drift loads on ships and offshore structures have been a topic of research over the past 50 years, however the linear theory which is used to calculate those has not changed. The aim of this research project is to investigate the effect of bow shape on the second order drift load. A better understanding of the difference between the actual physics and the physics included in linear theory may lead to improved calculation models and thus better accuracy of drift load predictions. The focus of the research will be on the accuracy of the relative wave elevation (RWE) contribution to the mean drift force. This is the major contributor to the drift force and the most likely component affected by the bow shape in real waves, whereas numerical methods assume infinitesimally small waves. The research question investigated in this study is: What is the effect of non-infinitesimal small relative wave heights on the relative wave elevation (RWE) mean drift component for an Aframax FPSO? The total mean drift force in head waves is a delicate balance of the fluid forces at the bow and aft of the ship. The main parameters influencing the four 'Pinkster components' are: ship motions, pressures below the mean waterline (MWL) and the RWE along the MWL. To provide an answer to the research question model tests are conducted for two hull forms. The difference in hull form is found in the bow shape above the MWL. In order to investigate the effect of the RWE on the total drift force alone, motions and pressures below the MWL should be equal for both bow shapes. The original bow shape is that of an Aframax tanker and the wall-sided bow shape is wall-sided (vertical upward from MWL). Therefore, the numerical model is equal for both hull forms and differences in results may be contributed to the difference in bow shape. The increase in RWE at the bow can be contributed to non-linear radiation and diffraction, because motions are equal for wavefrequencies of interest. The bow flare above the MWL affects the RWE due to additional wave disturbance in high waves. The difference in shape is not significant enough to affect the motions, due to e.g. non-linear buoyancy or wave loads acting on the flare. The difference in total mean QTF measured between the original and wall-sided bow could be calculated by using the actual RWE as input for the RWE mean drift component (P I). However, a significant difference between the measured and calculated mean drift force remains and is likely due to 'above MWL' effects and differences in the other drift force components. For higher waves a decrease in contribution of the bow to the mean drift force can be observed. This decrease coincides with observations of bow emergence. This is not in line with total drift force measurements, as the total mean QTF increases with waveheight. The analysis results from the stern suggest there is an increasing contribution to the total mean QTF, due to hull form above the MWL. The observation of non-linear effects, such as splashing at stern and a decrease in RWE, support this. These observations give cause to further investigate the prediction of other ""Pinkster components"".","second-order wave loads; FPSO; relative wave elevation; hull form; bow shape","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-10-03","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine & Transport Technology","","Ship Hydromechanics","",""

This model has to be able to simulate the motions of such a barrier as observed in two dimensional tests and allows for a better understanding of the barrier’s hydrodynamic behaviour. The wave forces on the barrier are calculated with the Morison equation, which is often used in offshore hydrodynamics to calculate the wave forces on slender members. Including all details necessary for a correct simulation, the model is simplified wherever possible. This reduces runtime so that the model can be used for simulations for a fatigue assessment in the second part of this thesis. These assumptions are validated using the results from 2D tests carried out by Deltares. In addition, another student will develop a CFD model to validate these simplifications by an alternative way. The results of the validation using the 2D tests suggest that the motions can be simulated very well using this approach. The validation also shows that the horizontal position of the barrier seems to be mostly affected by the forces on the screen, while the vertical position is dominated by the buoyancy force of the floating boom. The second part of this study consists of a first qualitative assessment of the fatigue life of the barrier. Earlier tests have shown that the loads on the barrier are relatively low. This is why fatigue is expected to play an important role, given the fact that the barrier will be deployed for about 5 to 10 years. Fatigue life of the rubber component at the point where the floating boom is connected to the plastic capturing screen is investigated. To carry out this assessment, the prototype currently deployed in the North Sea is used as a starting point. The hydro-elastic model from the first part of this thesis is used to simulate the barrier’s motions. Using a structural model which simulates the rubber’s behaviour, these motions are superimposed from the global to the local structure. For this structural model a hyperelastic material that resembles the rubber component is assumed. After superimposing the barrier’s motions, fatigue life of the barrier is calculated using a damage model suitable for rubber. The results show that fatigue life seems to be dominated by seastates with steep waves or with large velocity and acceleration amplitudes. Also, the fatigue life in the Pacific Ocean will be about two and a half to three times longer than for one deployed in the North Sea.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Offshore & Dredging Engineering","",""

(mentor); de Vries, P.A. (mentor); Yang, Y. (mentor)","2016","Minor thesis --- Preload loss in pretensioned bolts is an inevitable phenomenon. This thesis focuses on the different causes for bolt relaxation and their relation to joint design. Investigating bolt relaxation is relevant because there is a direct relation between the bolt preload and the resistance of the connection. In order to assess the loss of preload in pretensioned bolts, test results of extended creep tests (cf. EN 1090-2) have been used. It was found that bolt relaxation is mainly a function of coating thickness of the joint members. The larger the coating thickness, the more bolt relaxation occurs. The influence of bolt relaxation due to flattening of surface roughness could not be quantified due to the governing influence of coating thickness, but the surface roughness is of large importance for the slip resistance. External static loading has an influence on short-term bolt relaxation which can be modelled using an equation derived in this thesis. Proper joint design is key to achieving a high strength friction grip connection with a high preload level and thus a high slip resistance over the entire service lifetime. Higher ratios of clamping length over bolt diameter lead to less bolt relaxation. The results of this thesis can be used to gain insight in the behaviour of preloaded connections, as well as to have an indication on how to achieve a preloaded connection with relatively small preload losses.","","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Additional Thesis - All around the world many species are dying out locally or entirely due to interferences in their habitats. One of the big problems for marine life is the creation of migration barriers which preclude migrating species to complete their life cycle.Fish passages are a way for migrating species to get around obstructions in a water way. The goal of this research is to determine whether a large scale Tesla valve could be applicable as a fish passage. In a series of three experiments is investigated whether a large scale Tesla valve can meet the requirements as a fish passage. The three experiments have different scales and in each experiment focuses on another part of the requirements. Taking into account all the points from both the ecological and technical perspective it is determined that a large scale Tesla valve could indeed be applicable as a fish passage. However in its original design the valve will only be applicable as fish passage in cases of (very) small gradients and in cases of high gradients only in combination with large discharges. Further research has to be done on shape optimisation, the critical flow velocity and constructional & economic feasibility before the general feasibility of a large scale Tesla valve as fish passage can be determined.","Tesla valve; fish passage; ecology; migration barriers; migrating species; fish ladder; vistrap; fishway","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water Resources","",""
