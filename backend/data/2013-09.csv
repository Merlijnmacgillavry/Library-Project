(mentor); Simao Ferreira, C.J. (mentor)","2013","For a wind turbine, the flow downstream of the turbines (wake) is influenced by the power extraction process. This causes a momentum deficit behind the rotor, resulting in lower velocities in the wake than the free-stream velocity. Wind turbines in a wind farm are likely to operate in the wakes of upstream turbines. This drops the power production of these wind turbines. Better control strategies could help in reducing these wake losses. The first step towards achieving this goal is understanding the physics of wake re-energization. The wake of an horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT) is investigated using Stereo Particle Image Velocimetry (SPIV) in the open jet wind tunnel facility (OJF). The wind turbine used in the experiment is a 2-bladed wind turbine having the profile of Eppler E387 airfoil, with a design tip speed ratio of 6. Using SPIV, a three component velocity field is obtained for two different tip speed ratios (TSR). The wake is captured upto 5 diameters downstream with a focus on the shear layer. Both phase-locked and uncorrelated sampled data are obtained during the experiment. The results from the experiment show that the tip vortices interact and leapfrogging phenomenon occurs. After the leapfrogging the tip vortices breakdown rapidly. The downstream location at which the leapfrogging takes place is dependent on the tip speed ratio. The distribution of the stream-wise axial velocity increases immediately after the point of maximum leapfrogging, implying the point of wake re-energization. The reason for tip vortex leapfrogging may be attributed to the difference in the manufacturing of the two blades. A 6% difference in the circulation is observed between the tip vortices released by the two blades. The circulation calculated along the span of the blades shows a good match with the data obtained from blade element method simulations. Preliminary results showing the loads on two different blade sections are also calculated.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Wind Energy","","","",""

While for the user this is mainly as a result of increasing operational costs associated with the devices for heating and cooling, the bigger concern for environmentally conscious engineers and designers lies in reducing the emission of green house gases. Further, use of locally available eco-friendly materials are also gaining popularity as they have the potential to reduce the embodied energy to a great extent. In this master thesis project, a design concept for a dynamic façade system for urban India (mainly for the hot-humid climate zone) using bamboo has been developed. The design is based on promoting cooling by natural ventilation in combination with positioning the façade elements in such a way that reduces the impact of heat released due to thermal mass on the indoor climate. Thermal comfort has been assessed based on Adaptive Thermal Comfort models for the hot-humid climate zone. CFD tool of the software, DesignBuilder in combination with excel calculations were carried out to perform the necessary building physics calculations. Further, the environmental impact of the design has been evaluated by the Cradle2Cradle framework.","Hot-humid Climate; Bamboo; India; Climate Adaptive Facade","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-09-30","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Building Physics and Technology","",""

(mentor); Zadpoor, A. (mentor); Tiso, P. (mentor)","2013","Use of DXA-measured aBMD is the common method to predict osteoporotic hip fractures in clinical settings. However, taking only the changes in aBMD into consideration is not enough to explain the whole variety of low energy fractures. It is deemed essential to develop alternative methods that also reflect the influence of other parameters (e.g. shape of the anatomical structure, load conditions), which are known to be associated with fracture. Development of subject specific FE models is a powerful instrument for investigating bone strength in vivo and, thus, for estimating the risk of fracture. As the mentioned alternative methods need to be adaptable to clinical settings while also being accurate and sufficiently fast for specific tasks, e.g. estimation of proximal femur fracture load, the main aim of this study was to develop a framework that is adaptable to clinical uses and has room for improvement. The presented semi-automatic framework covers development of patient specific FE models based on DXA to predict proximal femur fracture load. Information on the proximal femur shape of individuals were directly derived from DXA by Active Appearance Models (AAM), which detects the object of interest by fitting statistical shape models to the new set of images. To build up AAM, a training data set of DXA scans of 70 proximal femurs was used. Furthermore, 17 DXA scans of the proximal femurs that had been not included in the training set were used as test samples, on which the FE models were developed. To evaluate the effect of segmentation in prediction of proximal femur fracture load, two different cases were considered: proximal femurs that had been segmented using AAM and the same samples with manual segmentation. In order to evaluate the accuracy of AAM, leave-one-out experiments were conducted which provided a point-to-curve error of 1.2470 ±0.6505 (mm) (with 95% confidence). On the other hand, point-to-curve error in segmentation of 17 proximal femurs that were used in the FE analyses was computed as 1.4169 ± 0.7499 (mm) (with 95% confidence). Taking all of the 17 proximal femur samples into account, the fracture loads were estimated to be 3870.9 ± 932.83 (N) for manual segmentation case and 3804.2 ± 850.11 (N) for segmentation case using AAM. A strong correlation was observed between these estimated failure loads (R2 =0.8197). On the other hand, it was noticed that even small errors (e.g. 1.06 mm) in segmentation process might result in larger errors (e.g. 24.1%) in the prediction of fracture load. This work presents the first results obtained with the created framework, which is found to perform sufficiently well compared to its equivalents and is easily adaptable to clinical settings. However, considering the load prediction sensitivity to segmentation, further improvement in the accuracy of the segmentation process is believed to be a vital step for future studies. Such a development might be valuable for the prediction accuracy of proximal femur fracture risk.","osteoporosis; active appearance models; finite element analysis; proximal","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-09-30","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

(mentor)","2013","Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a newly developed technique in solar cell manufacturing which is based on sequential chemical interaction between precursor gases and the substrate of the wafer. These gases react with the substrate one at a time repeatedly until the growing atomic layer is sufficiently deposited onto the wafer. Levitech is a Netherlands-based company that supplies solar cell manufacturing equipment (Levitrack) employing ALD technique to the industry . In levitrack, the wafers are injected with a high-pressure valve into a chamber where ALD process takes place. The wafers oscillate regularly in lateral directions under the influence of the gases during the transportation. Sometimes the wafers are damaged due to the collision between the wafer and the side-walls when the oscillation amplitude is beyond the range of the chamber. The cause for the oscillation as well as the methods to reduce oscillation amplitude is to be studied in order to reduce the failure of the wafers. This assignment is focused on the research and improvement of dynamic behavior of the wafer in lateral directions. In this project, a fundamental hypothesis is firstly proposed that the wafer oscillates with a deterministic stiffness coefficient. The oscillation is caused by the component of the injecting velocity in lateral directions. A theoretical dynamic equation of the wafer is then derived, which is closed with the value of stiffness coefficient computed in numerical approach. Afterwards, the dynamic equation is verified with experimental work. In numerical simulation, a parameter study is executed to reduce the oscillation amplitude. A discussion about the influence of different parameters on the amplitude is performed as well. Finally, an analytical explanation to the physics is elaborated in this report. In this project, many reasonable assumptions are figured out to simplify the problems as well as to highlight the dominant properties of the physics. Laminar flow and thin-film flow are coupled in numerical computation in order to increase computation efficiency. It is finally found that the unavoidable leaking of the device plays a more important role in causing the collision than the lateral component of injecting velocity of the wafer. In addition, the fundamental hypothesis, dynamic equations and numerical computation are demonstrated sufficient in industry by experimental work. The data obtained in the project are employed in the manufacturing of new devices.","lateral oscillation; stiffness; laminar flow; thin-film flow; model coupling; finite element analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-01-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Den Hartigh, E. (mentor); Van der Voort, H. (mentor)","2013","Innovation is fundamental for a firm, especially in high tech industry, to survive in a competitive environment. Often found in large firms, the innovation activities are conducted under a separate department: Research and Development (R&D) department. Limited financing resources to develop an innovation project requires a firm to find another resources from the outside. Inter-organizational activity is one of the possible ways to fulfill such needs. Selecting the right financing instruments in the systematic process becomes very important to support the development of the innovation projects. Therefore, the design of the framework that enables the company to make an effective selection of external financing opportunities through inter-organizational activites is being the focus of this research. This thesis conducts a case study in Firm X that operates within high tech industry and characterized with long technology life cycle and high competitive environment. Given the limited financing resources has forced Firm X to find external financial resources to finance the development of their innovation projects. However, it is also unclear for them how to systematically select the financing opportunities that fit with their company. Currently, they have no systematic approach in deciding the suitable external financial opportunities. Thus, the result of this study could gives input to Firm X to have a systematic approach in deciding the suitable external financial opportunities. To conduct this research, firstly extensive literature studies are executed to identify and reach a better understanding of the concepts that influence in designing the framework. Secondly, the concepts that are identified in the first phase are empirically proven and/or improved by the results of semi-structured interview in the case of Firm X. Five different financing instruments are explored, namely: 1).EU Funding programs, 2). NL government funding programs, 3).Structural funding programs, 4).Co-financing with other organization, and 5).Special financing arrangement. And finally, the framework is formed based on the requirements that are identified in the second phase. The results of the study suggest that a rational decision making model is the suitable systematic approach. It consists of seven sequential steps. Moreover, selection criteria play an important role in the proposed framework. It assesses the advantages and disadvantages of each financing instrument to the firm. The findings of the study suggest that amount of public support, R&D intensity, incoming spillovers, technology opportunities and IP rights and publication are top five most important criteria to considered in selecting the equity type of organization structure with exploration/exploitation objective. While for the non-equity type of organization structure with exploitation-objective, criteria that become the strongest factors to select them are amount of public support, technological opportunities, IP ownership, clear objectives, roles and responsibilities, partners reputation and timing and duration. Furthermore, criteria that play predominant role in selecting the non-equity type of organization structure with exploration-objective are amount of public support, incoming spillovers, R&D intensity, and communication. It is expected that by adopting the proposed framework, a high tech firm could provide a more structured and systematic decision making process in selecting external financing opportunities. At the end, the decision makers are seen adjusting their rationality rather than completely blind in making the decision just using their gut feeling.","inter-organizational activities; external financing of innovation projects; innovation project portfolio; financing instrument","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2015-09-22","Technology, Policy and Management","Technology, Strategy, and Entrepreneurship","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor); Quist, J.N. (mentor)","2013","The Master’s programme Industrial Ecology is jointly organised by Leiden University and Delft University of Technology. Sustainable development is a young, developing field in which many standards, certificates, and initiatives are spawning. Companies are expected to work on sustainable development by its customers, investors, and society in general. It can be difficult to do this effectively because the field is cluttered and can be confusing. The Sustainability Maturity Model (SMM) presents an overview of sustainability topics and helps companies prioritise between them. The SMM was developed in a collaboration of Ecomatters (a consultancy firm in sustainability and regulatory affairs) and the master programme Industrial Ecology of Delft University of Technology and Leiden University to assist companies with defining their internal sustainability agenda. The SMM does that by supporting companies through providing an overview of the sustainability topics they are expected to manage, and prioritising them. The SMM consists of a list of 29 sustainability topics based on established standards, and is combined with a 5-step level system, that is based on the Capability Maturity Model. This project was commissioned by Ecomatters and its main goal was to operationalise the SMM and execute a pilot with potential users to assess the SMM’s viability as a consultancy product. The second goal was to relate the SMM to current academic literature. The SMM relates to current academic literature. It is based on the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) of ‘People, Planet, Profit’ developed by John Elkington. The TBL is the most widely accepted approach to sustainable development (Stubbs and Cocklin 2008). Sustainable development was defined by the World Council on Environment and Development as meeting the needs of the present without compromising the needs of future generations (WCED 1987). The topic list of the SMM is based on established frameworks: the European Eco-Management and Audit Scheme, the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, ISO 26000 on Social Responsibility, and Social Accountability’s SA8000. Next to topics from these frameworks, the SMM includes the topic Future Business Activities which is based on the widely used framework Transition Management that was developed to incorporate sustainability trends into the business strategy (Loorbach, van Bakel et al. 2010). The topic ‘Sustainability Awareness’ was added because it is recognised as an important factor for the sustainability performance of a company (McEwen and Schmidt 2007). Since the issues companies “are expected to manage” is an important theme in the SMM, it is important to understand the role business is expected to assume in sustainable development. Business is expected to address sustainability issues through developing sustainable products and processes (Hall, Daneke et al. 2010, Porter and Kramer 2011). Sustainable products and processes are expected to play an important role, but the issues in sustainable development are too complex to be tackled by single organisations (Loorbach, van Bakel et al. 2010). Therefore, business needs to form coalitions with different types of organisations (SustainAbility 2004). The level system of the SMM includes requirements regarding both expectations. The lower levels have to do with the internal processes and the highest level covers collaboration with other organisations. The levels are based on the Capability Maturity Model (Paulk, Curtis et al. 1993) that originated from software development and is now widely used as a basis for managing business processes in a stepwise approach (de Bruin, Rosemann et al. 2005). The level system follows the best practices for maturity models defined by De Bruin et al. (2005). The SMM does not present any final score on sustainability. For individual actors such as companies, ‘being sustainable’ is not possible since sustainability is a property of a system, not of an individual component (Nikolic 2009). The SMM does not prescribe a minimum level anywhere. Individual actors cannot be obliged to not perform unsustainable actions when they intend no harm and when the influence of those actions is too small to change anything (Sinnott-Armstrong 2010). Instead, companies are encouraged to define their own priorities and decide how strongly they want to perform on each individual topic. The SMM was reviewed in four steps: aligning the topics from the different standards, supplementing the topic list with findings from academic literature, fitting the level system to the CMM and the situation, and testing its operationalisation in a pilot. After the review, the SMM was operationalised by creating a leaflet that introduces potential participants to the pilot, an one-page introduction to the workshop, a presentation to guide the workshop, a set of forms to guide the consultant through the workshop and make quick notes on, and a format for the feedback report the companies received after the pilot. Eight companies in the chemical, food and energy industries with revenues of 176 million to 3,7 billion participated in the pilot. They were represented by one or two of their managers in sustainability (six companies) or communications (two companies). During the 3-hour workshops, the topics in the Sustainability Maturity Model were discussed one by one. After the workshops had been held, the participants received feedback reports that analysed their results as well as the average results of the entire group. The gap analysis and recommendations about topics to work on formed the core of these reports. The participants were phoned to discuss the value of this feedback and how it could be used within the company. From the perspective of the participants, the workshops and feedback reports were useful. The participants appreciated the broadness of the topics list, the structured approach, the face to face interaction, and the emphasis on prioritising. Applying the same management framework to each topic and being selective about the topics to work on was seen as a novel approach. Most of the participants felt that their feedback report provided useful input for determining the focus of their strategy. The SMM was tested with medium and larger sized companies and found suitable when the participants were open to the approach. According to an industry expert, it could be useful for smaller companies as well. The usefulness of the model depends on how open the company is to its approach of prioritising and advancing within a topic list. Even though literature research and the reactions from the participants show that the SMM is suitable for its intended use, several practical improvements could increase the usefulness of the SMM process further, the main recommendations being: conducting the workshop with multiple people to increase data quality, preparing them for the workshop better to save time during the workshop, and providing more detail on the requirements per topic in the feedback so it is easier for participants to define follow up actions. By doing workshops with a large group of similar companies the benchmarking function of the SMM can be improved, which is a feature the participants of the pilot asked for. Before this project, the concept of the SMM was defined, but it was not ready for use in a consultancy context yet. This project has strengthened the link between the SMM and current literature on sustainable development in the business context, has made the SMM usable, and the first pilot was conducted. The pilot was the first presentation of the SMM to potential users, and their predominantly positive reactions have shown that the SMM is now ready for use in a consultancy context. The SMM and the work done for it during this project are property of Ecomatters. This report contains the part of the information that was selected to be publicly available. Company results have been aggregated and anonymised, and parts of the analysis and description of the model have been omitted in this report to guarantee the confidentiality of this information. Parts of the analysis and description of the model were retained to serve as examples of the further development of the SMM and the results of that process.","sustainability; sustainable; agenda; priority; business; pilot; model; consultancy; manage; ISO 14001; SA 8000; Capability Maturity Model; company; EMAS; DJSI; ISO 26000; standard; guideline; people; planet; profit; GRI; topic; level; operationalise; organisational capability; management; maturity; capability; improvement; test; interview; feedback; workshop; benchmark; comparison; ambition; supply chain; life cycle; strategy; business strategy; partnership; collaboration; triple bottom line; prioritise; compare; collaborate; consult; consultant; companies; businesses; improve; capable; mature","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy & Industry","","Industrial Ecology","",""

(mentor); Duin, R.J. (mentor); Kortmann, R. (mentor)","2013","In today’s highly competitive market, it is very difficult for companies to stay successful in the market. While manufacturing methods have improved in last fifty years, competition is taking place at the level of whole supply chain rather than production only. Accordingly, the apparel industry which has long and complicated supply network needs more consideration. Based on literature, in the past two decades, a number of studies have been done in this industry. Operations strategy influences the whole supply network because of its effects on different aspects of the supply network such as production, labour, transport, and distribution. These four aspects account for most of supply chain costs. Companies follow particular business strategies to position themselves in the market. Business strategy is the primary driver of the company, which affects the whole supply network and consequently, the operations strategy. Subsequently, decision making on appropriate operations strategy helps the company to achieve its goal and its desired image in the market. The goal of this research is strategic alignment regarding the company’s supply network. In other words, the goal is to improve the decision making process of companies in apparel industry such that the right operations strategy can be selected based on their business strategy. To evaluate the supply network, three Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are defined. The main KPIs in apparel industry are: lead time, fulfilment rate, and cost. The study is founded on exploring the literature, interviews with experts, defining a case, running a simulation model to generate data for decision analysis part, and finally, using a multiple criteria decision analysis method. The case provides one year of data for the research modelling from July 2011 to March 2012. As mentioned, the model includes two parts; simulation part and decision analysis part. The first part is simulation of the supply chain according to different operations strategies. In this part, four main aspects of the supply chain operation are considered: production, labour, transport, and distribution. The simulation results in different values for KPIs based on each set of operations strategy. Then, the second part is decision making on choosing the appropriate operations strategy based on defined KPIs generated by simulation model. This analysis is performed according to a quantitative Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) method. Finally, the whole modelling process of the study leads to aligning operations strategy of a company with its business strategy.","supply network; business strategy; operations strategy; decision support tool; apparel industry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Multi Actor Systems","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management (SEPAM)","",""

(mentor); Abspoel, R. (mentor); Pasterkamp, S. (mentor); Van Lammeren, T. (mentor)","2013","This master’s thesis is about the use of higher strength steel in buildings and the economical advantages of the use of this steel. The economical advantages are examined based on a comparison of similar designs with the use of the steel grades S355 and S460. The latter could in some cases result in large weight and cost savings. The costs are examined for trusses and columns. The trusses are applied to transfer loads from 5 different floors to columns up to 40 m apart. The columns are examined for a high-rise office with 24 stories. For all the components examined the costs have been calculated. These costs are divided into 4 different groups: Material, fabrication, transportation and assembly costs. When designing constructions with the use of S460 large material cost savings can be expected. Due to the excellent properties of this steel grade the use of S460 is beneficial for both light weight and heavy sections. For heavy sections exceptionally large material cost savings can be expected. The use of this steel grade should however be limited to axially loaded members only. Fabrication costs are more difficult to describe than the material costs. Stronger steel grades have a larger hardness which makes sawing and drilling for example more difficult. The reduced thicknesses that can be achieved by using S460 can however be assumed to compensate for this increased difficulty. Fabrication costs will ultimately not differ much from the costs required for a design with the use of S355. Assembly costs can be reduced due to the lower weight of the components. If trusses are used the total weight can be reduced significantly and the use of smaller cranes is therefore possible. The time required for construction will not change much but the costs for the required equipment could decrease significantly due to the decreased weight. The transportation costs can also be reduced because of the reduced weight. Less trucks are required to transport sections and plates to the construction site which results in a cost reduction proportional to the weight saving. The total costs for a steel structure will be lower when S460 is used. The costs for beams cannot be reduced because the use of S460 is very inefficient in these cases. A steel structure can therefore be designed with the use of S460 for the columns and S355 for beams to achieve an optimal economical design.","economical advantages; High strength steel; HSS; S355; S460; fabrication; assembly; transportation; material","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-05-29","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural and Building Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2013","A new approach in coastal maintenance is the application of a large scale nourishment as natural feeder of the coast. The Sand Motor constructed near Kijkduin on the Holland Coast is a pilot project of this new nourishment strategy. The objective of this research is to contribute to a better understanding of the sediment transport processes at nourishments by analysing the sediment sorting processes. Field data of the sediment characteristics in the Sand Motor area is used to determine the sediment sorting in the Sand Motor area. A numerical model (Delft3D) is used to simulate the sediment sorting processes and time scales in the cross-shore direction at a large scale nourishment. The measurement data showed an increase of the sediment sorting in the longshore direction. The sediment at the Sand Motor was coarser than the sediment in the area North of the Sand Motor. It is hypothesised that the fining North of the Sand Motor is caused by the deposition of relatively fine material that is eroded at the Sand Motor. A measured decrease of the uniformity coefficient at the Sand Motor is in accordance with this hypothesis. In the cross-shore direction the minimum median grain size in the transects was found to move seaward after the construction of the Sand Motor. It is assumed that the wave conditions preceding these measurements influenced the location of the minimum median grain size. Higher wave conditions are assumed to lead to a minimum median grain size located further offshore due to the stronger undertow. The model results show a strong influence of the sedimentation and erosion in the profile on the sediment sorting pattern. This pattern is found to be independent of the initial bathymetry and initial sediment composition of the nourishment. It is shown that extreme wave heights have a large influence on the sediment distribution in the profile as wave conditions determine the area where sediment sorting takes place. Furthermore, the sediment distribution also responds more quickly to higher waves. Finally, the hypothesis is confirmed that the location of the minimum median grain size in the profile depends on the wave conditions. Model results show that the location of the minimum median grain size is located at the edge of the morphologically active profile and is thus related to the wave height via the closure depth formulation. To conclude, this research consists of new measurement information on the sediment composition in the Sand Motor area and a comparison of this data set with existing measurement campaigns. This information shows the influence of the Sand Motor on the alongshore and cross-shore sediment sorting and states the influence of the wave conditions on the location of the minimum median grain size in the profile. The model study shows the utility of a relatively simple Delft3D model to study the influence of different parameters on the sediment sorting processes and the timescale of these processes.","sediment sorting; grain size; nourishment; Sand Motor; cross-shore","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-03-30","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

(mentor); Dijkema, P.G.M. (mentor); Scholten, D.J. (mentor); Ghorbani, A. (mentor); Hardi, E. (mentor)","2013","Biogas networks can reduce CO2 emissions by replacing natural gas consumption with biogas consumption. This means that biogas production can contribute to the Dutch targets to reduce CO2 emissions by 20% and increase renewable energy production to 16% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels. It is unclear how the biogas infrastructure system will develop over the coming years in the Netherlands and therefore how it will contribute to the Dutch CO2 reduction and renewable energy production targets. A deep understanding of the biogas infrastructure system and the impact of different policies and external factors over the long term is currently missing. Current scientific literature proposes policy changes to develop the Dutch biogas system, but it does not quantify the effects of these proposals. Linear programming approaches have been used to quantify the impact of different model parameters, but are unsuitable to capture system development and policy changes due to their over simplification of reality. Nevertheless, computer simulation of the biogas system is a useful way to assess the impact of policies and scenarios over a long period of time. In fact, simulation is necessary since biogas networks are an innovation in biogas production and there are only a few existing biogas pipelines and biogas grids under development in the Netherlands. Agent based modeling is useful for modeling system developments and policy changes by separately modeling the institutions, technical system and stakeholder interactions. Agent based simulation of biogas networks is relatively new, which leads to the following research questions: How can we develop a simulation model to explore the conditions for, and characteristics of a robust biogas infrastructure system? 1. What social aspects are relevant to model for the biogas infrastructure system? 2. What technical aspects are relevant to model for the biogas infrastructure system? 3. What operational aspects are relevant to model for the biogas infrastructure system? 4. What parameters is the simulation model sensitive to? Models are simplifications of reality, which is why the first research objective is: To create a conceptual model which captures the biogas system concepts in a structured way and which serves as a bridge between the real world and computer simulation model. In order to study the biogas system it has to be implemented in a computer simulation model, resulting in the second research objective: To run experiments on the biogas simulation model to explore the conditions for and characteristics of a robust biogas system. Outcomes In this research a conceptual model of the Dutch biogas infrastructure system was created using the MAIA meta-model. The conceptual model focusses on the biogas production by agricultural firms and water treatments. The conceptual model can be used by programmers, without any prior knowledge of the biogas infrastructure system, to implement a simulation model. In this research the conceptual model was implement in an agent based model using NetLogo and experiments were performed on the simulation model to explore the conditions for and characteristics of a robust biogas system. The outcomes provide insights in the possible development of the biogas infrastructure system and the parameters that drive these developments. Results A robust biogas infrastructure system can develop without any subsidies, but the future is very uncertain. In 54% of the cases there is no biogas production since it is not economically viable. In the remaining 46% agricultural biogas projects have a positive cash flow. However, around 69% of the projects have a negative Net Present Value. External market prices for co-substrates, natural gas and CO2 largely determine the feasibility and profitability of biogas production. Longer depreciation periods as well as increasing natural gas prices increase the initial profitability of biogas, but also expose agricultural firms to the risks and uncertainty of external price developments. Socialization of biogas pipeline costs does not increase the biogas systems’ performance in terms of biogas production and yearly profits. Renegotiating biogas prices for existing contracts increases the profitability of biogas projects, because it reduces the risks of changing external market prices for biogas producers. Reflection The conceptual model should be expanded with additional sub-systems, such as local manure and co-substrate markets, to better understand their dynamics and impacts. There is little information available about the production and direct use of biogas. Assumptions underlying the Net Present Value calculations largely determine experimental outcomes, which makes it harder to meaningfully interpret and use the data. Few policy options were explored during the experiments, limiting the amount of policy recommendations that can be made. Policy recommendations The following policy recommendations are expected to reduce the uncertainty of biogas production and profitability. Policy implementation is expected to increase biogas production by 37% and average cash flows by 64%. However, around 66% of the biogas projects are still expected to have a negative Net Present Value. Expand the positieve lijst to allow agricultural firms to use a wider range of co-substrates as well as local waste streams. This is expected to lower the costs of co-substrates for agricultural biogas producers. 1. Increase depreciation periods to 15 years, but operate the biogas production for the duration of its (longer) technical lifetime. Investments in biogas projects should be earned back within a reasonable period, but technical lifetimes far exceed the economic lifetimes of biogas assets. 2. Redistribute uncertainty in a fair way by periodically renegotiating contract prices. Biogas contracts have a long lifetime and the price of biogas should be adjusted to changes in the prices of natural gas, co-substrates and CO2. Future research More research domains should be combined by expanding the conceptual model, resulting in a richer model that can better explain emerging system behavior. Especially the manure and co-substrate sub-systems are important candidates due to their high impacts on operational costs of agricultural biogas producers. Efforts should be made to compare simulation models of the biogas system in terms of structure and output. As more simulation models are being created comparisons can lead to new insights, or comparisons can put simulation results into perspective. Additionally, the usefulness of different simulation methods can be assessed. Smart agents should be implemented to allow for better decision making in the dynamic biogas system. This allows the agents to make predictions and decisions based on historical and current information. Persisting trends are not recognized by normal agents, which can put them at risk in a biogas system where the value of biogas and the price of co-substrates are not linked together. Further research should be done to challenge and improve the underlying assumptions of the Net Present Value calculations of biogas projects. Other measures, such as Return on Investment, should also be explored. Collaborative modeling can help in creating scenarios that are accepted by the involved stakeholders. These simulations of the biogas system focus on exploring the possibilities of biogas rather than predicting developments in biogas production.","agent-based modeling; biogas; conceptualization; infrastructure; institutional analysis; social simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy & Industry","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management","",""

(mentor); Gerritsen, B.H.M. (mentor)","2013","Introduction This thesis is part of my Master of Science graduation project at the OV-chipkaart Graduation Lab of the Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering at the Delft University of Technology. The aim of the Graduation Lab is to improve electronic ticketing for travellers using Dutch public transport in a 3 to 10 year time-span. This work is supported by the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment, provinces (IPO), city regions (SkVV), Dutch Railways (NS), Rotterdam public transport (RET), and consumer organisation Rover. Electronic ticketing The OV-chipkaart electronic ticketing system for Dutch public transport achieves its goals and fulfils its purpose as is (Niemantsverdriet, 2011). It is a reliable payment system that allows for exact revenue distribution and securing stations by limiting entrance to people with tickets. While these business goals have been achieved, a holistic and integrated travel experience has not been a top priority. Problem Groups of travellers have experienced system related problems that could have been solved beforehand, such as inconsistent and confusing human-machine interfaces, hard to understand system rules, and a lack of system transparency. Wayfinding, smartcard acquisition, problem solving and lack of transparency were the four main usability problems found in Joppien, Niermeijer & Niks (2013). The lack of transparency caused by the ticket information invisibility is a usability problem with low impact, high frequency and high persistency. Solving this usability problem will improve the customer satisfaction of a large group of people on many occasions. Product proposals To make ticket information visible, I studied the available technologies and analysed several solutions: portable smartcard reader, a smartcard with integrated display, local NFC smartcard communication and backend information communication. I evaluated these proposals with medium-fidelity prototypes with 16 travellers and 15 experts. I concluded that they see limited usefulness for a portable reader and are enthusiastic about the display card, but have strong preference for a smartphone solution. Participants would preferably use a smartphone that allows fare payment instead of just local NFC or backend ticket information visualisation. Recommended proposal With this user input, I designed a smartphone solution that allows travellers to pay for public transport and fits the existing OV-chipkaart infrastructure. I compared the viability of using GPS, NFC, BLE, tracking and QR codes for this purpose and concluded that QR codes best fit the requirements for the foreseeable future. QR code tickets are able to use scanners that are already being developed for international travellers and post-pay services for business travellers. Some of the other technologies do not have enough market penetration or have technical limitations. The proposed design for fare payment with smartphones is an app that generates a QR code and displays it on screen. This QR code is scanned at check-in and check-out points by a new type of validator, ensuring reliable fare collection. The QR code communicates the ticket information to the OV-chipkaart system while the app can display the same information in a human readable format to travellers. Conductors are able to validate tickets by scanning a similar QR code generated by the app. The app can also show travel history, as well as purchased and available season tickets, and current travel information based on GPS location information and online route information services. A user of this app is logged in to his public transport account, which links the smartphone to a bank account. I evaluated this smartphone fare payment proposal with a high-fidelity prototype with 10 participants and the results were positive. Participants preferred the use of a contactless technology that would not require line of sight (i.e., NFC, BLE or similar), but indicated that a solution that uses QR codes would both solve their ticket information visibility problem and be preferable in use to the current smartcard. While a growing majority of people has smartphones, there will probably always remain a group of people who either do not have one or do not want to use one for fare payment. To also improve the travel experience for these people, I also re-evaluated the display card. Participants without smartphones prefer the display card to paper tickets, the current smartcard and a smartphone solution. A major concern remains the development and production costs: travellers are probably unwilling to pay more for a required purchase. Selling the display card for a higher price besides a regular smartcard will probably result in a relatively low volume of sales, increasing the per unit production costs in a vicious circle. Especially infrequent travellers and low-income earners could benefit from greater insight into their credit balance and travel expenses, but would probably be reluctant to purchase a higher price display card. Conclusion I recommend developing both the display card and smartphone fare payment app, in order to improve the travel experience for all people. The display card should replace the existing smartcard. The smartphone app should start with QR codes for device-system communication and other technologies should be followed closely.","ov-chipkaart; electronic ticketing; e-ticketing; user-centred design; user-centered design; multi-stakeholder; OV-chipkaart Graduation Lab","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

Our hypothesis is that these applications contain severe errors, take unnecessary performance penalties, and violate accessibility standards. This study analyzes such errors and tries to quantify the need for a tool that can help developers make web applications with less errors. The research is conducted by first showing how much of the DOM is modified after the initial page load. This could indicate that static analysis does not suffice anymore. After that we quantify the amount of faults in the web application. The research is done on 3,422 sites randomly selected from the internet. They were automatically analyzed using a crawler. We conclude that the use of static analysis tools to prevent these faults does not suffice anymore. The errors and accessibility standard violations happen in dynamically generated DOM, which are not detectable by static analysis. The performance penalties are only visible through dynamic analysis. We propose to develop a random testing tool based on a crawler that checks for these errors. Our main contributions are the design of such a tool, the large dataset that we have gathered during this research and the quantification of both the level of dynamism of modern web applications and the fault-proneness of these applications due to this dynamism.","crawling; testing; web applications","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-09-27","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","Software Engineering","",""

Academic research focuses mainly on upper context aspects such as smart grids or smart homes. Relatively lower interest is drawn to user awareness for reducing energy usage. Every individual can achieve a greener footprint when provided with detailed information about the appliances' consumption that he uses. To that extent, a direct association between the user/device, and the corresponding wall socket must be established, especially when the latter is publicly accessible. The objective of this thesis is to examine and present a novel Power Modulation Association protocol. The proposed protocol is deployable for the pair of a smart wall socket and a smart device. Information is exchanged over the AC power cable via modulating either the power demand of the device, or the power supply provided by the socket. Via this technique, when shareable sockets are present, individual pricing policies for domestic or vocational habitats may be introduced that can influence the building power consumption. Ultimately, a socket is paired with the attached device and thus, the latter is then granted with electrical power. The evaluation of the system is performed by extensive experimentation in actual running conditions. The aim was to select the optimal association modality and above all, confirm the feasibility of the developed communication schemes. Results demonstrate that the proposed system is capable of establishing a half-duplex serial communication mechanism that can effectively facilitate the pairing between a smart socket and a smart device.","power modulation; smart grid; smart metering; pairing protocol","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software and Computer Technology","","Embedded Systems","",""

The variant, where the deflections are critical, the use of carbon fibres in the FRP and pre-cambering of the slide is necessary. The variant where the deflections are not the limiting factor, cheaper glass fibres can be used in the FRP, but this option needs extra adjustments on the concrete structure. This last option is worked out in more detail, because this option offers some long term advantages. Also a life cycle analysis (LCA) is carried out to compare the investment costs of an FRP-slide with the maintenance costs of the current barrier. This LCA shows that the life cycle costs of an FRP slide are much lower over 100 years then for a steel slide.

This has led to the development of reservoir models and simulators, able to predict future field behaviour, when paired with accurate geological information. However, the data obtained through in-situ measurements, such as seismic surveys, is insufficient to represent the large number of unknowns (porosity, permeability, pressure and fluid saturation in each grid cell). In response to this issue, the scientific community designed computer-assisted history matching algorithms, which are able to provide estimates for model parameters by conditioning on the log of observed production data. The Ensemble Kalman Filter, in particular, is becoming the industry standard, because of its ease of implementation and natural ability to handle uncertainty. However, as past studies have pointed out, reservoirs with complex structural features, such as curved or branching channels, raise difficulties because of the higher-order dependencies induced between the state variables. Another important drawback is the appearance of ensemble collapse, which leads to poor estimates and causes the filter to diverge. The Subspace EnKF is a recently developed history matching framework, able to address both of these issues, by using parameterizations to constrain the ensemble members to different subregions of the parameter space. The main goal of the Master's project was to adapt this framework to 2D channelized petroleum reservoirs, composed of two types of rocks (permeable sand and background shale). For this purpose, we studied polynomial kernel Principal Components Analysis and proposed a novel analytical solution to the preimage problem. The experiments showed that our method surpasses the fixed-point iterative scheme, suggested in the literature, especially in terms of scalability and computational expense. Next, we paired the resulting KPCA parameterization with the Iterative Ensemble Smoother and the Subspace EnKF. Our comparative history matching experiment revealed that the latter is able to successfully avoid ensemble collapse. Finally, we suggested training set clustering as a means to accommodate the subspace parameterizations to the prior information and conducted a sensitivity study on the Subspace EnKF, which yielded encouraging results.","petroleum reservoir; history matching; data assimilation; channels; multipoint geostatistics; kernel principal component analysis; kalman filter; ensemble smoother; subspace parameterization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied Mathematics","","Risk and Environmental Modelling","",""

(mentor); Storm, S. (mentor); Pruyt, E. (mentor)","2013","Years of turmoil in the banking sector have revealed the need to assess the performance of banks and explore the resilience of the banking system under adverse futures. Banks are not the safe houses everyone believed them to be, as the recent crisis of 2007 showed. Today, banks are highly uncertain dynamically complex systems that are permanently at risk due to internal and external stresses and uncertainties. Although external uncertainties and stresses cannot be controlled and accurately forecasted, system’s exploration under plausible futures can lead to the identification of its weak points. Monitoring a complex system like a bank and identifying vulnerabilities to different types of risks requires advanced tools. Monitoring and analytical tools, like financial stress tests, are developed by regulatory authorities and financial institutions to identify causes and vulnerabilities of the system under adverse future scenarios. Financial stress testing allows assessing the financial system stability or even individual bank’s performance. During the last decade, the evolution in this field is significant, in an effort to enhance the resilience of financial institutions, especially after the severe financial crisis. New methodologies and more elaborated tools are implemented in risk management practices of banks. Common techniques can be summarised in simple sensitivity tests and historical or hypothetical scenario analyses. To this direction, focusing on an approach that could simulate multiple future hypothetical scenarios, exploratory System Dynamics modelling could offer a new tool for a model based exploration in order to support monitoring of bank’s financial state. This research illustrates a pilot System Dynamics approach towards financial stress testing in view of making banks more robust by identifying possible weaknesses. A System Dynamics model was developed to represent the core endogenous operations of a bank. The bank model represents a medium sized commercial bank and not a systemic bank of a country. The level of aggregation provides an example of its balance sheet but it is not an accurate and detailed representation of a bank. Although, further research is needed for a more detailed model, an analysis of plausible scenarios that could have effects on bank’s balance sheet, regarding its net worth and liquidity, is performed. The model is constantly or periodically attacked by unforeseen risks and shocks in order to generate insights into all sorts of plausible bank system behaviours under stress. The use of EMA workbench can assist in the exploration of those behaviours by plotting all the plausible future scenarios. Based on the observed behaviours we identify the causes of undesirable dynamics, vulnerabilities and levers.

(mentor); De Lille, C. (mentor)","2013","Thales, a well-known company that provides products and services for the aerospace, defence, transportation and security markets, is a technology driven company. The usual approach to innovation within a technology driven company is to focus on the development of a technology, and once the technology is ready, find application for it in the marketplace [technology push]. Further, as a B2B company, many of Thales’ businesses are used to following call for tenders and designing as per the requirements of the client. But such a business-client set up is undergoing change, and clients are increasingly looking up to companies to proactively come up with innovative solutions. Doing so requires a deeper understanding of the client needs and emerging trends in the market. Many senior executives within Thales realize that the company needs to adapt to the new emerging reality. Therefore, they want to enrich company’s current approach to innovation with design thinking, which is known to enable ‘market pull’ innovations. An entity named, Design Center, has been set up in one of the seven corporate universities of Thales group, with the aim to bring design thinking within Thales group’s fold. But implementing something new in a huge and complex company as Thales, is not an easy task. For example, the businesses of the company operate in very different industry dynamics and timelines. Design Center, set up in January 2013 and inaugurated in April 2013, is trying to figure out the right angle to position itself attractively to potential clients. This project aims to support Design Center as it takes its first steps within the company, trying to spread the understanding, and eventually the acceptance, of design thinking. Cynthia Tripp, former marketing director for global design at P&G, had a word of advice about bringing design thinking within organizations. “The trick is”, she says “Don’t turn it into an education program. Turn it into a problem-solving machine”. Design Center has a similar belief. In fact there are two important reasons for believing so – one, some critical design thinking skills are developed only by working on full-fledged projects (experiential learning), and two, people are motivated to learn new things and to put great effort, when the problem they are working on, directly concerns their work. But to do projects with Design Center, people should first know, what problem they want to tackle using design thinking. Considering the problem of Design Center in a holistic way, we have structured the problem to be consisting of four parts. 1) Convert The Visitor into The Seeker, by raising The Visitor’s consciousness about, how design thinking can bring value to his business domain. 2) Understand The Seeker’s needs and expectations to figure out how his problem should be approached. 3) Facilitate and mentor The Seeker and his team during project workshops. 4) Take measures to spread consciousness about design thinking within Thales. Taking the structured problem as base, we will describe what the scheme offers for tackling each part of the problem. For ‘Addressing The Visitor’, the scheme offers a game meant to sensitize potential client about how Design Center can help him discover new business opportunities. For ‘Addressing The Seeker’, the scheme offers Scoping Exercise and On-boarding. By performing the Scoping Exercise with a client, the Design Center executive will be able to gauge the capabilities, needs and expectations of the client. Using that information, the executive can make a suitable selection of methods and techniques for the workshops. Further, it is proposed that Design Center use the narrative of embarking on a mission or an epic journey while executing the project, in order to keep the participating team excited throughout the project. The On-boarding step is meant to strengthen the aforementioned narrative, and is a designerly way of sealing the deal for a project. The ‘Project Execution Support’ part of the scheme provides a selection of methods and techniques, a scheme for developing the design thinking skills of workshop participants, and a scheme for sowing the seeds for design thinking mind-set. Finally, in the ‘Gaining Visibility’ part of The Scheme, three proposals are made – Communication Support, Knowledge Relay and The Big Game. Communication Support is about providing artefacts and communication materials to enable communication about project outcome to stakeholders who were not part of the project. Knowledge Relay is about showcasing Design Center’s capability to bring knowledge from transverse domains and from the market. The Big Game is an organizational level system to gauge different business units’ commitment towards doing design thinking projects. A prudent combination of intrinsic motivators (competence, autonomy, relatedness) and extrinsic motivators (status, rewards) have been applied to build various parts of the scheme. The scheme approaches the implementation of design thinking within Thales from several levels. For example, there is provision to motivate an individual to develop his design thinking skills, there is an underlying narrative to keep a project team excited about their project, and there is organizational level Design Quotient Leader-board/web to facilitate adoption of design thinking. In short, it is hoped that by putting the scheme into practice, Thales will be gamed into embracing design thinking!","design thinking; innovation; engineering context; expertise; tool-kit","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2013","Wind sensors are widely used in many critical applications, such as navigation, weather forecast, aerospace and wind energy assessment. The thermal wind sensor can measure wind speed and direction at the same time, by measuring the temperature gradient on the sensor’s surface which is induced by the wind flow. Compared to traditional mechanical wind sensors, there are two main advantages for thermal wind sensors: Firstly, thermal sensors can measure the wind flow without any moving parts, thus no maintenance is required. Secondly, the sensing elements of the thermal wind sensor (such as heaters, thermopiles, etc) as well as its interface circuitry can be realized in a single CMOS chip. Therefore, the robustness of the sensor system can be enhanced. Despite these advantages, the existing CMOS thermal wind sensor’s relatively high power consumption strictly limits its applications. The scope of this thesis is the design and realization of a low-power CMOS thermal wind sensor with the competitive sensing accuracy as its mechanical counterparts. In order to achieve this, the constant power mode instead of traditional constant temperature difference mode is applied to the thermal wind sensor to reduce the power consumption. The advantage of the constant power mode is that the power consumption of the sensor can be controlled by an external digital signal, instead of being limited by the sensing inaccuracy of the temperature sensors. Based on the existing sensing elements, only by adding an extra comparator, the air-flow induced temperature gradient ?T can then be directly converted into digital bit-stream by a thermal ?? modulator. Because the noise-shaping provided by the thermal loop filter of the first-order thermal ?? modulator is not sufficient, for given sensing resolution, the heater’s power consumption of the thermal wind sensor is limited by the quantization noise. By cascading the thermal filter with an electrical integrator, the resulting second-order thermal ?? loop can provide more noise-shaping than the first-order system, to further reduce the quantization noise, thus required heating power consumption. To achieve reduced error due to the self-heating of the circuit, the chopping amplifier instead of traditional auto-zeroing amplifier, is used to interface the thermopile output signal. Two prototypes of the thermal wind sensor have been realized in standard CMOS process. The feasibility of the second-order thermal ?? modulator has been verified by the first proof-of-concept prototype. Measurements in wind tunnel show that the wind speed and direction accuracy are ±4% and ±2? respectively. Among the existing CMOS thermal wind sensors, the first-prototype achieves the lowest power consumption, which is 50mW in total. In the second prototype, system-level chopping is applied to reduce the offset of the interface circuit, to further reduce the power consumption to 25mW. Since the phase delay of the thermal filter is a monotonic function of the temperature, by measuring the peak frequency of the second-order thermal ?? modulator’s output square wave, temperature sensing can be achieved with the same thermal wind sensor chip. Measurements in the oven show that the resolution of the temperature sensing is about ±1?C with the range of [-40?C 50?C].","thermal wind sensor; thermal sigma-delta modulator; temperature sensor; analog to digital conversion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-10-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electronic Instrumentation Laboratory","","Microelectronics","",""

(mentor); Jonkman, S.N. (mentor); Bakker, K.J. (mentor); Braam, C.R. (mentor); Broos, E.J. (mentor)","2013","This MSc thesis focuses on two types of quay walls, namely the anchored quay wall without relieving structure and the quay wall with relieving structure. In the case of high retaining heights the anchored quay wall mostly consists of a combined sheet pile wall, which means that the wall is composed by tubular steel members that are connected by means of sheet piles. In some cases quay walls are provided with a relieving structure. A relieving structure consists of a concrete structure founded on the combined sheet pile wall and bearing piles. The function of the relieving structure is to reduce the pressure on the retaining wall caused by the surface load and soil on the relieving structure. In this thesis the engineering aspects (moments and displacements of the wall and anchor forces) and the economic aspects (costs) of quay wall designs with and without relieving structure are analysed. Also two calculation methods are compared, the beam on elastic foundation and the finite element method. The results of the calculation showed that from an engineering point of view, the relieving structure is more favourable. The displacements, moments and anchor forces when a relieving structure is present are smaller than the ones calculated when the relieving structure is absent. Also in the case of the failure of one anchor a relieving structure gives a better redistribution of forces due to the high stiffness of the slab of the relieving structure. The cost estimation performed in this thesis lead to the conclusion that a quay wall with relieving structure is more expensive that a quay wall without it. The main contribution to the costs of the analysed quay walls come from the steel combined wall. The price of the steel primary members (steel tubes) depends on the way they are fabricated. When the tubes exceed certain limit in dimensions the fabrication costs increase with a factor 1.5 to 2. In this thesis, the calculated elements of all variants exceed this limit, which lead to high costs of the fabrication of steel tubes for both, the quay wall with and without relieving structure. During decision making the parties involved would have to consider whether the reduction of the costs by using a quay wall without relieving structure overrun the aforementioned engineering aspects. An important aspect is that when the relieving structure is absent the dimensions of the primary elements of the combined wall increase and are considered extraordinary in onshore projects. The companies that can install such elements are limited and even offshore equipment would be necessary, which could increase the total costs of the project. Regarding the calculation methods some remarkable differences where found, specially in the calculation of the anchor forces. The moments in the retaining structure for both cases with and without relieving structure calculated with D-sheet vary sligtly from the ones calculated with PLAXIS, a maximum difference of 20% is found. When the relieving structure is absent the anchor forces calculated with both methods differ in a range of 20%. When a relieving structure is present D-sheet estimates forces that are 30% to 35% lower than PLAXIS when the relieving structure has a length of 10 meters. When the relieving structure length increases to 20 meters, D-sheet calculates anchor forces that are 20% to 60% lower than PLAXIS. Literature review showed that the method to estimate horizontal pressures due to strip loads used by D-sheet underestimates the resultant force acting on the wall, which leads to an under estimation of anchor forces.","Quay walls; PLAXIS; D-sheet; Moments; Boussinesq","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Blom, C.B.M. (mentor); Hoogenboom, P.C.J. (mentor); Houben, L.J.M. (mentor)","2013","The excavated building pit is a frequently used building technique during the construction of structures below ground level. A temporary structure of sheet piles and underwater concrete is designed to retain soil and water. Ribbed tension piles are driven to compensate the hydrostatic pressure after de-watering of the construction pit. Generally, the top of the foundation piles are crushed before concreting the structural. The uncovered pile reinforcement is combined with the slab reinforcement which results in a monolithic floor with an optimal connection between slab and pile. During some construction projects it is desirable to avoid pile head crushing for economic reasons or to prevent the stray current phenomena. The question that arises is to what extend does the partly penetrated ribbed foundation pile influence the punching shear behaviour of the structural slab when the pile is loaded in compression during the exploitation phase. At the heart of this debate lies the problem of the effectiveness of the present ribs and the associated punching cone perimeter. In order to investigate the punching shear behaviour, simulations by nonlinear finite element analyses have been performed using the software ATENA developed by Cervenka Consulting. Initially, conducted experiments were simulated in order to validate the modelling technique. The contact area is modelled with interface material, based on the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion for shear planes. The FEM analyses showed good agreement with the conducted experiments regarding to crack propagation which induces punching shear. The case study is made up of a number of subsequent modelling steps to investigate each influence separately. The case study starts with a parameter study to investigate the influence of the shear transfer capacity from slab to pile on the punching behaviour. The maximum allowable shear stress depends of a cohesion parameter and a coefficient of friction parameter. Various combinations of both parameters are investigated with respect to the punching shear behaviour. A clear distinction in failure behaviour is observed between a friction coefficient of 1.0 and 1.4. Up to a friction coefficient of 1.0, the critical shear crack propagates from pile head towards the slab surface which indicates that only the top part of the slab is responsible for punching shear resistance. From a friction coefficient of 1.4 the critical shear crack propagates from slab bottom towards slab surface, which indicates that the full slab height is active in punching resistance. This change in punching cone size results in a failure load which is more than twice as high. No significant increase of failure load is observed during analyses with different cohesion values. The second step consists of adding reinforcement to the initial model. The influence of bending reinforcement was neglectable due to the limited slab deflections. However, the influence of shear reinforcement was significant. For friction coefficients from 0.0 to 1.0, the failure load increased with a magnitude of roughly four compared to the failure load without shear reinforcement. An increase of roughly two is observed for friction coefficients of 1.4 or greater. Also a change in failure behaviour is observed. For friction coefficients of 1.0 or greater, the brittle punching behaviour changes into ductile flexural behaviour. This is highly desirable because large structural deflections insinuates an upcoming failure. Although full scale laboratory tests are needed to verify the numerical results, the recommendation for practical use is that for structural slabs provided with shear reinforcement and a foundation pile with at least two ribbed sides, a fully punching cone develops.","Punching Shear; FEM; ATENA Concrete; Ribbed piles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Concrete Structures","",""

(mentor); Dobbelsteen, J.J. (mentor); van de Berg, N.J. (mentor)","2013","Abstract—Percutaneous needle insertion is a minimally invasive technique, in which intervention effectiveness depends on needle placement accuracy. Targeting specific areas is difficult as needle trajectory is influenced by the highly variable and unpredictable nature of soft tissue. Furthermore the physician receives very limited information, as force feedback is low and often masked by other disturbances. During insertion, the needle traverses several tissue layers of varying stiffness. In addition it is known that target regions of interest, as for instance fibrosis or carcinomas, differ in stiffness compared to healthy tissue. Therefore, it is suggested that by measuring tissue compliance percutaneously, information about needle placement can be acquired. Monitoring the puncture of tissue layers by tip force measurements, has already been investigated by others. However, it was found that measurements from puncture events are not always reliable due to the large variance in peak forces. The novelty presented here is expanding the possibilities of tissue characterization by applying dynamic indentations whilst inserting the needle. By measuring resulting amplitude and average force responses, it is hypothesized that differences in tissue compliance can be discriminated percutaneously at the needle tip. Experiments were performed by inserting a blunt modified 18 gauge trocar needle with constant velocity and a small oscillation into stacked gelatin assemblies of varying stiffness. By measuring amplitude responses, significant correspondence was found in discriminating test samples of varying concentration gelatin. Besides merely discriminating, results were so consistent that even classification schemes could be acquired. Materials can therefore be characterized by comparing force responses to data from classification schemes. It was also found that average force responses gave better discriminatory results than peak to bottom amplitudes. However, it is expected that in clinical settings where needle preloading and patient movement are inevitable, force responses may drift. In these cases measuring merely relative differences from amplitude responses provide an advantage, as systematic errors can be excluded from measurement.","percutaneous needle insertions; viscoelasticity; soft tissue; liver biospy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-10-11","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

(mentor)","2013","NedTrain, a subsidiary of the Dutch Railways (NS), is responsible for maintenance of rolling stock of NS. Maintenance is performed at maintenance depots and involves wheel sets that are located under trains. Wheels are subject to wear due to usage and need to be exchanged at maintenance when they have worn below a certain limit. Therefore, it is key to have a certain set (types and amount) of wheel sets available for upcoming maintenance to prevent non-availability of trains. At this moment wheel sets are stocked at different locations. However, NedTrain intents to concentrate wheel set stock at a central depot, and to supply wheel sets Just-In-Time to local maintenance depots. It is believed that in this way the turnaround stock of overhauled wheel sets can be reduced. Insight in the interaction between departments is provided with an overview of the wheel set chain. At this moment two forecasting methods for wheel set demand are used. Maintenance depots plan demand one week ahead by using information from NS Reizigers on planned train arrivals. The overhaul depot forecasts supply four weeks ahead, based on former overhaul levels. It is observed that little information on future demand is exchanged and demand beyond four weeks is unknown. Wheel wear has shown a more deterministic behavior since a use-based maintenance policy for wheel sets has been introduced for intercity rolling stock of NS as of 2007. Since demand patterns have not been changed and current forecasts based on former overhaul/demand levels shows varying results an alternative forecasting approach has been developed. This forecast approach is based on actual wheel set conditions and wheel wear. Wheel wear at wheel lathes is 2 - 6 times as high than wear during operation. A selection of wheel wear causes is made, based on short-term influences, which are used as variables in the forecast method. An overview of causes is included in Appendix I. In this report six different methods of forecasting wheel set demand are studied and validated with 2012 demand. Wheel set demand is forecasted based on wheel set exchanges due to passing a wear limit, which covered 86% of wheel set exchanges in 2012. The best performing method is selected on the lowest error between forecasted versus real demand in the first three months. Validation shows that wheel set demand can be forecasted with a Mean Absolute Deviation of 26 - 27 days, which exceeds the current planning horizon of maintenance depots. The best performing method includes fuzzy logic to account for temporary increased wear rates due to maintenance, stage of wear and seasonality. Forecasted failure dates of wheel sets are rounded down to future maintenance periods. The current accuracy on short-term is considered as too low to serve as reliable basis for determining a required level of wheel sets to supply maintenance depots with an interval of one month and wheel set availability of 90%. The application of fuzzy logic and tuning has improved accuracy on monthly levels, but still demand for wheel sets is frequently overestimated. For this reason Just-In-Time delivery of wheel sets, based on current demand patterns and forecast accuracy, is currently not the designated solution to supply maintenance depots at NedTrain. In this report is shown that diameters within a population of wheel sets are not always equally distributed, which results in troughs and peaks in demand. The forecast accuracy on mid-term is accurate enough to provide insight for NedTrain in these future demand patterns for at least 2 years ahead. This information might be used as guideline for mid or long-term decisions on future overhaul and stock levels of wheel sets. Improvements are proposed for the forecast model and with regard to NedTrain practices to help increase predictability of future wheel set demand.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-09-26","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

Unfortunately the real world is far from ideal and over 20,000 people get injured in a crash in the Netherlands each year. Around 46,7% of these registered crashes, take place at intersections. To decrease the chance and number of conflicts, and therefore the chance of crashes, many intersections are controlled by traffic signal control, but these will only have effect when the signals are obeyed. In almost all traffic signal control systems the motorised streams are prioritised, because of the space and time needed for cars to cross the intersection. Therefore cyclists, who can cross in high numbers in a short time, have longer waiting times compared to motorized streams. As a result cyclists are possibly more likely to ignore the traffic lights and cross when seems safe to them. When they cross during the phase where the light is turned red, this is called red light running. The purpose of the report is to give insight in the percentage of the red light running by cyclists in the Netherlands, the influence factors and the consequences for traffic safety. Through literature review an inventory of the different factors that influence red light running is made. The characteristics found that increased the percentage of red light running were: Male cyclists, young adults, experienced cyclists, bad weather, long waiting times, reduced credibility/low conflicting traffic flow, short crossing distance, herding (when there are other people violating the red light they are more likely to also violate the red light) and a low percentage of trucks and busses. Though most literature was over 25 years old and thus was not recent enough to form hypotheses. Thus the study got a descriptive and explanatory nature. With the help of video observations on 5 different intersections, factors found in literature were analysed. The overall red light running was 27.4%. Factors that were found influencing red light running are: - Gender: Men violated the red light 1.32 times more than women. - Age: Young cyclist have a higher percentage of red light running, 1.63 times higher than adults and 1.78 time higher than elderly cyclists. - Crossing distance: A longer crossing distance decreases the red light running - Flow of the motorized streams: more traffic on the conflicting motorized streams lead to less red light running. The vehicle composition of the conflicting stream seems to have an effect on the red light running. However, the number of observations for these factors was too low to statistically test them. Therefore further research, with observation of more intersections, is necessary. The other factors did not have an effect or the effect seen was not statistically significant. It is recommended to do further research on the factors that have an influence on the red light running. The number of the observations, number of intersections or number of cyclists crossing in this descriptive research are too low to conclude without a doubt the effect of these factors.","red light running; cyclist; traffic safety","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

(mentor); Thielemann, T. (mentor)","2013","Mining is different from most businesses because knowledge of the product is essentially based on estimates, which by their very nature include a degree of uncertainty (Dominy, Noppé, & Annels, 2004). The risks associated with mining are varied and complex, where the dominant source of risk is the orebody itself (Snowden, Glacken, & Noppé, 2002). The modeling of orebody geology is the basis for all prediction of in-situ grades, mineral resources and recoverable ore reserves, as well as mine design and long term production forecasting. The Lower Rhine Basin is a rift basin located in northwest Germany which hosts several large lignite seams of considerable economical importance. One of these massive lignite deposits - the Garzweiler open cast mine - is containing marine and fluvial sand intrusions which are significantly affecting the reserve estimation and the operational processes. The current model based on a deterministic ""best guess"" approach fails to properly predict these sand partings within the lignite seams. Probabilistic or stochastic models can provide an alternative. The aim of this thesis is to elaborate a first appraisal of the possibilities for RWE Power AG to apply geostatistical modeling at its Garzweiler lignite operation. An analysis is made of the available datasets and of the applicable geostatistical methods, including their strengths and shortcomings. This exercise of applying the relevant geostatistical methods to the different datasets provides new insights for predictive modeling. On this basis, recommendations are formulated for geostatistical modeling methods applicable to the unmined area of the Garzweiler mine. Data collection is not an aim in itself. Purposeful data collection presupposes a theory or a model which gives meaning and significance to raw data by processing them as information that is useful and needed for a specified goal. In the context of this project, this goal is the accurate prediction of the composition of a lignite seam. The different data types are thoroughly described and their strengths and limitations are clearly indicated. From the point of view of geostatistical modeling, the current practice of collecting and processing surveying data has potential for improvement, because of the limited applicability of the existing data. While collecting surveying data demands great effort, production data - digitally stored and therefore easily automated - are readily available at no cost. A continuous, automated input of available production data creates a model with permanently updated geostatistical predictions and therefore a reduction of the empirical error. In addition, drill data provide information for a wider area about not only the coal / sand ratio, but also on the ash content of the lignite. Ideally, this geostatistical model should be complemented with the KOLA data - online analytics of coal composition. The KOLA data themselves can be used for predictive purposes, but above all they possess the unique advantage of being able to validate the predicted ash content. However, practical obstacles prevent an effective use of these data. The ordinary kriging method is widely in use and in general gives good predictions. These predictions are accompanied by an estimated error. In the context of the stationarity assumption - one of the fundaments of kriging - a significant limitation arises: ordinary kriging is poorly able to cope with sudden “structural” changes. Introducing an automation step will generate a model where continuous input and usage of the available data will result in permanently updated geostatistical predictions and a reduction of the empirical error, particularly in changing environments. The indicator approach, though not providing accurate predictions, does have the virtue of signaling areas with specific features. As opposed to kriging, simulation does not require a normally distributed dataset. The creation of multiple realizations gives a better feeling for possible scenarios of future mining. Simulation applied to ash content data presents promising results.","lignite mining; geostatistics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-09-25","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Resource Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2013","Currently the Doherty Power Amplifier (DPA) is replacing the traditional Class B amplifier in base-station and broadcast applications, as such becoming the preferred choice of industry due to its simplicity and high efficiency performance. In spite of its success, so far practical DPA implementations can provide only a very limited RF bandwidth, which tends to narrow down even more at higher power levels. This narrowband behavior of the DPA is mostly caused by the use of traditional operating classes for the active devices and bandwidth restrictions related to use of a conventional impedance inverter. In this work, the bandwidth of different DPA topologies has been analyzed, followed by a discussion of recent techniques that can help to improve the DPA bandwidth. To overcome the remaining bandwidth limitations in a DPA design, a novel differential configuration was proposed. In this approach, transmission line based baluns are used to implement the desired wideband 2nd harmonic terminations of the active devices. By combining this technique with a novel wideband impedance inverter, excellent DPA wideband performance can be achieved. Unfortunately, when going to practical balun implementations, various imperfections come to light, which trouble the achievable DPA bandwidth performance. For this reason, three practical balun structures are investigated in detail, namely, the coaxial cable based balun, the vertically installed planar balun and suspended planar stripline balun. To explore the proposed DPA concept when using practical baluns, two DPAs featuring mixed-signal driven inputs are presented. A dedicated design procedure for these DPAs is also given. The first prototype is implemented using NXP GaN devices and coaxial cable based baluns. Simulation results show a maximum output power of 52dBm, but in 6dB power back-off we only reach 40% efficiency from 530MHz to 700MHz, which is significantly less than the intend bandwidth (450MHz-810MHz). Using the lessons learned of this first amplifier, a second design with NXP LDMOS devices and suspended planar stripline balun has been developed. According to simulation this later design provides a maximum output power of 59dBm with the efficiency above 55% at both full power and 6dB power back-off. According the simulations this second design can even achieve 50% efficiency at 8dB back-off. The related center frequency is 650MHz with a high-efficiency bandwidth at 6dB power back-off (efficiency within 10% of its maximum) from 460MHz to 790MHz.","Doherty power amplifier; Balun; Wideband","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-09-30","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Microwave group","",""

(mentor); Sadowska, A.D. (mentor)","2013","Recent years have shown an increased interest in the use of autonomous vehicles. These vehicles must find a path towards a desired location while avoiding obstacles. Since finding the optimal solution is computationally expensive, approximation techniques are often used. In the last decades several path planning techniques have been proposed. One novel technique considers mobile robots and uses the limit cycle strategy to avoid static obstacles (D. Kim and J. Kim, 2003). The main advantage of this method is the low computational cost, which makes this method especially useful for small robots with limited computational power. In short, the method relies on creating a circular limit cycle that a robot should follow in the proximity of an obstacle to avoid collision. In this thesis a new algorithm incorporating ellipsoidal limit cycles is presented for avoiding static 3D obstacles by using 3D limit cycles. The ellipsoidal limit cycles represent a safety zone around an obstacle. By using ellipsoidal limit cycles, the shape of the obstacles can be better represented. Ellipsoidal limit cycles are also useful when there is a preferred direction in which the obstacle should be avoided, e.g., to prevent passing in front of the obstacle. Further, the limit cycle method is combined with the velocity obstacle approach in order to avoid moving obstacles in 2D and 3D. To ensure that the robot chooses the optimal rotation direction with multiple and/or moving obstacles, a tree search is performed yielding the globally optimal rotation direction around each obstacle.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

(mentor); Ferreira, J.A. (mentor); Rodrigo Mor, A. (mentor)","2013","The increasing global energy needs and the high integration of renewable energy generation have changed the requirements for the electricity grid. Countries are becoming unable to cover their energy demands with their own means and the need for power exchange between neighboring countries has increased. Consequently, power needs to be transmitted over longer distances and multi-terminal complex grids need to be created to facilitate the energy evolution. Contrary to the existing AC grids, HVDC is an appealing alternative for future grids. VSC technology has been the focus of recent HVDC research due to its inherent advantages. However, the use of fully-controllable switches becomes a disadvantage in case of DC contingencies. Thus far, opening the AC breakers has been the only way to clear DC faults, by completely de-energising the system and interrupting the power transfer with significant economic and societal consequences. Other protection concepts include multi-level converters with full-bridge submodules, which are able to limit the fault current; and control methods which identify the faulty lines. However, DC switch breakers are necessary to isolate the faulty line from the network, allowing normal operation to be resumed. The main contributions of this thesis are the comparison of different grid operating topologies under fault cases; and the impact analysis of different current limiting measures and control strategies on the developing DC fault currents. A four terminal grid in radial configuration was simulated using Matlab/Simulink®, and the natural fault response of the stations in most common HVDC grid topologies was studied. Additionally, two selective fault detection methods are proposed, which take into account the current direction on DC lines and the rate of rise of the fault currents. Four DC breaker technologies were simulated for all analysed grid topologies, and compared on the basis of the total DC fault interruption time and their influence on the system post-fault coordination and operation restoration. With the concepts analysed in this thesis, MTDC network system designers will be able to understand and tackle DC contingencies to facilitate an uninterruptible power flow between the different interconnected AC grids.","VSC-HVDC; DC grid control; DC breakers; HVDC protection; DC limiting reactors","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-01-19","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","Electrical Power Processing","",""

(mentor)","2013","During the discharge of a firearm gunshot residues (GSRs) escape from the barrel and other openings and may deposit on surfaces in the vicinity of the discharging firearm. The detection and identification of these GSR particles may provide valuable information in forensic investigations. A comparison, based on the elemental composition, between GSR particles found on various exhibits can be made to link suspects and victims. The ultimate question of interest in GSR comparisons is whether or not the compared GSRs originate from the same shot. In this thesis we looked at three different approaches to model GSR evidence in the form of profiles that quantitatively describe the elemental composition over several categories. The score-based model transforms the data into one single measure and does not have much potential to serve as a basis for verbal likelihood ratios (LRs) in real life casework. The multinomial model uses the whole multivariate structure of the profiles, but does not provide reasonable LR values. The Pólya model seems a good fit for modeling GSR profiles and can be used with an overall parameter or with several parameters, each characteristic for a specific encountered ammunition type. Iterative methods were explored to obtain estimates of the parameters, for which we also constructed 95% confidence regions. Such a region can be used to calculate a range of possible values for the LR and serve as a basis for the verbal scale. Only with the use of a representative GSR database the LR can provide meaningful estimates. Since such a database was not yet available at the NFI we developed populating procedures and started conducting test firings to obtain a first set of database entries.","forensic statistics; gunshot residue evidence; Polya distribution; likelihood ratio models; parameter estimation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-09-13","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied Mathematics","","Statistics","",""

Flume experiments were performed on a scaled fringing reef in the laboratory facilities of Deltares in Delft. The objective of this thesis was to analyse the measurements and to model the experiments using the numerical model XBeach. The water depth and bed roughness were shown to have influence on many processes such as short wave breaking, infragravity (IG) wave generation, IG wave transformation, reef flat seiching, wave-induced setup and wave reflection. The measurements showed that long waves dominate the short waves in the lagoon. The flow velocities in the rough cases were lower than that in the smooth cases as a result of the bed friction. The result of the sediment data analysis paints a very consistent picture in which both the short and the long waves play a role, but the long waves appear to be the dominant factor in sediment transport and bed profile development especially close to the beach. Also the effect of the bed roughness becomes visible, mainly in the shape of a swash bar, which is more pronounced for the smooth than for the rough cases. This shows that the dominance of long waves in a fringing reef lagoon results in different sediment dynamics than for example on a regular sandy beach. The XBeach modelling reproduced the short wave height, long wave height, flow velocity and reef flat seiching rather well. The effect of bed roughness on wave-induced set-up was found to be complex. In the experiments the roughness had no influence on the set-up while in XBeach the set-up increased significantly when using a high bed roughness value. This can possibly be solved by adding an extra force according to Dean and Bender (2006) to account for a shear stress exerted by the roughness elements on the water column counter to the direction of wave propagation. This could increase the application range of XBeach. The use of XBeach and its default sediment transport formulation resulted in very little sediment suspension in the sandy lagoon, which was in disagreement with the data. Also the development of the beach profile was not correctly predicted by XBeach. Further research is recommended to increase the ability of XBeach to model these processes.","fringing reef; XBeach; sediment transport; infragravity wave; flume experiment; hydrodynamics; morphodynamics; seiching; bed friction; wave-induced set-up; FOSLIM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-10-01","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

Methodology The research approach used is based on a design science approach. Therefore first a first hunch was developed followed by requirements generation for the framework through interviews with IT managers from SMEs and mid-corporates. Then structural specifications were created and finally a prototype framework was designed. Findings The research shows the requirements from SMEs for an integral IT management framework. The research also shows the IT management domains and disciplines that are required for the framework to be considered complete. Finally the research covers the best practices and theories available for each of the identified disciplines of IT management.

(mentor); Bouwman, H. (mentor); Scholten, V. (mentor); Schonewille, J.P. (mentor)","2013","Purpose - Mergers & acquisitions (M&As) have become a common way to rapidly acquire skills, assets and/or market share in today’s business environment. After a deal is signed, integration processes in the post-merger phase often serve to realize the expected benefits from the M&A. Since IT is increasingly intertwined with the way that firms conduct their business, it is observed that more and more synergies depend on the successful integration of enterprise-wide information systems. The objective of this research is to increase our understanding of how business and IT reciprocate during post-merger integration (PMI) processes. Design/methodology/approach - Findings are based on an exploratory case study of two horizontal mergers in the transport sector. An adapted qualitative research approach from Miles and Huberman (1994) has been used for data analysis and drawing conclusions. A conceptual model based on scientific literature was constructed in order to assess 29 readily transcribed interviews with managers who have been involved in post-merger integration. The post-merger phase was modeled as a business integration and an IT integration that run in parallel, and both include manageble PMI factors and observable PMI effects. In two consecutive rounds of data coding the model has been adapted in order to draw relevant conclusions. Findings - The research has revealed a number of complex interaction effects through which business and IT influence each other during post-merger integration. Business and IT are so strongly interlinked in PMI that it does not make sense to consider them in isolation. Business processes have been identified as an area through which the business integration and IT integration are interlinked. The concept of process integration level has been introduced to explain tenacious implementation issues that have occurred in both the case studies. The process integration level proposes an approach to post-merger integration from a process perspective in considering the desired level to which processes in the new organization should amalgamate, which subsequently have implications on the business and IT integration levels. Limitations/implications - This research explains the reciprocation between business and IT in post-merger integration for the two cases that have been considered. A number of limitations are inherent to the limited number of cases studied. Although findings have been validated by literature review, they have only been applied to M&A cases of horizontal, similar-sized firms in the transport sector. Future research should aim to extent this reach and increase the external validity of the proposed concepts. Originality - This research has highlighted a number of complex interactions between business and IT in a post-merger situation. It is pointed out how IT is used as an instrument for change in arriving at a desired business integration level, and an perspective is provided on how to avoid the undesired issues that can arise. This research is unique in the way how it proposes to consider the business processes of the new organization to explain the role of IT in post-merger integration. Findings are relevant to both scholars in the field of information systems integration in M&A, as well as practitioners who are facing a post-merger integration.","mergers & acquisitions; M&A; IT integration; information systems; business processes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-09-23","Technology, Policy and Management","Information - and Communication Technology","","Management of Technology","",""

Using the modeling techniques of network calculus, network elements are represented by discrete-time systems whose dynamics are linear in min-plus algebra. From the state-space representation of a min-plus linear (MiPL) system, a finite-state symbolic model or quotient system can be constructed. The construction of such quotient systems is done by first partitioning the state-space according to the MiPL dynamics and certain atomic propositions defined over the states. The transitions between the quotient states are then computed based on the dynamical system. The resulting finite abstraction simulates the infinite-state discrete-time model, which permits applying formal verification to reason about the properties of the discrete-time system. The work is finalized by transforming the backlog and virtual delay properties of the original model to equivalent specifications, given by Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas, on the finite abstraction.","Networked Control Systems; Network Calculus; Leaky Buckets; Latency-Rate Servers; Virtual Delay; Backlog; Min-Plus Systems; Piecewise-Affine Systems; Symbolic Models; Finite Abstractions; Formal Methods; Verification; Model Checking; Linear Temporal Logic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-10-07","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","Embedded Systems","",""

(mentor); Cuppen, E. (mentor); Dijkema, G. (mentor)","2013","With 20.000 signatures on the petition against shale gas, it can be stated that there are resistances towards the development of shale gas in the Netherlands (Schaliegasvrij Nederland, n.d.) Many people fear that in the Netherlands the same negative effects concerning the exploration of shale gas can occur as in the U.S. Though, it may be questioned if this indeed is possible. The insights which can help to answer this question can be achieved with the ‘Modernized Zimmerman framework’, which is developed and tested during this research. This framework is based on the theory of E.W. Zimmerman and theories on modern institutions and is developed to increase the understanding on the development and functionality of resources. The main question which is answered during this research is: To what extent is it possible to develop an institutional framework based on the theory of E.W. Zimmerman and new institutional economists that is constructive to generate insights on the development and functionality of a resource? The theory of E.W. Zimmerman (1888-1961) is chosen as the basis from which the framework is developed, as it explains which factors determine why and how a substance can be developed and function as a resource. According to Zimmerman, a substance can function as a resource if it least satisfies one objective, referred to by Zimmerman as a Want. Zimmerman explains that the development and functionality of resources is a dynamic process and explains what the relations between the factors, which are of influence on the development and functionality of resources, are. In addition, his approach is selected, because it provides an uneconomic approach on why resources are developed. This can provide different and original insights, than economic approaches, which often take the profitability and the demand of a resource as the main causes why resources are developed and function as they do. Zimmerman’s theory originates from 1951 and therefore it is somewhat outdated, especially in the field of institutions. Zimmerman is not very specific on the type of institutions present, the content of these institutions and how these are related, compared to the Modern institutional theories. In addition, the terms he uses in his theory are rather complex and he uses multiple terms for the same aspects. For this reason, his theory is improved by means of Modern institutional theories. The four layered model of Williamson and the adjusted version of this model, developed by Groenewegen and Koppenjan are used to increase the insights on the different types of institutions and their interrelations. These insights are also integrated in the framework. In addition, some of the vague terms of Zimmerman are replaced by the more modern, abstract and comprehensive terms of Groenewegen and Koppenjan. The result of the combination of the theory of Zimmerman and the Modern institutional theories, lead to the ‘Modernized Zimmerman framework’ provided in figure 1, which is tested with a case-study on shale gas in the U.S. Figure 1 Modernized Zimmerman framework The ‘Modernized Zimmerman framework’ provides a structured and scientific approach to analyze the development and functionality of resources and provides valuable tool to obtain important insights on the development and functionality of resources. Amongst others, it increases the understanding that it is unlikely that exactly the same effects are posed by the exploration of shale gas in the Netherlands as in the U.S. For this reason the resistances which can be expected in these countries will also be different. The reason for this difference can be found in the difference in institutions. These institutions are of strong influence on the development of the Technical system and therewith on the effect the resource will have on society. Also, the framework increases the understanding why the Technical system could evolve as it did and why there were no resistances towards shale gas in the U.S. until 2010. The case study on the shale gas development in the U.S. has also provided important insights on the development and functionality of shale gas in the U.S. These and the general insights which can be attained with the framework could be used by governments to develop an informed decision on if they want to exploit a resource, such as shale gas. By using the framework an increased understanding can be obtained on which resistances will be associated with the development of a resource and how these resistances evolve. Also, the framework can increase the understanding if, and how resistances could be overcome. Also, the framework is able to increase the understanding why a resource is developed and if it is able to meet these demands. Last, the framework provides an indication on the level of public acceptance which can be expected. When there are many resistances present, which cannot be overcome or will not be overcome for other reasons, the level of public acceptance is expected to be low. In addition, the factor Societal appraisal, the outcome of the model, also provides an indication of this public acceptance and provides guidance on which fields the resource should be improved to increase this acceptance. Thus it was possible to develop a framework, based on the theory of E.W. Zimmerman and modern institutional economist which is constructive in generating valuable insights on the development and functionality of resources. This framework is the ‘Modernized Zimmerman framework’. The framework can be used for further research towards the development and functionality of resources and the public acceptance. In addition the framework could be used to structure discussions with stakeholders. Finally, the framework could be used by governments to create more informed decision making processes on resources.","framework; resources; functionality; shale gas; institutions; Zimmerman","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy and Industry","","Systems Engineering Policy Analysis and Management","",""

(mentor); Van der Helm, R.M. (mentor); Van de Langkruis, A. (mentor)","2013","The purpose of the project was to explore the possibilities of communicating the process of operating the humidity, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) hardware of a multi-levelled building through a software tool to facility managers, including those possessing domain technical knowledge and those who do not. The challenge was to find out the differences between their perceptions of the HVAC system and implement them in the design that satisfies both groups. One of the problems to be solved within this challenge was to create a consistent and clear way to communicate the effects of applying settings, in particular when they affect other areas in the building, above/below or within the same level. The project was proposed and conceived as visionary, exploring the possibilities and development direction in the future. The methods for research and design included card-sorting with open discussion of HVAC system functional connections, tests to discover the usability and preferences towards various spatial representations of the building and iterative design of the interface. It started from discussions and feedback on rough paper sketches, and the fidelity of the following prototypes was gradually increasing and including more and more specific solutions. The findings have shown that people without technical background perceive the HVAC system in terms of spaces, rather than hardware (they want to make the room colder, rather than change the air conditioning settings). This means that they think of applying a climate condition change to a room, rather than to an HVAC unit. The easiest way to orient in space was the top-view map, followed by floor plans in perspective. Several elements contributing to recognition of familiar spaces, such as colour coding of areas, name tags and wall rises were important for test subjects to orient well on the floor plans. Throughout the flow of the design process, various building representation concepts were tested, as well as approaches to performing settings and task flows. The findings were implemented in the design. Overall, the design was recognised as successful by final user test subjects. The system provides a framework for various task flows, which correspond the types of activities that facility managers perform during their work. The designed interface features a consistent manner of representing variously-sized buildings; a way to include a multitude of settings; possibility to extend the functionality to new types of controls; a clear overview of the current state of building settings. Final user testing brought up some specific elements of the interface which should receive more design effort, such as indications of the state of the settings on a lower level when the navigation tree is collapsed, the colour coding of the current settings in the graphical navigation area. The interface is suitable for use on a mobile tablet touchscreen device; smartphone use is not convenient and a modification of the proposed interface has to be developed in order to enable smartphone use.","HVAC; facility management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-09-20","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Integrated Product Design","",""

De oorzaak hiervan is dat door de afsluiting van het Markermeer met de Houtribdijk een ondiep meer is ontstaan met een bodem van klei waarin een dynamische sliblaag aanwezig is. Al bij lage windsnelheden ontstaan golven die erosie van deze sliblaag veroorzaken. De slibconcentratie in het water is hoog, waardoor het water troebel is en er nog maar weinig waterplanten in het Markermeer groeien. Dit heeft nadelige gevolgen voor de rest van het ecosysteem van het Markermeer. Dit afstudeeronderzoek richt zich op een luwtemaatregel in het Hoornse Hop. De lokale effecten op golven en stroming in het Hoornse Hop wordt onderzocht. De studie is gericht op een damwand als lijnvormige luwtemaatregel voor de kust van Noord-Holland. Hierbij wordt de effectiviteit van verschillende varianten onderzocht. De hoofdvraag van dit onderzoek is: “Op welke manier kunnen lijnvormige luwtestructuren langs de Noord-Hollandse kust de golven en stroming in het Hoornse Hop zodanig beïnvloeden, dat daarmee een bijdrage wordt geleverd aan het oplossen van het slibprobleem van het Markermeer?” Om de lokale effecten van de luwtemaatregel in het Hoornse Hop te onderzoeken, is een hydrodynamisch model van het Markermeer opgezet in Delft3D. Het model simuleert de golven en stroming die door de wind worden opgewekt en berekent hiermee de bodemschuifspanning die optreedt in het Hoornse Hop. Hiermee worden vervolgens gebieden bepaald waar erosie van de sliblaag door de luwtemaatregel wordt voorkomen. In dit onderzoek zijn een aantal varianten ontwikkeld met een verschillende ligging en vormgeving, waarbij de effectiviteit in het reduceren van de golfhoogte en het afbuigen van stroming is onderzocht. Als zoekgebieden voor de luwtemaatregel zijn drie gebieden langs de kust van Noord-Holland, tussen Hoorn en Edam, aangewezen. Uit dit onderzoek kan worden geconcludeerd dat lijnvormige luwtestructuren in het Hoornse Hop een bijdrage kunnen leveren aan het oplossen van het slibprobleem van het Markermeer. De aanleghoogte is hierbij een belangrijke ontwerpparameter, die groot genoeg moet worden gekozen om transmissie van golfenergie over de luwtestructuur te voorkomen. Daarnaast dient de ligging van de luwtestructuur bij te dragen aan afbuiging van stroming naar het Markermeer. Hiermee wordt instroom van slibrijk water achter de structuur naar het luwe gebied beperkt. Om dit te bereiken dient de luwtestructuur zich voldoende ver uit te strekken richting de kust van Noord-Holland. Tot slot wordt aanbevolen om in plaats van een damwand een ander type constructie als een dam of golfbreker toe te passen.","Markermeer; Hoornse Hop; bodemschuifspanning; golven; stroming; luwtemaatregel; Delft3D","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-09-20","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor); Behdani, B. (mentor); Van Duin, J.H.R. (mentor)","2013","Allseas is one of the major offshore pipeline installation and subsea construction companies in the world. The process of pipeline installation is executed by operating specialised vessels, which are designed in-house. Allseas executes the pipeline installation with the S-lay method. The pieces of pipe (the joints) are assembled to form one pipeline in a horizontal working plane, the “firing line”, on board of the vessel. First the two joints are welded together, followed by the inspection step (Non-Destructive testing) and before leaving the vessel the pipe is coated (Field Joint Coating). The system analysed in this research is the equipment-unit of Pipeline Production Department (PPD). PPD is responsible for the preparation of all offshore welding, NDT and coating services. PPD encountered problems with timely delivery of their project equipment and consumables and seeks for measures to solve this. This thesis will focus on the internal supply chain of the welding unit within PPD. The other supply chains are out of scope due to the complexity of the whole system. Problem Definition Due to strict norms and regulations in the offshore industry almost all procedures need to be qualified onshore. Only if procedures get approval from the client, the process can continue. This imposes difficulties for the internal supply chain of the welding unit. The wish of Allseas is to control and optimise the logistics of project equipment and consumables for the welding unit. This means reducing the vulnerability of the internal supply chain for a disruption. The ability of a system to withstand and accommodate a disruption is called resilience. In this thesis the following definition of resilience is used: resilience is the ability of a system to return to its original form after unforeseen changes. This ability of the system can be defined in a twofold matter, the time to recover to the original form and the impact this unforeseen change temporarily has on the system. A system can develop resilience in a threefold manner by increasing redundancy, building flexibility into the system, and the right corporate culture. The work of Sheffi will be the theoretical framework for this thesis. By improving the flexibility of a chain the time_to_respond to a disruption will become shorter. A more resilient culture and a higher level of redundancy will reduce the impact of a disruption. Research Objective Based on the problem definition the following research objective can be stated: Increase the resilience of the internal equipment and consumables supply chain of Allseas' welding department to cope with the disruptions stemming from the seasonal planning. Based on the research objective the main research question for this thesis is the following: How to increase the resilience of the internal equipment and consumables supply chain of Allseas' welding department to cope with the disruptions stemming from the seasonal planning? This research question is assessed and the results of this research are shown in three parts: part I: qualitative analysis, part II: quantitative analysis, and part III: roadmap. Part I: Qualitative Analysis The goal of part I was to determine the root cause of the problem with handling disruptions. This in order to gain insights in the system and to search for the drivers behind the problems in the chain. This qualitative analysis starts with a disruption analysis followed by the bottlenecks and finished with a search for lessons learned from other industries. The disruption analysis is conducted based on a framework of disruption assessment by Jüttner, Peck, & Christopher. This framework makes a distinction between on the one hand risk sources and on the other hand risk drivers and their mitigating strategies. This framework is applied on Allseas for example when dealing with a vessel swap. The risk sources are not the main cause of problems in the disruption handling of PPD. The reason why the previous vessel swap was executed in such a chaotic way was due to a lack in general preparation at the equipment side and not communicating in a proper way. The supply chain risk drivers were the basis of the bottleneck analysis. By assessing the drivers as the bottlenecks. Clear problems were pinpointed and the effect of these bottlenecks on resilience is shown as well.  Communication is a big problem within PPD. There is not a structured way to communicate and this influences the execution of projects. The lack of communication influences the flexibility of the chain because the current way of communicating consumes the much needed preparation time.  The innovative culture of Allseas helped them to be one of the major companies in their industry; however it is now a threat to their supply chain. Innovations cannot be planned or scheduled and this implements high uncertainty to the chain.  The current way of equipment handling does not have an explicit strategy, therefore it is not clear why some equipment is purchased and other equipment is rented (the make or buy decision). These uncertainties in the equipment pool influence the redundancy of the chain. In the chaotic ad-hoc way of working everyone choses the quick fix instead of working on a more fundamental solution. The measures that are going to be tested only have influence on the flexibility of the system and not on the redundancy or the culture of this system. This is due to the fact that improvements on redundancy cannot be tested in this system. The lack of transparency in the equipment pool makes it impossible to see whether or not improvements are made. Culture is as well not tested due to the ambiguous nature of this topic and is therefore difficult to quantify. Culture will, however, be part of the roadmap towards a resilient chain. Flexibility will be the core of the measures that will be tested in part II. Especially the time between different tasks is important. The influence of these tasks on each other and on the time to make the deadline of mobilisation of a project is important. ? Part II: Quantitative Analysis In part I the system was analysed and from the synthesis it can be concluded that the relations between different processes in a project are of major importance. The interdependencies between different projects influence the total project time. To assess the influence of the interdependencies the total project time the impact of the sequence of events is evaluated. This sequence of events is called the critical path of a project. One alternative set up will be tested in this analysis; this scenario is based on the conclusions of part I. The goal of the scenario analysis is to quantify the improvements in the internal supply chain of PPD. The changes in the process should be shown in a different critical path and a reduction in total process time. To improve the flexibility the two main lessons are taken into account in the improved schedule.  The first lesson is to have a “Kingpin”, a central point to be the controller of the whole process.  The second lesson is that preparation is key for flexibility. This is done by: a split in the information flow and the equipment flow and creating an explicit step of organising equipment. By decoupling planning of the equipment from the mobilisation process more time_to_respond is created. With these changes the chain will be more flexible in order to improve the resilience of the internal supply chain of welding equipment and consumables. From the analysis it can be concluded that the new supply chain set-up is more flexible and in the end will increase the resilience. The two disruptions did not have an effect on the internal supply chain in the new internal supply chain set-up. The effect of moving the step of planning the equipment forward in the chain created time_to_respond to a disruption. And with this creation build in the system one of the major aspects of a resilient chain is gained. Part III: Roadmap The framework of Sheffi proposed three types of solutions to increase the resilience of a supply chain. This can be done by increasing the flexibility and redundancy, and changing the culture. Per type of solution the following should be implemented to increase the resilience of the internal equipment and consumables supply chain. Flexibility; the procedures and the equipment needs to be pre-qualified onshore before going offshore. This is the reason that preparation is key. The new internal supply chain set-up splits the internal supply chain in an information and a physical flow of goods. With parallel processes the internal supply chain has time_to_respond to disruptions and contributes to a more resilient supply chain. Redundancy; the equipment database needs to be fully up to date before decisions concerning equipment can be made. When all the equipment is updated an assessment can be made on the criticalness of certain equipment. And criteria can be set up to make the make or buy decisions. Culture; the culture issue has not been a major part of this thesis. However, using the OCAI method as an initial analysis it is apparent that a culture change is a necessary. This cultural change is a precondition to implement the measures.","resilience; supply chain; disruption","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-09-19","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","MSc.

(mentor)","2013","ASML is one of the world's largest suppliers of lithography systems for the semiconductor industry. ASML designs and develops machines that are used to print circuits on silicon wafers, to produce IC chips. These circuits have to be printed with accuracy of up to 2nm. For this purpose, the machines incorporate several measurement systems. The Parallel Integrated Lens Interferometer At Scanner (PARIS) sensor is responsible for measurement of lens aberrations. The PARIS measurement has a tight timing budget. Currently, the software stack of PARIS runs on a single core PowerPC processor based board and a quadcore SUN M3000 server, which is shared with other components in the machine, making the execution time non-deterministic with a variation of up to 30%. Further, there is a risk that as further enhancements are made, the PARIS software stack will not be able to meet the worst case execution time (WCET) specification. In this thesis we propose a multicore hardware platform such that the execution time of the PARIS software stack is deterministic and is at least reduced to half of the current execution time. The results show an approximate gain of 9x for algorithms deployed on the GPU. This results in an approximate 3x performance gain for the software execution time and 2x gain in the application performance. However, a GPU based solution requires high investment of time, effort and thus has a high impact on the organization and ASML's product platform. An optimal solution proposed is a platform based on two Intel i7 processors which provides for an approximate 2.4x performance gain for the software execution time and 1.8x gain for the entire application with lower impact on the organization and ASML's product platform.","multi-core; CPU; GPU; FPGA; CUDA; ASML; optics; algorithms; PARIS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-09-23","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Embedded Systems","",""

The project involves several organizations such as TUDelft, TU/Eindhoven, Design Academy, Philips, Geestelijke Gezondheidszorg Eindhoven (GGZE), in collaboration with relaxation experts and addresses the issue of flexibility versus control in the design of product service systems aimed at work related stress. Aim of the project is to build a relaxation space to help employees tackling work related stress using a combination of Nature Inspired Design (NID) and Philips technology within an ambient experience. The way to achieve the result is to design in multiple iterations a full working prototype of the relaxation space within the office environment of Philips Design. An exploration phase was conducted at the beginning of the project to gather information on the topic through interviews with relaxation experts and Philips employees, visit at the GGZE and literature research. Designing the space, NID tools such as Biomimicry’s Life’s Principles were used; suggestions from Biophilic Design have been taken in consideration as well to define which characteristics the relaxation space should have had. Hence the prototype was developed, built and introduced as a new social ritual, proposing the concepts of awareness, prevention and common wellness. The final prototype is a dynamic space, which adapts its dimensions according to users’ needs; it presents a generative soundscape and a loop of coloured pacing light which help occupants to relax focusing on their breathing. The prototype has been evaluated in two phases: the first by twenty-three experts to get feedback on how to improve it before the introduction to the employees; the latter with a group of beta users to evaluate a prolonged use. At the end of the projects, taking into account the feedback gathered and pushing even more the Nature Inspired attitude of the project, two new versions have been designed to suggest fast improvements and an eventual futuristic product for Philips.","nature inspired design; relaxation; work related stress; common well being; prototyping; social rituals; biomimicry; biophilia; office environment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

The report has been composed during an internship at Royal HaskoningDHV which contributes to the completion of the master Construction Management and Engineering at the Delft University of Technology. The incentive for this master thesis research lies within the fact that currently there is insufficient knowledge of BVP from the perspective of the vendor. Engineering companies have the desire to learn how to anticipate on this new development in the procurement of the Dutch construction industry. In response to this, the following research question of engineering companies to investigate opportunities to improve their performance projects that are tendered with the BVP award mechanism. In respond to this, the main research question of this master thesis is formulated below. “What are the opportunities for vendors to increase the scores on the award criteria in BVP tender procedures in order to structurally improve the success rate in tender procedures procured with the BVP award mechanism?” First, a closer look is taken at the BVP award mechanism and the BV philosophy. In the theoretical framework the fundamental underlying theories are investigated, i.e. the Information Measurement Theory (IMT) and the Kashiwagi Solution Model (KSM). Besides the practical implementation of the BV philosophy from the client’s point of view (BVP), also insight is provided from the vendor’s point of view, i.e. Best Value Sales (BVS). In the figure below the number of projects that are tendered with the BVP award mechanism are shown. These prospects seem to predict a bright future. With the theories about BV in mind, there is moved on to the practical component of the research. In the case study three projects are investigated that have been tendered with the BVP award mechanism. All three projects are concerned with plan studies in the field of hydraulic engineering and in every one of them Royal Haskoning and DHV have participated. Here, the performances of both vendors are put under the microscope and it is investigated how these performances have come about. This is done based on an evaluation on the tender assessments of Rijkswaterstaat and on the interviews with employees that have participated in these projects. From the tender assessments and the interviews points of attention are retrieved that have the potential to contribute to increase the scores on the award criteria. These suggested opportunities are related to both context improvements and organisational improvements. Two examples of these points of attention are (1) coupling risks and opportunities to the project objectives and (2) developing internal BV standards. Most important point of attention that has been indicated by both client and vendor is the SMART formulation of the tender documents and the answers during the interviews. Therefore, this opportunity is worked out more extensively during the design phase. In the figure above, the developed SMART assessment tool is shown, with which the formulation of tender documents or interviews can be assessed. SMART is an acronym for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Time-bound and the tool assesses every formulation based on these five conditions. For every single condition two points can be earned, as indicated for the condition ‘specific’ in the table below. This way, the maximum score for the five conditions together is ten points, which is visualised in figure S2. The SMART assessment tool has been applied on the tender documents of one of the projects in the case study and suggestions for improvement have been put forward. During the SMART assessment the condition ‘measurable’ is indicated as the condition with the most potential for improvement. Finally, this report concludes with the establishment of the BV organisation in order to move towards the BV vendor. Therefore, there is zoomed in on three levels in the organisation, i.e. the BV support team, the BV tender team and the BV individual. This part is concluded with the notion that it is most important to be aware of the personalities within these teams in order to utilise the capabilities of each BV individual and optimise the performances of the teams.","Best Value Porcurement; BVP; Prestatieinkoop; Privatie party; Information Measurement Theory; IMT; SMART; Assessment tool","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Construction Management and Engineering","",""

(mentor); van de Berg, N.J. (mentor); Dankelman, J. (mentor)","2013","Percutaneous procedures are minimally invasive medical procedures that use needles to locally operate on a target in a patient’s body. The precise placement of the needle in the body is a challenging task that can affect the quality and efficiency of these procedures. Needle insertion accuracy may be improved by robot-assisted control of steerable needles. The type of steerable needles considered in this study are needles that are being developed at the Delft University of Technology (TUD) and are intended to be used in liver biopsy procedures. The goal of this research is to prove that these needles are able to reach a predetermined target accuracy during straight needle insertion. First, the uncontrolled insertion is tested in different tissue stiffness samples and with different insertion speeds. The results show that the target is reached with an accuracy that is smaller than 1 mm only when the insertion speed and the tissue stiffness are low. Other conditions require a control of the needle steering during its insertion, so that its deviations from the straight path can be corrected for. Two controllers are applied and tested. They both use direct position feedback that comes from optical strain sensors in the needle stylet and act on the servomotors with a proportional controller. The first controller only takes into account the end-point of the needle, while the second one takes into account its whole trajectory. Results show that both controllers improve the needle insertion accuracy with respect to the uncontrolled insertion at the tested conditions, allowing to reach the target with a position error that is smaller than 1 mm. The trajectory control gave better performance than the end-point control, which is to be expected, considering that the needle is a nonholonomic system. Overall, this study proved that under specified conditions, the TUD tip actuated steerable needles are able to reach a target on a straight trajectory within a position error that is smaller than 1 mm.","steerable needles; precise needle tip placement; nonholonomic control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-09-19","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","","",""

No study has studied the drawbacks of EV systems for urban areas in order to improve their performance. A methodology is needed to indicate the reverse salient, which represents the technical drawbacks and social barriers within a large scale technological system, that are hindering the EV diffusion. This paper employed morphological analysis to thoroughly explore all possible designs of electric vehicle systems for urban mobility. Based on the 45 explored electric vehicle configurations, the RS for each type of EV system are identified by consulting four automotive industry experts. The results are validated by confronting with the results from reviewing 34 previous literatures. Multiple technical and social RS are indicated with suggested strategies to overcome the RS. At last, the RS of China’s EV market are analyzed and identified as government policies, consumer cultures and product diversity and market positioning. Multiple policy suggestions are given to the central government of China. Future studies can focus on analyzing RS for longer range applications; customer psychology and behavior towards EV; customer classifications for difference types of EVs; and analysis of policy incentives for EV adoption and charging behaviors.","reverse salient; battery electric vehicle; hybrid electric vehicle; fuel cell vehicle; infrastructure of electric vehicle; morphological analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Multi Actor Systems","","EPA","",""

We use code churn to gain more insight into the evolution of software systems. With that in mind, we describe four experiments that we conducted on open source as well as proprietary systems. First, we show how code churn can be calculated on different time intervals and the effect this can have on studies. This can differ up to 20% between commit-based and week-based intervals. Secondly, we use code churn and related metrics to automatically determine what the primary focus of a development team was during a period of time. We show how we built such a classifier with a precision of 74%. Thirdly, we attempted to find generalizable patterns in the code churn progression of systems. We did not find such patterns, and we think this is inherent to software evolution. Finally we study the effect of change volume on the surroundings and user base of a system. We show there is a correlation between change volume and the amount of activity on issue trackers and Q&A websites.","code churn; software evolution; software metrics; classification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Computer Science","",""

The literature is quite scarce on this latter subject, however, so we have to reproduce a referenced result that proved too hard to find. With the basic components covered, we define the concept of automatic maps, and show that it does not rely on the particular choice of numeration system in a given base. We then continue to prove that a map is automatic with respect to every multiplicatively dependent base, and show that there exist automatic maps that are not automatic in any multiplicatively independent base.

(mentor); Quist, P. (mentor); Daamen, W. (mentor); De Boer, J. (mentor)","2013","Two typical types of channels are identified on the PIANC rules (one and two-way channel) and a detailed set of rules for conceptual design purposes is presented. Nevertheless, no explicit definition about when to use which type of channel is provided. For assessing the performance of an access channel, a new simulation model is programmed. This model permits the assessment of different type and layouts of an approach channel, and incorporates several functionalities that allow the enhancement of the yearly number of ships without exceeding an acceptable congestion criterion. As a previous stage for the programming of the simulation model, a verbal model is defined. It describes the main processes related to vessels using an access channel (entrance to the channel, different speed stages, etc.). To enter into the channel, a vessel has to accomplish with different restrictions (channel open, berth available, traffic and weather conditions suitable). The development of the simulation model was executed in two different stages. In a first stage, a basic model was programmed. It includes all typical options available on alternative simulation models like Harboursim: one or two-way channel, tidal and current window, single entrance to the access channel. The model was programmed in Matlab® as a fast-time model, and it is executed in four sequential stages: set-up, data generation, model running and output. Because of the absence of real data information, the simulation model is not validated. Nevertheless, several testing of its main functions and checking of the model results with other accepted sources of information are performed. The second development stage corresponds to the implementation of several functionalities that enhance the performance of the access channel. These measures are classified as traffic measures and enlargement of the nautical infrastructure. The traffic measures include a ‘mixed’ operability of the channel, multiple entrances allowance and speed reduction allowance. The layout modification measures include a passing section and the implementation of an intermediate anchorage. Some results of the simulation model were analyzed. In a first part, a definition of the different parameters that have an effect on the traffic delay is provided (type of channel, expected number of ships, length, capacity and availability of the channel). Via a sensitivity analysis, four relationships are proposed for the average and maximum waiting time. In a second part, the effectiveness of the different available functions is analyzed. While a mixed operation and a multiple entrances scheme are better for fleets with a large number of small vessels, a modification of the layout is better for larger ships. The simulation model is used for the assessment of the traffic conditions of the approach channel of the Taman Seaport. For the current design, the results indicate that during an initial stage of operation, all terminals have acceptable delays. Nevertheless, during a final stage of operation, two terminals (Container 1 and Coal 1) present delays larger than the accepted. The main cause of delay for Container 1 is berth availability, while for the Coal 1 the main cause is divided between berth availability and congestion. Because of the large number of small vessels present in the Taman’s fleet, traffic rules are applied (mixed operation and multiple entrances). Average traffic delay is reduced from 18 min to 2 min. If the layout is modified, the average traffic delay can be reduced down to 1 min (passing section). The modification of the layout is recommended only if the benefit per reduced hour of congestion is larger than 13,300 /hr.","approach channel; simulation model; congestion; Taman","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Ports and Waterways","",""

(mentor); Houben, G.J. (mentor)","2013","Recent studies have investigated the use of source code metrics to predict the change- and defect-proneness of source code. While the indicative power of these metrics was validated for several systems, it has not been tested on Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA). In particular, the SOA paradigm prescribes the development of systems through the composition of services, i.e., network-accessible components. In one implementation of SOA which is very popular in industry, services are specified using WSDL interface descriptions. Thus, service consumers are highly affected by the changes performed on an evolving WSDL interface. This fact reveals the importance of assessing the change-proneness of interfaces in SOA. This work aims at investigating the correlation between several cohesion and data type complexity metrics and the change-proneness of a WSDL interface. We empirically investigate the correlation between the number of fine-grained interface changes and complexity and cohesion metrics including a newly defined data type cohesion (DTC) metric. Furthermore, we perform a manual analysis of the interfaces to gain better insight to our conclusions. We performed these measurements on multiple versions of ten widely used, open-source WSDL interfaces. Our results show that data type complexity expressed in number of nodes is an appropriate metric to represent data type complexity but not sufficient to predict the change-proneness of an interface. In addition, we investigate three other cohesion metrics: LCOS, SFCI and SIDC presented in the literature and the newly designed DTC metric. Our empirical study shows that among the tested metrics it is the DTC cohesion metric that exhibits the strongest correlation with the number of fine-grained changes performed in subsequent versions of WSDLs. Finally, based on the DTC metric results about the cohesion in data types, we manually analyzed the examined WSDLs and we conclude that highly referenced data types are less change-prone.","SOA; change-proneness; WSDL; service; software evolution; metrics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-09-18","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Engineering Research Group","","Computer Science/Information Architecture Track","",""

The project is part of the Highly Individualized Patient Projects (HiPP), a research consortium between Industrial Design Engineering faculty in TU Delft, Biomet, and Reinier de Graaf Groep hospital. The used design process is a sequence of several steps. In order to understand the teamwork in the OR, a literature research was done with main focus on the non-technical skills that influence the performance of the OR professionals. While narrowing down the scope, a field research in four different hospitals was done. In these hospitals, twelve observations in orthopedic's ORs were done. The outcome of this study was combined with the results from the literature research in order to formulate the interaction vision of the to be designed product. This was supported with the determination of the product functions. During the conceptualization phase three design directions were found that revealed four different concepts. A Harris profile tool was used in order to find the most promising concept. The concept that fulfills the criteria list the most, was further developed during the embodiment design phase. A iterative design process was followed, starting by defining the working principle that will make the system work with the most efficient way. After the working principle was determined, a prototype of the system was developed. By using the prototype, the developed system was tested in RdGG hospital to verify its functionality and if it fulfills the primary goals. In order to perform the testing, all the the interaction vision and the product functions and conditions were used. Finally, the final system is further developed, including an initial business model proposal that can be used for the future steps of the system.","teamwork in the OR; medical design; product design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-09-17","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Kuipers, H. (mentor)","2013","This thesis describes the development of a trailer for the launching and retrieving of boats without a ramp for Vanclaes B.V. Vanclaes produces and sells boat trailers in the vision of ‘unburdening’ the consumer. Their trailer solves many of the problems consumers have when using traditional boat trailers. A key feature of Vanclaes trailers is that they are built from modular elements, allowing the trailer to be tailored to a consumer’s boat when it comes to length and width. Next to boat trailers that enable boats to be launched at a boat ramp, ‘tilt boat trailers’ allow consumers to launch boat without a ramp. Vanclaes believes that this product is not user friendly and wanted a solution that matches the vision of their current trailer. The context of Vanclaes, tilt trailers and users was analysed, after which a design challenge and program of requirements could be compiled. When using tilt trailers, users have a lack of control over their boats, creating a fear of damage to the boat and causing distrust. The new product should improve this situation. It should also appeal to a target group of ‘avid users’: adventurous, more wealthy boat users that like to explore new territories with their boats. The product weight should be as low as possible, to be able to fit the tow weight of as much cars as possible and to save on fuel. The product needs to function with different boat lengths between 5 and 11 meters with a weight up to 1500 (kg), which made the technical embodiment an important point of attention. Various ideas and principles to solve the problem were explored. Out of four selected use principles, the principle in which an extra tilting frame is added to a base trailer was seen as most promising. Two concepts were developed to determine which type of drive was most promising: a spindle drive or a hydraulic drive. The latter was chosen because it would create a more stable motion and because it was likely to be more affordable. The result of the project is the Vanclaes ProLaunch system, an add-on for the Vanclaes base trailer. This launching system enables users to launch and retrieve their boats at quays up to 40 (cm) in height. The user is able to control the movements of his boat in a safe way, without using excessive force. The user controls a hydraulic system, which pushes an added tilt frame towards the water surface via a set of tilt arms. From there, the boat is lowered in the water using an electronic winch. The system is built from modular elements to be able to assemble it in different widths and lengths and is compatable with the roller system Vanclaes currently uses. Selected aspects of the design were tested by building a full scale prototype. At the moment, the stability of the system needs to be further evaluated. The weight of the system and the cost price are too high, but optimization is possible. The feasibility of the ProLaunch concept on a functional level is proven and can be elaborated upon. The system can be further developed with a focus on reducing weight and cost price.","boat trailer; launching; retrieving; quay; product development; Vanclaes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

Relatively small resonating components can alter the dynamics of the assembly significantly. Due to the presence of many small components and limited test resources it is often difficult to find the disruptor. In this report a procedure is proposed to trace a relatively small resonating component of a large structural assembly. It is based on correlation of analytical, finite element method (FEM), and experimental modal analysis data, specifically by using objective functions. No additional measurements are required; the entire procedure is performed with FEM calculations. The proposed localization procedure is applied to different configurations of a specially designed and manufactured structural assembly. The test results illustrate a successful localization of the resonating component for the investigated configurations. The complexity of the investigated structural assembly could be increased in further researches, since the procedure proved to be robust.","model analysis; correlation; error localization; assembly; objective function","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-01-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Caarls, W. (mentor)","2013","By learning to walk, robots should be able to traverse many types of terrains. An important learning paradigm for robots is Reinforcement Learning (RL). Learning to walk through RL with real robots remains a difficult challenge however. To meet this challenge, a robot called LEO has been developed in the Delft BioRobotics Lab. LEO is a 2D bipedal robot built specifically to learn to walk through RL. Unfortunately, when learning with Sarsa(?) the robot breaks down before it has learned a successful gait. A possible solution for this is to minimize the number of interactions with the environment (samples) needed to learn a satisfactory policy. A promising technique to reduce sample complexity in RL is to re-use samples instead of discarding them after one update. One of the contribution of this thesis is providing a theoretical comparison of sample re-use techniques in the form of a novel unified framework. With the help of the framework, Experience Replay (ER) is selected to be used for evaluation and analysis of sample re-use on walking robots. Empirical comparison of ER with Sarsa(?) is done with three benchmark problems: simulations of the inverted pendulum, the simplest walker, and LEO. On initial experiments we observed slow and unpredictable learning with ER on the walking problems. We show that this is mainly caused by two issues. The first issue involves failing back-propagation due to optimism in the face of uncertainty. To deal with this, we develop a new algorithm called ER-? which makes the attitude towards uncertainty a function of the state instead initialization of the value function. The second issue is concerning local maxima emerging in the value function due to self effecting states. For this, we propose a residual gradient variant of ER. We find that the new algorithms perform well on the walking problems. In particular, (residual) ER-? gives very encouraging results when compared with Sarsa(?) and vanilla-ER. From the results, we can see that the attitude towards uncertainty during replay is of particular importance for walking problems. We conclude that while ER is a promising technique, it gives no guarantee on good learning performance. We showed that by exploiting the available data and knowledge of the representation, the result of ER can significantly be increased.","reinforcement learing; walking robots","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-09-27","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

(mentor); Nauta, C.L. (mentor)","2013","Dutchband B.V., in 2001 founded, is nowadays the largest provider of wristbands, tokens and festival solutions like sealstations and cash and pin vendor machines on the Dutch market. Since three years they have broaden their scope towards the European market, in order to maintain growth. With an increasing range to serve customers, their products need to change along side, e.g. for transportation. This thesis’ focus is on the development of the new generation sealstation to produce wristbands. The sealstation is a patented system to provide textile woven, fraud resistance, wristbands to visitors of festivals and events. Sebastian Yap has worked on the concept design for the new generation and finished with a working prototype. The thesis starts with a more extended introduction towards the product and the company. Based upon his thesis and the feedback gained out of the user tests with the prototype the list of requirements was reviewed and six main criteria were defined. To structure the following steps, these six criteria were divided into four main topics, to which will be referred later on. From here the research starts with e.g. the analysing of the sealstation, the context of usage, all stakeholders involved and the seal strength. Besides theoretical analysis of the situation, several festivals were visited with the sealstation to see the machine in action. During these practical experiences great insights were obtained from several stakeholders which were analysed on forehand. After the research phase, the development of all components is explained. For each topic, components are optimized for that specific topic. This is partially done by experiments. For each topic a functional analysis is made to define which component has which relation with and influence on another component. After all four topics are reviewed, they come together and the whole is analysed on interference errors. Since the components have not been tested together, this was done by 3D modelling. Due to a lack of time, one of the topics required an unexpected amount of time, the final stage is a ready for prototyping sealstation. Once the prototype is tested and no malfunctions arise, the product is ready for production. All technical drawings and order numbers for purchase components are present. It is likely though there will be a small iteration step required after the prototyping. Steps to be taken after this thesis are explained in the chapter conclusions. In the current stage of the seal station, a weight reduction compared to the existing seal station of 56 % and a volume reduction during transport of 58 % was realised. This thesis was written to obtain my masters degree at the faculty of Industrial Design Engineering. There is also an annotation for entrepreneurship incorporated in the master, including in this thesis. This meant the participation of an Entrepreneurship Week during the graduation. It includes also the search for new markets relating to the seal station, which is executed and summarised in the chapter opportunities.","design; embodiment; sealstation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-09-16","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Vardon, P.J. (mentor)","2013","The Master's programme Industrial Ecology is jointly organised by Leiden University and Delft University of Technology. This research project was done during an internship of 8 months completed with Royal Dutch Shell within the department of Future Energy Technologies of The Netherlands. It is focused on a case study of a medium size house (2202) situated in The Hague, NL and the neighboring households with the same characteristics along the same street. Homes in the Netherlands are likely to have their heat requirements fulfilled by conventional natural gas systems due to the relatively cheap cost compared to other systems (installation and investment wise) that could have a lower carbon footprint. However, innovative installations could make other more environmentally friendly systems as accessible as conventional systems. The Netherlands as one of the European member states have the goal of reducing CO2 emissions to accomplish their Kyoto targets; however, The Netherlands was not able to meet this target by 3.24% (target of 200.4 megaton CO2-eq). Besides, there is a general lack of financial incentives, making it in many cases an obvious decision to keep and use standard fossil fuel energy systems (both large- and small-scale) regardless of the environmental impact they may have. The building energy consumption sector provides a great opportunity and focus area for trying to reduce even more those emissions, and efforts have been made to introduce into the market more environmentally friendly systems. Until now, exploitation of geothermal shallow energy using a Ground Source Heat Pump (GSHP) has generally been limited to large commercial / industrial units. One reason for this is that the technology used for obtaining the geothermal energy and raising it to an appropriate temperature for the heat requirements of a typical house requires a big space for its installation which in turn proves to be a disruptive and complex process that requires the use of heavy and bulky machinery which immediately translates in a restriction for small homes. Innovations for installations of Ground Source heat pumps are starting to appear in the market, giving the possibility and the opportunity to install those systems in smaller areas, with less disruption and lower investment costs, although some concerns may arise when considering the thermal interference between the boreholes. This project examined the geological characteristics of the case study as determined by a Thermal Response Test (TRT) where parameters such as the thermal conductivity, the thermal resistance and the thermal diffusivity of the ground were obtained. Furthermore, the heat requirements of the test house were calculated with real data obtained during a year between 2012 and 2013 in order to determine the size of the system that would be required for each one of the houses assuming they all have the same demand throughout the year, having a peak demand for a winter day of 16 KW and an average demand of 10 KW in the winter months. Calculations of the length required of every Borehole Heat Exchanger (BHE) and the distance between them were made for the area of each house assuming no thermal interference. The first set of results indicated that a BHE length of 268 m would be needed, and with borehole thermal interference introducing a temperature penalty calculated with an analytical model, the length required increased to 332 m, 68 m more. After this a proposed design of borehole arrangement is suggested for the test house considering the space constraints. Calculations on the Economic and Environmental advantage from Ground Source Heat Pump (GSHP) compared to a Gas Boiler is done, taking into consideration two scenarios for the GSHP, 1) with a Seasonal Performance Factor (SPF) of 3.5 and 2) with a SPF of 3.0. Domestic gas and electricity price fluctuations over the past years were included, extrapolating this behavior for the years 2015 and 2020. Gas prices are considered to have changed 9% per year given the data from 1996 – 2013. Having extrapolated the prices, calculations are done on running costs and investment cost, to give the payback times when considering current power and gas prices for 2015 and 2020. The current situation (2013) seems the more expensive moment for having the system with a payback time of 24 years however a GSHP system in 2020 with electricity and gas prices following a 9% increase for gas prices would take just 8 years to have the investment back. For the environmental performance the Dutch footprint of power generation is calculated for the average predicted trends of different scenarios in the future for European power generation where GSHP with a SPF of 3.5 in 2020 seems to have the best Carbon Footprint advantage of all with 59% advantage of the compared systems. Recommendations are made in order to come up with connected scenarios of Dutch power and natural gas to have a coherent and timely understanding of GSHP and other renewable systems in the Dutch heating market for the coming years. Further recommendations are made in order to have a clear understanding on all the interrelated factors that have an impact on the efficiency, feasibility and performance of GSHP systems and how this research project could be broadened.","ground source heat pumps; renewable energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technical University of Technology","Chemical Engineering","","Industrial Ecology","",""

Local-equilibrium models assume steady-state throughout a porous medium, but foam processes might be slow to reach steady-state in the laboratory. This could result in inaccurate predictions when processes that are important on a laboratory scale might not be so important in the field. We build a population-balance model to examine the effect of foam dynamics before steady state is reached. We compare simulation results for our population-balance model with a local-equilibrium (LE) model under two known scenarios to verify our model works properly. In the first scenario we compare the simulation results if no foam is generated. In the second scenario we compare the simulation results if foam is generated assuming local equilibrium is reached instantaneously throughout the porous medium. Finally we simulate a case where foam is created more slowly, and compare to a published experimental result to see if our population-balance model can fit the delayed peak in pressure gradient in this experiment. The population-balance model manages to describe foam dynamics more adequately than the LE model, but cannot explain the delayed peak in pressure gradient.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

The physiological effects on the suborbital tourist cannot be sufficiently predicted. All currently available baseline data were collected in a highly selected group of professional astronauts that do not represent the general population. Participants of commercial flights can be of any age and could have a number of medical conditions. To increase understanding on the reaction of non-astronauts to G-force a monitoring system is developed that collects vital health information. The system has two objectives. First, it must collect data for further research into the human tolerance to G-forces. Second, the system must enable constant monitoring of the state of the participant in real time during the flight. The goal of this research is to investigate how the vital functions of spaceflight participants can be monitored during a suborbital spaceflight. Method: First of all the research involved investigating which vital functions are important for participant health state estimation, Second, based on physiological requirements, techniques were selected for monitoring during a suborbital spaceflight. Third, the prototype was built incorporating both physiological en surroundings monitoring modules. Fourth and finally, the system was evaluated in a hypergravity environment on earth. Results: Two types of results were produced namely physiological results and operational results. The operational results focus on the monitoring concept and the improvements that could be made based on the development and test phase. The physiological results go into detail on the physiology of suborbital spaceflight. These findings determine if the system provides sufficient information to estimate the health state of the spaceflight participant. The vital health information or vital functions are cerebral oxygenation, blood oxygenation and heart function. The only suitable monitoring techniques in this research setting are Electrocardiography (ECG) and Pulse Oximetry (SPO2). Conclusion: The future suborbital spaceflight monitoring system should consist of a harness with an integrated ECG with a minimum of 3-leads, a pulse oximeter and a respiration meter. It should contain an integrated G-force sensor or be able to synchronize the system with an external G-force measurement. The system should be able to facilitate hardware and software modification. Due to the technical and practical limitations of the medical monitoring techniques only two techniques met the requirements for monitoring in space. Consequently, a certain health information gap exists. This research suggests that the future of monitoring spaceflight participants lies in collecting more heath monitoring data.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-09-15","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

(mentor); Bosch-Rekveldt, M.G.C. (mentor); Koops, L.S.W. (mentor); Mauser, H.W. (mentor); Van den Berg, A. (mentor)","2013","Within the current Dutch construction industry, complex and extensive civil engineering projects are often executed by private partnerships, with a public client (the Dutch department of public works, better known as Rijkswaterstaat). Large projects in this context are considered multimillion euro projects, characterised as uncertain, complex, politically sensitive and involving a large number of stakeholders. Multiple research on such projects is already done over the past years, especially on ‘hard factors’, like risk management or supply chain control. However, research on ‘soft factors’ like collaboration is limited but desirable due to struggle as identified in practice. The size of the projects and the associated large amount financial resources, reference requirements and risk involved, causes that company are willing to step into a partnership. Out of these companies a joint organisation (or joint venture) is established, in which collaboration is necessary to reach shared project success. The different backgrounds of the individuals entering the project on a temporary basis, has proved to be difficult in practise. The combination of individuals derived from different parent companies, all having a specific specialism and having more or less experience in the sector, causes a complex situation regarding collaboration. This thesis is aimed at providing insight into the individuals’ perspectives into factors influencing collaboration in a specific formed centre of collaboration, using the following research question: Which factors influence collaboration according to an individual’s view, in a specific formed centre of collaboration? To generate the required data for answering the research question, Q-methodology is used within the context of a single-case. Q-methodology starts with the definition of a concourse, which is the sum of all information about the main issue (here: factors influencing collaboration). A combination of five researches (both comparative and self-executed) provides a set of forty-six factors and criteria regarding collaboration, which forms the base for this study. These forty-six items are clustered into six categories: trust, organisation, purpose, communication, risk and incentives. After comparison and selection of the items, nineteen factors remained to use for this research: (1) Atmosphere of mutual respect and understanding; (2) Confidence in each other’s skills; (3) Trust and support from the client; (4) Variety in team composition; (5) Availability resources; (6) Clear project role guidelines; (7) Shared objectives; (8) Attainable goals; (9) Project focussing; (10) Formal communication; (11) Informal communication; (12) Open and honest communication; (13) Understand each other’s language; (14) High technical complexity; (15) Clarity about risk allocation; (16) Gain and pain sharing; (17) Cooperative attitude; (18) Repetitiveness of collaboration; (19) Common priorities. These factors are translated into statements, known as the Q-set, which form the base for the Q-sorting process. Within this process, the twenty-eight respondents as selected in the case are confronted with the statements and asked to rank them relatively by the degree of importance using the main theme: “To achieve good collaboration within a project team it is important that....” For the most salient outcomes an explanation is given by the respondents in short interviews afterwards, which is used for the interpretation of the data. Analysis showed that respondents agreed on the degree of (un)importance of nine of the nineteen statements, which signifies a high consensus in opinion. Two factors which are considered as most important by the majority of respondents are: “open and honest communication” and “an atmosphere of mutual respect and understanding”. Despite of the recognition of the importance of these two factors, respondents argue that both items are hard to achieve because of the different interests of individuals, as an effect of the different parent companies and the different departments in the organisation individuals act in. Though the relatively high degree of consensus, also several differences can be identified, which makes it possible to formulate and characterise (three) different perspectives, which can be seen as clusters of correlated viewpoints of respondents. After a quantitative data analysis the perspectives are ualitatively interpreted. The three perspectives as derived are labelled as: (1) Perspective A: “The idealistic team worker”; This person represents someone who attaches importance towards the mental part, with a certain distance from reality. It is a supportive individual, who is known for its flexibility and adaptability to different situations and environments. This person is considered an unconditionally collaborator. (2) Perspective B: “The socialistic co-ordinator”; This person represents someone who strives for equality, has a certain degree of solidarity and puts the collective interest of the team on top of their priority list. It is a conditional collaborator, having a strong focus on their internal team and own framework, which neglects the outside world. In addition, its effectiveness will be optimal when working in a small, restricted team. (3) Perspective C: “The pragmatic implementer”; This person represents someone who aims for a pragmatic attitude, which places production above collaboration. He or she is known for routine, practical common-sense and self-discipline. This person works hard, but needs guidance. This individual is generally not suitable for an umbrella function, because of the lack of seeing the bigger picture. It is tried to link the different perspectives with one or more of the three characteristics of the respondents, which are ‘parent company’, ‘organisation’s department’ and ‘work experience’. Apparently, these characteristics do not have a clear influence on the individual’s viewpoint towards factors influencing collaboration. The differences in perspectives may not be find in the individual’s characteristics as identified and may even be found in the deeper layer of what drives people to act and to react. Collaboration was shown to be dynamic and a deeply rooted emotional process, which cannot easily traced down to unambiguous characteristics. Earlier research already showed that effective teams include a variety of types of individuals. Nevertheless, the confrontation of these different individuals causes conflict on the shop floor. While confronting the different perspectives of this research, conflict occurs between both perspective A and B, A and C and B and C; all for different reasons. The main source of these conflicts can be found in a discrepancy in expectations and the individual’s needs, which should be solved by the individuals themselves. Therefore the main management implication is to be found in bringing people together and within the confrontation of individuals. The outcomes of the research are mirrored against a research on collaboration of thirty-eight years ago, which showed to be outdated. Especially conflict over costs became more important over the years. An increased cost awareness and need for cost effectiveness over the years caused that conflicts over (and attention for) costs became more and more accurate. In addition, were the technical options and performance trade-offs are seen as a source of conflict thirty-eight years ago, this research aims that technical complexity is a side effect of the sector and something that can be managed by specialists. As an indicator for collaboration effectiveness, the maturity levels of Meng et al. (2011) are used. Analysis showed that the organisation as identified does not (yet) reach full maturity (which is ultimately desired). To reach higher maturity, attention should be paid to the identified sources of conflict as well as to the factors indicated as important by all perspectives (“open and honest communication” and “an atmosphere of mutual respect and understanding”). As a remark, it should be clear that all factors extracted from literature are considered influential on collaboration and therefore not one factor should be neglected. An extreme focus on only those factors which came forward within this research may cause deterioration of others. In addition, it needs to be mentioned that although individuals think in a certain maturity level, they do not necessarily act in the same level. This research was indented to explore the individual’s view on factors influencing collaboration, not to explore how these individuals actually act. In a people process (like within collaboration) a researcher (as well as a manager) should always be aware of the discrepancy between thinking and acting of individuals. Looking back to the main research question it can be concluded that the research results generally show a common view towards factors influencing collaboration, but that some nuances are visible. The three different perspectives of individuals show the differences in viewpoints. Although some consensus exists, the discovery of the existence of different types of individuals is a step forward in an improved internal collaboration situation.","Collaboration; Role; Q-methodology; Partnership; Individuals; Joint Venture; Factors; Perspectives","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Construction Management and Engineering","",""

The current study has shown the method’s potential to investigate the stability of PBD-b-PEO polymersomes by looking at the kinetics of free 111In3+ and 111In bound to Tropolone and DTPA molecules. Unfortunately no conclusive results were yet obtained. Ideally the polymersome membrane has no influence on the molecular tumbling of the 111In entrapped inside. It was expected similar perturbation factors to be obtained for 111In-DTPA in solution and the loaded polymersomes. This was not the case. Assuming the PAC system functions correctly, one possible explanation is the leakage of the polymersomes. Another explanation, sustained as well by the scattered results, is that the correlation times of the 111In-DTPA respectively 111In-Tropolone, are too small to be detected by the PAC. Because PAC has not been previously used to investigate 111In loaded polymersomes, the results could not be confirmed nor infirmed.

In order to gain a better understanding of the programming features and the use of these features by programmers it is imperative to perform studies on various programming tasks in these languages. Such studies advance our knowledge of the benefits of using agent-oriented languages and may contribute positively to the evolution of these languages. As a first step we perform an analysis of the submissions to the Multi-Agent Programming Contest. We look at common patterns, structures and methodologies used. Additionally a functional categorization is made to identify common structures in the agent program. We discover that participants favor modular abstractions and simple decision structures. Iterative methodologies seem to perform better. Based on these findings we provide a set of recommendations that agent programming languages should follow. We also use these findings to design the study which is the primary focus of this thesis. In this study we compare the performance of programmers on tasks that use the agent programming frameworks GOAL and POSH. The aim of the study was to investigate any differences in usability of the frameworks as well as differences between novice and more advanced programmers using either framework. The results suggest that there is no significant difference for the given tasks between both frameworks. We did find that general programming experience seems to be a relatively big advantage when using a (new) programming language. Analysis of the assignment and the observations made about the use of the frameworks, however, suggest that the experimental design can be adapted in such a way that differences in usability of the frameworks can be established.","agents; GOAL; POSH; agent programming; agent programming languages","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-09-11","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Interactive Inteligence","","Computer Science","",""

(mentor); Roscam Abbing, E. (mentor)","2013","PROJECT BACKGROUND Space Expedition Corporation (SXC) founded in 2011, is one of the few companies that offers commercial sub-orbital spaceflights to the general public. Moreover, these spaceflights allows scientific institutes to perform scientific research in space (microgravity research). To provide these spaceflights, SXC has a wet-lease agreement with space vehicle developer XCOR Aerospace. The commercial space industry is still in its infancy and therefore it is important for SXC to capture as much market share as possible and build in entry barriers for competitors to come. Currently, SXC holds a market share of roughly 30% opposed to one other competitor, based on sold spaceflight tickets. Market studies on commercial human spaceflights forecasts a growing demand, which will lead to an increase of competitors as well. Thus, the challenge is to grow the SXC brand and strengthen SXC’s position in this market. In order to operate spaceflights, SXC will use a so-called spaceport. A commercial spaceport is similar to an airport, but then facilitating the flights into space. Literature has indicated that a commercial spaceport needs a visitor experience center to generate more revenue. Thus, the assignment of this thesis is to develop a SXC branded experience center concept that could be implemented at multiple spaceports paired with a business strategy. Therefore, the spaceport is a key stakeholder in this project. To have a SXC visitor experience on spaceports all over the world, a competitive advantage is created. This would not only enhance SXC’s brand and position in the market, but creates extra revenue for SXC as well. ANALYSIS After performing a company analysis it is worth mentioning that SXC has the expertise in facilitating commercial spaceflights in terms of legislations, procedure, infrastructure and logistics. Moreover, SXC has know-how on the experiences and emotions paired with the different stages in the actual spaceflight. However, the vision, mission and values of SXC were not clearly stated. Roscam Abbing (2010) notes that a strong vision and mission can separate a company from its competitors. In the external analysis relevant macro trends have been found (see table 3.4) as well as the fact that there is an urge of commercial spaceports to have a visitor experience center to generate more revenues. On top of this, a spaceport can only survive when signing an anchor tenant, like SXC. This gives SXC an advantage. An interview with the CEO of Spaceport Sweden (SPS) confirmed the possibility of having a SXC experience center at SPS (SPS is currently performing a feasibility study for the development of the spaceport). To design a visitor experience center various existing experience centers and museums have been studied. It could be concluded that for the design the four conditions of ‘learning for fun’ by Packer (2006) should be applied (read more in section 3.3). Moreover, it is important as a designer to not only focus on the messages to be conveyed to the visitor, but to also take the learning experience of the visitor into account. The competitor analysis discusses the differences between SXC and its main competitor Virgin Galactic. The spaceflight experience is different and therefore can be positioned distinctively by SXC. Also, XCOR as vehicle developer places more focus on safety and sustainability. However, no actual commercial spaceflights have been executed yet, but Virgin Galactic stands a high chance of being the first one. Based on the performed industry attractiveness analysis it is safe to say that SXC should initiate close partnerships with spaceports in their early development stage. Additionally, the design should be scalable to achieve a geographic competitive advantage. A threat is the fact that XCOR could start selling its space vehicles to other companies besides SXC in the future, creating more competitors. A customer analysis is executed with current clients of SXC and potential spaceport visitors to understand who they are and to discover the expectations of the spaceflight experience. Current clients like the heroic aspect of going on a space trip, the personal challenge and to make history as a person. The potential spaceport visitors are interested more in the future of space travel, safety and sustainability. Brand model literature was reviewed, which created a foundation for designing a new brand framework for SXC. It is worth mentioning that the ‘why’ of Sinek’s golden circle should be defined first. This is equal to the vision of a company. Moreover, the brand values can be defined by using archetypes. DESIGN PHASE The design vision of the experience center has been from the start of this project, “space will come to you”. This is targeting the general public that cannot afford a spaceflight ticket (currently $100,000). The experience center is divided in building blocks emphasizing the different sub-experiences within one flight. Firstly, the vision, mission and values were redefined with C. Faes (marketing director): Vision: “We believe that space belongs to everyone and it offers an entirely new world of opportunities that has yet to be seized”. Mission: “Our mission is to make space technically, financially and comprehensibly accessible for everyone, including the general public, the industry and the scientific world”. Values: Meaningful – With meaningful we mean significant. In order to be significant SXC, strives to be a game changer in the commercial space industry and to stimulate change that is beneficial for everyone. Empowerment – SXC empowers everyone to be game changing as well as letting you create your own benefits for the commercial space industry. Based on the analysis stage and this brand framework, six design criteria have been developed. Also, a persona is designed to tailor the experience center to his behavior, needs and wishes. A brainstorm session per defined sub-experience is conducted to develop design ideas. Ideas are selected with the design criteria and cohesion is formed through interior design and the brand- and spaceflight story (see section 4.7). The concept is evaluated with experience design firm Northern Light, and a user study with 12 participants matching the persona profile is executed. Both parties were positive about the concept and minor additions have been added to optimize (see section 4.11). BUSINESS STRATEGY First, a business model is synthesized. In this business model it is evident that three parties are relevant: SXC, the spaceport and the SXC leaseholder. SXC will provide the spaceport with this visitor experience concept, whereupon the spaceport will search for a leaseholder wanting to operate this center. Therefore, the investment of the center lays in the hands of the leaseholder and SXC will receive a annual license fee over the gross profit. Further, the spaceport also benefits from this concept, because it secures rent income from the leaseholder. Indirectly, this center will also attract many visitors for the spaceport. The admission fee is divided in two offerings, a full experience at $40 for adults and $32 for children and a sxc experience (only access to the ground floor) at an adult rate of $20 and $16 for children. This concept can be offered in three packages to the leaseholder varying in initial investments. Package A is the full experience, package B is experience-wise at 75% of A and package C is equal to 50% of the full experience. Package A, the full experience, needs an initial investment of $14.7 million to develop. A financial plan with a period of five years is drafted to investigate the center’s profitability and earnings for SXC. Two scenarios have been reviewed, a baseline scenario and a constrained scenario. The main difference between the two scenarios is the amount of visitors. With the baseline scenario the payback period of the initial investment is in 4.81 years. After year 5 the net profit amounts roughly $ 5.7 million. The annual gross profit of the experience center is from year 2 to year 5 respectively: $ 9.5 million, $ 12.6 million, $ 12.6 million and $ 15.1 million. This means with a 10% license fee the earnings of SXC will be (from year 2-5): $ 950,000, $ 1.3 million, $ 1.3 million and $ 1.5 million. In the constrained scenario no net profit is earned after five years with an admission fee of $40 and a 10% license fee. Therefore, the admission fee was increased with 25% (=$50) and the license fee reduced to 5% for SXC. This resulted in a payback period of 4.28 years. After year 5 the net profit amounts over $ 4.7 million. The yearly gross profit starts in year 2 at $ 7.9 million and increases to $ 15.1 million in year 5. With a license fee of 5% SXC earns from year 2 to year 5: $ 400,000 - $ 760,000. Within this project assumptions have been made to progress, which are discussed in chapter 6. At the end it can be concluded that implementing this concept could increase SXC’s brand image and strengthen its position in the market, not to mention an increase of revenues through licensing.","Commercial Space Travel; Visitor Experience Center; spaceflights; branding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

(mentor); Dankers, A.G. (mentor)","2013","With advancing technology, systems are becoming increasingly interconnected and form more complex networks. Additionally, measurements are more available due to cheaper sensors. Hence there is a need for identification methods specifically designed for networks. System identification is a wide-spread technique that handles open-loop and closed-loop identification problems well, and has explicit consistency and variance results for them. The application of these methods to complex networks is currently under development. Several methods have been proposed in order to obtain consistent estimates. Beside consistency, the variance of the obtained estimates is also crucial because the variance defines confidence regions for the model. A common feature when studying dynamic networks is that measurements can be taken at various locations in the network. These measurements are taken using sensors, which in reality always have some noise. In this thesis it is shown that combining the data of multiple (noisy) sensors to estimate a network internal variable can be beneficial for the estimate’s variance, even if the sensors are measuring different internal variables. This multiple measurements phenomenon is studied and its insight is used to devise a novel network system identification method: the partial tailor-made method. It is shown that the partial tailor-made method provides consistent estimates with lower variance than the celebrated two-stage method.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

Situational awareness is value representation for the comprehension of a situation used to infer what is going on and what is going to happen. The situational awareness of a human was improved by showing extra virtual information using augmented reality. The virtual information was shown using a virtual model of the robot arm on a head-mounted display. Two categories of information to improve situational awareness were found by analysing the human-robot interaction in orange repacking: state and intention information. From each category, one information type with a high potential to improve situational was implemented and explored. Two within-subject experiments were conducted in which the test subjects were asked to wear a head-mounted display and work in a designed robot working cell. During the first experiment the test subject were presented with visual cues about the state of the robot arm and during the second experiment with visual cues about the intended goal of the robot arm. In each experiment the test subjects were evaluated on the reaction time to the visual cues. Each experiment was done twice, once with the presence of virtual information and once without, but both while wearing the head-mounted display. Compared to the case without virtual information, the results showed a decrease in reaction times to state and intention information when presented with the virtual information. This decrease in reaction time was a measure for an increased situational awareness of the human and showed that situational awareness could be improved by using a head-mounted display to show extra, not observable, information about the robot arm. This work contributes to help humans work more efficiently together with industrial robot arms by using a head-mounted display to present information in a more natural manor.","intention projection; robot intentions; augmented reality; situational awareness; head-mounted display","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-09-15","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

(mentor)","2013","The Technical University of Delft has started a project in the form of a Master Thesis to improve their existing and develop new algorithms for processing the measured data with the PARSAX radar for 2D-Windfield monitoring. A new algorithm is developed that detects and estimates the multi-layered structure of a windfield using the measured polarimetric Doppler weather data. It is studied which variables can be used and within which boundaries they will be for the measurement of precipitation targets. The processing of the measured data is improved and higher quality data is obtained. The high quality data is used to make a Velocity Azimuth Display (VAD) and study the pattern of a windfield. An existing algorithm is studied and tested to obtain the direction and strength of the windfield from the VAD. A model is developed that uses the radar configuration and a user divined weather model as input to simulate the Doppler velocity pattern that the radar would measure with this configuration. This model is used to simulate the pattern that would be observed in case of a multi layered windfield, to be used as input for the testing of the newly developed algorithm. The developed algorithm is finally tested on a real dataset. The obtained windfield parameters with the existing and developed algorithm are used as input for the developed Doppler velocity pattern simulation model to compare the simulated Doppler velocity patterns with the measured one. It can be concluded that the existing algorithm has problems and gives wrong results when more windfields are present. The developed algorithm gives more realistic results, retrieving wind characteristics for every vertical layer, and producing high resulting correlation between simulated and observed patterns on VAD.","PARSAX; polarimetric radar; Multi layered windfield; pattern simulation; VAD; Doppler velocity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","Telecommunication","",""

(mentor)","2013","Simulation models become increasingly important in energy policy analysis. A literature review showed that there is demand for analysing the effect of multiple more realistic investment algorithms on the outcomes of energy policy analysis. The reason is that energy policy analysis could be incomplete without insight in the implications of the assumed investment behaviour in simulation models. The research question is: How is the effectiveness of the EU-ETS mechanism affected by diverse investment algorithms in an electricity market simulation model? In EMlab-generation, three modular empirical data based algorithms are designed including behaviour with technology-preferences, credit-risk considerations and risk-averse behaviour. The results showed that more realistic investment behaviour culminates in all experiments in at least one or more technologies with substantially different investment patterns. Different investment patterns caused a lowered CO2 price volatility in most experiments in relation to homogeneous profit only behaviour indicating that the CO2 price might be a more stable investment signal than earlier assumed. The effectiveness of the EU-ETS mechanism remains for all experiments however doubtful due to the substantial CO2 price volatility of more than 100%. The necessity of stabilizing measures such as a price floor and/or ceiling proposed by previous studies is reinforced by the results. This research shows the importance of being aware of the implications of the assumed investment behaviour in simulation models used for energy policy analysis. Two recommendations to deal with the implications of the assumed investment behaviour in models is to design more flexible and modular investment algorithms. Flexibility and modularity in investment algorithms enable and support exploring the effect of different behavioural configurations on outcomes of energy policy analysis.","power plant investment; modelling; EU-ETS mechanism; policy analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy & Industry","","","",""

(mentor); Van der Helm, A.J.C. (mentor)","2013","Goal In recent years, designers have increasingly started to make experiential prototypes containing electronics within the design process. This has been enabled by the rise of several microcontroller boards and software tools that decrease the complexity and cost of making such a prototype, allowing designers to construct these prototypes themselves. Although these tools have already drastically simplified the complexity of making such prototypes, it is still far from easy. It often requires substantial knowledge and experience in programming and electronics, creating a barrier for new or infrequent users and often leading to frustration. These skills also require a very logical problem solving headspace that can hinder thinking creatively about the design on a higher level. This barrier is unfortunate, as being able to properly use these tools could be very valuable to designers. This graduation project aims to design a tool to help designers make and program these kinds of prototypes more easily, quickly and fluently. Analysis After an analysis of the different prototyping platforms and programming languages available, the Arduino platform in combination with the official Arduino language was chosen as the focus for this project. A literature study on the difficulties of novices in learning to program was done, from which it was found that the most problematic part of programming for novices is structuring the program, rather than issues on the level of individual lines. From interviews with design students it was furthermore found that they have trouble adapting their program once it is written. At this point, it was also decided that it was essential for the solution to be compatible with the wealth of resources available in the Arduino community and for it not to lock users in, i.e. that the experience they gain while using it can also be used outside of the system. Exploration A tool from software engineering, the state machine, was explored and selected as a basis for the high-level structuring of the program. Using state machines and their visual representation the state transition diagram, has several advantages: they are relatively easily to learn and understand; they give a visual overview of the program, which can also be used to discuss within a design team; they provide high-level structuring that then allows the user to fill-in the separate low-level parts; they make changing the program easier; and code can be easily reused. Based on an analysis of the actual code of several designers’ finished programs, a three part approach was chosen as most appropriate for writing these: to use state machines for high-level program structuring; to provide a library of ways to achieve common functionality, called patterns, for common operations; and to rely on libraries and sample code available online for sensor and actuator code. A preliminary exploration with this approach was done by means of a paper booklet providing a step by step approach to writing a program, which included a state machine step. From tests with designers using this booklet, several problems were identified in using state machines: there is a lack of direct feedback on their diagram, which would allow them to quickly learn from mistakes and rid themselves of misconceptions; state machine operation is invisible in a normal program, potentially obscuring mistakes that are present; and they lack information about details from the eventual code that prevent them from determining how to set up the state transition diagram. Core Design A desktop application was designed with a fully working prototype, called Machino. It revolves around making an Arduino program using a state machine and seeing the state machine in action as the program is running on the Arduino. The user draws a state transition diagram and Machino then instantly generates the code for it with places where the user can implement the lower-level functionality. Highlighting provides the feedback on how the state machine is running. This helps the designer in gaining an accurate understanding of how the state machine operates. Machino helps with the structuring but leaves the code for the lower-level functionality to the user. This frees it from having to provide support for specific sensor or actuators, instead leveraging the Arduino community resources abundantly available. This design was evaluated by means of a user test. It was found that the programming pattern they needed to use posed the most difficulty and consumed the most time, due to its conceptual difficulty and non-modularity. Another important finding was that the correspondence between the diagram and the code was insufficiently clear. Final Design Based on the findings a second, for this project final, iteration was made on the design of Machino. This iteration introduced a preliminary design for a pattern library, an extension to the state machine to make it more modular, and several additional forms of highlighting to strengthen the connection between the diagram and the code. Properly designing the patterns for the pattern library is beyond the scope of this project, but a limited set were made as an initial exploration into this direction. This final design was evaluated by means of another, slightly more comprehensive user test. This test also aimed to provide some validation for using state machines in this context, independently from the Machino implementation. It was found that when properly understood state machines can indeed be a helpful tool for designers to structure their program and their thinking. Several difficulties in using the patterns provided some early guidelines for an eventual proper design of such a system. The added highlighting was largely clear and effective. Conclusion Machino presents a significant step in the right direction in terms of the original assignment. It can help designers to create and adapt their interactive prototypes more easily, quickly and fluently. This allows them to do more themselves and to adapt and refine their concept more. And hopefully, it can encourage more designers to work with these tools and unlock their full potential.","programming; electronics; prototyping; Arduino; app","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Van den Dobbelsteen, A.A.J.F. (mentor); Schipper, H.R. (mentor)","2013","To counter the effects of carbon dioxide emissions and to become less dependent on energy imports, the electrical energy production in Europe is likely to make a significant shift towards renewable energy sources in the coming years. One of the major challenges in this transition process is to match the unpredictable and fluctuating supply of renewable energies, like wind and PV, with the demand. The solution to this problem comprises demand control (smart grids) and storage systems. The Highrise Energy Storage Core (HESC) is a gravitational potential energy system that stores electrical energy inside a tall building by lifting a large mass inside the concrete core of a tall building. The mass is raised by pumping water with high pressure underneath the piston when there is an energy surplus. During an energy shortage, the mass is lowered and energy is recovered with a turbine. By activating the mass, the system can also be used as a thermal buffer and the water inside the system can be used to extinguish a fire instead of extracting water from nearby surface water, storage tanks, or the mains. This study elaborates upon the need for storage in an electrical grid with a significant share of renewables and the idea of storing energy inside the core of a tall building. Several options that use the height of the building have been looked at. A set of commonly used storage solutions has been examined and compared with the HESC. In order to investigate the economical and technical feasibility, the system has been applied to an 80 meter tall reference building and to a second 160 meter tall building. The most important components have been dimensioned and the round-trip efficiency for the tall and very tall building have been calculated. Placing a storage system in the electrical grid enables a profound integration of renewable energies. Placing such systems near the end users has many advantages for the stability of the grid and the losses that occur in the grid. The power capacity in relation to the energy capacity makes the HESC solution particularly suitable for levelling out the daily supply and demand fluctuations. Energy generated during the day can be used during the evening and overproduction at night can be used to level out peak demands in the morning. Calculations show that the technical and economical feasibility of the HESC storage system increases with the height of the building. The round-trip efficiency of the 80 meter tall building is 69% and the efficiency of the 160m tall building is 74%. The economic calculations show that the energy density of the system needs to be maximized by optimizing the height of the piston since the floor space costs turned out to be an important parameter in the overall costs calculation. The thermal capacity of the building mass increases by 150%, but further research is needed to investigate the best options for using using this buffer capacity. The HESC is a multi-functional storage system for tall to very tall buildings that is able to compete on price and efficiency with currently applied single use storage systems.","electrical energy storage; highrise; renewables; concrete core; thermal energy storage; gravitational potential energy storage; smart grid; Francis turbine; pumps","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Building Engineering/Structural Design","",""

To prevent the city from this flooding, MARD set up plan 1547. The main idea of the plan is to build a ring dike around HCMC in combination with several movable tidal barriers. One of these barriers is the Muong Chuoi Barrier. In this report a conceptual design of the Muong Chuoi Barrier is made. The structure consists of a movable tidal barrier and a navigation lock, both able to bear the water in both directions. The navigation lock provides a possibility of vessels passing when the barrier is closed. In the preliminary research information is gained about the location properties, the soil conditions, the hydraulic conditions and the shipping class, which results in a basis of design. An analysis of diffrent gate and foundation types give a number of possible alternatives. Vietnamese unit prices are investigated and used to make a proper cost estimation of the different alternatives. The most important requirements from the basis of design are: the normative high water level, the water discharge of the Muong Chuoi river, the shipping class, the number of vessels passing every day and minimum life span of the structure. After a selection between all the possible solutions, that follow from the preliminary research, four alternatives are worked out, which are a combination between two gate types, a lifting gate and a radial gate, and two foundation types, a caisson foundation and foundation with combi wall and underwater concrete. By means of structural calculations, the quantities of the materials used are determined. Based on these results and the unit prices from the preliminary research, a cost estimation of every alternative is made. In the multi criteria analysis for the barrier, the most important factor are the costs, its weighing factor is 50%. Other criteria are: maintenance, constructability, usability and environmental impact. After the multi criteria analysis, the best alternative is alternative D, the radial gate in combination the combi wall foundation. The study of alternatives for the navigation lock focuses only on the lock head. Again a selection is made between the possible solutions that follow from the preliminary research. Four types are selected for the multi criteria analysis: mitre gates, single leaf gates, lifting gates and rolling or sliding gates. One of the most important criteria for the navigation lock are cost (35%). Also the usability (35%) is considered to be important, in particular the locking cycle and reliability. After the multi criteria analysis, the best alternative is the single leave gate. A conceptual design for the lock is created. The inner dimensions of the lock chamber are determined, the structural elements are designed and an structural calculation of the single leave gate is made.","Vietnam; Ho Chi Minh City; tidal barrier; codes","en","student report","TU Delft, department Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering and Structural Engineering","","","",""

The search for this growth strategy was structured using the three growth directions of Ansoff (1957): product development, market development and diversification. In three steps the best direction was defined. First a situational analysis was done, identifying strengths and weaknesses. Then an external analysis was conducted to identify the most important opportunities and threats. In a synthesis the data from these analyses was combined, resulting in the selection of the ‘product development’ growth strategy as most favourable. To implement this strategy, the new ‘product’ was designed: an innovative healthcare fund, focusing on seed funding with an active investment approach. This fund, called HealthStars, is unique because of its business creation structure: from idea to start-up governed by an innovation model. This model structures and seeds the discovery of opportunities, the selection of the best ideas, the development of business plans and provides the possibility to test an idea in the market (proof of concept). Start-ups that successfully test their product in the market can pitch for further investments and become portfolio companies of the fund. The most important stakeholders for the fund are the investors, the initiators (that initiate projects to turn an idea into a start-up) and eventually also the portfolio companies. To position the fund, some core brand elements were identified: a strict governance structure, an active investment approach, a strong network in healthcare and a focus on seed funding. Next to this, a few specific brand elements were formulated to increase the brand appeal of the new fund under the most important stakeholders: branding of the reputation, the services, the portfolio, the track record and the management. This project is concluded with three potential scenarios that point out that the fund size should be around  15 Million; this makes it large enough to seed, do initial investments and reinvestments, but also have a high chance of succeeding with a good return.","venture capital; healthcare; financial product; service design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

This study aims to produce an estimate of the magnitude of the sediment supply and the sea level fluctuations at the time when the Panther Tongue delta was formed. First, two delta sections and a beach ridges section were constructed by interpreting and correlating available logs, using the Manti geological map (Witkind et al., 1987) and geological interpretations from Hwang & Heller (2002) and Hampson et al.

Forward simulations with different sea level and sediment supply scenarios were run in order to determine a model that best fits the constructed delta and beach ridges sections. The input variables of the best matching simulation are the following. The relative sea level falls 28 meters over 80 000 years. The sea level decreases 4 meters over the first 40 000 years and 24 meters over the next 40 000 years. The average bed sediment load supply is 0,03 m3/s.

(mentor); Hartmann, L. (mentor); Van Wijk, A. (mentor); Verhoef, L. (mentor)","2013","Vehicle to Grid (V2G) has been proposed as an alternative way to cope with the electricity demands of the future by integrating the electric and transportation system infrastructures. In this way, the vehicle fleet will be used as a mobile storage system, enabling a higher penetration level for renewable energy sources. As an example, with the current personal transportation fleet of Europe, 2,390 GW of electric capacity could be fed into the grid. Currently, V2G is in the Research and Development stage and several institutions around the world are testing its capabilities in pilot projects. The Car as Power Plant (CaPP) concept emerged as one of the projects from The Green Village, which is an initiative of Delft University of Technology. Similar to the V2G technology, the Car as Power Plant's main aim is to deliver electricity to the grid. However, there are significant differences among them. In the case of the CaPP it uses Fuel Cell Vehicles to generate not only electricity but also water and heat. Therefore, the CaPP concept can be considered as a small multi-product power plant. There are additional elements that make the CaPP concept not only a way to deliver electricity to the grid, but a whole paradigm shift by using our cars to replace the electric system. The focus of this report is precisely in this technological concept. In the past, the studies about the CaPP concept have concentrated mainly on the technical feasibility and economic estimations of the project. One of the studies examined the technological gaps and opportunities for the CaPP, while the other assessed the ancillary services delivered to the grid by the Fuel Cell vehicles. Nevertheless, the technology evolves and emerges into society as a technological system due to the alignment of several socio-technical factors. Some of these include user practices, market conditions, consumer perceptions or a merely functional basis. For this reason, it is relevant to go one step further and not only understand the technical conditions of the system, but also the perceived benefits and concerns by the potential users. On this way it would be possible to incorporate into the Research and Development stage some elements that could be of interest for society, to ease the adoption of the technology in the future. The objective of this study is to bridge the gap between the technology development and the society's perception by assessing the vehicle technology acceptance and its implications for the business model design in the Netherlands. A model extended from the Car Technology Acceptance Model is proposed to conduct the study. This model is formed by eight independent, three moderating and one dependant variables. To have a better impression about the user's context, mixed research methods are employed. The application is done by individual in-depth structured interviews as the preferred data collection method with a reduced amount of participants. The sample comprises 20 participants, classified in 3 groups: 1) Students that do not own a car, 2) Professionals who own an internal combustion based car, and 3) Persons who own and electric based cars. From the total participants, 7 are students, 8 are gasoline car owners, and 5 are electric car drivers. Considering two different measurements instruments are used, the data analysis follows the same structure. The quantitative instrument uses descriptive statistics and then a correlation analysis using the SPSS software. The qualitative data is analysed using content analysis by grouping information together into category clusters and then comparing it with the group of participants. The results show the technology acceptance levels about the CaPP concept are in general above average, this is true in both the quantitative and qualitative sections. The most relevant factors to foster the technology adoption are grouped in 6 categories: price, incentives, information access, infrastructure, technology and values. The perceived benefits are classified in two categories: for the user and for society. The benefits for the user include: monetary incentives, guilt reduction, and increase in consumer power. The benefits for society are: environmental benefits, integration of services, and reducing the variation from renewable sources. The concerns are classified in two: car technology and the system. The concerns identified about car technology are: dangers of using hydrogen, degradation of the Fuel Cell, and lack of flexibility when the car is plugged-in. On the system side the concerns are: the lack of infrastructure, long distances from CaPP facilities to the final destination, and the risks involved in decentralizing the power generation. The semi-lease is determined to be the best business model structure to adopt the CaPP as it transfers the associated risks from the users to the provider and keeps the customer as the proprietary of the vehicle. Some of the policy recommendations to develop the niche include: continue funding the Fuel Cells R&D related activities, define an annual amount of energy that should be delivered to the grid with the CaPP technology, incentivize an open innovation scheme where different industry, governmental and academia actors come together under a joint venture to develop the technology, unify the development of the communication standards being used in the V2G projects around the world as they may influence the ones to be adopted in the future for the CaPP.","technology acceptance; car as power plant; business model design; strategic niche management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Technology, Strategy and Entrepreneurship","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor); Vlaar, M. (mentor)","2013","Stroke is a serious global health care problem for which rehabilitation is the main mode of therapy. Studying human corticomuscular communication with a measure that can reveal causality in a system with sensory and motor pathways has the potential to lead to an optimal, patient-tailored rehabilitation strategy. The goal of this study was to identify and solve potential problems in the use of (renormalized) partial directed coherence (PDC and rPDC) in corticomuscular coupling research. Simulations showed that A) an overestimation of the multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) model order p increases the effectiveness of PDC and rPDC, if a sufficiently high ratio ? between the number of samples and MVAR parameters is maintained. B) A difference in signal-to-measurement-noise ratio (SNR) between the channels i and j of a bivariate time series will only allow the comparison of PDCi ?j(f) to PDCj?i(f) at frequency f if both SNRs ?10dB. The same holds for rPDC. C) When using short segments of data, PDC and rPDC can be determined more accurately by averaging the covariance matrix R ?(?) of the time series at lag ? over segments than by averaging the MVAR parameters. We furthermore provide a way to obtain the analytical confidence limits of PDC and rPDC from segmented data. Finally, we show that PDC and rPDC can be correctly determined in real, segmented electroencephalography-electromyography (EEG-EMG) data using an order p several times higher than indicated by Akaike's Information Criterion or Schwarz's Bayesian Criterion.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-09-13","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

(mentor); Dunning, A.G. (mentor)","2013","Ultra-compact is a valuable property in designs of assistive devices for people with Duchenne Muscle Dystrophy. Reducing the size of these medical devices will increase the cosmetic appearance. Current devices are large and stigmatizing in the eyes of the users. In other words, the users want a device to be small enough to be worn underneath the clothes, so it becomes unnoticeable. Additionally, they want the device to adjust the amount of assistance to the progression of their disease. The goals of this study are (1) to design an elbow joint for an unnoticeable eating assistive device meeting the growing demands of the users and (2) to evaluate this design based on performance indicators. In order to reach these goals, two evolving fields of study are brought together that have great potential to reduce the size of exoskeletons: smart materials and compliant rotational joints. This study presents the design of an ultra-compact actuated rotational joint that can be used in an eating assistive device. An antagonistic actuator is made from shape memory alloy muscle wires. It is able to carry an external load and to actuate to move to different positions. A compliant rotational joint is optimised to balance the weight of the arm. In addition, it is used to auto-align with the elbow joint. The device supports the user passively at an early stage of the disease. The passive support is increased as the disease progresses by increasing the amount of stacked leaf springs. When the muscles have deteriorated too much for full passive support, the antagonistic SMA actuator is added for active support. The device generates a stall torque of 7.22 10^3 Nm/m^3 and produces a work density of $7.70 10^3 J/m^3 based on isolating volumes and the efficiency of the whole system is 3.9 %.","arm support; exoskeleton; shape memory alloy; compliant rotational joint; actuator; performance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-09-27","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

It is a renewable energy source with limited air emissions and it can provide reliable base-load power. Since 2007 eight installations were built and more than hundred exploration permits were approved by the Dutch authorities. Many energy firms are looking for new business opportunities and might also see the potential of the geothermal industry. However, the geothermal industry is a nascent market in an early stage of formation. It is not clear which activities are present in the geothermal industry and what investment options are available for energy firms. This research addresses these issues. Should energy firms invest in the geothermal industry and if so, what strategic investment options are available and which should they choose? This research connects practice—the geothermal industry, which is still immature, very cooperative and under development—with the theoretical concepts from transactions cost theory, the resource-based view and resource dependence theory. A strategic investment framework is developed to support firms during their decision-making process. It is concluded that resources are especially important in competitive markets, in which TAQA is currently active, while resource dependence is important when firms do not directly compete, which is the case in the geothermal industry. Transaction cost theory might be important in mature markets and did not prove to be of high value for the geothermal industry or for TAQA. The framework includes criteria resulting from all three theories in order to support firms in assessing strategic investment options in the geothermal industry.","geothermal energy; transaction cost; resource dependence; resource-based view; strategic investment framework; strategic investment decision","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy & Industry","","SEPAM","",""

(mentor); van Bussel, G.J.W. (mentor)","2013","Thunderstorm gusts can be severe and inflict major damage to high buildings such as wind turbines. These gusts are caused by the downburst emanating from the thunderstorm cloud. In this research, thunderstorms are modelled for wind turbine design. The results of this study might help make the design of wind turbines thunderstorm-proof. Not only the shape of thunderstorm gust, but also its strength needs to be researched for this purpose. To model thunderstorms, an existing model from literature on thunderstorm was chosen. This model was then created as a vector field and stored in a four dimensional array. The four dimensions of this array represent the 3 different wind speed directions and time. With industrial simulation software for the industry, Bladed, it was now used to simulate loads on a pre-selected wind turbine. Thunderstorm gusts characteristically have high wind speeds at low altitudes. Therefore blade tip tower clearance of the wind turbine during a thunderstorm gust was chosen for investigation. Since the higher wind speeds at low altitudes will cause the blade to bend more towards the tower. The second focus of research was the strength of the thunderstorm gusts. The aim of this part of the research was to calculate a 50 year maximum load estimate. For this purpose, measured data was collected on the maximum wind speeds occurring at thunderstorms. Also information was gathered on the number of occurrences of thunderstorms. Finally, high frequency wind speed measurements were also used to calculate loads on the wind turbine. Because not enough high frequency data was available, gusts were generated according to the theoretical model and were used to calculate loads. Multiplying the found probability distributions for wind speeds and turbine loads lead to a 50 year maximum turbine load estimate. The results of these researches led to the following conclusions. An increase of up to 27% in blade tip deflections was found for thunderstorm models compared to normal shear wind loading. Whereas the decrease of blade tip tower clearance was even up to 42%. The 50 year load estimate for the tower root moment due to thunderstorms is found to be 250 MNm. Further research into thunderstorms is necessary to create better insight into these complex systems. Then, a better model might be made. Gathering a dataset which is both accurate and large enough can lead to significant increase of reliability of this research. Furthermore, this research did not take yaw effects or the effects of a moving storm centre into account. For more representative results, more complex models can be made taking into account much more of these factors.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Bouwman, W.A.G.A. (mentor)","2013","Wealth, prosperity and sustainable economic growth for future generations are topics which today’s policy makers and society have to deal with on an everyday basis. Radical technologies, disrupting incumbent technological and societal regimes play an important role in realizing these advances. Entrepreneurial innovation has been identified as the main vehicle in bringing these technologies to the market. Entrepreneurs in start-ups do so by searching for repeatable and scalable business models in markets with high growth potential and under extreme uncertainty. However, the complex environment of a start-up confronts them with a wide variety of challenges which they have to overcome by choosing suitable strategic activities in order to be successful. The entrepreneurs are the decision makers who select these strategic activities dependent on how they perceive this environment which is ever-changing over the life-cycle of the start-up. The decisions of the entrepreneur directly influence the performance of the new venture and lead to path dependencies in its further development. The exploratory research conducted in this thesis aims to draw a picture of this environment – the context of a start-up. It investigates what the context of high-technology and particularly clean-technology start-ups looks like, what challenges entrepreneurs in these start-ups face and perceive and whether or not these challenges are similar across different sectors and kinds of start-ups. Understanding and identifying critical shared perceptions of challenges in different start-ups makes it easier for policy makers and incubators to provide suitable support measures to entrepreneurs in order to make their start-ups more successful and contribute to a sustainable future. Two research questions are the focus of the thesis: Q1: What are common challenges that entrepreneurs in high-technology and clean-technology start-ups face? Q2: Is there a difference in perception and prioritization of challenges between entrepreneurs in different high-technology start-ups and specifically clean-technology start-ups? By employing Q-methodology, the research conducted in this thesis reveals shared viewpoints of 30 Dutch high-technology and clean-technology entrepreneurs on how they perceive certain challenges. 43 statements describing challenges of technology start-ups were derived from literature and exploratory interviews. The respondents were asked to rank these statements according to their subjective opinions and personal perceptions, resulting in a holistic picture of how their context moderates the challenges they face and the decisions they take. Two common challenges entrepreneurs in all start-ups shared were identified: ‘High pressure from incumbent industry‘ makes it important for start-ups to carefully choose a market niche in which they can communicate their value proposition with the biggest effect. ‘Long sales cycles’ lead to problems in cash-flow as access to working capital is limited. Additionally, clean-technology start-ups were often found to suffer from a dependence on commodity prices and regulatory frameworks. Contextual elements influencing challenge perceptions were observed to be more complex than only on an industry level. Thus, no significant differences in challenge perception and prioritization were found between entrepreneurs in hardware, software and service start-ups. However, four distinct profiles, describing shared viewpoints of entrepreneurs in four groups of start-ups emerged. Profile one, ‘clean technology behemoths’ describes entrepreneurs in start-ups relying on complex clean-technologies. They successfully developed a minimal viable product, sold it to launching customers in a strategically chosen niche and are currently aiming to enter mainstream markets. Their main challenge is to scale up their capacities in a sustainable way and they need capital to do so. Entrepreneurs in start-ups associated with profile two, ‘raw diamonds’ were identified to being in a phase in which they iterate between product development and analyzing market feedback. This group of young entrepreneurs is, even though inexperienced, well aware of their lack of commercial skills and market knowledge. They acknowledge that they need to acquire this knowledge before being able to move forward. Profile three, ‘innovators eager to grow’ describes young entrepreneurs in start-ups which rapidly developed a first minimal viable product and now aim to grow aggressively. However, by focusing too much on entering the market, they overlook an offset between actual market needs and their value propositions which hampers their diffusion and ability to expand. Entrepreneurs in start-ups associated with profile four, start-ups ‘in the valley of death’ did not acknowledge the need to adapt their value proposition to their customers’ needs by constantly asking for and implementing market feedback. A lack of communication with the market place leads to long product development cycles and a lack of launching customers, manifested in perceived difficulties to convince investors and to raise funding. The results found in this thesis contribute to academia by acknowledging the thus far commonly neglected link between process and environment and go one step further towards the contextualisation of entrepreneurship. It was found that not only perceived challenges lead to the choice of certain strategic activities but also previously chosen activities might introduce new challenges by influencing the context of the firm. The four identified profiles describe start-ups on different levels of maturity and showcase that decisions on strategic activities the entrepreneurs took in the past are linked to their present position and induce path dependencies. The findings of this exploratory research provide a base for further research. By identifying specific challenges and shortcomings entrepreneurs in high-technology and clean-technology start-ups face, a foundation is laid from which causal relations between perceived and actual challenges and specific strategic activities can be investigated in the future. Moreover, the observed path dependencies in entrepreneurial decision making represent a new perspective on strategic decision making theory and a basis for further research. The findings also allow for practical application and give implications on how to overcome the identified challenges. Policy makers are able to tackle challenges like funding gaps or coherence of innovation networks and practice transition management on a policy level. Incubators are able to analyze their start-ups following the identified characteristics and provide suitable support measures. Entrepreneurs are able to critically assess their current situation to prevent misinterpretation of challenges and missing out on valuable opportunities.","start-up; entrepreneurship; strategy; high-tech; clean-tech","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Innovation Management & Entrepreneurship","","Management of Technology","",""
