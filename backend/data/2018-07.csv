Since these structures are placed offshore, they must be able to withstand all kinds of loads. It is essential that the eigenfrequencies of the support structure do not correspond to the passing frequencies of the blades and any other dynamic actions. To avoid this the natural frequencies of the structure should be estimated during the design and the objective of this MSc study is the development of an easy to use finite element model to perform the modal analysis of an offshore wind support structure. It was built based on relevant inputs, defining the possible design of the lattice structure. Based on these parameters, the model can be adjusted and a high number of designs can be tested easily. <br/>The model is built in Matlab and consists of several modules, each one representing a different part of the design. The user has access to a main script to enter all necessary inputs. Then the program starts and a second function takes over. This second function is divided into five parts. The first, the definition of the geometry, creates the nodes and elements composing the structure. The second part concerns the creation of matrices characterizing the model. Each element is associated with two matrices: a local element mass matrix and a local element stiffness matrix. Each is computed in a local frame of reference, then rotated and assembled into two global matrices, representing the complete structure. Then, the equivalent stiffness characterizing the soil-piles interaction is calculated in the third part. Depending on the pile size and the soil properties, the equivalent stiffness is determined. Once the matrices completely describe the model, eigenvalues and mode shapes are calculated in the fourth part. The fifth part of the function is the plotting of the structure.<br/>The functionalities of the Matlab tool have been validated and thoroughly checked. Firstly, by comparing the analytical and numerical results of a simplified structure (a clamped beam), and secondly using a complete structural model by comparing the outputs of the program with the outputs of the professional software “Bladed”. All key results are verified. From these verifications, it can be concluded that the characterizing matrices of the structure are correctly defined and that the model correctly represents the modal behaviour of a lattice structure. <br/>The tool is ready to be used for sensitivity studies to verify which parameters most affect the natural frequencies. The model can also be used as a pre-design tool to quickly obtain and test different scenarios for an offshore wind support structure. <br/>Nevertheless, the tool has some limitations such as the restricted number of possible designs/configurations, the assumption that the transition piece is a rigid body, the use of the p-y curves that can overestimate the stiffness of the soil, the non-linearity of the system that does not take into account the variation in time. Recommended future work may address these issues.","Finite Element modelling; Finite Element Analysis; Modal Analysis; Wind; bottom founded structure; jacket; MATLAB; natural frequency; modes; wind energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nowadays a low degree and a short period of disturbance is more and highly valued when it comes to construction methods. Cut-and-cover with compressed air differs from traditional construction methods in that during excavation and construction of the tunnel floor, compressed air is used to maintain horizontal and vertical equilibrium. Instead of working completely top-down, the tunnel is constructed beneath the tunnel roof in a train like motion, called the construction cycle consisting of (1) Groundwater control, (2) Excavation and (3) Construction tunnel floor. The feasibility of the cut-and-cover with compressed air construction method depends on the construction schedule, a faster construction schedule will increase the feasibility. Wet excavation with this construction method is not desirable. To achieve a fast construction schedule, dry excavation is vital. This research focuses on the groundwater control methods that are feasible to apply for the construction of cut-and-cover tunnels with compressed air to ensure dry excavation. The feasibility of a groundwater control method depends on the period necessary for groundwater control and the deformations induced by the groundwater control method itself. Important soil parameters influencing the result of groundwater control are the resistance of the soil and the corresponding Soil-Water Characteristic Curve. The application of compressed air will lead to an increase in the water volume released from the soil, due to a shift in the Soil-Water Characteristic Curve. Compressed air as an exclusion method is not a feasible groundwater control method in low permeable soils. The groundwater control period with compressed air is higher than the resistance of the soil deposits. The resistance value of low permeable soils are often significantly higher than the construction cycle schedule. Suitable groundwater control methods studied in this research are compressed air with vertical drains, vertical dewatering, horizontal dewatering and combinations of dewatering with compressed air. For the case study groundwater control methods are analyzed. The groundwater flow calculations are performed with a coupled SEEP/W and AIR/W calculation to determine the groundwater control period. The deformation analysis is performed with Plaxis 2D. Groundwater control with compressed air with vertical drains has the most effect on the volume of water discharged during the 12 days groundwater control period. With the study is determined that in between 33% and 43% of the required volume for dry excavation is removed in 12 days. The resistance value becomes less important with a decrease in center-to-center distance of the vertical drains. Deformations that occur during the groundwater control period do not have an influence on the total deformation during the final stage of construction. It is recommended to perform a field test to generate data that can lead can lead to more knowledge and therefore a more feasible construction method.","Cut-and-Cover; Groundwater control; Compressed air; Exclusion method; Vertical drains","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-07-31","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","",""

(mentor); van Rooij, Michel (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","New generation combat aircraft are expected to operate over extended flight envelopes, including flight at high flow angles and rapid maneuvers. Conditions beyond traditional limits are giving rise to nonlinear phenomena, such as flow separation, large scale energetic vortices, fluctuations etc. These phenomena have significant impact on aircraft performance and if not resolved accurately design uncertainties are increased risking lack of performance or even costly redesigns. Thus, accurate modelling of unsteady nonlinear aerodynamics is essential for modern and future combat aircraft.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, conventional modelling tools either lack the required fidelity or they are too expensive. Traditional, highly-efficient approaches are not suitable for modelling nonlinear flow phenomena. Concurrently, high fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are computationally demanding and therefore impractical in many cases. To enhance aircraft design, it is desirable to obtain models joining the best of these two worlds. A common approach is to distill high fidelity methods into Reduced-Order Models (ROMs) that can accurately approximate unsteady aerodynamics at orders of magnitudes lower costs than CFD. Relevant literature offers many different ROM techniques for varying purposes. Nonetheless, constructing such models is still challenging and currently there is no generally agreed method. <br/><br/>In the current thesis a ROM technique that may be applicable to wider ranges of problems and simpler to construct is sought. The objective is to obtain a model that can promote aircraft control design, performance assessment and structural analysis throughout dynamic maneuvers over complete flight envelopes. The thesis proposes a novel approach utilizing modern, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The devised model consists of three main components. First it incorporates a geometry description constituted by coordinates of an aircraft CFD surface grid. Second, a primary encoding-decoding CNN predicts pressure distribution at the grid points of the geometry. The final and third part of the model is an auxiliary encoding CNN deriving integral aerodynamic loads corresponding to the pressure field predictions of the primary network. The model evaluates and produces instantaneous values. Given a maneuver, it proceeds in timesteps. The predictions of the separate instances are computed directly without the need of subiterations (as it would be the case for CFD simulations).<br/><br/>As a proof of concept, the model is applied to symmetric motions in the vertical plane at fixed Mach number and altitude. The subject of the investigations is the MULDICON configuration of the 251 th Science and Technology Organization work-group of NATO. To fully exploit the advantages of reduced-order modelling, flow characteristics are inferred from a single excitation following an efficient system identification technique using Schroeder sweeps as input signals. The performance of the model is assessed by numerous test cases performed in CFD. First, steady conditions of varying incidence angles are investigated. Second, harmonic pitch and plunge oscillations around different angles of attack at different amplitudes and frequencies are considered. Third, additional test cases of a linear pitch up-down -- and a climbing maneuver are studied.<br/><br/>Considering computational efficiency, the results show robust model performance. GPU-accelerated CNN calculations are conducted roughly 5000 times faster than CFD simulations. The primary network can accurately resolve the pressure distributions over large portions of the geometry. Lower surface predictions are very accurate. However, among certain conditions discrepancies are observable on the upper surface towards the wingtips. Still, the secondary network can predict corresponding aerodynamic forces accurately. In contrast, its moment predictions are sensitive to errors in pressure distributions. Consequently, moment predictions can largely deviate from reference data, especially when nonlinear phenomena are prominent. However, in many cases errors are attributed to insufficient regressor space coverage, i.e.\ certain input combinations are explored poorly by the Schroeder sweeps. Reconsidering system identification practices might mitigate those issues. Nevertheless, the thesis proves the applicability of deep CNNs to the problems at hand. Additionally, the results encourage further investigations.","Reduced order model; Surrogate modelling; Convolutional Neural Networks; unsteady flow effects; CFD","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Flight Performance and Propulsion","",""

Different research institutions and companies recognize this potential and have set up printers to further investigate and develop the technique all over the world. Some pioneering projects showcase the state of the art by producing full scale structures, but otherwise printing of concrete is done mostly in a research lab. In an effort to find whether 3DCP is ready for the current market of the building industry, this thesis performs a viability analysis on the production of façade panels by 3DCP. This research is performed for the University of Technology Delft and Movares Nederland B.V. using the concrete printer from Bruil.<br/>The origins of 3DCP are defined by the development of Additive Manufacturing (AM) in other materials (plastics) as well as the demand for freeform concrete production. Both fields are examined to help understand from where the technique is derived and what its goal and potentials are. Next to the initiators, some of the more advanced researches on the topic are disclosed in order to define the current level of capability of concrete printing.<br/>As this research focusses on testing the viability of 3DCP as production technique for structural verified elements, a case study is performed. Façade design is chosen as the design scope in order to consider the potential benefit of freeform design as well as integration of functions, which are both prominent in a building enclosure. Through analysis of façade designs, typologies and performance requirements, a concept design of a perforated façade panel is defined. Over the course of the case study the fabrication technique and the engineering model influence the design of the panel, and this design process is analyzed for the disciplines of design, engineering and fabrication. The façade panel is designed parametrically to allow façade patterns to be created by customized elements on mass-production scale (mass-customization). This sets the requirement for the engineering models to also be parameterized, for this a software strategy is defined.<br/>Specimen are printed and tested to define material properties of printed concrete and analyze the effect of the additive manufacturing method on the strength and concrete development. Additionally, different forms of reinforcement are implemented in the 3DCP production process and tested on fabrication and structural aspects. Finally, the case study element is produced and load-tested to conclude the research on the feasibility of fabricating and engineering a façade panel by 3DCP. This thesis proves that the technique can produce elements from which the structural behavior (load bearing capacity and failure behavior) can be safely predicted.","3D Concrete Printing; Additive Manufacturing; Digital Fabrication; Facade Design; Product Development; Feasibility Study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-09-01","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

Often a coalition partner participates for a certain period of time and other nations or instances might want to join the coalition in a later stage, resulting in a dynamic environment. In practice the members in these coalitions are dissimilar with regards to their disposition, requiring the coalition to be set up in a decentralised manner. In order to facilitate such an environment, a secure decentralised network should be in place that enables decision making, access control to shared information and the ability to join and leave in an appropriate way. To enable the coalition to put its signature on important decisions and to be able to provide certified public keys to enable access control, the network should include a signature scheme. A challenge for such a signature scheme is that it should not be able for previous compositions of the coalition to create valid signatures. In other words, Backlogging should be prevented in the system. Van der Lubbe et al. introduced a distributed (n,n) signature scheme for dynamic coalitions based on the distributed El Gamal signature scheme of Park et al., which can be expanded to a (n+1,n+1) signature scheme. The scheme prevents backlogging by the use of two Oblivious Third Parties. Van Elsas et al. then improved this signature scheme by enabling the signature scheme to be reduced to a (n-1,n-1) signature scheme and by replacing the Oblivious Third Parties by One-Way Accumulators, dismissing the need for Third Parties in general. Additionally, the currently popular Blockchain model has the capability to perform as a ledger. The ledger characteristics, specifically the chain of blocks, the Merkle Tree model and a consensus mechanism, can replace the functionality that prevents backlogging. <br/><br/>In this thesis we present a Blockchain-based Signature Scheme for Dynamic Coalitions. The signature scheme is a distributed (n,n)-signature scheme, that is able to expand to a distributed (n+1,n+1)-signature scheme and is able to reduce to a distributed (n-1,n-1)-signature scheme. The signature scheme uses the Blockchain model to tackle Backlogging Problem. In addition, we provide an analysis of aspects of the signature scheme that could introduce problems when implementing it.","Blockchain; Dynamic Coalition; Signature Scheme; Proof-of-Consensus; Threshold Signature Scheme; Dynamic Coalition Environment; Dynamic Coalitions","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Software Technology","",""

(mentor); Lathouwers, D. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","In proton therapy, the calculation of the dose distribution is of great importance in order to find the best treatment plan. For a treatment plan with high quality, several error scenarios are investigated, in order to come up with a general plan that suits best in these scenarios. All of the scenarios have a different simulated error, e.g., in patient displacement and proton beam range. In order to cope with a large number of errors scenarios, a quick calculation method is needed. In this work, a method that used Reduced Order Modelling (ROM) and subsequently polynomial regression to overcome the computational problem is presented, as well as its results on a real head and neck cancer patient. Before error scenarios are simulated, using inverse optimisation a treatment plan is calculated for a perfectly known position and organ structure of the patient, i.e. the nominal scenario. Then, several error scenarios are simulated and for each of these scenarios, the real dose on tissue is calculated, using the treatment parameters that were previously set for the nominal scenario. The dose distributions of all these scenarios are stored in a matrix, on which a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is executed. A reduced order of singular values and vectors is used, together with regression models on the right singular vectors, to reconstruct the dose distribution matrix. This is done in order to create a computationally<br/>cheap method for dose distribution calculations. The right singular vectors are now a function of the used parameters: positioning errors dx, dy, dz and proton beam range error dρ. The dose distribution matrix is reconstructed from the left singular vectors, first few singular values and the function for the right singular vectors. Range errors with a uniform distribution with a maximum of 3% and positioning errors with a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 3 mm in each direction were simulated. For 100 error scenarios, the dose distribution matrix could be reconstructed with an average accepted error of 1% on a voxel relative to the maximum dose for 96:5% of the voxels, using a voxel-by-voxel comparison. These results were obtained for a 17th order of the SVD and a 7th order polynomial in the regression. On unseen test data, the acceptance was 81:0% of the voxels with an allowed error of 1%. For an allowed error of 3%, 92:5% of the voxels of this test set were accepted. These results are promising and encouraging for future research. First of all, it is recommended to examine the regression of the right singular vectors more closely, especially the regression of the higher order right singular vectors. Further subjects of interest would be to perform the same procedure that is done on the dose distribution matrix on the dose influence matrix. Also, harder-to-reach error scenarios,<br/>like organ movement and tumour deformation could be taken into account.

Wonder inc. believes that brands live in the mind of the consumer, at the intersection of what consumers want and what companies deliver. Their model shows different levels in which companies can provide value to consumers and believe that if on all levels value is delivered, a brand becomes an extraordinary brand. An extraordinary brand is a brand that has become the only choice for the consumer when it comes to achieving a certain aim or goal. During this thesis, a deep dive is executed and presented on how consumers perceive brands and how this fits within the model created by Wonder Inc.. Through literature, qualitative and quantitative research the model is elaborated, tested and improved. The result of the thesis is a deep understanding of how consumers perceive brands and how companies can use this understanding to create more value. This in-depth understanding of how consumers perceive brands resulted in the creation of a Brand Perception Blueprint. In this blueprint, companies can find how consumers perceive their brands and how this perception translates into their behaviour. Moreover, it provides an insight into how companies can best allocate their resources to not only improve the consumer’s perception but also influence their resulting behaviour.

This is due to the development of more robust system identification techniques as well as improvements with regard to the practicality of installing the necessary instrumentation. Health monitoring systems are more often replacing static deflection tests and detailed visual inspections, where continuous monitoring of vibration data aims for early damage detection.<br/><br/>This thesis can be summarized as the development of a structural health monitoring method for bridges. It forms a part of the Zwartewaterbrug project, related to the Zwartewater bridge located in the city of Hasselt, in the Dutch province of Overijssel. The Zwartewater bridge served as a case study for validation of the proposed early damage detection algorithm.<br/><br/>The wider purpose of this work was to address the problem of having a large number of bridges in Europe that are facing the end of their service life and should either be retrofitted or decommissioned.. The chosen approach consisted of a low-cost vibration monitoring method, that is suitable for continuous structural health monitoring.<br/><br/>The initial challenge was to introduce a small change to the structure, representative of early damage, without actually damaging the structure. For this an added mass approach was taken, where weights of respectively 25, 50, 75, and 100 kg were added below the bridge deck. The vibration data (accelerations) measured on the ”damaged” structure were then used to solve an inverse problem where the aim was to detect the induced damage without closing the bridge to traffic.<br/><br/>Since the data was gathered with only ambient excitation by wind and traffic, a new challenge arose, which is considered to be the core of this thesis. The structural differences between vibration measurements related to the ”healthy” and ”damaged” structure were concluded to be smaller than the structural changes due to the differences in unknown traffic loading. The traffic loads were namely varying from 200kg motorcycles to 50t trucks.<br/><br/>In this thesis, the method of Probabilistic Filtering was developed to face the aforementioned challenge. The method involves mainly a data pre-processing step, and the probabilistically filtered signals are subsequently processed with two output-only identification methods: Frequency Domain Decomposition and data-driven Stochastic Subspace Identification. The full process was integrated into an automatic analysis algorithm, performed in MatLab.<br/><br/>It was concluded that both detection and localization of the induced damage is possible with the proposed methodology. Further work was then performed to quantify the detected added mass in terms of structural damage. A quantitative finite element analysis was performed with the substructure approach (super-element, static boundary conditions to the substructure of interest). The given analysis concluded that the developed structural health monitoring method is able to detect anomalies comparable to a 35cm crack in the welds securing the longitudinal stiffeners to the transverse beams.<br/><br/>Finally, recommendations were made regarding an expansion of the method to structure service life predictions and more computationally efficient calculation set-ups.","Probabilistic Filtering; Structural Health Monitoring (SHM); Vibration-based monitoring; Zwartewaterbrug bridge","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Structural Engineering","The Zwartewaterbrug project",""

Cheap and easy access to meteorological information allows communities and individuals to better manage agricultural development, track localised extreme weather events, and expand knowledge of ground-true weather conditions for remote or hard to access locations.<br/>Nowadays, with the growth of modern technology and the rise of the Internet-of-Things, it has become possible to design a long range, low maintenance, affordable, continuously operating autonomous wireless weather station powered off-grid by renewable resources. This thesis explores the feasibility of such a self-supporting wireless station, and attempts to construct a prototype to support the findings. A multitude of solutions are discussed to tackle the different subsystems and their functions, culminating in a proposal for a weather station design. Low maintenance sensors are used to acquire weather data and LoRaWAN is used to send that data over long ranges with a low power draw. The station uses solar energy and li-ion batteries to sustain the system, which are scaled to prevent loss of power. A simple microcontroller unit manages the power and data flows of the system. Long term simulations of the design show the proposed system would be able to operate continuously throughout the year, while measuring every minute. The report also discusses the apparent strengths and shortcomings of the system, and suggests potential improvements that could help the system achieve a better long-term performance.","meteorology; LoRa; LoRaWAN; IoT; Autonomous; sensor network","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering","Bachelor Graduation Project",""

(mentor); Negenborn, R.R. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Background: Currently the Royal Netherlands Army (RNLA) has a traditional three echelon supply chain consisting of suppliers that deliver to a warehouse and the warehouse that delivers to customers. However, the RNLA is interested in having its stock geographically spread for safety reasons. A solution for this would be to re-design the supply chain into a decentralized stock distribution design. This means that instead of keeping the majority of the stock at a RNLA controlled storage facility, the stock will be stored at the suppliers location and delivered when required. Updating the current RNLA supply chain network towards a decentralized product storage network might lead to a better performing network, but the downsides in case of an emergency response sit- uation are still unclear. This lack of knowledge could severely jeopardize the safety of the Netherlands, it’s citizens and also the employees of the RNLA. This research aims to answer the following question:<br/>What RNLA supply chain design, with a focus on decentralized stock distribution, is the most effective in case of an RNLA emergency response situation?<br/>Methods: Based on a literature research, interviews and a flow chart analysis the RNLA specific situation has been studied and translated into an extended supply chain design. Using the method of mathematical programming a multi-period, multi-commodity, multi-objective model has been created that describes the flow between multiple sources and sinks. Penalties are used as cost function to differentiate between desirable and less desirable product flows. By turning on and off different new supply chain functional- ities such as cross-docking, direct supplier deliveries and pop-up cross-docks different supply chain designs can be experimented with. User service level and decentralized stock distribution are used as key performance indicators. Fuzzy numbers have been used to account for uncertainty of demand. By utilizing both single and multi-objective objectives a complete picture of a specific situation can be created.<br/>Results: Experimenting with different scenarios, which are combinations of supply chain setups and parameter settings, led to the classification of different supply chain designs based on the resulting objective values. Insight is created in decentralized prod- uct storage, early and late product flows and the maximum number of late days, based on the resulting product flows. It was noticed that the weighted-sum multi-objective method took less time to find the optimal solution, compared to the other methods. Conclusions and Recommendations: Using the supply chain classification, the best supply chain design can be chosen. Using the weighted-sum method, this can be done in an efficient manner. It is recommended to study additional key performance indicators such as the effect of costs. The effect of more advanced objective methods could lead to better results, especially the effect of penalty factors should be studied. Also, internal logistics and vehicle routing should be studied to improve the solutions. On top of that it is very important for the RNLA to accumulate the right kind and amount of data in order to be able to optimize their supply chain now and in the future.","Scenario based; Decentralised stock distribution; Emergency response; Royal Netherlands Army","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-07-30","","","","Marine Technology | Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

Most ships do have damage response procedures in place. In case of military ships these are well developed, where a well-trained crew, in the form of damage parties, is available to respond adequately. For non-navy ships, this is hardly possible, mostly due to crew restrictions. But even for navy vessels, underwater damage is hard to assess because of accessibility issues of flooded compartments. This is undesirable because it needs to be known which compartments have flooded in order to assess the situation with respect to residual buoyancy and stability. Based on the outcome, the officer in charge can decide whether to evacuate or to stay on board and control the situation. For establishing which compartments will flood the extent of the raking damage must be known. It is proposed that the accelerations (or rather, decelerations) measured on board during a grounding incident can be used to make a prediction of the extent of raking damage.<br/><br/>A three degree of freedom external dynamics calculation model for ship grounding has been made, which is used to predict the extent of bottom raking damage and the grounding force with associated decelerations of the ship in terms of surge, sway and yaw. When the ship decelerates, caused by a grounding event, these motions can be logged through continuous ship motion measurements. From these deceleration time traces it is possible to calculate the bottom damage path through a double integration with respect to time. Moreover, with these decelerations, the location of the raking damage along the ship’s bottom can be calculated as well. A straight forward method is proposed, which is validated against data on ship grounding external dynamics from earlier research and data from large-scale grounding experiments, both carried out in the nineties of the previous century.","raking damage; prediction from measured accelerations; ship grounding; grounding damage; three degrees of freedom external dynamics model; ship survival","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Improper terminations could result in overheating, partial discharges, eventual breakdown, flashover and breakdown in the system. There are several defects that can take place in terminations because of environmental, ageing and imperfections caused during manufacturing and installation . A potential defect is the contamination of oil with water due to sealing failures.<br/><br/>Water contamination can lead to partial discharges that, when produced over the insulation result in accelerated ageing. Typically, online electrical measurements of partial discharges can be used for termination monitoring. However, online monitoring suffers from noise and interferences, and localisation of partial discharges can be a problem. To overcome the challenges of electrical measurements, optical means of detecting partial discharge is researched in this thesis. The main goal of the thesis is to study the feasibility of using the optical PD detection method in oil-filled cable termination. The aim was to detect surface discharges at the rubber-oil interface through an optical sensor.<br/><br/>The identification of parameters for selection and final choice of optical sensor for PD detection application were done. Various setups to produce the surface discharge at the rubber-oil interface were investigated and one of the method was finalized. The simultaneous measurements of PD with electrical and optical sensors were conducted in dry oil and oil with different moisture content. The analysis of data obtained from optical sensor in comparison with electrical sensor based on sensitivity, PD pulse, PRPD pattern and correlation factor are discussed. It is noted that most of the characteristics of optical measurements is comparable to the electrical measurements. Thus, it can be said that this thesis contributes towards initial step of using the optical PD detection for online monitoring of HV components.","Optical; Partial Discharge; APD sensor; HFCT sensor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-07-27","","","","","",""

The simulation results would naturally depend on the size of the discrete time step, according to the order of accuracy of the implemented numerical scheme. For accurate analyses the required time steps might be needed to be very small, which then leads to very costly simulations, which are often times impractical in real-world simulation applications. Taking coarse-scale time-step sizes can reduce the computational costs, however, it results in lower simulation accuracy. Note that a common simulation practice is to take constant time-step everywhere in the computational domain. To resolve this challenge, this MSc thesis report presents a novel local time-stepping (LTS) method for multiphase flow in porous media. In this method, different time-steps can be applied in one computational domain; allowing for employing small time steps in sub-domains with higher sensitivity to the time step size and bigger time steps elsewhere. The LTS method is developed for all types of sequentially-coupled and fully-coupled simulation strategies. For all of these developments, the interfacial flux continuity is the key requirement to connect the sub-domains of different time zones. The fluxes chosen for the inner stages of the coarse time-step are consistent with the chosen simulation strategy. More precisely, in the case of the implicit-pressure-explicit-saturation (IMPES) method these fluxes are lagged in time (explicit), while for the sequential implicit and fully implicit (FIM) methods they are calculated at the current (implicit) time-step. For implicit transport method, the refined zone partition matrices are developed to algebraically form the refined zone Jacobian matrix and refined zone residual vector. The numerical results show that only a fraction of the domain can be simulated with small time steps; while the rest can be simulated at a bigger one. Local time-stepping method provides accurate simulation results compared with the fine-scale time-step simulation results for all three simulation strategies. Specially, the local time-stepping for FIM simulations, which is the mostly common commercial-grade simulation approach, can preserve the accuracy of the results and also the computational efficiency. For the studied cases, the computational efficiency gain of LTS for sequential implicit method is not as significant as that of the FIM. To exploit full adaptivity in simulation, as presented in Appendix B, one can directly apply the developed method of this thesis to adaptive implicit method (AIM); where sequential and fully implicit coupling approaches are applied in different sub-domains of the reservoir. Overall, LTS casts a promising approach to optimize accuracy-efficiency tradeoff when it comes to time step selection.","Local Time-Stepping; Flux Continuity; Fully Implicit Method; IMPES; Sequential Implicit","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

Originally to create weapons, jewellery and decorative ceramics. Nowadays as windows, reagent bottles and electronic devices. It’s only in the last two centuries that there has been substantial development of float glass. The resulting products provide comfort, protection, energy reduction, security and transparency. It is for this reason that glass in modern architecture grew very rapidly in the past decade. Glass panels increased in size and with that growth, the thickness of glass panels has increased from a modest 8 mm to a currently more regular thickness of 32 mm. On top of this, the required insulation values of glass constructions also increased. Future glass panels can include triple or more layers to provide for the required insulation, creating even heavier panels. At a time where we strive to make ever larger and heavier glass panels, shouldn’t we investigate new ways of pushing technological boundaries in order to save material rather than using more of it? <br/><br/>Where regular float glass is a rather thick, hard and brittle substance that can break easily when subjected to large stresses, thin glass can be found on the other side of the spectrum with its flexibility, clarity and higher strength. Thin glass has rarely been used for architectural applications, mainly because technologies for manufacturing thin glass in construction element sizes were not available or were often too expensive. This product however shows large potential provided sufficient interest is shown from different sectors to lower the price and stimulate innovation. This research will therefore focus on how to implement thin glass on a larger architectural scale and embrace its features to create thinner and stronger load-bearing glazing elements in areas where regular float glass doesn’t work. Several design configuration are proposed, of which the thin glass as cold bent laminated panels is the chosen principle to further explore. The main goal of this research is then to gain insight in the structural and post-breakage behaviour of cold bent laminated thin glass panels. Two layers of Leoflex glass from AGC are to be cold bent into a sinusoidal shape with Saflex DG41 provided by Qdel and SentryGlas provided by Trosifol as the interlayers. From the moment the panels are released from their mould, a certain spring back can be observed. Afterwards, the relaxation phase is initiated. Additionally, experiments are performed on a smaller scale panel for a point load applied in the middle of the upper bent surface.","Thin glass; Leoflex glass; Saflex DG41; SentryGlas; Cold bent; Lamination; Strand7","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Building Engineering","",""

However these require bulky external instrumentation. An integrated fluid control mechanism would make microfluidic systems more portable, closed and automated. The aim of this project was to create a pH-responsive membrane for integrated fluid control in microfluidic systems. pH-responsiveness will allow the membrane to interact directly with analytes in a microfluidic system. <br/>First pH-responsive materials and fluid control mechanisms to create a pH-responsive membrane were reviewed. Cross-linked polymer hydrogels with pH-dependent volumetric swelling were identified as the most suitable material for the membrane. These materials respond to changes in pH by large volumetric transitions, which creates potential for control over a wide range of flow rates. Furthermore they have an inherent interaction with water and are permeable to small molecules such as H+ ions. The material is synthesized from a liquid precursor that can be cured through photo-initiated free radical polymerization. <br/>We tested a system for measuring the pH response of the material that consisted of a hydrogel disk that was vertically constrained inside a fluidic channel. Due to this constraint, expansion only occurred in the lateral direction and could be measured using an optical microscope. Furthermore, we developed a method for manufacturing macro-porous hydrogel membranes that gives control over pore size, shape and position. A photo-lithography approach was used to pattern the membranes and thereby create pores, using a photo-mask that was manufactured on an office printer in a very fast and low-cost process. <br/>The resulting membranes had a thickness of 140-190 um and pore diameters of 100-400 um. The pore size was measured for environmental pH of 1.6 and 7.1, within this range the pores doubled in diameter. Furthermore the pH-responsive deformation ratio of the pores increased significantly with increasing curing time and decreasing pore diameter. The results suggest that there is a difference in material properties around the pores that develops due to a local difference in received exposure dose during curing. <br/>The fluidic properties and pH-response of the membrane can be adjusted to suit a specific application by changing the design, the curing time or the chemical composition of the membrane. The constrained disk system can then be used to measure and compare the pH-response of different potential materials.<br","Membrane; Porous membrane; Hydrogel; microfluidics; pH-responsive; pH-sensitive; smart materials; active materials","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Micro and Nano Engineering","",""

However, there are concerns that have been raised about their injectivity. The large entangled polymer chains can clog the pore throats, giving a tendency to cause injectivity reduction. In this study, processing techniques were used to condition an acrylamide-based copolymer inverse emulsion system at a salinity of 50,000 ppm TDS before being injected into porous media. The investigated polymer solution contained 4,000 ppm active emulsion-polymer and 2,400 ppm surfactant, providing a zero-shear rate viscosity of 13 mPas. Shearing with two agitators, a disperser and Ultra-Turrax, at different intensities and pressure-driven flow into a thin capillary reduces the size of the largest polymer and disentangles the polymer chains while maintaining its viscosifying power as much as possible. Subsequently, the filtration ratios (퐹푅) with optimum between 1–1.2 were determined by performing filtration tests in a 1-micron polycarbonate membrane to evaluate the plugging behavior. This was followed by sand-pack flooding tests of differently sheared solutions in order to investigate the impact of pre-conditioning on injectivity.<br/>Bulk experiments enabled the establishment of master curves showing viscosity and screen factor dependences on accumulated energy during pre-shearing, regardless of shear origin. The injected unsheared polymer solution has an 퐹푅 of 1.6 and an injectivity gradient, e.g. ratio of resistance factor over 10 pore volumes, of 2.4. All injected pre-conditioned solutions have an 퐹푅 in the optimal range between 1 to 1.2. By imposing 15 MJ/m3, the disperser-sheared solution improves the injectivity by decreasing the injectivity gradient to 1.3, while the viscosifying power is reduced by 2% and the screen factor by 30%. To reach the same injectivity gradient of 1.3 with Ultra-Turrax, 31 MJ/m3 were imposed, which reduces the viscosity and screen factor by 11% and 44% respectively. The sheared solution into a capillary imposes 50 MJ/m3, giving an injectivity gradient of 2.7. Both viscosity and screen factor are reduced by 19% and 53% respectively. This indicates that the injectivity performance is shear-origin dependent and the resulting polymer structure, when sheared through contractions, has a different alignment as compared to shearing with the agitators, the disperser and Ultra-Turrax.<br/>In conclusion, the rheological dependencies of sheared polymer solutions form a master curve dependent of accumulated energy during shearing with different shearing devices. Further, the proven beneficial impact of pre-conditioning with agitators before injection enables a better utilization of polymer flooding operations by reducing the risk of pore plugging.","polymer flooding; EOR; emulsion polymer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Finding an optimal layout of the sorting system on the warehouse floor; 2. Allocating products or parcels to be sorted to robots; 3. Finding paths that all robots can follow concurrently, without colliding. These problems are considered one by one. The first problem is understood on an intuitive level, while the other two are considered more closely. For both problems, several algorithms are considered. Some utilize greedy heuristics while others model the problem at hand precisely using integer linear programming methods. The algorithm’s real world performance is then assessed using a simulation. Slow, ILP-based algorithms are found to produce optimal solutions for small instances. However, they don’t scale well, and are unable to solve large instances. Greedy approximation algorithms solve all problem instance sizes tested, but produce solutions of lower quality.","optimization; sorting; planning; allocation; path; collision; ILP; makespan; heuristic; greedy; disjoint; parcel; robot; hamiltonian; tree-width; dynamic; programming; multi; commodity; flow; conservation; a-star; rust; integrality; gap; benchmark; test","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

(mentor); Hartjes, S. (graduation committee); Voskuijl, M. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","In the year 2050, global anthropogenic radiative forcing from aircraft emissions are projected to increase significantly. Recent studies have considered climate optimized flight trajectories to be a promising measure to mitigate non-CO2 emissions’ environmental impact, which is highly sensitive to locus and time of emissions. Estimating the maximum mitigation potential from these trajectories requires accounting of air traffic regulations. As designing regulated climate optimal trajectories necessitates solving a hybrid optimal control system with unknown mode sequence and associated switching times, there is a need to build an efficient and systematic control technique. In this thesis, a bi-level optimal control algorithm is proposed for designing climate optimal cruise trajectories, the lower level calculates the optimal switching times and control<br/>inputs of a fixed mode sequence and, the upper level updates the mode sequence with mode insertion which lower the cost locally. The problem for trajectory optimization is formulated here as a hybrid optimal control problem with a switched system and with a variable mode sequence, where step-climb and descent modes are included in the mode sequence. Optimal Control problems for minimizing operating cost and climate cost with fictitious climate cost functions (CCF), varying with altitude, are solved to study the performance of the algorithm. The algorithm is implemented within the Trajectory Optimization Module (TOM) by building a bi-level framework. The framework was validated by solving the operating cost optimal control problem. The maximum error between the cost reduction estimated by the algorithm and the actual cost reduction was found to be less than 15%. With high probability it can be stated that the bi-level framework is able to calculate an optimal mode sequence as the framework allow for zero entry modes in the mode sequence i.e. modes of zero duration. Although, careful consideration is required while selecting a mode for insertion as the framework is highly dependent on the sequence of the set of modes.<br/><br/>Despite a satisfactory performance of the bi-level optimal control technique there are few challenges which limits the scope of this technique. The maximum error was found to increase for optimal control problems with AirClim CCFs. The dependence of the AirClim CCFs on position of the aircraft influences the locus of the trajectory at each flight level. Because of this the the trajectories calculated in each iteration of the framework are found to be inconsistent. A flight trajectory guided by waypoints is proposed as a solution for future studies to handle the inconsistency between trajectories. As future studies are expected to focus on finding optimal mode definitions for designing climate optimal trajectories, the bi-level optimal control algorithm can act as an intermediary tool with which the researchers can systematically investigate cost benefits along the trajectories.","Aircraft Trajectory Optimization; Bi-Level Control Algorithm; Climate Optimized Trajectory; Hybrid Systems; Optimal Control Theory; Switched System","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); Veldhuis, L.L.M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Ever since the late seventies great engineering effort has gone into increasing the fuel efficiency and reduction of the noise profile of aircraft. A concept that has been explored is the wingtip-mounted (pusher) propeller. In all wings energy is lost due to the lift-induced vortex at the wingtip. Wingtip-mounted pusher propellers can recover some of this energy if rotating opposite to the wingtip vortex rotation. The required propeller shaft power and wing induced drag could be reduced. Nevertheless, no aircraft utilise this setup because of aeroelastic problems and one-engine-out requirements. Nowadays this can be resolved by scaling down the propeller and using (distributed) electric propulsion. Recent developments in personal air transport and multi-rotor aircraft have sparked interest in wingtip-mounted propellers. The goal of this research is to obtain quantified insight into the propulsive efficiency gains and optimal geometry of a pusher propeller placed in a wingtip flow field.<br/>In the first part of this research a CFD simulation of the wingtip flow field was implemented and validated with available experimental data. A simple Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model proved to be most suitable and accurate. The flow field of the Tecnam P2006T aircraft was modelled to provide a realistic wingtip flow field to which the propeller would be subjected.<br/>In the second part of this research a lower-order tool called PROPR was built and proved to be a fast propeller aerodynamic analysis tool. Validation with experimental data showed a deviation of less than 15% in obtained thrust- and torque coefficients found. PROPR was integrated in an optimisation routine for fast optimisation of propeller geometry and operating conditions for non-uniform inflow. Total thrust, torque and their distributions obtained from PROPR and an implemented CFD model showed identical trends and were overestimated approximately 5% by <i>PROPR</i>.<br/>In the final research part the Tecnam wing with installed propeller was investigated. A wingtip-mounted pusher propeller enables more than 12% increase in propulsive efficiency over the entire propeller thrust regime evaluated. Propeller optimisation was done for a thrust range of 50 &lt; T<sub>des </sub>&lt; 350 N, wing induced drag was 240 N. Relative reductions in power requirement were constant for the thrust regime. Absolute power decrease did not decrease with increasing design thrust. No airfoil optimisation was performed to enable fast and stable optimization. From optimisation of a fictitious propeller with constant airfoil geometry it was concluded that the airfoil geometries are a limiting factor in fully capturing the benefits of the wingtip flow field. In optimised (installed) propeller geometry blade loadings shift towards the blade root. A smaller chord length and lower RPM are preferred given the used baseline propeller geometry.<br/>A CFD simulation in which the propeller was represented as an actuator disk was constructed. The up- stream effect of an installed propeller was negligible. Thus, the incoming flow field was independent of pro- peller thrust within the considered thrust range. With this the implemented methodology was proven to be valid. Also, the overall power reduction of the combined setup is thus equal to the power reduction of the propeller. Comparison with transient CFD simulations of the wing with installed propeller showed great cor- respondence with results from <i>PROPR</i>.<br/>In further research it is recommended to include optimisation of (root section) airfoil geometries in the propeller design. Evaluation of propellers at higher thrust levels would provide insight in power reduction at these higher thrust levels. Finally, investigation of the propeller at additional downstream locations, in- cidence angles and azimuthal positions would further validate the benefits of wingtip-mounted propellers suggested in this research.","Propeller design; Wingtip-mounted propellers; wing-propeller interaction; Optimisation; CFD modelling; Blade Element Method; Actuator Disk; Installation effects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Based on the STDF, we propose a multivariate tail dependence coefficient (TDC) as an extension of the well-known bivariate TDC. Importantly, we show that the proposed measure can identify tail independence in all dimensions d≥2, similar to its bivariate variant. The performance of nonparametric estimators for the STDF and, inherently, the multivariate TDC, is assessed with an extensive simulation study, including smoothed and bias-corrected versions of the empirical STDF. Based on the estimators for the STDF and the multivariate TDC, test statistics under the null hypothesis of tail independence are developed and evaluated in another simulation study. The STDF-based estimation and testing procedures are applied to foreign exchange (FX) data to characterize the tail dependence structure between three European FX rates and five worldwide FX rates.","extreme value copula; stable tail dependence function; tail dependence coefficient; tail dependence testing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To prevent a large-scale change of the earth’s climate humanity needs to switch to renewable energy sources. A large drawback of current renewable energy sources is that they almost all exclusively produce electricity which is hard to store for long periods of time. A possible solution to this energy storage issue is the electrochemical reduction of CO2 with electricity from renewable sources. Catalysts used for this process are transition metals but there are several problems that prevent large-scale implementation. Two fundamental problems with these catalysts are: Low activity causing low reaction rates, and low selectivity causing the formation of undesired products. A possible solution was proposed by Lim et al. (2014)1 where they suggested doping a silver electrode with sulphur to enhance the selectivity and activity for carbon monoxide production. This proposal was put the test in this thesis where silver was doped with sulphur by two different methods and were characterized by different techniques and tested at four different potentials. The method where a sample was immersed in a sulphur containing solution and subsequently annealed proofed to be the most effective way to dope a silver electrode. With the help of gas chromatography it was found out that at lower overpotentials the addition of sulphur is beneficial to its performance to produce CO but at higher potentials this advantage is lost. However if the results of this thesis are compared to literature it is clear that doping with sulphur is not effective. Furthermore it was seen that the sulphur doped Ag electrodes were not very stable and therefore not suited for large-scale implementation.","Electrochemical; reduction; Carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; Silver; Sulphur","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is unlikely that current battery chemistries will reach the energy density desired for future applications [8]. Li-metal, which has the highest reduction potential of all metals and the highest achievable capacity per weight unit, could significantly increase the energy density when used as an Anode. Unfortunately, the dendritic growth of Li-metal is a safety hazard, and the low electrochemical potential of Li-metal<br/>is outside the stability window of many electrolytes leading to capacity degradation.<br/>It has been suggested that safe Li-metal Anodes may be possible in combination with solid electrolytes, as the higher shear modulo of solid over liquid electrolytes may be able to suppress dendrite formation [21].<br/>To study the stability of the interface between Li-metal and the solid electrolyte Li6PS5Cl, electrochemical measurements of the cells, ex-situ x-ray diffraction, and solid state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance measurements were made. It was not possible to confirm the decomposition products that were proposed in literature by density functional theory calculations and in-situ XPS. The XRD-pattern of the cycled electrolyte did not show additional phases. The NMR spectra developed broader peaks and one additional phosphorous environment upon cycling. As a tool to study dendritic growth through Li-ion concentration profiles, a cell for in-situ neutron depth profiling (NDP) was developed. The electrochemical performance is comparable to regular cells, except for a voltage drop due to contact problems during the break after Li-metal stripping. A thin layer of Li-metal between the window and the electrolyte pellet, as well as a collimator plate to put some pressure on the window, could be the solution<br/>to go towards operando measurements.<br/>The current standard data analysis method was implemented and its sensitivity towards gaussian broadening, due to energy straggling (from small angle scattering in the material and the stochastic nature of energy loss), was<br/>investigated.

AGS in continuous systems could be a solution to this disadvantage. That’s why the HARKOS pilot is built. This pilot is based on the enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) process. The aim of this study is to make sure this pilot runs according to the EBPR process (reactor characterization) and to apply biological selective pressure for granulation. This biological selective pressure consists out of four pillars. Prevention of COD overshoot into the aerobic zone, as much COD in the anaerobic zone to storage polymers, enrichment for bio-p organisms and compartmentalization of the reactor. It’s concluded that the pilot is characterized, that no COD overshoot is present, that more COD is stored as storage polymers, that the sludge is enriched for bio-p organisms and that the reactor is well enough compartmentalized. The biological selective pressure is applied. If enough physical selective pressure is applied granulation will start in the HARKOS pilot.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2021-01-01","","","","Life Science and Technology (LST)","",""

In difficult terrain, the amount of obstacles or hard layers increase, leading to an increased risk of pile tip damage. Also the ever increasing D/t ratio of the pile leads to piles more vulnerable to damage to the pile tip. Already, damage to the pile tip was encountered in projects such as the Goodwyn A and Valhall projects, resulting in financial burdens. The design codes show close to zero design guidance regarding pile tip deformation when hard driving is expected. There is a demand for research to understand these deformations at the pile tip. The main goal of this research is to obtain insight in the potential deformations at the pile tip as a result of collision with an obstacle.<br/><br/>To identify the pile tip deformation, a finite element model is established. Six volume elements over the thickness are required at the contact zone to model the pile-boulder interaction accurately. Axial- and lateral soil support is included in the model by using non-linear Winkler springs. Lateral soil support inside the pile is included by transferring the results of a volume element model into linear springs. <br/>A parametric study is performed to investigate the influence of different parameters on damage to the pile tip. It is noticed that a fully geometric- and material nonlinear analyses is required to performs these simulations. Also, it is shown that in contrast with what is frequently done and also mentioned in design standards, the D/t ratio of the pile cannot be used as single parameter to design monopiles. Both D and t should be independently taken into account. Furthermore, it is seen that relatively large pile-boulder contact angles or low steel-rock friction causes the pile to slip over the boulder’s surface. Higher friction or smaller contact angles are likely to result in rippling or local in- or outward (local ovalisation) deformation of the wall. Although the larger contact angles and lower friction causes the pile to slip over the boulder’s surface, the horizontal reaction is shown to be large enough to push the boulder away, reducing the damage to the tip.<br/><br/>Based on a pile drive-ability analyses it is pointed out that current offshore hydraulic hammers are able to deliver the load that is needed to initiate the investigated local tip damage. Furthermore, based on Terzaghi's bearing formulation and the Brazilian Tensile Test it is demonstrated that local penetration of the pile into the boulder is likely to happen for softer rocks and that splitting the boulder is not likely to occur. Finally, one dynamic simulation is run to compare the static and dynamic simulation. It seems possible to investigate failure mechanisms using statics. Accurate results and propagation should be obtained in dynamic analyses. Detailed dynamic analyses is left for future work.<br","Pile tip deformation; Boulder; obstacle; FEM analysis; Local deformation; Pile driving","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","",""

In contrast to the conventional DFT method, the DMF approach utilises two electron density fields to correctly account for the bias-induced non-equilibrium effects.

The results are compared to calculations with a conventional VWN LDA XC functional. The DMF approach leads to a 20% mean increase in the HOMO-LUMO gap. This is an important and promising result, as conventional LDA methods are known to underestimate the HOMO-LUMO gap. Additionally the bias dependence of the transmission spectrum has been analysed. This yields similarly good stability as the conventional LDA method.<br/><br/>These first results encourage additional testing and development of the DMF method.

We assessed the collection efficiency of both straight and curved fog water collectors using computational fluid dynamics models and performed controlled experiments in a climatic wind tunnel on sample fog water collectors. The analytical model disregards convex fog harvesters because their lower drag coefficient reduces the aerodynamic efficiency of the fog harvester. The results of the CFD models show that efficiency can be doubled if fog catchers are built convex facing the wind. The wind tunnel experiments support the results from the CFD models.

We focus specifically on extreme amounts of precipitation. The Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute (KNMI) uses a numerical model, approximating the solutions to partial differential equations, to forecast precipitation and other metrics about the weather. These forecasts have systematic errors, due to the model’s high sensitivity to input parameters. These errors can be corrected with statistical methods, by looking at the relation between the predicted and actual precipitation. We use a non-parametric regression set-up to estimate the conditional expectation of the weather given the forecasts of the numerical weather prediction model of the KNMI. Specifically, we focus on predicting the maximum precipitation in a three by three kilometers area in the Netherlands. There are several existing methods for solving non-parametric regression problems; in this thesis we will focus on k-nearest neighbors and random forests. A simulation study shows, however, that both these methods are not capable of dealing with more complex regression problems, such as forecasting extreme precipitation. Therefore, we are proposing a newly developed method, called k-nearest forest neighbors, which is a generalization of the random forests approach. This new method performs significantly better on the simulated data, compared to k-nearest neighbors and random forests. When applying the methods on a precipitation data set obtained from the KNMI, it also turns out that the method we developed has more predictive power than the numerical weather model and the existing non-parametric regression approaches.","non-parametric regression; weather; precipitation; random forests; k-nearest neighbors","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The CMOS wind sensor operates in the electro-thermal domain; therefore, it has no moving parts and therefore requires very little maintenance. Moreover, the CMOS wind sensor is an active sensor, compared to its mechanical counterpart. Its sensitivity can be easily adjusted by changing the magnitude of the excitation signal.<br/><br/>Despite the manufacturing advantages of CMOS technology, the wind sensor has not attained commercial success in the market. This is due, in part, to process spread and packaging artifacts that have resulted in offset, nonlinearity and angle errors in detecting wind speed and direction. Because of this, expensive manual calibration is required to compensate these errors. Furthermore, its power consumption, in the order of tens of milliwatts, is not yet low enough to compete with its MEMS counterparts. <br/><br/>In this thesis, the design of a new version of the wind sensor is described, which aims to address the drawbacks of previous designs. Four extra resistors were added at each corner to electrically compensate for packaging artifacts, with the aim of reducing calibration costs. Larger thermopiles (a number of thermo- couples in series) were used, resulting in a greater signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Internal signals were buffered to output pads to gain more insight into the magnitude of the sensor's internal signal swings. With these improvements, the resulting wind sensor chip consumes less than 30 mW of heating power and has an accuracy of ±0.6 m/s (speed) for wind speeds ranging from 1 to 25 m/s, and ±2.5°(direction) for a range of 4 to 25 m/s.","CMOS; Wind; Sensor; smart; Sigma Delta","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The effects of subsidence, combined with the removal of surface water in the last century, are now further exacerbated by the increasing threat of climate change, which results in a growing flood risk. This thesis develops a plan to improve water storage and decrease risks using green-blue spatial interventions. The capacity of such interventions is calculated in various situations, ranging from normal rainy days to extreme precipitation occurrences without support from existing technical systems. At the same time, the potential for spatial changes is tested, both through analysis and workshops with inhabitants and other stakeholders. New interventions must be closely integrated within the existing structure of the city in order to protect the monumental value of the existing medieval core and ensure the character of the city centre remains recognisable. This leads to an integrated, three-pronged strategy in which the various characteristics and problems of the city centre each result in a different approach, including both monumental protection as well as a new drive towards innovative water management practices. To further ground these strategies into the existing city structure, new street profiles are developed, which show what level and type of adaptation can be added to specific streets. Interventions are chosen in such a way that each change references an already existing element of the city without being directly derivative. Instead they evoke the character of the city without copying it. In one location, water storage was brought back from where it was removed in the 20th century, adapted in a modernized way that brings more storage capacity as well as new functions. This creates a city in which monumental buildings are protected from flooding, precipitation is safely discharged and the potential for new water experiences is re-opened.","Spatial transformation; Adaptive capacity; Green-blue design; Historical preservation; Water management; Climate change; Gouda","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","Delta Interventions","52.011543, 4.710451"

Their use is widespread due to their reduced drag and structural robustness. We reproduce with Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) recent Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) experiments of the micro-ramp flow performed at TU Delft to study the wake of a micro-ramp immersed in a laminar and incompressible boundary layer. The micro-ramp is a vortex generator which induces a pair of streamwise counter-rotating vortices. The current literature identifies this structure as the main flow feature contributing to the increase of the near-wall momentum. The micro-ramp is also a surface roughness element which can trigger laminar-turbulent transition. The action of the induced vortices introduces a strong detached shear layer into the flow field, susceptible to Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) instability. We analyse the micro-ramp flow dynamics and the transitional mechanisms which develop in the micro-ramp wake. Furthermore, we intend to contribute to the discussion on the micro-ramp working principle, which has been put into question by other authors. We show the importance of the transitional perturbation development in the micro-ramp functionality. %In the past decade, numerous computational and experimental studies performed inquired into the topology of the flow behind a micro-ramp and its relation to the functionality of the device. <br/><br/>Downstream-travelling streamwise vortices and transitional disturbances serve to the same purpose of increasing the momentum close to the surface. To examine their relative contribution in this regard, we numerically decompose the micro-ramp flow field into a laminar steady state and a time-dependant perturbation field. To achieve that, we apply Selective Frequency Damping (SFD), a numerical technique used to compute the steady solutions of globally unstable dynamical systems. SFD is a popular method nowadays and the preferred approach for aerospace applications. However, it has two case-dependant model parameters which are key to the method's effectivity and efficiency, and whose selection remains a challenge in the literature. Not every combination of the model parameters guarantees the success of SFD, and even if so, the required computational time may be so large that the approach is impractical. We provide the first rigorous analysis of the influence of these parameters to the functionality of SFD, leading to simple expressions and procedures for choosing them optimally. Furthermore, we prove that, under certain conditions, SFD is always able to stabilise a globally unstable flow configuration.","Micro-ramp; SFD; Transition; Turbulence; Instability; DNS; CFD; Aerodynamics; Flow Control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-09-01","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","51.9900° N, 4.3754° E"

It is important to have a high vaccination coverage in order to stop spreading diseases and reaching herd immunity. This herd immunity, of which the minimum percentage differs per disease but lies around 90 percent, protects the people that cannot be vaccinated due to illness or are too young to be vaccinated. <br/><br/>This graduation project focuses on risk communication, presenting both advantages and disadvantages, about the first child vaccinations (DKTP-Hib-Hepb and pneumococcal vaccination between 6 and 9 weeks of age).

People who do not have the intention to participate in the NIP are not taken into account.

Many bridges require reassessment. In 2009 the former ministry of “Volkshuisvesting, Ruimtelijke Ordening en Milieubeheer”(Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment) carried out a study about the state of the bridges, following several incidents including for example the closure of the Sebastiaansbridge in Delft. The main conclusion from the research was that it is hard to prove that the structural safety of existing bridges and viaducts is sufficient. One of the main topics in the reassessment of the bridges was the shear capacity. The aim of this study is first to investigate the present Eurocode approach to determine the shear tension capacity, secondly if there is a possibility to improve this Eurocode approach or to propose another model. The general main research question is: What model determines the resistance with respect to the formation of shear tension cracks most accurate? Practical experiments of the researchers Choulli[8] and Elzanaty[9] already carried out will serve as a basis to evaluate of differentmodels in this thesis. The experiments consist of single-span prestressed I- and T-beams. The study focusses on two topics. In the first topic attention is paid to the comparison of the analytical stress distribution and the numerical stress distribution of the web of the single span prestressed I- and T-beams. The analytical stress distribution is determined according to the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, the vertical stress component ¾y is not taken into account. The current Eurocode model is based on the analytical stress distribution. The numerical stress distribution is determined with a linear elastic analysis in the finite element software program DIANA FEA. The following topic is about the choice of a consistent model that predicts the first shear crack in the web and the consideration of a strength criterion. In this study in total there are considered 6 models and 3 strength criterions. Model 1 is the Eurocode model and is considered with the analytical stress distribution. Model 2, the “LE FEA” model is considered with the numerical stress distribution. Model 3, the “midheight” model around the neutral axis, is considered with the analytical stress distribution. Models 4, 5 and 6 respectively the 45°, the 35°and the 30°model, are considered with the analytical stress distribution. Each model consists of a single or a set points in the web of the prestressed beams to consider. For both the textual explanation and the graphical representation of the models, reference is made to sections 5.1.1 and 5.2.1. There are considered 3 strength criterions: the uniaxial tensile strength fctm, the biaxial tensile strength according to “Mohr-Coulomb” and the biaxial tensile strength according to “Huber”. For each model, the set of points or the single point is divided by a value of a strength criterion. This is defined as “model uncertainty”. From the analysis it is found that the analytical stress distribution does not equal the numerical stress distribution at some parts of the prestressed beams. This is the case in the socalled “disturbed areas”. These areas are located near concentrated loads, so around supports and external concentrated loads. After analysis it is found that the analytical stress distribution takes a too high principal tensile stress σ1 into account, in the “disturbed areas”. After analysis of the different stress components σx , σy and τxy , it is found that components σy and τxy are the cause of the deviant stress distribution in the “disturbed areas”. The test set consists of in total 29 experiments: 12 experiments of Choulli and 17 experiments of Elzanaty. First the results per model, per strength criterion of the Choulli and Elzanaty experiments will be combined, from which the mean and the variation coefficient of the “model uncertainties” are determined. The conclusion is based on one important feature: the conclusions are based on both the complete set of experiments and on the set of experiments where no flexural cracks have been observed. In case of the set of experiments where no flexural cracks have been observed, also the experiments where the calculated tensile stress in the ultimate fiber exceeds the uniaxial tensile strength fctm are left out. From the comparison of the analytical and the numerical stress distribution it can be concluded that stress distribution in the socalled “disturbed areas” is overestimated. Based on the complete set of experiments, model 3, the “midheight” around the neutral axis, is preferred. This model offers the best consistency. Concerning the strength criterion: there is a little difference in consistency between the model with uniaxial tensile strength and the model with the biaxial tensile strength(this holds true for both “Mohr-Coulomb” and “Huber”). Based on this it is preferable for practice to reduce the uniaxial tensile strength with 20%. Based on the set without the experiments which showed flexural cracks, it is found that the “means” of the models were lower and that the models are more consistent. Concerning the strength criterion: both the uniaxial tensile strength fctm and the tensile strength according to “Mohr-Coulomb” are overestimated. For future research it is recommended to investigate the influence of present flexural cracks on the stress distribution, what will be the influence on the way of predicting diagonal tension cracking. Fromthe results in this study it can be seen that the presence of flexural cracks can have significant influence on the consistency of the models. Further, it is also important for future research to consider distributed loads in addition to concentrated loads, because in practice there will be always present a significant distributed load.","Prestressed; Concrete; Beams; Bridges","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

Specifically, we are interested in data with temporal smoothness, i.e. where consecutive instances likely belong to the same class. We use the task of bird song detection in outdoor audio recordings as a motivating example throughout this thesis. To incorporate this additional knowledge in our algorithm we present a novel temporal mixture model based on hidden Markov random fields. By fitting our temporal model to the data and identifying instances that are poorly explained we can iteratively nominate candidates that are likely minority instances. A human expert labels each nominated instance, after which the model is updated using the newly obtained labelled information. We show that our temporal model is able to improve the parameter estimates, and can correctly classify instances that reside deep inside the boundaries of another class. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on several bird song detection problems.","rare category detection; temporal data; semi-supervised learning; mixture models; markov random fields","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using PVsyst, a PV modelling software, the maximum power operating points were determined for a test layout. This was then transformed to other layouts which allowed the optimum layout to be found for a system connected to electrolyzers using maximum power point tracking technology. A second scenario using a battery was also modelled and optimized. Finally, the third scenario used direct coupling, meaning that the PV panels were not operated at their maximum power point but rather at where the electrolyzer and PV current and voltage lines crossed. This resulted in a lower power yield but also lower costs. To find the current and voltage curve for the PV field, the data from PVsyst analyzed to find the short circuit current and the open circuit voltage. This allowed the full current and voltage curve to be determined, which allowed the intersection point with the (experimental) electrolyzer current and voltage curve to be determined.<br/><br/>In all simulations piping storage was used to remove the intermittency of the hydrogen production by having a capacity of 3 tons of gaseous H2. This ensures a constant stream of hydrogen to the liquefaction system.<br/><br/>Using preliminary results an electrolyzer degradation simulation was carried out, to find how the electrolyzer would behave after 20 years of use. Although the influence of intermittency could not be found in literature, it was shown that the electrolyzer produces, on average during its 20 year lifetime, approximately 5.7% less hydrogen than it would without any degradation. This has been included in all financial analyses carried out in this report, along with a 7% weighted average cost of capital.<br/><br/>The financial framework has been based off of a number of different sources and forecasts. Due to the limitations of publicly available data some forecasts were replaced with constant prices which do not evolve throughout the years.<br/><br/>Using the hydrogen production models and financial frameworks it is possible to compare the different scenarios. From this a price of 4.16$/kg was found for a MPP coupled system, 4.39$/kg for a MPP coupled system including a battery, and 4.02$/kg for a direct coupled system. The third scenario was furthermore looked at in terms of physical layout; it was found that the decentralized layout consisting of smaller subplots was slightly more expensive than the standard centralized layout (4.09$/kg). For this pilot plant it is advised to use a decentralized topology, combined with a decentralized layout consisting of multiple smaller plots. Although the centralized layout is slightly cheaper, it contains more system critical components which could cause a large portion of the system to be inactive if they are broken.","hydrogen; Broome; solar; PV; direct coupling; electrolyzer; alkaline electrolyzer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-07-20","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

It needs electric energy to fulfill its purpose: to provide artificial ice to - initially - extend the ice skating season.<br/>Nowadays the need of artificial ice has increased, since the oppurtunity to practice the ice skating sport outside with natural circumstances ceased to exist. The main cause of this development is the increasing annual temperature, which has been a result of global warming.<br/>Due to this climate change, an ice rink building will soon be the only means to practice the sport.<br/>Another development is the increasing demands of the ice skaters to have the right circumstances to enhance their sporting performance.<br/>The architectural typology of the ice rink had been initiated in the 1980’s, before that speed skating on artificial ice had mainly been practiced outdoors. This newly introduced architecture merely played a role as a shell of protection, but is low performing in controlling the right circumstances for high-quality ice and comfort of the sporter.<br/>The ice rink building nowadays is still generally challenged in providing a controllable environment and the typology is still associated with being occupied in winter, and vacated in summer. The ice rink typology can be described as unsustainable.<br/>The directive of the research is to find architectural means to improve an ice rink in its sustainable characteristics. This is mainly focussed on lowering the energy demand by application of architectural solutions, and compensating this energy demand by integrating energy producing elements.<br/>For this research, mainly the usage/operation stage will be taken into account. For the construction stage (choice of materials and their embodied energy) only assumptions will be made to improve the buildings energy sustainability. The result will be an energy neutral ice rink.<br/>To gain insight in the building requirements, case studies of ice rink predecessors and questionnaires on larger potential user groups were necessary. To go into depth of the building characteristics and usefull feedback on how to design an ice rink, specialists in the ice rink field were interviewed. Where needed the research was expanded with literature studies.<br/>Outcomes of the research are, among others, a roof and a double facade acting as an climatic buffer, insulation in the building envelope, avoidance of heat radiation by the sun or surrounding materials, strong climate regulation devices, and a hermetically sealed sport area as protection from its outer environment. In the end the building design will provide an ice sport venue in winter and multifunctional venue in summer with its own fully controllable micro climate.<br/>These solutions will be applied in a program of requirements for a design proposal of the ice rink of the future.","ice rink; Energy Efficiency; architecture; explore lab; ice skating; skating; stadium; manual","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Explorelab","",""

The dynamic properties of these moving parts are crucial to the performance of the machine. Therefore these moving parts have to be carefully designed which is often a very time consuming iterative process. In this thesis a general method to optimize the dynamic properties of a structure utilizing topology optimization is investigated. More specifically, the method will be focused on the optimization of eigenfrequencies whilst achieving specific ratios between eigenfrequencies,<br/>as dynamic performance requirements are often linked to such criteria. We refer to this class of topology optimization problems as problems involving constrained eigenfrequencies. A particular case of interest is the desired multiplicity of two or more eigenfrequencies, that is a ratio of 1. Several crucial aspects of the topology optimization of eigenfrequencies are investigated, these are the material interpolation methods, mode tracking techniques, multiplicity problems and obtaining a discrete design. By comparing different material interpolation methods, a clear view on the effects of different methods is obtained, leading to solid arguments for selecting a linear material interpolation method for topology optimization of eigenfrequencies. A simple yet effective method of tracking the eigenmodes during the optimization process combined with a solution for the multiplicity problems is presented and verified to show similar results as a more complex analytical approach. A new method of obtaining a discrete design without applying penalization or modification of the eigenvalue problem has been developed using a modified objective function. This method shows promising results and is a good candidate for replacing the material interpolation penalization method. By combining these results, a general and capable framework for the topology optimization of constrained eigenfrequencies is obtained. Using the presented framework, a practical application of the method is given by the design of a cantilever used in an atomic force microscope.

Data of eleven seasons of the Dutch football league, the Eredivisie, were used to train six cost-sensitive decision trees. Two of our cost-sensitive models use the odds of a single bookmaker. Since multiple bookmakers publish their odds for the same match, four cost-combining methods are compared as well. The thesis shows what the strengths and weaknesses of each method are and how they behave both when betting on all matches, and when the strategy of value betting is employed.

This report focuses on the falling film evaporator, which role in the production process is to evaporate the water content from the milk. A falling film evaporator is a large vertically-placed vessel whereby the inside is filled with smaller tubes. Steam enters the vessel and heats up the outside of the smaller tubes. The milk flows in a thin layer only along the inside perimeter of the smaller tubes, so these tubes are not completely filled. The advantage of this flow is that a thin layer of liquid is continuously in contact with the wall so the heating process is equal along the tube. The thin layer is called a falling film because the thickness compared to the length of the flow is very small. <br/><br/>The objective of this research is to determine theoretically the local overall heat transfer coefficient of the falling film and to investigate experimentally the applicability of heat flux sensors by determining the local overall heat transfer coefficient. By investigating the falling film, it is not allowed to disturb the falling film. Once a falling film is disturbed, the falling film will proceed at a different path. Heat flux sensors allow for local non-intrusive measurements. The overall heat transfer coefficient gives information about the thickness of the falling film. Theoretically the overall heat transfer coefficient is calculated by taken the thermal resistances of each component. Experimentally, the overall heat transfer coefficient is measured by the heat flux and the temperature difference between the bulk temperature of the fluid and the sensor at the outside of the tube.<br/><br/>Before the heat flux sensors are used in practice on the falling film evaporator, a setup has been built to experimentally determine the applicability of the heat flux sensor. This setup has been made for a tube filled with water and to create a falling film. The tube filled with water is well-described in theory and used as a reference. <br/><br/>The results of the experimental setup show that the Danfoss 'Koperpasta tube AT' is in good comparison with the theoretical approach. The theoretical overall heat transfer coefficient difference, caused by the mass flow difference of 0.01 kg/s in the falling film evaporator, can be detected by the heat flux sensors taking into account the error margin of the heat flux sensor and temperature sensor.<br","Fluid dynamics; Heat transfer; Experimental study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The in-line liquid-liquid swirl separator is a separation method that is interesting for two reasons: It separates oil and water faster than the conventional settling tank and the fact that it is placed in-line is a practical advantage. In this report a study has been conducted on the modelling of an in-line liquid-liquid swirl separator using a mechanistic model. This model can be used as a thinking tool to better understand the separation performance of an in-line swirl separator: which parameters play an important role, what are the key processes? This model could also serve as an engineering design tool to optimize the swirl separator for industrial use. The goal of this research is to build a solid foundation for a relatively uncomplicated mechanistic model to describe the underlying physical processes of an in-line swirl separator.<br/>To model the process of separating an oil-water mixture using an in-line liquid-liquid swirl separator different research steps have been taken. The first step was building a base model. The idea of this model was to provide a solid foundation for a more sophisticated model. Based on the findings from this base model and by comparing the base model results to results from CFD simulations and experimental results, a more sophisticated model has been built. In this report this model is referred to as the swirl decay model. These models calculate the separation efficiency based on certain key parameters. To find the efficiency, the trajectory of the particle in the axial and radial directions are modelled based on a balance of forces constructed under the assumption of a quasi-steady state. From these trajectories it is possible to determine whether an oil droplet starting at a certain radial position at the beginning of the swirl tube ends up in the collection tube at the end of the pipe.<br/>The mechanistic model that was built in this research manages to capture the general processes involved in an in-line swirl separator, although the calculated efficiency values are generally larger than the experimental values. However, in order to capture the whole process, several features should be added to the model. These improvements include: more accurately determining the swirl decay coefficient, finding a way to model the droplet size distribution, model droplet coalescence and breakup, implementing a way to alter the flow split.<br","Mechanistic; model; swirl; separator; in-line","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Physics","",""

The main objective was to create a holistic and strategic framework for start-ups to rapidly scale-up, while utilizing Ecobloom as a case study for implementation and evaluation.<br/><br/>Ecobloom is a start-up that focuses on empowering people to grow their own fresh and organic food in a fun, interactive and sustainable way. The proposition that Ecobloom currently develops and will start offering in the near future is often categorized in different ways by various consumer segments. The main cause of this effect is the hybrid characteristic of the product which means it exists out of multiple categories of products. More specifically, it combines an aquarium and indoor garden, also known as aquaponics. Many potential consumers are unfamiliar with the product category which poses challenges, but simultaneously great opportunities. One of the strengths of the thesis’ framework is that it aims to optimize the innovation adoption for ambiguously categorized (hybrid) products. The development of the product was already done for 60% when starting the thesis.<br/><br/>Scaling up a start-up is considered a complex and dynamic phenomenon. To create a comprehensive, yet manageable framework, an important distinction between scaling on an abstract and more concrete dimension has been made. Firstly, a start-up grows as an organization, thereby developing its ‘back-end’. Simultaneously, the ‘front-end’ is considered the actual proposition a start-up offers the market. This thesis takes both dimensions into account and combines the rather abstract and more concrete aspects of scaling to support start-ups to grow fast. During the development of both these frameworks, product development, Kickstarter preparation and other parallel processes were performed for Ecobloom. Interaction effects between these processes are highlighted to enrich the thesis further with valuable insights.<br/><br/>The concrete layer of the thesis takes into account consumer behavior models, attitude formation and its influence on behavior and categorization theory to optimize the innovation adoption by customizing the communicated product positioning per consumer segment. In other words, the (digital) marketing efforts are specifically tailored to the segments’ desired benefits and values of the product. A hybrid model where on- and offline marketing strategies are combined paves the way to reach innovators, early adopters and the early majority. Furthermore, the framework guides start-ups through the iterative method of online proposition validation and provides guidelines on how to scale geographically in a rational and validated manner, thereby decreasing risks and enhancing the chance of success at the moment of market introduction.<br/><br/>The abstract, organizational layer of the framework aims to support start-ups both short- and long- term. Therefore, it first presents a long-term focused framework which reflects adaptability and flexibility. Its future oriented characteristic with continuous exploration prepares start-ups to create and develop new innovations that strategically fit future landscapes, while exploiting current knowledge and businesses. This ambidextrous balance is crucial for start-ups to succeed on the long-term. The second organizational framework demonstrates 12 crucial elements that have been implemented by Ecobloom to succeed on the short-term and bring the first product to market. It is designed to thrive in an entrepreneurial and dynamic context.<br","start-up growth; Strategy; Case Study; Strategic Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Tilt-rotor aircraft have the potential to decrease airport congestion and average flight delay in passenger transportation, while benefits are numerous in i.e. search and rescue, disaster relief and military application. Time, money and risk can be significantly reduced through the application of flight trajectory optimization and assessment prior to flight, as this can accurately simulate flight and its related performance limits. A numerical three-dimensional pointmass model for a tilt-rotor type aircraft has been derived to fill the gaps that currently exist in tilt-rotor modelling and the understanding of their flight mechanics. After validation, the model is applied to optimize integral flight trajectories using optimal control theory in GPOPS. It was concluded that the derived model is valid under its assumptions and limitations. From the tilt-rotor flight behaviour it was assessed that specific nacelle tilting behaviour could be observed, as the tilt-rotor can exploit its unique rotor tilting capability. Since the power required is the driving factor in most flight optimization, the nacelle angle is driven by the aircraft’s velocity and altitude. This model can be used in theoretical flight trajectory optimization studies.

Regardless of the intention or trading strategy of these traders, the invariable outcome is their attempt to buy or sell assets. However, in such a competitive field, experienced market participants seek to exploit any advantage over those who are less experienced, for financial gain. Therefore, this work aims to make a contribution to the important issue of how to optimize the process of buying and selling assets on exchanges, and to do so in a form that is accessible to other traders. This research concerns the optimization of limit order placement within a given time horizon of 100 seconds and how to transpose this process into an end-to-end learning pipeline in the context of reinforcement learning.<br/>Features were constructed from raw market event data that related to movements of the Bitcoin/USD trading pair on the Bittrex cryptocurrency exchange. These features were then used by deep reinforcement learning agents in order to learn a limit order placement policy. To facilitate the implementation of this process, a reinforcement learning environment that emulates a local broker was developed as part of this work. Furthermore, we defined an evaluation procedure which can determine the capabilities and limitations of the policies learned by the reinforcement learning agents and ultimately provides means to quantify the optimization achieved with our approach. Our analysis of the results of this work includes the identification of patterns in cryptocurrency trading that were formed by market participants who posted orders, and a conceptual framework to construct data features containing these patterns. We developed a fully-functioning reinforcement learning environment that emulates a local broker and, by means of this process, we identified which components are essential.<br/>With the use of this environment, we were able to train and test multiple reinforcement learning agents whose aims were to optimize the placement of buy and sell limit orders. During the evaluation, we were able to improve the parameter settings of the constructed reinforcement learning environment and therefore improve the policy learned by the agents. Ultimately, we achieved a significant improvement in limit order placement with the application of a state-of-the-art deep Q-network agent and were able to simulate purchases and sales of 1.0 BTC at a price that was up to $33.89 better than the market price. We have made use of the OpenAI Gym library and contributed our work to the community to enable further investigations to be carried out. The work done in this thesis can be used as a framework to (1) build a component that acts as an intermediary between trader and exchange and (2) to enable exchanges to provide a new order type to be used by traders.","Reinforcement Learning; Q-Learning; Deep Q-Network; deep reinforcement learning; limit order; limit order placement; trading","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This includes an analysis of the current standards and practices surrounding aircraft lavatories, a review of existing products, an analysis of relevant stakeholders, observational research onboard active flights and finally a concept design which aims to improve passenger hygiene. Research indicates that the small form factor of the lavatory makes it challenging for passengers to behave in a hygienic manner. The new design emulates the cubicle based layout of public restrooms, where wash basins are shared. Each lavatory increases in size by removing their wash basins and situating them in the cabin, where they are shared by passengers. Provision of separate lavatories for men and women enables the use of urinals for men and additional space for women and passengers with reduced mobility. Aircraft lavatories can be kept clean on long haul flights by creating new lavatory services and layouts which expand the space within the lavatory. Airlines can improve passenger hygiene and therefore satisfaction by providing lavatories which are larger and cater to more specific needs, such as standing and sitting urination. The new design is also of benefit to the process of manufacture and maintenance as it simplifies the existing product significantly and reduces the time it takes to clean and disinfect the aircraft between flights.","Clean; Aircraft; Lavatory; Concept Design; passenger experience; hygiene","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","","",""

These systems accommodate human settlements vulnerable to climate change, which offer enough economic, social, and environmental utility to require further research on the impact of climate change and subsequent best management practices.<br/><br/>The present work aims to analyze how climate change impacts the hydrodynamics and morphodynamics of two barrier inlet systems: Katama Bay (United States of America), and the Santa Lucia Estuary (South Africa). The goal is to estimate future changes in forcing variables (e.g., sea level rise, wave climate, river discharge, tides), implement them in process-based models (coupled SWAN and Delft3D), and identify changes in the dynamics of both systems by comparing present and future state simulations.<br/><br/>This thesis develops a replicable and flexible methodology that can be used as a systematic tool to assess the impacts of climate change on the overall dynamics of tidal inlet systems. A novel approach (copula analysis) was used to derive the wave climate implemented in Delft3D, which was then qualitatively validated for both sites. Model results were used to compare changes to inlet stability, inlet geometry, and sediment pathways for present and future hydrodynamic conditions.<br/><br/>Results show that sea level rise is the primary contributor to the overall morphodynamics at both sites, whereas changes in wave direction strongly impact the rate of inlet migration. Other changes (e.g., significant wave height, wave period, and river discharge) play a secondary role in the dynamics of both systems. Comparisons with previous studies suggest that wave direction impacts each system differently. These impacts must be specifically addressed for each tidal inlet, as the results from one site should not be used to determine a general behavior for the assessment of CC impacts in tidal inlet systems.","tidal inlet; Climate Change; Copula analysis; Hydrodynamics; Morphodynamics; Delft3D; inlet migration; Sediment pathways; Katama Bay; Santa Lucia Estuary","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM)","",""

PMUs are the main element of the Wide-Area Monitoring, Protection and Control System, the concept that provides an estimate of the actual condition of the system, allowing operators to run online simulations and determine the possibility of cascading events, the voltage values outside the limits, while the operator is still able to take proper actions, preventing the system blackout. However, for achieving complete observability of a power network, PMUs should be installed at about one-third of the total number of network buses. Due to the high expenses, TSOs and DSOs are not willing to integrate PMUs in the large scale. Consequently, by covering only small portions of the power grid, detailed snapshot of the power grid condition is not possible and complete benefit of such advanced monitoring units cannot be gained. This was the source of the motivation for presented master thesis. The contribution of the thesis is a development of the low-cost Phasor Measurement Unit, which performance complies with the IEEE C37.118.1 standard requirements. The prototype is based on Smart Discrete Fourier Transform technique for synchrophasor estimation.The algorithm is running on the embedded voltage sensor developed in Smart State Technology. During the research, the main question was how accurate performance of the prototype can be obtained by optimization of the algorithm to the processing power of the embedded sensor. The most optimal solution for staying within the sensor processing limitations and at the same time achieving the accurate performance of the algorithm is found in ADC sampling rate of 1kHz, non-recursive DFT approach and mean filtering performed on SDFT frequency estimates.","real-time monitoring; phasor measurement units; Embedded Systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","",""

These waves with very long wave periods, even up to minutes, are possibly dangerous for flood events, increased storm surge and/or failure of coastal defences. Current guidelines for dike safety are often determined for gravity wave dominated systems, so identifying IG dominated systems can be a tool to determine whether dike safety guidelines are sufficient or not. To analyse the IG waves, the non-hydrostatic simulation model SWASH is proposed. An extensive model validation was carried out, comparing the results of a lab experiment with the model output to assess the model’s accuracy to simulate the IG waves. Next, four parameters were chosen to be varied (offshore wave height and period, beach slope and vegetation type) to create several scenarios, mimicking real-life situations in the Wadden Sea and the Chesapeake Bay. To express the IG wave dominance, the Infragravity coefficient (IGC) is used, which is the low-frequency over the high-frequency wave height ratio. IG dominance is defined when the IGC&gt;1.0, and a very IG dominant system is defined when IGC&gt;2.0. For this study, the IGC is analysed at a dike toe. The effect of a slope on IG dominance shows that weak slopes (1:500) show very IG dominance overall, no matter the offshore conditions. As the slope gets steeper, the gravity waves start to dominate, starting at the lower wave heights. The wave heights show almost never IG dominance for low values (1m) and show more IG dominance as the offshore wave height increases. The offshore period has a minimal influence on IG dominance for short periods, but the IGC seems to decrease after an offshore period of 10s. This effect is mostly visible on steep slopes, and barely visible for weak slopes. When vegetation is added to the weak-sloped scenario (1:500), it is concluded that vegetation dissipates both the low -and high-frequency wave heights in case of low offshore wave heights (1 and 2m) and short periods (6 and 8s). For higher and longer waves, vegetation dissipates high-frequency gravity waves better than low-frequency IG waves. This shows an increase in IG dominance with the inclusion of vegetation. For very high and long waves (10m, 14s) the vegetation’s effect is minimal. These results from this study show that for a large number of scenarios, mainly for weak slopes, IG waves dominate over gravity waves.","CoMEM; infragravity dominance; infragravity waves; nature-based flood defences; numerical modelling; non-hydrostatic simulation; SWASH; vegetation","en","master thesis","","","","","","The Erasmus+: Erasmus Mundus MSc in Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management is an integrated programme including mobility organized by five European partner institutions, coordinated by Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).","","","","","","Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM)","",""

As the number of large scale electrolysers is projected to grow, it is important that the dynamics of these plants are well understood in order to integrate them successfully. In line with this objective, suitable models must be developed to aid studies of electrical power system dynamics with electrolysers configured as sources of ancillary services. This thesis report provides an overview on implementing practical models of large scale electrolysers (&gt;1 MW) for real time digital simulation and also proposes a control scheme to extend the basic capabilities of large scale electrolysers in order to provide ancillary services to the electrical power system.To illustrate the feasibility of creating such models, case studies are built on a one megawatt-scale plant connected to a high voltage infinite grid via step-down transformers. Real time simulations are performed by using the Real-Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) platform to investigate the response of the electrolyser model to external command signals and power system disturbances. The 1 MWmodel is also scaled to 300 MW with the view to qualitatively assess its performance, with respect to grid code compliance. The results show that the generic 1 MW model in RTDS can replicate the step response profile of a real electrolyser. The results also support the view that high level control schemes are a key enabler for ancillary services using large scale electrolysers. High level control schemes can enable an optimal operation of the electrolyser load on the basis of market and power system conditions.","Modelling; power to gas; large scale electrolyser; ancillary services; power system stability; hydrogen","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","Intelligent Electrical Power Grids",""

This thesis research is on the crossing located at the Sognefjord, the widest and deepest of the straight crossings in the E39 highway. Previous thesis projects at IV-Consult have yielded a design for a floating bridge supported on twenty-two pontoons. The bridge is moored using a sub-sea cable system. The bridge design reaches a height of 70 m at its 465 m wide mid-span and is dimensioned on the basis of static calculations of the structural elements. <br/>The goal of this thesis research is to calculate the dynamic response of the bridge system to environmental loads and to determine if the current bridge design is sufficient in relation to this response.<br/>To reach this goal, several models have been developed for the structural elements that compose the bridge; the continuous bridge deck girder, the pylons supporting this girder, the floating pontoons supporting these and the sub-sea cable mooring system fixing the structure in place.<br/>First a structural model for the bridge structure is developed with special attention being placed on the sub-sea mooring system. For these cables an internal design is made and a calculation method is developed to model and determine the internal hysteretic damping in the cables due to inter-wire friction. Second, a mechanical model describing the linear dynamic response of the pontoons for small rotations has been developed. The pontoons themselves are modelled as rigid bodies. Third, the bridge deck girder is modelled as an equivalent Euler-Bernoulli beam.<br/>Finally, a load model is developed for the wave and current loads at the bridge location. Diffraction theory is used to calculate wave loads on the large pontoons and the current loading is identified and modelled according to prevailing design codes. Six critical wave load cases are formulated. <br/>Models of the bridge structure are built using the SACS and Scia Engineer software packages. A non-linear solver is written in Python to implement the cable model for static calculation, utilizing Scia Engineer's non-linear solver. Verification calculations of SACS software results are performed. <br/>The steady state response of the bridge structure is calculated using SACS software for the six critical wave load cases formulated. In conjunction with this analysis, the cable damping is calculated according to the cable model. The bridge deck motion and cable fatigue damage are evaluated and are found to be well within design limits, leading to the conclusion that wave loading will not lead to critical failure in the bridge design. <br/>An analysis of vortex induced vibrations of the bridge system caused by cross-flow loading of the bridge pontoons is performed. The analysis is performed using Ansys Fluent in conjunction with the SACS Dynamic Response module to model the fluid-structure coupling. A large sensitivity to vortex induced vibrations is found for the bridge system, several potential solutions to this problem are presented and recommendations are made for further research into this phenomenon for the bridge design. <br/>A verification calculation of the Fluent-SACS model introduced in this thesis is performed using a coupled wake oscillator model. The verification is based on only the cross-flow motion of a single pontoon in the bridge system and yields comparable results in terms of load and displacement amplitudes for both models.","Structural dynamics; Vortex induced vibrations; Steel wire rope; Hysteretic damping; Wave loading; Floating structure; CFD","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","61.083753, 5.503247"

Recent developments in the area of sensors makes it possible to create networks consisting of a large number of nodes. The focus of this thesis will be optimizing distributed problems over a decentralized network. These distributed optimization schemes operate in an iterative matter as follows. First each node performs some local computations, after which the data is transmitted to its neighbours. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of approximating these local computations inexactly on the convergence of distributed optimization schemes. Although we consider many optimization schemes in general, the primal-dual method of multipliers (PDMM) is used during the simulations. Therefore we start off by deriving the inexact iteration for PDMM which shows how the inexactness propagates through the iterates. This derivation also suggests that the inexactness depends on the optimization constant, which was verified during the simulations. After that, the convergence of distributed optimization schemes is analyzed by making use of monotone operator theory to investigate under<br/>which conditions convergence will be reached. This convergence analysis has two main results. It firstly shows that distributed optimization schemes converge to a fixed point if the error is summable and secondly<br/>that an error has less influence as iterations pass. Thereafter simulations are presented that suggest that the inexactness affects how far the algorithm converges, thus what the remaining error is when convergence is<br/>reached. Decreasing the error when convergence is reached causes the inexact PDMM iteration to resume converging at the rate of the standard PDMM algorithm. These observations holds in synchronous as well as asynchronous operation. Introducing packet loss only influences the convergence rate of the inexact PDMM iteration.","Distributed Optimization; Convex functions; Inexact; monotone operators; convergence analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The rising waters bring greater risk of floods, submergence of low lying land, salinization of freshwater supplies, and the erosion of sandy beaches. Quantifying these impacts spurns action by those hoping to adapt to changing environmental conditions, but sea level rise acts at such large scales that this quantification proves difficult. Dynamic Interactive Vulnerability Analysis (DIVA) provides this capacity by modelling the growth of society parallel to environmental forcing from IPCC scenarios and human adaptation measures in the coastal zone. This thesis attempts to use new information and technology to expand existing tools which quantify the impacts of beach erosion due to sea level rise and human adaptation using beach nourishment on a global scale. This echoes earlier work by (Hinkel et al., 2013). To accomplish this task, a methodology is developed to conduct and aggregate large amounts of information into the DIVA coastal database, and a secondary global risk model develops refined nourishment adaptation cost information. <br/>Data collection over the large scales covered by the DIVA model is difficult, and existing approximations within the model are categorically applied to poorly resolved datasets and archived information. Recent developments in remote sensing created a new database which indicates the location of beaches at a global scale. The utility of this information is the primary motivation for this study. Similarly, adaptation costs in DIVA are not well resolved, and available expert judgment is leveraged to allow more insight into these practices. <br/>These modifications have complex individual interactions with human coastal development, and simple superposition is not an effective tool to predict their combined impact. The locations most significantly impacted by the modifications are typically island states previously categorized without beaches. Adaptation favors wealthy locations with a large population density. The costs of lost land and forced migration in these areas outweigh adaptation costs by substantial margins in some cases, and nourishment .<br/>Recreation of the Hinkel et al. study is not possible with the current DIVA architecture, and the lack of reasoned relation to this work limits interpretation. As a large scale model using aggregated parameters, DIVA is limited by its ignorance of local-level processes. Further limitations include a lack of resolved information for secondary erosive forcing from tidal basins, whose impacts are included, yet not specifically addressed.<br/>DIVA does address the question of vulnerability at a national level, and can inform decision makers on the costs and protections provided through adaptation. It can highlight the growth and development of adaptation measures in response to sea level rise and weigh them against the cost of inaction. In doing so, DIVA highlights areas where pretection is economically feasible and viable for the mitigation of sea-level-rise-induced beach erosion.","Sea level rise; DIVA; Beach erosion; Global assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","The Erasmus+: Erasmus Mundus MSc in Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management is an integrated programme including mobility organized by five European partner institutions, coordinated by Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).","","2019-04-01","","","","Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM)","",""

During these surgeries, which are performed with open surgery, clamps are placed around the bone to protect the surrounding soft tissue from accidental jumping<br/>of the saw blade. These clamps however do not protect the soft tissue properly from the jumping and they damage the soft tissue when being applied. The clamps, the jumping and the open surgery all cause a longer healing time for the patient. Therefore, the orthopaedic surgeons of the AMC desire a novel solution for a bone sectioning device which can be applied minimally invasive and used with as little as possible tissue damage. From an earlier conducted literature review it was decided to use a wire saw, since it is cheap, small and cuts away from the soft tissue. The goal of this project is therefore: Designing a novel instrument or method for minimally invasive sectioning of bone using a wire saw.<br/><br/>To design a new instrument, a structured process needs to be followed, to be able to optimize the instrument from the first steps onward. First a list of requirements was set up from which design challenges have been derived. A brainstorming phase resulted in several solutions to the design challenges. These solutions were combined in a morphological table from which three concepts were derived. These concepts were judged using a Harris profile, from which one concept was chosen to be elaborated further. This concept was<br/>thought out and was based on automated actuation. Based on a procedural assessment this design was considered too complicated, which is why the decision was made to stop using automated actuation. The next iteration was therefore focused on a solution using manual actuation. This design was based on one tube, which guided the two wire saw ends into the soft tissue. After a quick experiment however, it was discovered that the used wire saw had a minimum bending radius,which caused the second iteration to be unable to perform the intended operation. Therefore, a new design has been created using two guiding tubes. This design has been made into a prototype. The prototype has afterwards been used in an experiment in the pathology department. Apart from testing the working principle, the duration of the procedure, the surrounding tissue damage and the quality of cut were tested. In a questionnaire, the workload, the opinion on the shape and size of the surgeon and additional feedback were asked. Also a discussion was held with an expert of a CSD department to check if the prototype is properly cleanable and sterilizable.<br/><br/>The prototype was not able to section the bone completely, it was again hindered by the minimum bending radius of the wire saw. The duration of the procedure was long, but because of the inability to fully section the bone. The duration will be better measurable with a fully sectioning prototype. The assembly of the prototype was fast even though it was the first time the surgeon used it. The surrounding tissue damage was very little, which is very promising. The flatness of the cut was relatively high, which is preferable for the operations this project is focused on. The workload is relatively high compared to literature.<br/>The opinion of the surgeon on the size and shape was low, due to ergonomics and the bulkiness of the prototype. According to the expert of the CSD department, the prototype was properly cleanable and sterilizable except for some minor details. A new initial design based on the findings was made with tubes under an angle of 45 degrees to increase the bending radius of the wire saw during the operation.<br/><br/>The design of a method for sectioning bone with as little soft tissue damage as possible was partially successful. The designed system was not able to fully section the bone, however it was capable of sectioning the majority of it. The soft tissue damage was very low and the flatness of the cut was acceptable.<br/>The design can be improved by either optimizing the used wire saw, or increasing the bending angle of the wire saw during the sectioning procedure.","Minimally invasive surgery; wire saw; orthopedic surgery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-09","","","","","",""

Until now, the most used composite in building materials, natural wood, has not been used in an additive manufacturing process. The potential of using wood in<br/>an additive manufacturing process lies in the complex shapes which could be made, the savings of materials, the wood properties which could be used in a more optimal way and the ease to reproduce an object with high accuracy without the costs of labor. This research will investigate if there are options to use wood in an additive manufacturing process such as 3d printing. The question to answer is; Can wood be used in an additive manufacturing<br/>process? Study design - This research is based on a broad literature survey on the topics of wood, additive manufacturing and state of the art of 3d printing wood. This is followed by an exploration phase where various material mixes are made and tested in a qualitative way in order to get an understanding of the behaviour of the material. The materials are extruded with medical syringes and later on with a 3d printer to see how they behave in this process. Finally a design is made what shows the potential of this material in 3d printing. Focus - This study focusses on the use of the materials cellulose and lignin, which are combined in a 3d printable material. The process is based on the soluble character of lignin, and therefore does not work with a temperature gradient. The materials which are used are Skogcell 90Z bleached kraft WFBR and Indulin AT lignin, both retrieved from softwood in the kraft process and are fully biobased. This research describes a limited amount of material mixes, based on the input materials. Results - Theory about wood and its main components is translated into a production process which leads to a wood based 3d printable material. Material mixes with a content up to 20% of cellulose are tested and printed with a syringe. Materials containing up to 11 % of cellulose are printed with a 3d printer.

Both regular and bichromatic wave experiments were carried out. The focus lies on the regular waves experiments. Six regular wave experiments were carried out. During the first two experiemnts, cnoidal waves were generated with typical swell scales, while the latter four experiments involved waves with scales similar to infragravity waves. High-resolution collocated measurements of surface elevation and velocity allowed proper separation of incoming and outgoing wave components at 11 positions along the reef. This made a detailed analysis of wave transformation over the reef flat and run-up measurements on the beach possible. A collocated decomposition method has been developed which takes into account the effects of nonlinearity and dispersion, and can be used for deforming waves on the reef flat. The incoming and outgoing waves are given in terms of discharge or free surface elevation. For all wave conditions, undular bores develop over the reef flat and well-developed undulations are observed at the beach toe. The processes leading to the development of the undulations are however quite different for the different wave conditions. For the swell cases, the wave front steepens considerably on the fore-reef slope and the waves subsequently break violently at the reef crest. The breaking bore then decays progressively until it stops breaking and start forming undulations at mid reef. The IG-scale waves stay relatively symmetric about the vertical during the shoaling process on the fore-reef. The front only becomes steeper on the reef flat, and does not break turbulently for all IG-scale cases. For some cases the steepening process continues and is directly followed by formation of undulations. For the more energetic IG-scale cases the front first breaks turbulently. The rate at which the waves steepen on the reef flat depends, as expected, on the wave height and wave length. This is in concordance with the theory of Stoker; larger and shorter waves steepen faster than smaller and longer waves. Consequently, shorter shallow water waves starts forming undulations earlier on and feature more developed undulations when they arrive at the beach. The cross-shore evolution of the total variance clearly reflects these differences in behaviour. The cases involving strong breaking (i.e. the swell cases) show a rapid decrease of the variance at the outer reef flat, while the IG wave cases involving no breaking experience a slow decay of energy, most probably due to bottom and wall friction. The leading undulation is generally the largest and propagates faster than the trailing undulations due to amplitude dispersion. The leading undulation progressively separates from the rest of the wave train, and ultimately resembles a solitary wave when it arrives at the toe of the beach. Nonlinear steepening is associated with generation of higher harmonics at a multiple of the primary frequency. The undulations are also higher harmonics, but form a secondary peak instead a tail of decreasing energy in the spectrum. This secondary peak shifts towards lower frequencies as the undular bore travels over the reef. Moreover, the reflection coefficient is larger for a larger offshore period and wave height. The relative magnitude of HF bulk energy with respect to energy in the LF band near the beach differs per experiment. For the swell waves and IG-scale waves with smaller periods, the major part of LF energy is transferred to the HF band due to undular bore formation. For the cases that involve wave breaking, energy dissipation is, at least initially, the main mechanism for energy loss in the LF band. However, as energy decay continues and the bore becomes weaker, radiation of energy at the front by means of formation of undulations can take over this role. The undulations break while running up the beach. The signature of the first undulations is clearly visible in the run-up signal. It is shown that the leading undulation governs maximum run-up. More specifically, we demonstrate that empirically derived formulas for the run-up of breaking solitary waves are able to predict the maximum run-up accurately, when the characteristics of the leading undulation at the beach toe are used. Two types of empirical formulations were presented, of which only requires a single parameter to be estimated from data. This empirical formula, formally valid for solitary waves, can be used for run-up estimation of undular bores. Given the current fit, maximum run-up can be estimated for a given reef if the beach slope is known.","Undular bores; Fringing coral reefs; Infragravity waves; wave runup; collocated decomposition; experimental modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the rapidly increasing amounts of data being collected, analyzing large-scale graphs has become a necessity. To address this need, many dedicated graph analysis frameworks have been developed in recent years. However, their performance is poorly understood. In this thesis, our goal is to improve insight into the performance of graph analysis frameworks. We design the Graphalytics ecosystem, a set of complementary systems for understanding the performance of graph analysis frameworks, with a focus on two key components. First, we design, implement, and evaluate Graphalytics, a comprehensive benchmark for graph analysis frameworks that facilitates the comparison of performance between these frameworks. Second, we design, implement, and evaluate Grade10, a system for automated, in-depth performance analysis of graph analysis frameworks. Through experimental evaluation of the Graphalytics ecosystem, we gain insight into the performance of six modern graph analysis frameworks.","Graphalytics; Grade10; graph analysis; performance analysis; benchmark; resource attribution; bottleneck identification; performance issue identification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After their discovery many applications followed, such as the MR clutch and MR damper. In these applications the fluids are subjected to ultra high shear rates although no knowledge is available on what happens to the rheological properties under these conditions. In general, the characteristics determined on lower shear rates are extrapolated and used to design new devices. Magnetorheological fluids have potential in the high tech and high precision applications and their properties need to be known in particular at shear rates around 106 [1/s]. Commercially available magnetorheometers are not able to measure these fluids at ultra high shear rates and are limited to 105 [1/s]. Therefore a new magnetorheometer is required to measure ultra high shear rates. In this thesis the physical limitations of current measuring principles are analysed and a concept is designed for ultra high shear rate rheometry in combination with a magnetic field. A prototype is fabricated and the techniques used are described. The prototype is tested and compared to a state of the art commercial rheometer. The test results of the prototype rheometer for MR fluids show its capability to measure fluids to a range of 10^4 [1/s] to 1.16x10^6 [1/s] and the capability to measure the magnetorheological effect of MR fluids.","Ferrofluids; Magnetorheological fluids; MR fluids; Rheometer; Rheology; Viscometry; Viscometer; Capillary rheometer; magnetic fluid; magnetorheometer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-16","","","","","",""

These activities include sitting, dynamic sitting, lying with face up and face down, lying to the left and right, standing, dynamic standing, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, walking, running, and cycling. The Controlled Study showed that most of these activities could be detected accurately using accelerometer data from both sensors with 91.83% F1-score. Similarly, the combination of these two sensors achieved the best performance for the Free-Living Study with 86.98% F1-score. Finally, this work proved that between the two environments a correlation could be possible only for the activity cycling.

The expensive servo motor drives are replaced by dedicated microcontrollers, allowing the actuators to make their own decisions based on the constraints imposed by various standards of tray sizes and other circumstances. A method is presented to derive the most favourable trajectories, which are then enforced on the system through a closed-loop feedback system. The resulting performance approaches that of the system's predecessor, but at a much more reasonable price.

The available data has the potential to indicate the health state of individual components based on which their maintenance requirements can be determined, a maintenance strategy called Condition Based Maintenance. Predictive Maintenance is a specific condition based maintenance strategy that aims to determine these requirements in advance by predicting failures from the sensor data. It has the potential to reduce costly unanticipated maintenance or unnecessarily conservative maintenance. In the short term it could add significant value for components that are currently subject to a reactive maintenance policy. In the long term it could potentially disrupt the traditional maintenance practice of periodic inspection. One of the main challenges in applying Predictive Maintenance in the aviation industry is translating the large amounts of sensor data into a reliable failure prediction, a process called prognostics.<br/><br/>In this study, state-of-the-art machine learning, and specifically deep learning models, have been investigated for their potential for prognostics. A case study has been performed at KLM Royal Dutch Airlines on the Boeing 747 Bleed Air Valves, traditionally some of the most challenging components from a maintenance perspective.

Human developments have reduced the amount of fine sediments delivered to the Bay-Delta system in recent years, which threatens habitat restoration initiatives and suitable water quality in the southern reach of the Bay (South Bay), where an ample supply of fine sediments is needed to support tidal flat development and to maintain conditions that limit the excessive growth of algae populations. A better understanding of how sediments enter and are redistributed within South Bay is needed to anticipate how the dynamics and supply of fine sediments will change under future conditions.   <br/><br/>In this study, a pair of process-based numerical models was applied to investigate fine sediment pathways in San Francisco Bay. An offline coupling between a DELWAQ water quality model and a Delft3D FM hydrodynamics model provides an efficient method to study suspended sediment transport in large, complex systems.   The DELWAQ model was applied to various hydrodynamic scenarios to better understand the effects of wind, density-driven flows, and freshwater discharge on sediment dynamics in San Francisco Bay. The results suggest that sediment import and export at the mouth of South Bay is linked to density-driven circulation induced by horizontal salinity gradients between South Bay and Central Bay. During years with particularly high volumes of freshwater discharge from the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers, South Bay is more likely to import sediments, and extreme pulses of freshwater were shown to enhance sediment connectivity between North Bay and South Bay. Sediment exchange between the channel and the flats in South Bay is facilitated by the tide, and wind wave resuspension influences the magnitude of sediment fluxes into and within the southern reach.   <br/><br/>This study advances our understanding of sediment dynamics in the complex San Francisco Bay estuary. With further validation, the DELWAQ model developed in this research can be used as a tool to predict system response to future conditions brought on by climate change and human-induced alterations to the watershed. Large-scale management decisions regarding the Bay Area and the Central Valley could alter the long-term trajectory of the estuary and determine whether it will maintain ecological viability while adapting to changing hydrodynamic and environmental conditions. Insights learned from sediment transport modelling can adequately capacitate the Bay's leadership as well as countless population-dense estuaries around the world confronting analogous challenges. <br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","The Erasmus+: Erasmus Mundus MSc in Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management is an integrated programme including mobility organified by five European partner institutions, coordinated by Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).","","","","","","Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM)","","37.773972, -122.431297"

(mentor); Bricker, J.D. (mentor); Yang, Y. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Highway bridges along the coast and small river bridges in mountainous regions can be submerged during storm surges or strong rainfall events, respectively. Loss of serviceability during these conditions can dramatically hamper the evacuation plan and the capacity for emergency transportation, thus it is essential to ensure the stability of bridges in extreme hydrological events. Correct estimates of the hydrodynamic forces on a bridge allows bridge designers to evaluate the robustness of the bridge in a more sophisticated approach rather than relying on a constant force magnitude obtained from a small range of physical tests. <br/>This study presents numerical simulations performed to quantify the hydrodynamic forces on a bridge deck with a rectangular cross section. The results of the numerical model are validated against the results of physical experiments. More than 700 simulations were performed to thoroughly investigate the effect of certain parameters on the flow field and forces on the deck. The parameters considered include: the water level, the Froude number, the blockage ratio, the proximity of the deck to the channel floor, the inclination of the deck, and the aspect ratio of the deck.<br/> The lift force is found to be downward unless the deck is significantly submerged i.e., inundation ratio (h*) is greater than 3.5, and the upstream velocity is relatively small, Frd&lt;0.6. For h*&lt;3.5 the development of flow patterns on the upper side of the deck is constrained by the presence of the free surface which causes an asymmetric pressure distribution in the vertical direction and ultimately results in a downward force. Increase in flow velocity results in a higher downward force and hence increase the bridge stability (provided that the submergence of the bridge is not too high, h*&lt;4). When considering the trend of changes in lift and drag forces simultaneously, it can be said that the combination of small velocities and inundation ratios higher than 2 results in the most critical situation for the vertical stability of the bridge deck.<br/> An increase in the blockage ratio results in an increase in the drag coefficient. On the other hand, a decrease in the blockage ratio shifts the drag coefficient towards the value of 1.56, which corresponds to the drag coefficient of a rectangular cylinder in an unbounded flow. Considering the common flow conditions of practical interest for bridge designers, the upper boundary of the drag coefficient for the box deck was found to be 2.8. Incipient failure analysis is performed to establish a hydrodynamic situation that can cause the failure of the deck. Regardless of the proximity ratio and the Froude number, the bridge deck collapsed when the inundation ratio was higher than 1.3. This indicates that the deck is more susceptible to high water levels than to flood velocity or to the distance to the channel floor. Moreover, no bridge failure occurred for inundation ratios lower than 1.3, indicating that the deck must be deeply submerged to fail. By extracting the starting point of failure for a wide range of inundation ratios, proximity ratios, and Froude numbers, contour lines of the threshold of failure are drawn. These contour lines representing the starting point of failure provide the basis for more accurate estimates of the failure of the bridge due to flood loadings and can be considered to be included in the bridge design codes and guidelines. In fact, this proposed method is more reliable than the traditional method which assumes a constant value for drag and lift. The traditional methods are still present in some guidelines such as the AASHTO Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) Bridge Design Specifications.<br/> Attaching wing-shaped structures on the sides of the deck was proposed as a countermeasure to avoid failure of the bridge decks. Although the projected area of the deck perpendicular to the direction of flow was kept constant, it was expected that CD, CL, and CM would change; since they are dependent on the geometry of the deck, and the flow pattern is altered significantly due to the presence of wings. Results of several simulations for six different shape of wings under different inundation ratio and Froude number indicated that a rational shape of the wings can significantly alter the flow pattern around the deck and postpone occurrence of failure during conditions of really high water levels (h*&gt;2.5) and high flood velocity (Fr&gt;0.65). The proposed countermeasure can be considered as a robust solution for the wide range of probable floods, because of the fact that firstly, occurrence of this extreme hydrological situation is rare, and secondly, the stability of the deck in that situation might not be the first priority, especially compared with the risk of flooding a large part of the upstream land.","CoMEM; Fluent; hydrodynamic forces; bridge deck; drag; lift; moment; numerical simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","The Erasmus+: Erasmus Mundus MSc in Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management is an integrated programme including mobility organized by five European partner institutions, coordinated by Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).","","","","","","Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM)","",""

(graduation committee); Volker, L. (mentor); Hombergen, L.P.I.M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Public construction projects have an image of poor performance, both in the Netherlands and other countries. Too many public projects go over budget and over time. A possible improvement to this poor performance could be Early Contractor Involvement (ECI). ECI literally translates to involving a contractor “early”, which in current practice implies that the contractor is involved before the design phase. As a more unambiguous definition was missing for this principle in the Netherlands, this research identified two varieties of ECI; a consulting form (like a market consultation) or a contracting form, where the contractor is contracted during the final stages of the initiation phase. ECI is suggested in literature to be a promising option to improve public construction projects in the Netherlands, but literature is split on what ECI is and what the benefits are. This thesis study aims to identify the effects, implications and implementation of ECI in the Netherlands. From this study, eight potential benefits of ECI have been identified by means of a Delphi study. Some examples of these benefits are improved risk assessment, risk distribution, higher project quality and higher certainties in both costs and planning. However, reaping these benefits requires preparation and experiments with projects using ECI. There currently seems to be no initiatives with ECI on the agenda, except the refurbishment project of the Hoevelaken intersection.<br/>To implement ECI in the Dutch public construction industry, this research found several conditions to implement and use ECI. Firstly, the role division of the client, design firm and contractor should be done differently. Secondly, the distribution of the risks must change. And thirdly, procurement may have to be specifically designed for ECI. In addition to these conditions, there are three barriers to overcome. These barriers are primarily concerned with the client side of the market. The client fears the early commitment to just one contractor and finds it hard to secure the competition in the market properly when ECI is used. Following these two barriers is a third; there is a lack of determination to experiment and implement ECI. To help overcome these barriers, four incentives are identified to be applied simultaneously:<br/>• An investment from the public sector to experiment with ECI,<br/>• Design of a proper exit-clause to terminate the contract,<br/>• The use of Past-Performance criteria for procuring projects with ECI,<br/>• The application of incentives on contractor behavior.<br/>When ECI is implemented in public construction in the Netherlands, ECI will have implications on both public construction projects and the construction industry. In procurement the criteria other than price are likely to become more important, as price is unrealistic to test on so early in a project. Contractors will have to develop their advising role and expand their designing/engineering capacity. As their expertise and capabilities develop, design and engineering work is likely to flow from the design firms to the contractors. The engineering expertise of the client must expand as well, to be able to communicate on the same level as the contractors to prevent communication errors and opportunistic behavior.<br/>This research suggests that ECI can indeed improve public projects on several aspects, but if there are too few experiments to develop and improve the concept it is unlikely to see implementation soon. As communication, perseverance and determination are key in experimenting with something new, this thesis advocates investing in ECI experiments with people who are capable and willing to try to make ECI work. Proper preparation and learning from the experiments will create forward momentum. When forward momentum is gained, ECI could be disproved to work or be proved a working innovation in the construction market, marking the next market improvement on the road to collaboration in the construction industry.","ECI; Early Contractor Involvement; Public Construction Projects; Netherlands; Construction industry; Delphi Study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

There is a kind of beauty in this scene. <br/><br/>Contradiction between the rough concrete volumes defeated by asoft, ephemeral and seemingly delicate mass of water was the beginning of the research. Analysing the biggest territorial scale -the North Sea- the notion of “clashes” re-appeared. Historically, the North Sea was always an area of conflict. The constant fight between nature and the people trying to harness its power is it its very essence. In this context Atlantic wall seems to be the most contemporary example of the conflict on the area of the North Sea. Remains of Hitler’s plan stretch along the whole coast and in that sense are a direct translation of the territorial scale of the “war” into the architectural one- of a singular building- a bunker. <br/><br/>Yet, the conflict around the Atlantic war was in fact deemed to be a failure from the beginning. From the 15 000 bunkers planned only 6000 were realized by 1943. Then, suddenly, without any actual battle, the war ended. Observing the horizon was the only task of the soldiers until the war came to an end. The “absence” of the war is the essence of this narrative. Conditions of waiting, observing and experiencing the present moment surrounded by nature became a base for guidance and exploration.<br/><br/>Being part of theWadden Sea protected area, the location on the island of Terschelling emphasizes the contrast between the solid bunkers and dynamics of nature. Wadden Sea Islands are known for beautiful constantly changing dunes, inhabited by rich fauna and flora and influenced by regular tidal flows. One of many strong points on the island is the one located just next to the sea-shore, on top of the highest dune was chosen. It consisted of several buildings that were spread around that dune, serving primarily as an observation point.<br/><br/>Now, many years after the bunkers were placed there, some still remain. The passage of time and power of nature has however, changed them. They’ve became ruins. Some walls fell apart, some volumes tilted and moved, some were covered by the sand and overgrown by the grass. The “present ruinous state” of the remnants of the Atlantic Wall was understood here as the fundamental and relevant experience of the history itself and the starting point for the design. Instead of protecting against the forces, the project tries to use them as the main actors in the architectonic setting. The dominant, always present, unstoppable forces of nature are the base for design decisions. The way of <br/>dealing with the knowledge was a strongly intuitive approach, mixing scientific knowledge with atmospheric perception of the nature. Inspiration for dealing with the composition, landscape and the ruins of the bunkers was taken from the archaeological excavation sites- the calculated geometric intervention against the vast masses of land in search of the “treasure” was to be used as the main concept in the design. The project relates to the landscape and experience of walking through the dunes. The wild nature is interpreted into rational concept. The different spaces and their architectonic qualities lead the visitor through subsequent spaces, constantly referring to the context. <br/><br/>The ritual experience begins by leaving the village or the parking area and entering through one of two gates. From a distance, only some of the bunker ruins and the skylights protruding through the sand are visible. Only when cutting through the ground and the building inside are the dimensions of the places revealed. The main buildings are almost all underground and are developed by taking from the architectural language of the bunkers. <br/><br/><br/>The project tries to anticipate the flows of nature and takes the future time into consideration. Even though the building has a function to serve people at the beginning, it doesn’t have to be occupied all the time. It is a monument and its future role is to be there, in the constant condition of anticipation. Following the story of the bunkers that were left on sand to become ruins the concrete buildings are also going to stay and slowly deteriorate. <br/><br/>The cycle will close waiting for yet another chapter.<br","Delta Interventions; North Sea; Heritage; Atlantic Wall; Bunkers; Wadden Sea","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","North Sea: Landscapes of Coexistence","53.406517, 5.294148"

However, the waiting list with patients who are in need of a new liver is long, because too few good-quality donor livers are available. New techniques in the field of tissue engineering are being investigated to create a reconstructed liver, which might offer a solution for the shortage of transplantable livers. In this study, after decellularization had been performed, the potential of recellularization of porcine liver grafts with liver-derived organoids was researched. In advance of organoid recellularization, the reseeding protocol was optimized by studying different flow rates and different numbers of cell injections in recellularization experiments with HepG2 cells. A flow rate of either 5 ml/min or 11 ml/min was used. The experiments were performed by multi-step perfusion of either 4 or 10 cell injections inside the perfusion system. In addition to optimization experiments and experiments with organoids, reendothelialization of vascular structures inside a porcine liver graft was tested by HUVEC reseeding. The results of these experiments have shown that regarding cellular spreading, cell position and cells viability, the optimal parameters are a flow rate of 5 ml/min and 10 injections. Furthermore, this study has shown that it is possible to culture HepG2 cells, HUVECs as well as organoids inside a porcine liver graft, and that it is possible to keep the cells viable for up to one week. Organoid reseeding was successful and the organoids have shown their organoid-like behaviour. Although more experiments should be done, organoid reseeding has shown to be a promising cell type for recellularization of liver grafts.","Recellularization; liver; organoid; tissue engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Medical Instruments and Medical Safety (MIMS)","",""

(mentor); Mulders, S.P. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","br/>Wind energy currently is one of the most attractive solutions to help in the goal of switching to a more sustainable way of energy production. To stay competitive with other forms of energy production, the reduction of the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCoE) is an important indicator. One way of achieving this goal is by increasing the size of the wind turbine. As a result, the increased blade length also comes with a significant increase in fatigue loads present on the wind turbine’s rotating and fixed structure.<br/><br/>Individual Pitch Control (IPC) forms an interesting opportunity in attenuating these fatigue loads. IPC is generally applied with the help of the Multi-Blade Coordinate (MBC-) transformation. The IPC control strategy uses the Out-of-Plane (OoP) bending moments measured on each blade. The MBC-transformation transforms the measured OoP bending moments towards the non-rotating reference frame. As a result the OoP bending moments are transformed into non-rotating yaw- and tilt-moments. The minimisation of these signals is then used as a control objective. Subsequently, the provided non-rotating control signals are then transformed back to the rotating domain to obtain the implementable individual pitch signals.<br/><br/>In the literature this controller synthesis is often employed by two separately operating Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) control loops. Whereby implicitly (or sometimes explicitly) assuming that the yaw- and tilt-moments are sufficiently decoupled to make this type of control viable. In the literature, a recent frequency domain analysis has shown that the coupling is non-negligible. Literature suggests that the introduction of an offset in the inverse MBC-transformation can help decouple these yaw- and tilt-moments, although this offset is usually found in a heuristic manner and its real effects are unknown.<br/><br/>In this study a thorough analysis on the effects of the azimuth offset is given on simplified and high-fidelity models. It is shown that the choice of blade-dynamic model structures has a significant effect on the analysis for maximum decoupling. It is also shown that a first-order model approximation is able to locate the ideal offset of a complex high-fidelity non-linear wind turbine model, which is subsequently verified by simulations and a sensitivity function analysis.","Individual Pitch Control; Wind Energy; Wind Turbine; fatigue load reduction; coleman; multi-blade coordinate transformation; azimuth offset; offset","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Additionally, after trauma, it can naturally regenerate into fresh, fully functional bone tissue. However, several factors can significantly impede the healing process and cause the formation of non-union tissue. Costs for hospitalization and treatments that prevent such non-unions can become a significant personal and socio-economic burden. To develop more efficient treatments<br/>that can tackle this, a thorough understanding of the bone fracture healing process is needed. It is currently known that bone heals via a multistage sequential process of inflammation, soft-callus formation, hard-callus formation and then bone remodelling. Moreover, during this process there is a need for restoration of a vascular network for nutrient delivery and waste removal. Whereas the regulation of vascular network during later stages is understood, knowledge of the mechanisms and<br/>driving forces of vascularization during earlier phases in bone healing is currently lacking. Nevertheless, during this process, cell migration towards the site of fracture is of great importance. This process is affected through a range of extracellular signals, which are dependent on the properties of the extracellular matrix. It has been shown that the structural properties and the composition of the fracture tissue are two of the key regulators in guiding cellular migration. This study has integrated the use of a novel electrospinning technique to mimic the effects of the early fracture composition on (endothelial) cell migration. Fibrinogen and gelatin fibers, which are reflective of the early fracture environment, have been spun using an acidic solvent system. Characterization of the fibers showed that the electrospinning process caused minor changes in the protein structure of fibrinogen, and none in that of gelatin. Furthermore, endothelial cells were cultured with a cell free zone on top of<br/>fibrinogen and gelatin patterned substrates to mimic cell migration during fracture revascularization. Cellular migration increased with higher fiber density, and gelatin fibers generally showed higher rates of cell migration. Furthermore, gelatin fibers showed higher amounts of cell polarization than fibrinogen fibers, likely driven by the higher stiffness of gelatin fibers. Moreover, the addition of fibers showed to<br/>reflect different modes of in vivo vascularization of cell migration on the substrates. To further analyze the effects of fracture composition on endothelial cell migration, fiber membranes were electrospun on a transwell-like device, and cell migration from a fibrin gel was assessed. The physical constraints posed by the fiber membranes were shown to impede cellular migration from the fibrin gel, and no significant differences were found between cell migration on the membranes. Overall, it became evident<br/>that the structural properties and the composition of the fibrous micro-environment regulate cellular migration, and can in turn affect the bone regeneration as a whole. Ultimately, further optimization and characterization of the used models are needed, such that they can more closely reflect the fracture healing environment.","cell migration; electrospinning; fracture healing; fibrinogen; gelatin; fibers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-07-21","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Tissue Biomechanics and Implants","",""

The microorganisms that are abundantly present during peri-implant infections are Staphylococcus bacteria and a variety of other less abundant bacteria as for example Escherichia coli. For this reason, some studies have been focusing on creating nanopatterns that might reduce bacterial colonization when used as implant surface topography. However, most of this research showed that the specified nanopatterns were only exceedingly bactericidal to either Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria. The aim of this novel study is to investigate the bactericidal effects of nanopatterns with pillar diameter of ~ 80 nm, a height of ~ 190 nm and an interpillar distance of ~ 170 nm on Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative Escherichia coli. The patterns were incubated with S. aureus and E. coli for 18 hours at 37 °C in their specific growth medium. The bactericidal effects were examined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) by assessing the bacterial cell morphology and the amount of damaged bacterial cells found on the patterns. The patterns were able to damage approximately 96.9 ± 1.2% of E. coli and 83.9 ± 22.8% of S. aureus cells. The severity of bacterial cell damage has led to believe that the percentage of dead bacterial cells was a sufficient measure for the bactericidal efficacy of the pattern. Based on these results there is a convincing assumption that these specific pillar parameters can be used as a bactericidal surface topography on bone implants. Nevertheless, follow up experiments should be done in combination with live imaging of the cells to establish possible long-term bacterial- and host cell effects on topography and gain more insights into the proposed bactericidal mechanism(s).","Topography; Bactericidal properties; electron beam induced deposition; Implant","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-07-16","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

For Bitcoin, the least volatile of the four, we found an annual volatility of approximately 70% based on daily exchange rates.

To reach the goal of an 80% reduction of CO2 emission by 2050, the total residential heat consumption would need to be drastically cut down. The Dutch government is leaning towards implementing large-scale heating networks and reusing waste heat from non-renewable industry. However, doubts exist whether or not that is the most viable solution. Other research lacks an overlapping approach to the modelling of a complex problem like the heating transition. The aim of this paper is to make a GIS-based framework to develop scenarios for the heating transition in cities and evaluate the implementation of different combinations of technologies to reach the Dutch climate goals. This analysis focusses on residential buildings because there is an ongoing discussion who is going to pay for the investment necessary to achieve the heating transition for this type of building. The case study of this paper focusses on the Merenwijk in the city of Leiden in the Netherlands<br/><br/>The technologies covered in this paper are heat pumps, low temperature heating networks and high temperature heating networks. These technologies are evaluated on their technical, financial and environmental aspects to determine their impact. Next to these impacts the trade-offs of implementing these technologies are evaluated and which impact these could have on the stakeholders involved. Three scenarios were made to cover a few combinations of these technologies: 1) a scenario based on the warmtevisie from Leiden utilizing heat pumps and low temperature heating networks; 2) a scenario utilizing only heat pumps; and 3) a scenario implementing low and high temperature heating networks for the whole neighbourhood. <br/>All technologies have specific characteristics which should be considered before implementing on a large scale. Financial assistance from the municipality or the government is needed for the home owners in order to achieve the heating transition within 32 years. The energy sources used by the heating technologies will be crucial for reaching the climate goals. At some point the Dutch government has to choose between a quick wins solution by reusing waste heat from the harbour of Rotterdam, or to implement a long term sustainable energy transition with heat pumps and low temperature heating networks. This paper provides an overview of the three mentioned heating technologies to be implemented during the heating transition as an alternative to natural gas. Moreover, it will hopefully invoke some debate about the Dutch government’s heating transition agenda.","Heating transition; GIS","en","master thesis","","","","","","The Master's programme Industrial Ecology is jointly organised by Leiden University and Delft University of Technology.","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

Current diagnostic tools for the detection of malignancies of the skin (MM cancer) include histological, optical, ultrasound, and impedance-based techniques. The inadequacies of the first three practices are overwhelmed by the Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) method. EIS overcomes reported spatiotemporal tradeoffs as a label-free and optics-free analytical method. Yet, MM’s enhanced heterogeneity and metastatic potential still results in misdiagnosis, or late diagnosis leading to stages characterized by high mortality rates. Important biological information and processing ability on single-cell level is missing. Single-cell dynamics recorded with a high-throughput system, contain important biological information on the heterogeneous subpopulations which are responsible for the MM aggressiveness.This project aims to investigate experimentally the possibility and capabilities of such a bioassay development, create working protocols and generate a fundamental basis for analysis and interpretation of the big-data-sets which derive from Impedance monitoring from a high-throughput transducer.Experiments were performed, employing two diverse, human-derived, MM cancer cell-lines, and using a high-throughput HD-MEA system with a 1024-channel impedance readout unit developed at IMEC, in Belgium. The measurements were realized at 1kHz aiming to extract Rseal information. The main proposal presents an experimental protocol of mid-term and long-term experiments Temporal and spatial resolutions were enhanced (Control System Automation), allowing for implementation of an experimental set to test the assay’s capabilities and determine any necessary additions to make the assay more robust for research (i.e. Z-Map, templates and scripts for OriginLab and Matlab, statistical methods for validation of findings on the big-data sets, optimizations in the experimental process, etc).Experimental results proved the optics-free specification of the assay with the utilization of an Impedance colormap, which was validated by comparing it to confocal images after measurements. Electrode-size and normalization techniques were deemed crucial factors that affected the variance of the results for the largest and smallest electrode sizes.

A proposal for a new type of analysis on the Impedance data is presented; it is an example-based approach to extract the classification and heterogeneity information of normalized IM measurements, by obtaining and analyzing the trends of impedance variance over time, per electrode.The bioassay proposal that was developed and tested in this project shows potential for both classification and heterogeneity studies for MM cancer.

Literature until now only focussed on whether or not adjustments to PM methodologies (customization of methodologies to a single project) are needed or not.<br/>This research aims to explore the fit-for-purpose use of these PM methodologies, to investigate on the level of projects what adjustment occur, what the underlying reasons are and what the contribution to project success is. The main research question is: “How do the fit-for-purpose adjustments to the project management methodologies used by the public clients in the Netherlands contribute to project success of infrastructure projects?” <br/>The research methodology is qualitative, with 13 interviews in a practical orientation (national-, regional-, local governments and waterboards), followed by 6 case studies (13 interviews with project managers and internal clients) at 3 different waterboards (PMC, PRINCE2 and an in-house PM methodology) and the findings were evaluated by 7 experts in the expert panel interviews. <br/>Adjustments to PM methodologies occur in two ways: organisation-specific adjustments (between official theory and the organisation) and project-specific adjustments (between the organisation and the project). Organisation-specific adjustments were made for all waterboards in this research and in total 16 project-specific adjustments were found. These adjustments range from e.g. additional financial mandate to shared risk registers and skipping phases or documentation. Adjustments can be specified to be deviations or additions, roughly occurring fifty-fifty.<br/>The overall majority of these adjustments was said to contribute to project success positively. Project success is in general perceived by the interviewed project managers as mostly a focus on time and budget and from the underlying reasons time was the most prominent aspect.<br/>Recommendations for future research include a closer look at the relation between the adjustments and project success, a framework for the measurement of the impact of adjustments and quantitative research into which methodologies need more adjustments.<br/><br/>Keywords: Fit-for-purpose, project management, PM methodologies, adjustments, project success, infrastructure, Dutch public clients.<br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As one of the most abundant energy on this planet, the solar energy starts to play an important role in the energy market. Various policies have already been proposed to encourage the renewable energy development. With the PV panels involved in the system, consumers can sell the extra energy from the PV panels' generation back to the grid, which makes them become prosumers. However, the PV panels generation cannot perfectly match the load peak, therefore, different power management methods are proposed to better schedule the power flow inside the grid-connected PV system. On the other hand, different tariff structures could also lead to the different energy bill. The prosumers also want to better allocate their load profiles to better suit for the tariff policies. Therefore, to find a suitable combination of power management method and electricity tariff are interested by prosumers.<br/><br/>This thesis aims at finding a suitable combination of power management method and electricity tariff for the prosumers based on the final energy bill. Four different power management methods are proposed to schedule the power flow inside the grid-connected PV system. The power flow data are simulated together with different tariff structures to calculate the final energy bill. A new method to generate the real-time electricity buy-in price is introduced, and four new feed-in tariff structures are designed with different compensation policies. Together with the power flow scheduled by power management methods, the final energy bill is calculated.<br/><br/>It is concluded that at least one of newly designed tariff structures can give a better or almost the same performance when compared with the existed tariff structures, and based on the final energy bill, a suitable combination of power management method and electricity tariff for prosumers can be found for the target countries/region.","power management strategy; Feed-in Tariff; Grid-Connected PV Systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The role of data is evolving and expanding, resulting in being utilized in open public databases. The main objective for making data accessible is to improve and further enhance the collaboration between the citizens and the municipality. This collaboration is an essential element in creating and optimizing a smart city. However, for all those that are not data literate nor see a meaningful use of data – these data remain a mystery, and further strengthening/improving collaboration by open data seems lost. This thesis aims to determine how data could support active citizens of Rotterdam to provide them with stimuli for direct collaboration with the municipality of Rotterdam. <br/><br/>In the first phase, Discover, the content of what is currently out there is explored. The city streets withhold a lot of data, information, knowledge, and history. This is one of the reasons, why open data needs to become more appealing and accessible to the public. Besides, a merger of big data (quantitative) (telling what is happening) and thick data (qualitative) (telling why it is happening) is necessary as the essence of the context is needed to make data understandable, clear and interpretable in the right way. To understand the data, the answers to how, what, where, who, when, what (1H5W) must be clear and known. Therefore, thoughts in mind, which are implicit, must become explicit to provide support for why something is communicated. Furthermore, visualising data makes it tangible to be understood by all citizens and reduces misinterpretations of what is communicated. Staying critical, discussing with others and evaluating can stimulate to translate knowledge into wisdom and create a correct perception. The understanding of what is communicated allows creating a common sense judgment. Making a diversity of people (citizens, organisations and, municipality) collect data can give a better perspective of the phenomena. Therefore, data must be stimulated to be used not only for the public but also for the employees of the Municipality of Rotterdam. As multiple study cases have shown, focus on a digital tool, like an application, is needed to make the data accessible to everyone.<br/><br/>All insights are gathered and a definition of the problem formulated. The main research question for the project is ‘How can active citizens be supported by data to begin collaborating and share their initiatives with the municipality?’ During the Discover and Analyse phase, it was revealed that the problem was a lot broader than initially expected. This is the reason that an additional focus is made as the first step in making area networkers familiar with data before achieving the main goal. The process continues with deeper research on the area networkers and future trends. After this research, a design brief is created, and a value proposition is formulated: “Make data as tangible as ‘Wikipedia’ with the possibility for the area networker to find and add information to provide more comfort and control of data usage to optimize thereby the connection, understanding and easier delivering of support for their neighbourhood.”<br/><br/>After an ideation and conceptualization phase, the final concept is created: L.A.M.A. which stands for Local Area Monitor Assistant. L.A.M.A. is an application which provides support to gain knowledge on observations in the neighbourhood for the area networker. The L.A.M.A. serves the area networker as an external hard drive. Not only does the increase of knowledge result in a better understanding of the neighbourhood, it also supports in getting a stronger connection with citizens. It furthermore allows optimization of the neighbourhood in a controlled and more comfortable way if it is supported with data. <br/><br/>L.A.M.A. makes collecting data approachable/assessable by taking a photo of the captured data, since a picture says more than a thousand words. But to avoid any misunderstandings a label and additional notes can be added. By doing this, the phenomena becomes very visible and understandable for everyone. Besides having the ease of collecting the data, the user will learn to see the benefits of dashboards in giving knowledge and stimulate to make the next step.<br/><br/>An interactive prototype was developed to evaluate the application. Evaluation gave insights into the experience and usability of the application and resulted in optimising and improving some screens. Other results are taken in for the future development of a vision for 2036 translated into a roadmap. <br/><br/>A solid foundation is created, but further development and research are needed to realise the concept and to strengthen the collaboration between the citizens and municipality envisioned by using data.<br","Application; Collaboration; Data; Observation data; Open4Citizens; Rotterdam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Strategic Product Design","",""

This is due to the increased number of short-span pedestrian and cycle bridges which are used to traverse canals and waterways. FRP bridges are desirable as they are light-weight, require low maintenance, are easily pre-fabricated and can be installed in a matter of hours.<br/>However, the main drawback of FRP constructions is that they lack stiffness meaning they are often vastly over-designed with regards to strength. The stiffness of glass fibre-reinforced polymers (GFRP), one of the most common types of FRP and the focus of this thesis, is approximately 5 times less than steel (1). For this reason, it is desirable to increase the stiffness of GFRP members; one way of doing such is to add a stiffer material to the laminate to create a hybrid-composite material. Hybrid-composites look to combine the advantageous properties of two materials, to produce a material superior to both of its individual component materials.<br/>This project focuses on the development and feasibility review of a fibre-steel hybrid-composite material, combining GFRP and steel into one laminate. A review of the state of the art of hybrid-composites guides the reader to potential problems that may arise with this combination. Through the testing and analytical estimation of the properties of the material and its component materials, the behaviour of the fibre-steel laminate (FSL) is discussed and evaluated. Using the established properties, a design case study of a hybrid deck system reviews the economic feasibility of the use of FSL ahead of the GFRP equivalent. <br/>The results of this two-fold approach form recommendations for the next steps of the investigation into the use of this material. It is recommended that the main focus of subsequent studies revolve around the improvement of the steel-GFRP interface as this was found to be a weak point in the material given the difference in in-plane properties of the two materials.<br","FRP; GFRP; FSL; Fibre-Steel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering","",""

This is also reflected by Luxembourg’s continuous and rapid population growth, caused almost exclusively by immigration. In addition, massive commuter flows, and the related rising resource consumption cause major problems in the national territory (e.g. traffic jams, air pollution, excessive resource consumption). Due to these challenging conditions and the specific geography, Luxembourg constitutes an exceptional case study. In search of innovative solutions, this design and research project shows the possibilities for resource efficient planning by exploring the concept of transit-oriented development. With my thesis, I aim to analyse how resource efficiency can be achieved on a regional scale through important changes in current spatial development strategies.

This global challenge demands for exploiting the subsurface formations as giant storage space for industrial by prod- ucts, e.g., CO2, while a future utilisation is found for them. Exploitation of subsurface formations for CO2 storage depends on our capacity to “accurately” and “efficiently” simulate the multiphase nonlinear flow in heterogeneous large-scale natural formations. An accurate and efficient simulation would allow for proper predictive understanding for several operational aspects including: (1) capacity of the storage; (2) life-time long behaviour of the injected CO2 in the subsurface formation, and (3) safety and integrity of the capturing procedure. The challenge of extreme scale dissimilarity between the heterogeneous coefficients (rock con- ductivity and fluid physics, e.g., mixing) and the reservoir has been known in the scientific literature as one of the main simulation challenges. Classically, to resolve this mismatch, reservoir models have been exces- sively upscaled to a resolution which can be solved affordably with the state-of-the-art commercial-grade simulators. However, as the rapid extension of the computational capacity, as well as the newly developed multiscale scalable nonlinear solvers, one needs to revisit our simulation frameworks to provide a scalable (to field scale) and accurate CO2 simulation framework. This thesis work focuses on extension of the recently developed Algebraic Dynamic Multilevel Method (ADM) to highly-nonlinear simulations of CO2-Brine multi- phase flow problems. ADM maintains simulation scalability by imposing fine-scale grids only where needed; and imposing coarser grids paired with accurate prolongation operators far from the sub-domains with sharp gradients. In this work, to provide a systematic study, the developed ADM framework is formulated such that it allows for both multiscale-based basis functions and also upscaling-based procedure. This is crucially im- portant as it reveals how the ""solution-based” interpolations based on fine-scale heterogeneity can impact the simulation results; compared with the “effective-coefficient-based” approach.<br/>In brief, the novelty and contribution of this research is two fold: (1) development of a multiscale-based ADM method for CO2-Brine simulator and (2) systematic study to find the best model order reduction strat- egy when it comes to complex multiphase characteristics and rock heterogeneity. Two different classes of simulations are studied: (1) injection and evolution of the injected CO2 phase into the brine with capillary effects; and (2) miscible mixing process in which resolving front fingers into the residing less-mobile fluid imposes computational challenges. The study, as such, intends to reveal the details in “upscaling-based” vs. “multiscal-based” approach; and tends to provide a generic framework in which the scalability of the simu- lations are preserved by employing fine-scale grids only where and when needed.<br/>Several challenging sensitivity analysis are performed in which fine-scale solutions are compared with the multi-scale ADM and upscaling ADM solutions for immiscible and miscible fluid flow displacement. From these numerical experiments can be concluded that Multiscale-ADM outperforms the Upscaling-based ADM approach. More precisely with similar active grid cells, it provides a more accurate simulation method. As such, Multiscale-ADM casts a promising approach for next-generation simulators for CO2-Brine systems.","ADM; CO2; Simulation; Reservoir; sequestration; upscaling; multi-scale approach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

In the Netherlands, people with a loan have the possibility to repay (part of) their outstanding loan before the due date. These prepayments make the length of the portfolio of loans stochastic, which creates problems in the refinancing policy of the bank, and affects the Asset &amp; Liability Management. Moreover, interest rate risk arises from prepayments, meaning that being able to forecast the prepayment rate can increase the performance of the hedging strategy of a bank. Given the magnitude of the mortgage portfolio in the balance sheet of a bank, estimating the prepayment rate is therefore crucial. There are two kinds of models in the literature, the optimal prepayment model, which sees prepayment as a consequence of rational behavior (e.g. prepayments are always exercised at an optimal time), and the exogenous model which also takes into account other macroeconomic variables, client specifics and loan characteristics. Our focus will be on the second kind of techniques, precisely we will approach the problem as a classification task that will be carried out with two different machine learning techniques: Random Forests and Artificial Neural Networks.Since prepayments are rare events, this leads to an imbalanced data set framework. The imbalance between classes creates complications in the development of the algorithm, hence ad hoc corrections are applied to solve them.","Neural Networks; Random Forest; Conditional Prepayment Rate; Imbalanced learning; Mortgages","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

The reason of this, stems from the increasing complexity of contemporary cities, the growing 3D approach in other fields (including 3D spatial data acquisition, spatial data processing and visualization) which made 3D cadastre technologically feasible, and the need to overcome the issues of 2D visualization. The visualization of cadastral parcels in 3D is a huge challenge, since legal boundaries are, in some cases, invisible in the real world. Several countries built their own 3D cadastre (partial) systems/prototypes which are still lacking some crucial functionalities, therefore this research will try to fill some of the gaps of the existing cadastral systems with a special focus on visualization and dissemination aspects.<br/>The goal of this research is to solve issues of occlusion, representation of unbounded vol- umes and ambiguous perception (in terms of position, size and shape) of objects in the con- text of 3D cadastre visualization. Additionally, the combination of topography and cadastral parcels is a double-edged sword; on one hand, it is useful for orientation purposes but, on the other hand, the growing complexity and increasing occlusion can make the visualization more challenging. The exploration of specific interaction techniques is fundamental to over- come these issues.<br/>This document provides guidance on the system design choices to implement a 3D cadas- tre prototype. The study starts with a theoretical and a technological research carried out to investigate the state of the art in 3D cadastre visualization and to explore the existing WebGL platforms on which to build a successful prototype. Along with these phases, two lists of requirements are created; the first one related to 3D visualization issues and the second one related to the web viewer functionalities. The implementation of the prototype is carried out following (part of) the requirements listed, leaving the rest for future work. The development phase is the core of the research and includes the selection of the datasets and of the area of interest located in the city centre of Brisbane, Australia. In addition to that, the definition of the LADM compliant storage schema and the process of data encoding, to transform the data from survey plans to a cadastral database, are described. Although these steps are not in the main scope, they are crucial for the development of the prototype. After that, different visualization functionalities have been implemented, each of them presenting drawbacks and difficulties mainly related to the data format chosen.<br/>In order to assess the usability and user-friendliness of the 3D cadastre prototype, a ques- tionnaire has been handed out to potential users of the application. Their feedback is funda- mental for this research and will provide insights on how to improve the actual design of the prototype.","3D cadastre; Visualization; Dissemination; Web; Land administration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","","-27.4696483, 153.0252398"

Due to the increasing demand for housing in this area, the developers have shifted their focus to the build of four to five-story chawls. We can distinguish two forms of chawl development; the redevelopment and the new constructions. In the case of the redevelopment the original baithi chawl is demolished and replaced by a four or five story chawl using the exact same footprint; increasing the<br/>density four times. Newly built chawls are developed on vacant lots using about the same urban layout as the redeveloped baithi chawls; creating a density of about 1300 units per hectare. Both developments contribute significantly to the provision of housing for the economical weaker<br/>sector and the lower income group.<br/>However, these developments create an urban fabric of chawls that is extremely cramped. In The chawl area’s the open space has been reduced to an absolute minimum. The buildings get placed closer and closer together to create the highest possible density, but leaving hardly any ‘open-to sky space’. As advocated by Correa these open-to-sky spaces<br/>are a crucial aspect of housing in warm climates: ''Successful housing is a seamless continuum of spaces that goes all the way from the<br/>most private, to the semi-private, to the public. This is why it creates communities''.

The core objective is to improve the investment module of a national energy system simulation model<br/>(Ensysi) that wants to represent actors’ technology-investments in the energy transition context.<br/>An initial literature review has revealed the importance of the agents’ rational and non rational behavior in determining<br/>the future stock evolution, given the high level of uncertainty of some key variables such as future energy<br/>carriers prices and ETS prices. With regard to this, Ensysi presents the shortcoming that investment decisions are<br/>not forward looking but just consider the costs and revenues of the year in which the decision takes place.

(mentor); Ortt, J.R. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Over the past few decades, new technology-based firms (NTBFs) have been considered an important engine of economic development. Consequently, a better understanding of the characteristics and attributes of these firms has become a primary goal for researchers and policy makers. While numerous studies found evidence of the relation between growth performance and strategy, clear methods and strategy formulation tools for NTBF managers are lacking. The main objective of this research is to offer guidance in formulating growth strategies for NTBFs, while considering their specific characteristics and environment. <br/>This research designs a solution for a large and complex contemporary socio-technical problem. In this, several contributions to technology entrepreneurship literature are made. Firstly, internal and external variables are identified that influence strategy making for NTBFs. Secondly, strategies and tactics that are applicable for NTBFs in specific situations and environments are defined. Thirdly, a conceptual framework that enables to select growth strategies for NTBFs by using an extensive “matchmaking” process is build and validated. This conceptual framework was built around three strategy management theories: Transaction Cost Economics (TCE), the Resource-Based View (RBV) and Contingency. Accordingly, this research investigates and reveals some theoretical implications for applying these theories to NTBFs specifically. <br/>The designed framework suggests that a strategy is subject to the internal and external environment, where the interpretation of this environment and the final decision is made by the management team of a NTBF. Feasible growth strategies for NTBFs are built around four regimes: Vertical Integration, Inter-firm Cooperation, Technology Transfer and System Integration. Two important clusters divide NTBFs and their suitable growth strategies; the ones with a strong financial position and the ones with a suitable situation for collaboration. When having a strong financial position, NTBFs can choose to vertically integrate or become a system integrator. Collaborative strategies can be subdivided in backward and/or forward strategic alliances, exclusivity agreements, equity strategic alliances, joint ventures and an IP-based technology transfer. NTBF founders use similar strategic tactics to deal with shared challenges. <br/>This research did not strive for prediction and certainty but strived to reduce the complexity for managers of NTBFs in choosing their growth strategy. Empirical findings and theoretical knowledge were bundled to understand the phenomenon, where this understanding is located on a higher level than the empirics itself. Especially since there will always be exceptions. Accordingly, the complexity of the research problem was reduced by using abstraction instead of generalisation. Generalisation was minimised where it is assumed that generalisation in NTBF growth strategies has significant shortcomings where too many variables interact. The art is within the clustering of variables, where these clusters are matched with a specific, optimal growth strategy on an abstract level. <br/>The multi-disciplinary abstraction approach of this research enabled to bridge the gap between research and practical execution. The designed conceptual framework is based on flexible conceptual terms rather than rigid theoretical variables and causal relations and aims to help to understand phenomena rather than to predict them. The input for the conceptual framework was holistic, using interviews and theory. In-depth interviews with founders of NTBFs were used to review the object of study from different, practical perspectives. Moreover, four theoretical viewpoints were used complementary: contingency, strategy, transactions (TCE) and resources (RBV). No attempt was made for theoretical integration or synthesis of theories. Rather, theories were combined in such a way as to enhance the qualities of each other. TCE theory was used for the identification of strategies, where RBV theory was used for the identification (or a lack) of resources, for which specific strategies and tactics can be executed. Contingency theory served as the overarching theme of the framework, where strategy forms the common thread in this research. An in-depth case study could be used to validate the conceptual framework by reflecting on a real-life case. A single case study was used, while context-dependent knowledge was assumed to be more valuable than predictive theories.<br/>The framework as designed in this research can be used for NTBFs when selecting their growth strategy. Further research is needed to examine the suitability of the framework for different NTBFs, where this research only validated the framework with a single case study. This can be done by executing several in-depth single case studies that lead to a more complete and usable framework. Data should not only be gathered from NTBFs but should also be gathered from researchers when it comes to the critical assessment of the used theories (RBV and TCE) and possible extensions of the conceptual framework. <br","New technology-based firms; growth strategy; strategic management; resources-based view; transaction cost economics; strategic decision-making; contingency; In-depth case study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-08-31","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Especially in urban areas, a typical road includes five to ten infrastructure systems which are all owned and managed by different entities. The CISs are spatially interdependent as these are highly interconnected due to the close spatial proximity. Despite the critical function of cables and pipes, over 30,000 cable and pipe failures from excavation works are reported in the Netherlands yearly. Multiple studies have been conducted to reduce the risk of excavation damage. These studies have mainly focused on the impact side. Remarkable as from an extensive cooperation between the network operators and other stakeholders, a guideline (CROW500) was formed that seeks to prevent cable and pipe damage from excavation works.<br/>The objective of this thesis is to develop a model to accurately predict cable and pipe failures from excavation works, considering spatial interdependencies. The associated research question is: “What method can predict the influence of spatial interdependencies on the probability of failure from excavation works on the cables and pipes of subsurface utility operators?”<br/>Predictive analyses are frequently used for enhanced decision making by subsurface utility operators, whereby cable and pipe failures, having large impact in this sector, are relatively rare. This thesis explores the possibilities of modelling rare event data within the subsurface utility industry, through which specific situations, such as failures from excavation works, can be considered. A case study within Evides Water Company was conducted whereby 107,000 non-failures and 180 failures from excavation works were collected. In terms of statistical techniques, alternative models to logistic regression and Bayesian logistic are considered. Two approaches, involving weighting and synthetic minority oversampling have been examined to compensate the imbalanced classifiers in the data set. Balancing is done by over-, under sampling, as well as by weighting, which aim to increase the accuracy of the models. At algorithm level, under sampling and weighting combined were tested and found to improve the balanced accuracy to 0.66 with 0.38 of the failures predicted. At data level, over and under sampling by SMOTE resulted in 0.58 of failures predicted and a balanced accuracy of 0.61.

A tool is designed for a combined loading test, in which a specimen is eccentrically loaded in tension. Specimens with a tailored geometry and various TZ arrangements were designed and manufactured.

Characteristics of a good TZ design are recognized based on knowledge of the sequence of events leading to failure. The principle of a good design is to increase the moment of inertia by placing steel foils at outer positions, to the extent where the increased tendency for delamination does not become critical.

In order to guarantee the security of supply, the volatile power output by the renewables asks for compensation by other sources. These backup technologies have to cope with a variety of scarcity cases, ranging from single peaks of uncovered load to longer scarcity periods. During winter times, these scarcity incidents show their most extreme form and overlap in some weeks. The German news calls this phenomenon “kalte Dunkelflaute” or only “Dunkelflaute” (analogously translated “energy drought during darkness and cold”).<br/>The need for backup technologies goes not along with a certain cost recovery. As the last dispatched entity in the market, they need to cover their fixed costs by scarcity prices. Depending on various factors, such as the weather conditions and the availability of short-term flexibility, it is difficult to predict the level of scarcity prices. Uncertain investment conditions lead to investment restraints and harm the security of supply. At the same time, frequent scarcity prices would contradict the principle of a secure energy supply with a limited financial burden for the consumers. The regulator is in a dilemma. <br/>Rewarding the contribution to the security of supply is an option to stimulate investments in backup technologies. The so-called capacity mechanisms are an intervention into the energy-only-market (EoM) which is known to organize the energy supply in the most efficient way. The principle decision of an intervention and its design requires a sounds judgment and the consideration of many factors. By presenting the challenges of future scarcity moments, the cost recovery conditions for backup technologies and examples for cost recovery measures, the thesis aims to contribute to the on-going discussion by answering the research question “How to maintain the security of supply under extreme weather conditions in a renewable dominated electricity system in the most cost-efficient way?”.<br/>It is addressed by a simulation with the agent-based model AMIRIS and accompanying analyses based on literature reviews and calculations. In the beginning, a cost comparison of backup technologies (chapter 3) and a multi-criteria decision analysis for capacity mechanisms (chapter 4) are examined. The most cost-efficient forms of each analysis are processed subsequently.<br/>After an introduction into the model (chapter 5) and the simulation process (chapter 6), the variations of scarcity (chapter 7) and cost recovery (chapter 8) according to two contrary weather years and the availability of battery storages are presented. Three scarcity indicators help to characterize the scarcity in the first step and indicate the dimensions of the backup capacity in the second step. A sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of the simulation results is examined in chapter 9. Lastly, two measures to bridge the lacking cost recovery for the backup technologies are presented. The resulting costs of the energy supply for the consumers are compared for the two measures and the system with scarcity prices without any intervention (chapter 10). <br/>The thesis describes the challenge of increasingly volatile market conditions and recommends measures to mitigate their risks. The main findings are presented by the four guiding hypotheses in the following. <br/>1. The level of scarcity varies substantially with the weather conditions<br/>For every weather condition, single moments occur in which a high residual load and limited flexibility lead to an extreme peak of the uncovered load. The simulation shows the same level for the maximum hourly peak for every scenario. In contrast to that, the aggregated uncovered load per year varies significantly for the extreme weather year 2010 with a low renewables output and the mild weather year 2007 with a high renewable output. The scenario with the weather year 2010 asks for 25 percent more additional energy to cover the demand than the one with the mild weather year 2007.<br/>The severity of scarcity becomes explicit when one considers the uncovered load of the longest scarcity period of each simulated year. In the scenarios with the weather year 2010 and 15 GW installed battery storage, it lasts for almost three days and contains 0.25 percent of the yearly uncovered load. This period by mid-February includes the maximum peak of uncovered load and is surrounded by other long scarcity periods. In this sense, it is a stress test for the electricity system. <br/>The situation changes for the mild weather year 2007. The longest duration of scarcity asks for less than a half of the energy of 2010. The difference of additionally requested energy and capacity makes it explicit how difficult it is to design a well-tailored backup mix for these scarcity moments. <br/>2. The short-term flexibility providers lower the need for backup capacity but cannot substitute it <br/>The emergence of short-term flexibilities, such as battery storage, is a mixed blessing for the security of supply. On the one hand, it balances the energy supply in moments with high and low prices and closes gaps between demand and supply. Looking at the scenario with the extreme weather year, the implementation of 15 GW battery storage divides the uncovered load per year in a half. On the other hand, it reduces the income basis for the backup technologies and is, therefore, a further factor of uncertainty for investments. <br/>At the same time, battery storage can hardly address situations of extreme scarcity alone. Only 10 percent of the missing energy can be covered by the battery storage during the longest scarcity period. The maximum uncovered load cannot be reduced at all by the battery storage.<br/>The correlation of extreme scarcity peaks and long scarcity periods gives the battery storage hardly any opportunity to charge during the extreme scarcity periods. For instance, more than one-third of the extreme peaks (in this case defined as 20 GW and more) is surrounded by a period of scarcity of 5 hours and longer. <br/>The knowledge about future prices impacts the ability of the battery storage to address scarcity hours. If the so-called foresight is extended from one day to one week, the uncovered load per year can be reduced by 20 percent. However, the positive effect of the longer foresight is bounded by the technical limitations of the battery storage. In the presented scenarios, no additional mitigation of the scarcity can be achieved in times of the Dunkelflaute by a foresight of one week. Also, a longer foresight than one week cannot reduce the uncovered load per year any further. <br/>Conclusions can be drawn about the suitability of the price sequences to support the bidding of the battery storage. It is noticeable that the longer foresight increases the number of used high prices but does not have the same effect on the low prices. Upcoming high prices seem to be missing to create an additional value by charging more energy during the low prices. This indicates a limited fit of the prices sequences for charging and discharging of the battery storage. <br/>All in all, the battery storages are restricted by their technical limitations and the sequence of market prices. Despite their positive effect on scarcity, they cannot substitute long-term backup technologies. <br/>3. The level of cost recovery for backup technologies on the EoM is not sufficient and depends strongly on the weather conditions and the availability of battery storage<br/>Due to its ability to react fast to scarcity signals and its relatively low fixed costs, gas turbines supplied with fossil gas are selected as backup technology. The constant level of the scarcity peak for all scenarios gives a clear indication for the required backup capacity. At the same time, the changing request of the backup energy for the different weather conditions and availability of short-term flexibility impacts their cost recovery.<br/>In the simulated case, the backup technologies do not leverage their dominant market position in times of scarcity and only bid their marginal cost. This leads to a negative profit margin for every scenario negative. With the implementation of 15 GW battery storage, it becomes four times lower. The optimized bidding with the longer foresight decreases the margin additionally by 25 percent. The lower request of the mild weather year leads to a decrease of 83.5 percent. <br/>Assuming that a further expansion of renewables would lead to a larger price spread and a more constant level of scarcity, the implementation of a power-to-methane to create synthetic gas from excess energy is an interesting option. Due to limitations of the model, power-to-methane was not simulated as backup technology, but the insights from the simulation with the gas turbine are transferred in a simplified calculation. It results in a higher (but still negative) profit margin for power-to-methane. At the same time, it needs to be considered that the smaller fixed costs base of the fossil gas application can adapt better to changing requests of backup energy. An implantation of a gas turbine supplied with fossil gas and later with syntactic methane would address both incidents. <br/>Solely the availability of suitable backup technologies will not lead to investments without a positive business case. Therefore, some measures to handle the lacking cost recovery are presented in the next paragraph. <br/>4. A well-designed regulatory intervention which rewards the contribution to the security of supply can reduce the costs for the consumer and improves the supply ratio<br/>The skepticism about the ability of the EoM to recover the costs of capital intense backup technologies is reinforced by the analysis. At the same time, no final assessment to which extent the invisible hand of the market can trigger investments in backup capacity and at which point a regulatory intervention is needed can be given in the course of the thesis. It only aims to pinpoint measures to improve the cost recovery and indicate their financial burden on the consumer. <br/>If a capacity mechanism does not only trigger investments in backup capacity but incites a system friendly behavior by all market participants, the security of supply can be maintained in the most cost-efficient way. In this sense, the MCDA highlights the concept of capacity subscriptions. By its self-rationing approach, it gives the consumers the option to decide whether they prefer to invest into backup capacity or contribute to the security of supply by reducing their consumption at peak times. The simplified calculation for the industrial consumers demonstrated its efficiency enhancement.<br/>As an alternative for improving the cost recovery, backup technologies can exhaust their dominant market position in scarcity times by including markups in their bids. As other market participants benefit from the increased prices as well, the measure with markups leads to higher costs of the energy supply for the consumers than the one with capacity subscriptions. <br/>Comparing the costs of energy supply in case of the EoM with and without a capacity subscription, the acceptance of scarcity prices leads to significantly higher costs for the consumer every year. Assuming that the scarcity prices would trigger investments in backup capacity, this would be at least the case during the lead time between the investment decision and commissioning of the backup technology. For the simplified calculation, the costs of energy supply are 12.9 times higher in the extreme case of scarcity and 5.2 times higher for a sensitivity of only 50 percent of the missing secured capacity. <br/>Overall, the calculations show the increases in efficiency resulting from capacity subscriptions and the reduction of the financial burden for the consumers. The design of a well-tailored regulatory intervention is a complex matter that carries the risk of maladjustments and false incentives. The design of capacity subscriptions, the extent of market power during scarcity time and the composition of a well-balanced flexibility mix which considers short-term flexibility potentials and long-term backup technologies is subject for further research. <br/>In conclusion, the thesis shows that suitable backup technologies are available and needed in an electricity system with a high share of renewables. At the same time, their cost recovery by the EoM is insufficient and is deteriorated in case of a mild weather year, a high level of battery storage and their qualification of forecasting the future dispatch accurately. The concept of capacity subscriptions is recommended as a measure to improve the cost recovery, decrease the risk and enhance efficiency. <br","Security of supply; weather; batteries; backup capacity; flexibility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Complex Systems Engineering and Management (CoSEM)","",""

Between 40% and 70% of MS patients suffer from cognitive complaints in various stages of their disease [8, 67]. The MS Centre Amsterdam has started a new so-called Second Opinion Multiple Sclerosis and COGnition screening (SOMSCOG) outpatient clinic for MS patients suffering from cognitive problems to research these cognitive problems. <br/><br/>A clear definition of patient experience is defined by the Beryl Institute: “Patient experience is the sum of all interactions, shaped by an organisations culture, that influence patient perceptions across the continuum of care” [19]. A literature study researching patient centred strategies showed that patient experience has an influence on quality of life. This connection shows that it is useful to improve patient experience to create a positive effect on quality of life. <br/>To this end, the central aim of this research was to design a service or product-service system that helps to improve the patient experience of MS patients who visit the SOMSCOG outpatient clinic at VUmc. <br/><br/>Different user research methodologies have been employed, with research methods including interviews, contextmapping and observations. This study showed that the needs and the underlying values of MS patients visiting the SOMSCOG outpatient clinic are fundamental values. They long for transparency, clarity and honesty. Additionally the user study exposed an interesting problem: patients have difficulties preparing for visit of the outpatient clinic. A result of this lack of preparation is that the help request - which form the basis of diagnosis - is often suboptimally formulated. <br/><br/>The insights gained throughout the user study resulted in a patient journey in which the current experience is depicted. By combining the insights of the literature and user study a design goal was formulated. <br/><br/>The aim of the design process was create a tool that will help patients prepare to for their hospital visit, that will guide them through the day and provide an overview of the whole journey. This tool should improve the overall patient experience and make a positive impact on the patient’s quality of life. <br/><br/>Building on the patient journey and the insights from literature, a toolkit - named De Gids - has been developed with which patients can prepare themselves for the screening day of the SOMSCOG outpatient clinic. <br/><br/>De Gids encompasses a folder, an information guide and a preparation sheet. The information guide contains information of the screening day e.g. the schedule, possible outcomes and treatment options. It also contains a conversation starter which can be used by patients and a next of kin. The aim of this conversation starter is to trigger patients in sharing their concerns around cognitive problems with someone close to them. <br/>The preparation sheet contains questions which prepare patients for the consultation with a neurologist on the screening day. It also functions as a conversation aid during this consultation. By filling out the questions on the sheet, patients will reflect on their concerns, expectations and a help request is formulated. This preparation of the help request should result in a better formulated help request.<br/><br/>When the help request is improved, the diagnosis can have a better connection with patients’ needs and the treatment options that will be offered might be more effective. This will ultimately result in better care and improved quality of life.","Medesign; experience; MS patient; Cognition; patient journey; preparation tool; conversation aid; conversation starter; neurology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Design for Interaction","",""

In Europe 80% of the wind turbines are installed on monopile foundations and this is expected to be the dominant choice in the future. The shallow geology of most of the wind farms is characterized as sand. A known phenomenon around foundations in sandy soils is the occurrence of scour, due to a disturbance in the flow caused by the waves and currents. Scour affects the embedment depth and natural frequency of the turbine. In order to prevent these effects a commonly used technique is to install a rock blanket around the monopile, to act as scour protection. Monopiles are mostly driven into the soil with a hydraulic impact hammer. The blows of the hammer result in an elevated noise level. Within the German EEZ strict rules are set regarding the allowable noise level. Noise mitigation measures, such as a noise mitigation screen, are used to prevent exceedance of the sound exposure level, see figure 1. <br/><br/>In an attempt to reduce the Levelised Costs of Energy (LCOE) of offshore wind, cost-saving optimizations are considered such as the installation of a single layer scour protection before foundation installation. The conventional two layer system requires two mobilization campaigns one for the filter and the second for the armour layer, after monopile installation. The single layer solution results in a reduced installation time and no risk of collision with the monopile. The NMS is lowered on the scour protection and the monopile is driven through the NMS. During the installation the NMS penetrates in the scour protection and deformations are observed, see the area close to the monopile in figure 2. Remedial works are very expensive and therefore one would like to know what the impact is on the performance of the scour protection during the lifetime of the wind farm.<br/><br/>The project is based on a review of literature regarding relevant topics such as: soil mechanics, scour protection, noise mitigation and installation processes. Because of the problem’s novelty, the available research is limited. In order to acquire insight in to the problem there is a need to investigate which processes are involved and relevant. This is done by collecting all available field data from selected offshore wind farms installed with a NMS, such as CPT data, survey data and hammer logs. <br/><br/>The analysis of the available data shows that the main factor influencing the NMS penetration is the combination of the use of a NMS together with the hammering procedure. Based on the available soil, hammer log, NMS and pile penetration data it is believed that the NMS imprint is a consequence of compaction of the underlying soils and scour protection. Compaction of underlaying soils is seen as having a beneficial effect on the scour protection system. Further it is investigated whether a large NMS penetration combined with a high relative mobility for the scour protection during storm conditions can lead to undesirable effects. Time series of environmental conditions were reconstructed from field measurements and numerical model hind casts. These time series serve as input to assess the relative rock mobility between installation and most recent bathymetry survey. Locations are verified for the imprint depth and relative mobility and a potential worst case is identified. The identified worst case is evaluated and validated against model tests of similar conditions. The outcome of the study is that limited rock movement has occurred from the edges of the imprint into it, but that the scour protection is still performing well after a 5yr design storm. This is also confirmed by model tests. A potential weak-link is identified in the slope of the imprint where the scour protection thickness is reduced. Practical mitigation and monitoring measures are proposed, but further research is needed to verify whether the risk of winnowing can appear within the slope of the deformed part of the imprint. <br","Noise mitigation screen; Scour protection; Impact hammer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-12","","","","","",""

For 80% of these patients, a treatment option is the surgical procedure known as breast conserving surgery (BCS). Re-excision is required in 10-60% of these patients, as positive margins are encountered post-operatively, showing the need of an intra-operative margin assessment (IMA) technique. Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS) has proven to accurately discriminate real-time between malignant and non-malignant tissue. As electrosurgery (ES) is the main technique used for BCS, the incorporation of DRS into the electrosurgical knife (ESK) is desired. A ‘smart’ ESK has previously been developed, yet practical use was disturbed by tissue contamination of the integrated diffuse reflectance fibers during ES.<br/><br/>This thesis, therefore, examines the characteristics of this contamination and the effects on the desired integration. Clinical and research analyses were done, obtaining requirements for a re-design of the ‘smart’ ESK. Instruments, settings and methods of cleaning the ESK in the operating room have been observed and the influence of clinical parameters on the amount of tissue debris has been investigated. Tissue contamination on ESK blades used for BCS was analyzed with the use of DRS and Fourier Transform – Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The impact of this contamination was additionally determined by power measurements of the ‘smart’ ESK after cutting on samples of subcutaneous porcine tissue for several time intervals.<br/><br/>All measured spectra of the charring components adhering to the electrosurgical blades matched with proteins (best matching with hemoglobin and hydrolyzed proteins) and fatty acid esters adhering to the electrosurgical blades. Furthermore, significant decreased debris was found correlating with the date of surgery and the amount of times the ESK was cleaned. No significant influence was found of the amount of ES current used on the tissue debris, yet the intensity of the signal was expressively decreased with the increase of debris. During the power experiments, tissue debris on the ‘smart’ ES increased significantly over time while cutting. Polishing the fibers resulted in a fiber signal of only 43% of the maximal power.<br/>Disturbance occurred already early within the normal usage time of surgical procedures, with 1.9% of the maximal power left after 2 minutes of cutting. Prevention of fiber contamination seemed most effective by avoiding direct contact of the fibers with tissue during ES.<br/><br/>Design challenges and requirements were obtained, resulting in three concepts aiming to overcome tissue adhering to the integrated fibers. Three prototypes were made and evaluated, which eventually led to a proposed re-design of the ‘smart’ ESK, containing integrated fibers which can be retracted into the casing when the knife is used to cut and is intermittently slided out for tissue contact to obtain DRS measurements. A working prototype was produced, which potentially overcomes the disrupted DRS measurements due to tissue contamination on the integrated fibers. Hence, a step is made towards the integration of DRS into the ESK. This will possibly have a positive impact on the margin assessment during surgery, which might reduce the number of re-excisions after BCS.","diffuse reflectance spectroscopy; Breast cancer; Electrosurgery; breast conserving surgery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-12","","","","","",""

The most recent disaster, The Great East Japan Earthquake with a magnitude of 9.0, resulted in a tsunami which had a devastating effect on the coastal regions of Tohoku. However, these crisis situations also offer a potential for implementing innovative concepts and strategies regarding disaster recovery. Japan copes with high volumes of precipitation and a rapid aging and declining population. Furthermore, as a result of the shutdown of almost all the nuclear energy plants after the tsunami there is a need for other (renewable) energy sources. It is important to take this trauma into account where most of the people want to recover what was lost. This causes a friction between the urge to develop new areas and recover what was there before, which results in defining the concept of Traditional Urban Recovery (TUR). There is a need for change from Traditional Urban Recovery to a new concept, Modern Urban Renewal (MUR). MUR in the context of Japan is defined as a combination of multiple concepts and topics that are systematically integrated together and strengthened by the community providing balance between water and land. These include four topics: physical living quality, environment, energy, and tsunami resilience. This research project is using the Dynamic Adaptation Policy Pathway (DAPP) approach as guiding method in order to shift from TUR towards MUR or learn how to directly implement MUR after a disaster. In order to strengthen this approach a set of supplementing methods is chosen. One of the supplementing methods used is the multidisciplinary approach. There are many problems in a disaster society such as in Japan which cannot be fully addressed by one scientific discipline. To resolve problems of a disaster society, contributions from many disciplines are needed, with inputs that should preferably be balanced and integrated. Actions that are developed to generate pathways and strategies are derived from the process analysis and spatial analysis. After defining the current situation of Yuriage the developed actions can be added to the pathway map. There are two phases that the strategy will go through: adaptation and resilience. The first phase starts from the current situation of Yuriage where some hard engineered solutions have been applied. the adaptation phase provides a foundation for the shift towards more resilient solutions. In phase two the transition from adaptive solutions towards resilient solutions is supported. Most of the hard engineered solutions are replaced by natural processes. However, in some cases the civil constructions and nature based solutions strengthened each other and were therefore combined to increase resilience. The hypothesis is that following a pathway for each of the four themes from adaptive actions to resilient actions Modern Urban Renewal is reached. The strategy is tested on its performance by translating the pathways in a design proposal for the coastal village Yuriage. The design can be divided into four sections: the coast, the harbor, the housing area, and the energy hub. By using the DAPP approach a set of steps is developed that can be followed in order to reach MUR faster in case of a new disaster situation.","Redevelopment process; adaptive planning; urban water management; interdisciplinary approach; Dynamic Adaptation Policy Pathway approach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","Interdisciplinary-International RESEARCH TSUNAMI RECONSTRUCTION-project","38.179400, 140.943525"

Determining layer orientation parameters and identifying folds are examples of features needed in order to create a geological map or model of the (sub) surface. Surveying is expensive and time consuming, therefore such survey is recently being investigated and implemented in 3D point clouds. This thesis provides a method to quickly obtain geological information such as orientation parameters and fold information in a semi-automated manner. Obtaining this parameters is currently still a difficult problem because of data density and calculation complexity. <br/>Fast and reliable are terms important for the created method. Large point clouds can easily jam a system and reliability is important for usability and compatibility of the created results. A method is designed which can handle bulk data, performing operations such as filtering and noise reduction assisting in data handling. Next to general calculations such as roughness filtering, intensity filtering and directional filtering of generated normals, the use of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) greatly improves the reliability of the feature calculations. The user selects areas which are potentially interesting for acquiring layer orientation information, which are then analyzed by the method itself creating a base for determining the layer orientation parameters. This base is then used to attempt the reconstruction of the bedding layers of the geological outcrop resulting in the desired geological features.<br/>The method has been tested on the “La Charce” dataset and the “Meso-scaled fold” dataset for method validation and on the “Pradelle 2” dataset for compatibility checking. Average calculation time is with approximately 10 minutes reasonable fast. The acquired dip direction of approximately 156 degrees is very similar to that of Prentice (2017), Bisschop (2017) and the fieldwork teams of 2016.

(mentor); Ersoy, O. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Smart contracts are applications that are deployed and executed on a blockchain's decentralised infrastructure. Many smart contract applications rely on data that resides outside the blockchain. However, while traditional web applications can communicate with trustworthy data sources directly through the Internet, this is not possible for smart contracts because their execution must be deterministic. Bringing external data into the blockchain has been a topic of research since the first introduction of Ethereum, and a system that can provide this data to smart contracts is called an oracle. The primary requirement in designing oracles is that the authenticity of the data must be publicly verifiable, which can be achieved through signatures. However, transmitting data to the blockchain and performing the verification is costly, especially if applications require data from multiple sources as, in that case, current approaches would need to retrieve the data from each source separately.<br/><br/>This research aims to reduce the cost of retrieving external data for smart contracts from multiple sources while ensuring that the authenticity of the data is publicly verifiable. Two factors influence the total cost. The first is the size of the data, which determines the cost of transmitting the data to the blockchain and storing it, while the second factor is the cost of verifying the authenticity. In this work, we focused on the first factor, as transmission and storage of data are among Ethereum's most expensive operations. <br/><br/>We present two oracles for retrieving data from multiple sources, which we believe to be the first to focus on the multi-source scenario. The oracles both lower the cost of retrieving external data by compressing the proofs of the data's authenticity using aggregate signatures. Even though the oracles achieve the same goal, they are based on different primitives. The first uses bilinear pairings and produces an aggregate signature of constant size, regardless of the number of data sources that are involved. The second is based on the more standard assumption of trapdoor permutations. However, the aggregate signature grows slightly with the number of signers, and the oracle must interact with the data sources sequentially. We confirm the feasibility of our work by implementing and practically evaluating the two oracles in the Solidity programming language. Our experiments show that both oracles expend less gas than non-aggregating oracles based on the same main primitives.","Blockchain; Smart Contracts; Oracles; Aggregate Signatures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Cyber Security","",""

In 1985 the economy of Aruba suffered due to a reduced worldwide demand for oil . This brought the island to direct its economy towards tourism. The Capital city became a port of call for Caribbean cruise ships and the northern coast accommodated luxury hotels. Since 2009 the oil refinery has discontinued operations, meaning that tourism is the only promising sector, making the island fully reliant on tourism. Recessions in countries that are main suppliers to the Aruban economy reverberate heavily and demonstrate the fragile state of the dependent tourism industry.

The Dutch regulation agencies have to embrace this age of digitization. It provides challenges, as the inspection work becomes more complex. It also provides opportunities, because data analysis could make the inspections more efficient. One of these inspection agencies is the NVWA, the Netherlands Food and Safety Authority. The NVWA strives to work risk-oriented, and expects data analysis to be an important tool to achieve this goal. However, most inspectors have little knowledge on data analysis. Thus, a new type of employee needs to be contracted: the data analyst. The NVWA wants the data analysts and inspectors to work together and share their knowledge. Together, they should create a risk model, which predicts where inspections should take place. These kinds of risk models are expected to change the inspection landscape. However, most of the knowledge of data analysts and inspectors is tacit, which means that their knowledge is rooted into intuition. This makes it hard to transfer to others. To solve this problem, the following research question has been used during the research: How can synergy between multiple sources of knowledge be created and utilized to achieve risk based regulation?","Risk-based regulation; Synergy; Knowledge creation; Tacit knowledge; CRISP-DM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

(mentor); Sieben, A (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The formation of scour holes is a vital thread of retaining the water infrastructure of rivers. Nowadays, protective filters are used to prevent washing away of the underlying material. Rijkswaterstaat started the program 'Stroomlijn’, in which trees (logs) are cut from the floodplains and placed in a sheltered zone of the river to test whether this would increase the flora and fauna. After some years, the logs might be re-used as bottom protection. This kind of bottom protection is formed by placing multiple logs next to each other, which together form a log carpet, and placing multiple log carpets on top of each other. This is called a log filter. Until now, no research has been carried out into the use of logs as bottom protection. The main function of a log filter is to reduce the hydraulic load so that the erosive capacity of the grains of the bottom will not be reached. Since a log filter has the same main function as a geometrically open filter, this research focuses whether the hydraulic load reduction of a log filter could be described by the current theory of granular open filter.<br/><br/>In granular open filter theory, the hydraulic load is defined as the pore flow velocity and turbulent kinetic energy inside the filter layer. The hydraulic load is caused by the influence of the energy slope and the influence of the flow over the filter structure. The pore flow velocity and turbulent kinetic energy caused by the energy slope is always present, regardless of how thick the layer is. The influence of flow over the filter structure decreases exponentially and depends on the load damping length.<br/><br/>In order to provide the hydraulic load reduction of a filter consisting of logs, experiments have been conducted in a flume of The Fluid Mechanics Laboratory at the Delft University of Technology. A filter consisting of logs has been mimicked and tested. The hydraulic load, i.e. increasing the depth average flow velocity and discharge, was increased until erosion occurred. During each increasing step, flow velocities above and inside the filter layer were measured.<br/><br/>From the experiments, it is concluded that at least two layers are needed in order to ensure a significant decrease of the pore flow velocity and turbulent kinetic energy. Adding more than two layers will not lead to further reduction of the pore velocity or turbulent kinetic energy. The pore flow and turbulent kinetic energy beneath layer 2 are dominantly caused due to the influence of the energy slope. <br/><br/>Hence, the equation describing the influence of the energy slope in a granular open filter is also appropriate in case of a log filter. However, the influence of the flow over the filter structure on the pore flow velocity and turbulent kinetic energy in a log filter does not decrease exponentially over depth, whereas in a granular filter it does. Therefore, we concluded that the current open granular filter models which describes the exponential decay of the pore flow velocity and turbulent kinetic energy due to the influence of the flow over the filter construction could not be applied in a log filter.<br/><br/>In addition, we concluded that the flow in a log filter is very anisotropic. The flow characteristics differ in front, halfway and behind the log. In front of the log, stagnation is present, which leads to a vertical jet flow directed downwards. This flow causes erosion in front of the logs in the first layer. The erosion process in case of a log filter differs from granular open filters, which stated that erosion is predominantly caused by the hydraulic load, i.e. pore flow velocity and turbulent kinetic energy, in the filter and the bed pressure fluctuations due to low-frequency vortices. <br/><br/>We also concluded that at locations where the porosity is higher, erosion occurred at lower hydraulic load conditions, i.e. discharge and depth-averaged flow velocity. This indicates that the porosity is an important variable when logs are used as bottom protection.","Filter; Logs; Wood; Bed protection; Filter structure; Granular filter; Scale model; Flume experiments","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","",""

The final investment decision involves the decision of the owner to continue the project into the project execution phases. After the FID is made, the project goal feasibility is no longer assessed. Traditionally it is believed that in projects all decisions are made before the final investment decision and during the project there is no requirement for additional decisions. However, in practice during the project execution phase decisions need to be made partly because of project risks and uncertainty. During the project execution phase in which the actual engineering, procurement and construction is conducted, decision-makers only evaluate the impact of their decisions on time, cost and quality criteria (together called the iron triangle) instead of on the long-term project objective, the project goal. The project goal of industrial engineering projects is to deliver a product for sale, e.g. oil, natural gas and high-volume chemicals created by an industrial asset. The construction of the industrial asset is defined in this research as delivering the project output. The construction of the asset (project output) is thereby a means to an end (project goal).

This form of organization, that is recognizable on various scale levels, emerges spontaneously in the system, without the conscious intention of ordering. Following the growing insight in different disciplines that a theory of complexity can more adequately describe real-world phenomena than the classical causal-mechanistic model, a theory is proposed in which a third state, one of self-organization, is added to the order-chaos dichotomy. Stuff systems are considered complex systems, whose global patterns and properties unfold in time, generated through local interactions between the parts. When projecting models that describe complex system dynamics on stuff systems, much of what we observe in a house can be explained, such as the rise of order parameters structuring the parts, life cycles of accumulation, growth, restructuring and renewal, and interdependencies across scales.<br/><br/>The problem here, is that the constant reconfiguration of stuff can only be explained through interaction with human beings, but does not solely follow a path of top-down design. A theory is proposed that links the self-organization of stuff to action identification theory. This theory from psychology explores the cognitive construct of the action (“what one thinks one is doing”) as an order parameter filtering incoming information and thus structuring behavior. Action identification and affordance creation act in parallel and can be considered a doubly complex system creating and created by the self-organization of stuff. <br/><br/>Because of the process through which it emerges, this form of order is functionally optimized, cognitively logic and endlessly more complex than could be designed by drawing lines on paper. Architecture is always about order, while this order comes completely for free. The proposal following this theoretical explanation is therefore a house that uses these network-like structures as the organizational pattern of the design, instead of the traditional orthogonal ‘grid’. Three designer tools that are created following the research and a simulation through agent-based modeling in Netlogo are used in the design process to make this possible.","self-organization; complex adaptive systems; complexity theory of cities; agent-based modeling; design tool; design toolkit; spontaneous order; system dynamics; house; design; architecture; living","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Explorelab","",""

In reality, vegetation does not reflect isotropically. Therefore, during this thesis research the planetary code is adapted such that a more realistic vegetation surface is simulated. The atmosphere is assumed to be purely gaseous. Within the planetary code a surface reflection matrix is defined that simulates the vegetated surface. Two models are used in the surface reflection matrix to describe the flux and linear polarization of light reflected from vegetation, i.e. the Roujean Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function model for the flux and the Maignan Bidirectional Polarization Distribution Function model for the linear polarization.<br/><br/>At the end of the research, a planetary code is delivered that simulates the flux and linear polarization of an Earth-like exoplanet covered fully with vegetation. The flux and linear polarization are presented for a spatially resolved planet and a disk-integrated planet. The polarization is also compared to Earthshine data.

We quantify the uncertainty of flow measurements by S-type pitot tubes in narrow exhaust stacks (diameter &lt; 0.5 m) in support of recent European Union (EU) regulations for emissions from medium-size combustion plants. The contribution of blockage and wall effects to the uncertainty budget is evaluated. The aim of this thesis is to characterize flow uncertainty and to aid the development of more accurate measurement methods for volume flow rates in narrow exhaust stacks. This thesis will provide the scientific basis for implementation of EU regulations concerning emissions from medium-size combustion plants. Characterization of flow fields in narrow exhaust stacks is key to accurate volume flow rate measurements. We use numerical simulations to study the mean velocity profile and turbulence statistics of fully developed turbulent flow. To investigate the impact of wall effects on measurement uncertainty, we simulate the flow eld around an S-type pitot tube in close proximity to the stack wall. In addition, we conduct S-type pitot tube measurements at various wall-distances and bulk velocities. Throughout this thesis, we use several uncertainty quantification techniques to evaluate the uncertainty of numerical simulations and experiments. Studying spatial variation in measurement uncertainty gives insight in the most suitable locations for S-type pitot tube measurements in narrow exhaust stacks. The results of this thesis suggest that wall effects dominate over other sources of measurement uncertainty in the near wall region. Throughout the measurement plane, the combined uncertainty of measurement error sources exceed the impact of blockage. We recommend to determine volume flow rates in narrow exhaust stacks by S-type pitot tube measurements in the stack center. A correction factor can be determined to compute the volume flow rate in a narrow exhaust stack from the maximum flow rate in the stack center.","uncertainty quantification; large-eddy simulation; OpenFOAM; pipe flow; S-type pitot tube; uncertainty propagation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","IMPRESS 2",""

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a popular treatment for RDS and has been proven to be safe, feasible, and effective for use in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The well-documented success of supportive CPAP in LMICs and prophylactic CPAP in developed countries indicates that delivery room CPAP has the potential to be implemented successfully in LMICs. The aim of this thesis is to explore the feasibility of a simple, low-cost, portable neonatal CPAP device for use in the delivery room in LMICs. A portable CPAP device was modelled in Simulink to predict the pressure and flowrate at any point in the CPAP circuit. A prototype composed of a centrifugal fan, silicone tubing, nasal cannula, and a PEEP valve was constructed. The prototype was tested using a Dräger Infant Test Lung to simulate a breathing neonate. The model predicted that neonates with higher peak inspiratory flows risked rebreathing exhaled gas. When compared to the experimental data, it was determined that the model underestimated resistance in the circuit and overestimated the mean pressure delivered to the patient. The prototype effectively delivered a positive pressure to the simulated patient; however, the pressure was not consistent across all experimental conditions. Cannula type, amount of leak, and breathing pattern all impacted the treatment delivered. The Simulink model can be used as a tool to aid in design decisions, but is not highly accurate, and thus does not eliminate the need for practical experimentation. The prototype was a good proof-of-concept and should be investigated further in consultation with clinicians.","continuous positive airway pressure; preterm; low resource settings; simulation; prototype","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

The street design of a 21th century European, democratic city needs to be reworked in order to host its citizens’ activities and needs most appropriately, otherwise it may turn out too restrictive. Remodelling the street in the spirit of democratic expression, whether it means agreeing or disagreeing, became the main premise of the project. <br/><br/>The project assumes reworking of the street profile, reaching beyond its traditional surfaces of a pavement and a facade, by adding depth and topography to the street and reusing existing buildings and adjacent empty plots as protest-related infrastructure edifices. Architectural solutions assume the creation of multiple ways of framing the protest, creating plurality of perspectives, providing both panoramic and immersive experience of the crowd. Carefully designed surfaces of the street pavement and varying ceiling modules provide orientation for the crowd. The subversive use of small architecture, i.e. benches, lamps is inherently contained in their design. The space is meant to provide all the infrastructure for protest as well as to allow for multiple creative uses of space through appropriation.<br/><br/>The project devises a system of protest street, which in its universality may prove replicable in various contexts and is not bound exclusively to the chosen location of Allee de la Robertsau in Strasbourg.","protest; dissent; dissidence; Strasbourg; France; European; Union; EU; street; section; democracy; Habermas; Arendt; framing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","48.5734053, 7.7521113"

The research we -as graduate students- started off with a general but deep understanding of the changing environment, borders, cultures and landscapes in and around the delta areas surrounding the North Sea. Building up our research through mapping, there was one question that would repeatedly come up; where does the data come from? <br/><br/>Although the question aimed towards the sources upon which the research was done, the question for me went further than that. It became part of my research into the question, What is the source of climate change data?<br/><br/>The first step was to look into the sequence in which we as humans translate the raw data into something we call knowledge. In other words, giving context to raw data and giving meaning to information to create knowledge. Although this is an existing sequence, the concept provides the base upon which I further developed my research. Besides the basic sequence in which raw data is being turned into knowledge or wisdom, I found a similar sequence connecting the natural landscape as we know it, to the digital and immaterial artificial world of data. <br/><br/>German artist and landscape architect Hans Dieter Schaal worked aroud this theme in his 1978 essay and accompanying sketches, Paths and Passages and Spaces. The book is a synthesis of his previous work on continuous spaces and the fluid dynamics between the natural and the artificial. In his book: Paths passages and spaces, he describes one of his drawing as a landscape as ‘a path from a scientific-technical environment to a romantic environment. To me, it establishes a certain relation between ‘nature’ or as Schaal names ‘romantic’ and the artificial environment, as Schaal names it the scientific-technical environment. <br/><br/>First, Second and Third Nature<br/>In Garden Perfections: The Practice of Garden Theory, John Dixon Hunt identifies the cultural landscape (agriculture, urban development, roads etc.) with Cicero's 'second nature.' In De natura deorum Cicero wrote ""We sow corn, we plant trees, we fertilize the soil by irrigation, we dam the rivers and direct them where we want. In short, by means of our hands we try to create as it were a second nature within the natural world. The second nature is based upon transforming and framing the landscape by the use of physical borders. <br/><br/><br/>"" 'First nature' - wilderness - is the realm of the gods, but it is also the raw material for second nature. John Dixon Hunt thinks that Cicero's formulation would have been in the mind of Jacopo Bonfadio when he wrote in 1541 to a fellow humanist that gardens make a 'third nature, which I would not know how to name.' Later in the century, another humanist Bartolomeo Taegio also used the term 'terza natura' or third nature, in describing gardens. The third nature is therefor based upon having total control over nature, in what and how we exhibit nature through the human controlled design of a garden.<br/><br/>Using the concept of the first, second and third nature as an analogy, I am translating the concept of the second nature to the adaptation nature from which we no longer extract agricultural resources, but rather extract data. Secondly, I loop at the third nature no longer as the garden that Cicero describes as the manifestation and exhibition of nature, but rather a curated exhibition of the extracted data. By doing so, I open a new <br/><br/>The Fourth Nature<br/>With the concept of the first second and third nature defined, it arose the question about a possible fourth nature. It is an environment furthest away from the first nature; the natural environment as we know it in the first second or third nature no longer exist. In the fourth nature, it is assumed that every part of the natural environment is translated into the digital environment and therefor, the natural environment is no longer present. It is important to understand that to the inevitable step between the state of the natural environment and the state of the digital environment <br/><br/><br/><br","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This new movement has the capacity to address two major aspects of contemporary architecture: the role of architects in catering for sustainable development (ecological, economic, and social development) and, more importantly, addressing the needs of changing society (e.g. from monologue to digital). A close look at masshousing projects in the Netherlands reveals the enduring impact of the doctrines in practice at the time of their construction. These principles, predominantly influenced by structuralism, present compelling opportunities for the transformation of selected buildings. Accordingly, a main goal of this graduation project is to study the housing demand of current, multi-cultural, Dutch (in a larger scope: European) society and therefore to explore possibilities for sustainable development, and for improving the living condition in the existing, post-war, masshousing complexes. To do this, this research examines the impact of mass-customization by means of a new, adaptable to the dweller housing structures, introduced in the existing urban fabric with the aim of supporting the development of sustainable communities. From the field survey and publications discussing social problems in the mass-housing neighbourhoods, it can be observed that the existing post-war mass housing model no longer caters to the needs of current and new users. The potential of structures to deal with this shift will be studied through the thorough analysis of relevant and successful mass housing renovation precedents. Through this, research conclusions will be drawn as to the extent and type of design intervention in 3 scales: individual dwelling unit, housing block and local urban settlement (i.e. within 3-4 adjacent blocks).","housing upgrade; transformation project; public space; urban renewal; pedestrian bridge; Delft","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","51.995585, 4.339090"

This model will affect not only the way we inhabit and use possessions but also space. The increasing phenomena such as Airbnb, pose the question of whether the lifestyle of 2050 will lead to a new typology of the house: The house as a Shared Platform. In this platform-model, people will live as a community and they will use space as a resource, together with other possessions such as the bike or the boat–since water mobility will be extensively used on the IJ river. Cohabitation will be the strategy to cope with the changing socio-economic conditions; community and space as resources and means of self-sufficiency. Zaanstad, a former industrial area which will be fully redeveloped in 2050 into a dense working and living district, will be the ideal place for such an experimentation; the perfect location for the sharing community to be established and grow on the river.

Introducing new urban relationships with its surroundings, the Platform will trigger urban sprawl on the IJ. People will travel and spend the night in the Shared Platform to experience this cohabitation community. They will get to know the habits and lifestyle of the real locals of the place. The unique location on the banks of the IJ and the water mobility network of ferries and water-taxis will strengthen the experience. The Shared Platform will consist a prototype for the new lifestyle.","Amsterdam 2050; Sharing Economy; IJ river; Cohabitation; platform; Future; Zaanstad; Complex Projects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Complex Projects","","52.408786, 4.863316"

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Machine learning techniques aim to train a model in such a way that it can approximate complex dynamics like the vehicle routing problem. In the recent years, combinatorial neural networks and deep learning methods have been used to predict the solution of routing problems. However, the approaches investigated so far in literature could be cumbersome to apply and replicate. Although such methods obtained good results in predicting the solutions of simple routing problems, their structures are complex and they do not consider any sort of precedence constraints, an aspect that is crucial in passenger transportation. The goal of this thesis is to apply supervised learning to predict the optimal cost of single-vehicle pick-up and delivery problem, leading to a simpler implementation compared with combinatorial neural networks. First, the most suitable machine learning model able to approximate problem is chosen as a neural network with one hidden layer and a ReLu activation function. Then, the input features that improve the prediction accuracy are searched. In particular, very good results are observed by feeding the solutions of heuristic algorithm as input to the neural network. Compared to baseline prediction method which returns the length of the route computed by greedy heuristic, an improvement of 40\% in prediction accuracy is obtained with the proposed approach. Finally, the model is improved to achieve better generalization properties with respect to a higher number of requests, by using the average optimal length as an additional input feature.","Pick-up and Delivery Problem; cost prediction; neural networks; greedy heuristic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

Market reports show there’s a massive, untapped market for robots to be used in commercial spaces such as hotels, restaurants, fast-foods and cruise ships. These spaces could serve as a great stepping stone on the path toward general-purpose home robots by driving scale, volume, and capabilities. However, there is a significant research gap in this field: only few studies are available on the introduction, adoption and diffusion of service robotics technologies in the hospitality industry.<br/>Tactile Robots (TR) is a high-tech startup based in Lecce, Italy, whose go to market strategy is to introduce its autonomous robots for indoor delivery in hotels for performing hotel room service. On one hand, nothing or only few is known regarding what is driving adoption of robotics technologies in hospitality and about which are the factors that are influencing adoption. On the other hand, Tactile Robots lacks adequate knowledge about its potential customers and the condition under which they are willing to be delivered value by TR’s innovative robotic solution.<br/>The aim of this research is to give recommendations about the design of a viable business model for Tactile Robots by investigating the drivers of adoption of service robotics technology in hospitality industry, together with factors that are influencing adoption. Traditional Business Model (BM) design practices and BM ontologies fail in taking into account contextual factors and actors outside the firm specific value chain. In this work, we propose a novel approach to business modeling which, through a first step of empirical research involving different external stakeholders, identifies technology adoption drivers and factors under the architecture of the theoretical Technology Organization and Environment(TOE) framework. Findings are then organized to structure four case studies that represent the approach with potential customers. Multiple case study analysis provides in depth insights needed to give informed recommendations for business model design for Tactile Robots. The set of recommendations touches primarily three out of nine building blocks of the chosen business model ontology, Business Model Canvas, namely: Target customers, Value proposition and revenue model.<br/>Research showed how, in order for service robotics solutions to be successfully introduced to the hospitality market, value propositions should address predominantly the customer facing side of hospitality business. Unlike for industrial settings, robots are not likely to be adopted by players in hospitality for the only purpose of cost reduction and enhanced productivity. They, instead, need to bring significant value to the guest by augmenting the service or providing a superior experience. Furthermore, well renowned international innovative hotel chains seem to be the most suitable target segment for service robotics applications. Finally, due to stringent financial factors, it is advisable to sell robots on a leasing model which allow hoteliers to minimize initial investment and future switching costs.<br/>This study is the first that research business model design for service robotics startup entering the hospitality industry. Further research is required to validate the factors that are influencing adoption of robots in hotels and to find the relative contribution of these factors to adoption decisions.","service robots; business model canvas; adoption of innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-06-26","","","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Aeronautical composite stiffened structures have the capability to carry loads deep into postbuckling, yet they are typically designed to operate below the buckling load to avoid potential issues with durability and structural integrity. Large out-of-plane postbuckling deformation of the skin can result in the opening of the skin-stringer interfaces, especially in the presence of defects, such as impact damage. To ensure that skin-stringer separation does not propagate in an unstable mode that can cause a complete collapse of the structure, a deeper understanding of the interaction between the postbuckling deformation and the development of damage is required. The present study represents a first step towards a methodology to assess and improve the capabilities of stiffened composite structures subjected to postbuckling deformations.<br/><br/>Two regions are identified in a four-stringer panel in which skin-stringer separation can occur, namely the region of maximum deformation and the region of maximum twisting. Both regions are studied using a finite element model of a representative single-stringer specimen. For the region of maximum deformation, a seven-point bending configuration is used, in which five supports and two loading points induce buckling waves to the specimen. The region of maximum twisting is approximated using an edge crack torsion configuration, with two supports and two loading points. These two configurations are studied by changing the positions of the supports and the loading points. An optimization procedure is carried out to minimize the error between the out-of-plane deformation of the representative single-stringer specimen and the corresponding region of the four-stringer panel. <br/><br/>The optimal configurations are applied to a finite element model of a single-stringer specimen including cohesive elements to simulate damage initiation. The types of damage initiation that occur in these configurations are compared to the global/local analysis of the two identified regions of the four-stringer panel. Furthermore, the effect of the position of the supports and loading points on damage initiation is investigated. The edge crack torsion configuration that is found to be the best at approximating the twisting deformation of the panel also shows the most similarity in damage characteristics with respect to the four-stringer panel.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

For this reason, I based the approach of this project on cross-border itinerant programs, infrastructure thinking and adaptable design interventions. The goal is to produce a common territory, promote multi-temporal practices, foster bi-directional social exchange and develop spatial configurations that respond to the uncertainties of use under different time frameworks; daily, weekly, monthly, yearly.<br","transmigration; Border condition; Infrastructure; adaptable public space; mobile-fixed dialectic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","18.292503, 71.523669"

The consideration within this project is about the reframing activities, abilities and opportunities of the Flatland team. The team of Flatland is unconsciously skilled in reframing, because of their knowledge gained out of experience, which is tacit (undocumented, unstructured and based on experience). When reframing, Flatland focuses on the interaction with the client while overlooking the knowledge about reframing itself. In order to make Flatland consciously skilled in reframing, various deliverables were made to improve on Flatland’s understanding of reframing and to structure and improve what reframing knowledge already exists in the team. Four deliverables were made where a new reframing process outline is found, together with an overview of reframing tools, a reflection approach to improve the use of the reframing tools and a practical component where reframing is put into a canvas for explicit interaction with clients. The deliverables are founded on a new reframing process that has been formed during the project that guides the reframing process in four steps. The first stage is to make frames &amp; situation explicit, the second stage is to discuss frames and objectives, the third stage is to find alternative problem directions and make a choice on what to focus, and the last stage is to form a goal and approach. The conclusions per stage are translated in a definition of the problem, objective, refined problem and solution direction. The deliverables allow the reframing knowledge to be outlined, discovered, instructed and improved by the (new) Flatland employees.","Reframing; Problem-solution space; Problem Exploration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","SPD","","51.9233355, 4.4691520"

The ranking is based on simulations modelled by a three-dimensional model build in COMSOL Multiphysics with a simulation duration of 50 years. The model is a nonisothermal, isotropic, cuboid consisting of a sandstone aquifer surrounded by identical impermeable layers. The ranking is derived based on a solution space covering a minimum, maximum and mean value for each of the simulation parameters. The investigated simulation parameters are the density, porosity, permeability, thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity of both the surrounding rock formations and the aquifer, the depth and thickness of the aquifer, the flow rate, injection temperature and the well spacing. The mean values of the solution space form the base model, from which the parameters will divert separately to monitor the model’s behaviour on the varying parameters.<br/><br/>In this research, the breakthrough time is defined as the time at which the production temperature is decreased by 1% to 99% of its initial value. The ranking is based on comparing the proportional change of each parameter from the base model to the change in breakthrough time. The results show that the thickness, flow rate and the well spacing are the most crucial parameters influencing the thermal breakthrough time of a reservoir. Overall, the flow rate has the greatest impact, with a decrease of 16.7 years between a flow rate of 150 m3/hour and 250 m3/hour.<br/><br/>In addition, the surrounding rock parameters have a notably smaller impact on the thermal breakthrough time compared to the reservoir rock and process parameters. The surrounding rock parameter with the relatively largest impact on the breakthrough time is the specific heat capacity, which is only a change of 0.2 years between a specific heat capacity of 1150 and 1250 Jkg-1K-1.","breakthrough time; geothermal doublet","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

The use of shoreface nourishments to counteract this erosion along shorelines has received considerable attention in the past, having the advantage of reduced cost compared to beach nourishments. Although shoreface nourishments are thus an increasingly interesting option for coastal managers, their design is often highly empirical and based on guidelines. A better understanding of the way a shoreface nourishment interacts with the antecedent bathymetry and respective forcing agents (i.e. - waves and tides) may help to reduce the degree of empiricism and possibly optimizing nourishment design in terms of longevity and shoreline sedimentation. Rather than using design guidelines, the present research aims to relate nourishment design to beach profile shaping parameters like wave climate and sediment characteristics.<br/>Representation of beach profiles based on local wave dissipation, wave reflection and sediment characteristics have previously been studied in the form of equilibrium beach profiles (EBP). Recently major improvement in beach profile representations are made by including wave reflection in the energy balance, resulting in a two-sectioned EBP. After local site-specific parameter calibration, the vertical deviation between the initial profile and analogous calibrated EBP (z_{ebp} - z_{ini}) should indicate where a scarcity of sediment along the cross-shore profile is. Shoreface nourishments are then designed by filling in the vertical gaps between these two profiles. A hypothesis was postulated stating that the optimal form for a shoreface nourishment follows the equilibrium beach profile the best. The differences in impact conventional nourishment designs (based on guidelines) have on either cross-shore and longshore transport rates are computed and compared to an EBP-based design in two separate modeling studies.<br/>Effects on cross-shore transport: Beach profile morphology and the response to shoreface nourishments are modeled in the 1D cross-shore profile model UNIBEST-TC. Three distinct conventional designs which have found recent applications are selected and based on either; extension of the outer bar, creating a new outer bar or filling in the trough shoreward of the outer bar. Analysis of the model results show that all four nourishment designs are incorporated well in the cross-shore morphodynamics as compared to the situation prior to construction. <br/>The EBP-design shows strongest reduction of offshore directed transport, followed by designs based on filling in the trough, creating a new outer bar or extending the existing outer bar. Therefore the model simulations suggest that a nourishment design with the largest vertical deviations from the EBP may be the least effective to counteract coastal erosion. This partially confirms the postulated hypothesis that cross-shore transport rates are lowered most efficient while using the concept of EBP to design shoreface nourishments. <br/>Effects on longshore transport: The coastal area flow model Delft3D was utilized for a series of numerical modeling simulations to examine the potential dependencies between nourishment design and post-dredging longshore transport rates and local gradients. Model results show a similar outcome as the cross-shore profile model, where the EBP-design results in the lowest longshore transport rates. Closer examination of the simulations, especially concerning the local gradients and longshore transport rates, show that the EBP-design reduces longshore gradients by a factor two up to four compared to conventional nourishment designs. The EBP-design therefore shows less sediment transport and local gradients because of a divergence of non-linear local sediment transport rates over the coastal zone. Confirming earlier studies that local longshore gradients dominate coastal change at the scale of nourishments and the hypothesis that shoreface nourishment design based on the concept of EBP is a more efficient way compared to conventional designs.<br/>Practical applications: The results and theory demonstrate how the incoming wave climate and sediment characteristics are responsible for both the EBP shape and sediment transport. Since the erosion rates at the project site show local longshore variability, and the EBP shape remains constant even though using the same characteristics, the deviation between the initial- and EBP profile should indicate a gradient in longshore transport rates as well. Knowing this, the overall longshore gradient can be estimated using only one survey dataset. This could lead to a preliminary nourishment design, based on only one bathymetry survey and project budget. Approximation of longshore transport gradients could strongly improve the nourishment lifetime, especially in remote locations.<br/>The constant longshore shape of the EBP with respect to MSL is furthermore efficient in reducing the local longshore transport gradients. Since the EBP-model is used as a template to fill in the vertical deviations between the initial profile and EBP, the longshore variabilities are spread out over the project site creating a less obstructive flow, thereby reducing longshore transport rates as well. Whereas conventional nourishment designs follow the original longshore variabilities and only enhance them, resulting in strong 3D bathymetrical features corresponding to coastal erosion as well.","Shoreface; Nourishment; Delft3D; Unibest","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Inside the master course a specialisation within this field is chosen. Herritage &amp; Architectural Design is a study direction that is focused on handling existing buildings within their technical, cultural and historic context. The current architecture climate in the world is increasingly confronted with an expanding number of jobs with a ‘renovational’ character. Also the definition of valuable heritage is broadening and the view on cultural-, historical- and architectural-herritage is continiouslychanging. This rapidly growing field requires specialized knowledge and skills to cope with these ‘one of a kind’ assignments wich require a ‘tailored made’ approach. It touches upon specific fields like historical research, architectural theories, building technology, the field of conservation and architecture. Not only to be able to conserve and honor the historic remnants that brought us to this point in time but also to give it new meaning by letting it contribute to the architectural discourse of today. The goal of this graduation project is to get well-prepared for this exiting future. This will be done by simulating a currently existing design assignment so it takes place in a realistic setting in regards to the proposed design’s financial-, structural-, ergonomical-, climatologic- and durability aspects and so on. This assignment will be analysed from a large urban scale to ultimatly the scope of a detail. Because this assignment is done inside the master course of Heritage&amp; Design also layers of time will be analysed by assessing the history of the building and area. Chosen for this assignment is the nationally listed warehouse of ‘Santos’(fig 1.21) wich is one of the remaining vacant historical/cultural/ architectural valuable buildings in the harbour area’s of Rotterdam. Located on ‘the pols of Katendrecht’ (fig1.11) it resides in an area on the brink of a large re-development plan led by the municipality. This creates a complex design assignment to develop a proposition to prolongate the warehouse life-span within a rapidly changing context. The goal is to nderstand the value and meaning the building represents to be able to preserve its historical function and use it to enrich the future plans of the municipality of Rotterdam. The reason for choosing ‘Santos’ amongst other warehouses available for this graduation course is multi-faceted: During my student years I lived in Rotterdam and I know how little historic fabric is left compared to other big cities in the Netherlands. Especially rare are historic building assignments wich were designed in ‘classical’ style. Because of this rarity and placement in a modern metropolis I find this an interesting architectural challenge in wich I would like to develop a possible solution. Next to my architectureal interest, ‘Santos’ also appealed to my love for history and technology. These two topics combined tell me stories of the evolution of human endeavours. These are entertaining stories but they also give our current time a context in wich it can be understood better. The warehouse of Santos has a rich history and was build technologically advanced during the time it was built. For this reason i find the ‘Santos’ assignment a great challenge in the preservation of this history wich i would like to find a suitable answer for.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","",""

A free-floating object in occupying this territory is not subject to the UK’s visa or customs regimes, nor is it at the mercy of the high seas.

Het is de verwachting dat op basis van verfijnde beoordelingen en verder fundamenteel onderzoek de ‘reserves’ middels een quickscan-aanpassing inzichtelijk gemaakt kunnen worden.

Door deze te vergelijken met diverse Scia-berekeningen is een methode gekozen die het best aan de eerdergenoemde punten voldoet. Tevens zijn de invloeden van meerdere uitgangspunten met elkaar vergeleken. Nadat inzicht is verkregen in de manier waarop de belasting over de liggers is verdeeld, is een generiek systeem gemaakt, een zogenaamde quickscan.

De quickscan is een generieke, eenvoudig toepasbare, conservatieve methode om ‘het kaf van het koren te scheiden’ voor de dwarskrachttoets, zonder dat daarvoor EEM-software nodig is, welke tevens de Scia-berekeningen zo goed mogelijk benadert.

Hierbij wordt de belasting gespreid of is deze niet afhankelijk van de locatie van de dwarsdragers. Met deze kennis is de quickscan Boon ontwikkeld. Deze kan worden uitgevoerd door enkele parameters in te vullen, zoals: de lengte van de ligger, het oppervlak van de ligger, het voorspanverloop, de dwarsdragers en door de ‘kritische’ sneden (belangrijke te toetsen sneden) van de ligger te bepalen. Daarna kan snel en slim inzichtelijk worden gemaakt wat de UC op deze sneden van de constructie is, en wat de consequenties van wijziging van uitgangspunten zijn. Uit het onderzoek is gebleken dat het tandemstelsel altijd op een hoek van 30 graden vanaf het gekozen punt tot hart rijstrook moet staan om de maximale dwarskracht in dat punt te vinden. Deze belastingsposities worden automatisch gevonden, waarna direct de dwarskracht en het bijbehorende moment berekend wordt met behulp van de verspreide methode.

The most important challenge is the challenge of climate change and the transition of the construction sector to a circular system. This transition needs to happen in a revolutionary way. This thesis is aimed at proposing the first steps of a strategy on transitioning the construction sector by researching the significance and possibilities of a “different way of thinking” in the design of construction projects. <br/><br/>A transition is defined as a process of fundamental and irreversible change in a society’s culture, (institutional) structures and practices. Two factors play an important role in transition: outside pressure and niche innovations. Outside pressure opens up the so called regime (how we do things) creating opportunities for niche innovations to develop and break with the conventions in the regime. Governing this process is considered a paradox since societal change is found too complex to handle in terms of straightforward management. Transition management therefore aims to develop governance systems to manage transition. A four step cycle stimulates the forming of coalitions and the execution of innovative experimental projects. These innovation experiments are an important driver for change but are alos differnt from conventional construction projects. An abduction 2 design approach to actually create innovative solutions in these experimental projects is found to be a promising strategy. <br/><br/>To be able to apply this transition management strategy to the Bouwagenda the current situation of the construction sector needs to be examined. Based on literature and case studies the most important barrier was found in the separation between client and contractor. Also the organisational structures of experienced clients and high risks that come with large construction projects were found to be barriers in applying a transition management design approach.<br/><br/>Inspiration for a strategy to overcome these barriers was found in competitive student innovation teams that create bottom up innovative solutions. National Bouwagenda Challenges are found to be the basis of a strategy for transition. The strategy consists of two parts, a management tool that can be used to assess the progress of the transition and make adjustments accordingly, and an innovation process for construction projects that take on the challenge. This process overcomes the barriers and is centred around early client and contractor collaboration in a design process and a designerly way of thinking.","Design; construction; transition; sector; Bouwagenda; process","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Strategic Product Design","","51.998215, 4.378411"

Light content entails the design of digital content for LED lighting products, taking human experience of light as the main design objective; light texture is one of the lighting effects within the framework of light content as defined by Signify (Philips lighting). Biophilic design is an architectural design framework that takes the concept of biophilia as its premise. Biophilia is the human inclination to affiliate with natural features, like water, forests, wildlife, etc. Biophilic design aims to re-integrate this inherent affiliation with nature into the built environment.<br/>The human experience of light, the visual qualities of light texture and the basic design principles of biophilic design are put together to arrive at a design approach for biophilic light texture. This approach entails a basic design principle, focusing on integration with both the architecture and its geographical, social and cultural context; and a set of practical guidelines on how to achieve this integration through the design of light textures.<br/><br/><br/>This design approach was applied in a design project for Beersnielsen lighting designers. This project involved the interior lighting design of a newly designed visitor center for a nature reserve park. The central element of this lighting design is a chandelier that projects a light texture (light shadow projections) onto the arched ceiling of the interior. The dynamic and style of the light texture create an integration with the natural environment, while at the same time the graphic style, the scale and the structure of the texture make it an integral part of the architecture as well. It continues the character and atmosphere of the nature reserve park, to the indoor environment of the visitor center. A prototype was created to show a proof of concept for creating the desired lighting effect, and to be able to experience the effect on a full architectural scale.<br/><br/>The guidelines of the design approach as outlined in this thesis are specifically focused on light texture as a lighting effect, as showcased in the design project. However, the basic design principle of the approach can also be applied to lighting design in general. It is encouraged to explore this principle of integrated design for other lighting effects within the light content framework as well, potentially arriving at a comprehensive biophilic design framework for lighting design in general.","Biophilic design; Lighting design; Light texture; Light content","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

To predict the escort capabilities of a tug, DAMEN has developed the computer program DAMEN TUGSIM. Since the tool is becoming a decisive tool in the design process, DAMEN wants to strengthen their confidence in the simulation tool TUGSIM by gaining more understanding related to the thruster performance. The goal of this study is to quantify and increase understanding into the following regions: Thruster performance in oblique flow; hydrodynamic interaction effects encountered between thrusters; hydrodynamic interaction effects encountered between the thruster and hull. Recently performed model tests of the RSD (Reverse Stern Drive) tug provided the opportunity to gain insight into these topics and to derive prediction models. Mathematical models are developed and finally implemented in TUGSIM. Implementation of the new models in TUGSIM enabled to harvest new insight into escort capabilities of the RSD tug, especially into the braking capabilities.","Escort tug; Thruster force; Thruster-thruster interaction; Thruster-hull interaction; oblique flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-07-10","","","","","",""

Theoretically wafers can be controlled up to a very high bandwidth. In reality, the flowerbed structure suffers from resonances that limit the control bandwidth and positioning precision.

This dynamic nature of the river leads to navigational hindrance and risk of unstable bifurcation points where discharge distributions might switch. In pilot studies, porcupines have shown promising results in re- tarding the flow and cause sediment deposition near river banks to prevent bank erosion. However the aim now becomes to apply the porcupines on a much larger scale to increase the channel roughness and influ- ence discharge distributions of bifurcation points such that the flow is mainly diverted to the channel where the highest discharge is required. This way the main channel receives the largest discharge and therefore sedimentation in these channels is prevented. Currently it is not known how porcupines should be modelled in a numerical model. It is simply assumed that porcupines can be modelled similar to vegetation which is schematised as rigid cylinders with a certain density, drag coefficient and resulting representative roughness. No measurements are available to validate the assumed roughness of porcupines and if the hydro- and mor- phodynamic behaviour, represented by the model, is true.<br/><br/>In this thesis laboratory experiments are conducted to assess the near-field hydro- and morphodynamic ef- fect of porcupines and generate more knowledge about their behaviour. Experiments with a concrete bottom give a detailed insight in the hydrodynamic behaviour of porcupines without the interference of bedforms and morphological developments. Experiments with a sediment bottom give more insight in the morpho- logical development and flow patterns over time which clearly influenced the initial hydraulic behaviour. Experiments are conducted in a 12 metre long and 0.8 metre wide flume with a recirculating pump. The wa- ter level, discharge, density of the porcupine field and configuration of the field are systematically varied to identify the dependences on the drag and sedimentation/erosion volumes in the near-field domain of the porcupines. Additionally, general observations are performed, describing the flow structures and sedimenta- tion patterns in and around the porcupine field.<br/><br/>From fixed-bed experiments it is observed how the flow is retarded by the presence of porcupines. Flow is pushed around the field in both transverse and vertical direction. Behind the porcupines, longitudinal flow vectors are downward directed and the flow velocity near the bed is significantly reduced. It is observed that staggered porcupine grids help to retard the flow stronger and captures sediment behind the field in wider strokes. Non-staggered grids only work effectively in the line of porcupines. Between those lines barely any retardation is observed and therefore only narrow strokes of sedimentation are observed behind the lines of porcupines. The reduction in flow velocity behind the porcupines is similar to the velocity reductions ob- served in experiments with vegetation. The velocity retardation is gradually restored in longitudinal direction where the effect of porcupines gradually diminishes. For different experiments this deceleration of the flow has been observed and it follows a linear trend line, that by means of extrapolation can be used to quantify the effective retardation length in longitudinal direction. Water level differences over the porcupine field are observed indicating loss of energy, and pushing up the water level upstream. Porcupines can effectively in- fluence bifurcation points in braiding rivers this way. The local water level gradient over the porcupine field, combined with the velocity measurements, is used to determine the drag and representative roughness of the porcupines by using the equations of Baptist. The obtained values for the roughness are validated by sim- ulating the flume in SOBEK with the corresponding roughness coefficients. Comparing the measured water levels with the computed water levels by the model gave a relatively good fit indicating that porcupines can be schematised by the equations of Baptist with a few adjustments. The Reynolds stresses give an indication of the height of the bed shear stresses. Measurements show that the shear stress in the near-bed region behind the porcupines is lower or the same compared to the undisturbed velocity profile. Lower bed shear stresses indicate a reduction in sediment transport and is therefore an important mechanism to reduce the bedload sediment transport.<br/><br/>Mobile-bed experiments show clear erosion patterns inside the porcupine field due to the increased turbu- lence intensity generated by the porcupines themselves. For the experiment with low water levels and high flow velocities erosion is observed to be most severe, whereas in experiments with lower field density an<br/><br/>overall sedimentation is observed inside the porcupine field. Due to the erosion porcupines sink into the bed significantly reducing their effectiveness on retarding the flow. To prevent scour larger spacing between the porcupines seems beneficial. A growing sedimentation ridge behind the porcupines is observed that influ- ences the flow retardation even stronger, enhancing further sedimentation. Once maximum sedimentation height is reached, the ridge will migrate downstream as a growing sedimentation bar gradually sloping down towards its initial bed level. This length scale of the sedimentation bar is comparable with the retardation length scale. Combined with the migration rate of the sedimentation bar an estimation of the time scales can be obtained. Based on the mobile-bed experiments it is concluded that least erosion within the field is beneficial and therefore low water levels and high flow velocities should be avoided.<br/><br/>Although initial results show that porcupines show similar behaviour compared to vegetation and that the roughness can be estimated by using the equations of Baptist it has become clear that there are still major differences between the behaviour of vegetation and porcupines. Therefore further research is required to improve schematisations of porcupine behaviour, especially to improve the schematisation of the sediment transport around porcupines since no descriptions are yet available.<br","Porcupines; Permeable structures; Braiding rivers; River training; Flexible solutions; Laboratory experiment; Bank erosion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a pairwise comparison experiment, the preferences of a sample are obtained by comparing the objects in pairs. Each individual in the sample judges every possible pair of objects and expresses which of the two object he prefers. Thurstone's Pairwise<br/>Comparison Model can then be used on the gathered data in order to obtain rankings of the objects based on the preferences of the sample. This thesis investigates several properties of Thurstone's Pairwise Comparison Model and how it can be used to model human food preferences. In recent years, people have become more aware of the importance of eating healthy food. It may, however, be questioned whether healthy food is generally preferred by the population. This can be examined by means of Thurstone's Pairwise Comparison Model. In order to examine how the model performs, a data study has been carried out using two sets of food products. One set consisted of general food<br/>products, while the other set was comprised of snack products. Both sets of objects consisted of both healthy and unhealthy food products. The influence of an introduction text, emphasizing the importance of healthy food, on the preferences of the individuals has been examined as well. For this, each set of food products was judged by two groups, each group receiving a different introduction text before starting the pairwise comparison experiment. The results of the data study yielded that Thurstone's Pairwise Comparison Model is more suitable for modelling preferences of humans for general food products. Furthermore, the introduction text turned out to be not of influence on the preferences of participants.","Pairwise Comparison; Thurstone; Preferences; Food items","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

The town is made up of two setlements, Old Manali and New Manali. The original settlement of Old Manali is located high in the hills above New Manali and has an urban morphology which<br/>has been built up slowly over time around a major market street. The location and urban fabric of Old Manali makes it inherently resilient from the major natural hazards which Manali faces, mainly landslides, avalanches, and earthquakes. However, it is the heritage, alongside the recreational activities which bring tourists to Old Manali. These activities are accommodated by the local inhabitants of Manali, who mainly live in the settlements closer to the river, in New Manali, and by doing so put themselves at risk of landslides. This risk has come about through over development in New Manali. New Manali’s urban belt has expanded into the town’s nature reserve to create access to the Manali highway and The Rohtang Pass beyond. By doing this, New Manali provides and entry point for tourists traveling to Old Manali, with the linking road between the two settlements being continuously occupied with traffic which moves tourist between the two settlements. Here we see a system of Supply and Demand between these two sub regions of Manali. Therefore, the tourism industry has destabilized the resilience of New Manali, through uncontrolled over evelopment, which has led to an environment which is highly susceptible to landslides but also contains living environments which on an everyday basis are detrimental to<br/>the health and safety of the local residents of New Manali. However, it is not tourism itself that is causing these problems, it is the way in which tourism is managed that creates this unsustainable environment. The most notable aspect of this is road traffic. From this analysis, a new station house is proposed, removing the car from the streets of Manali and replacing the link between Old and New with a cable car. It is located in an expanded nature reserve which aims to re-stabilize the ground which leads from the towns urban belt to the river,<br/>preventing landslides. The station house will be constructed from a new typological hybrid which interrelated the building methods of the vernacular Kathkhuni with the typological flexibility of the modern vernacular, allowing it to be adapted from a singular home to a large public building. By doing this, small units will interlink, enabling the construction to be completed by unskilled workers and make it a constructible typology available to all.<br/>This station house acts as a test unit for the reproduction of this typology throughout the valley, enabling the expansion of the cable car system and the hybrid construction system, to renovate unsafe concrete structures.

The main objective of this research is to identify how geometry could influence and enhance the thermal performance to reduce the overall energy consumption in a specific context.

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Among the several events that have shaped UK’s present , the British colonial empire could be one of the most significant ones. With the North Sea as Britains new passage to the world the British thalassocracy created one of the biggest colonial empires that lasted over three centuries. At its colonial peak, the imperial empire had occupied 24% of the Earth’s land area with 23% of the world’s population . Trade and exploitation of resources in the new colonies became the understructure of this empire. While UK’s proximity to the North Sea on the global scale facilitated the exchange of food and raw materials on the local scale it encouraged the growth of a complex system of internalised waterways and ports providing a lot of trade opportunities for the mercantile traders. During this time, food trade linked its colonies and the metropolis via complex bilateral and multilateral shipping routes of the North Sea, laying the foundation for the development of some of UK’s biggest cities today - London, Bristol,Manchester, Liverpool etc. Food therefore, was not just an adjunct to the British imperial might but fundamental to it . <br/><br/>At the core of the colonial expansion was the concept of land appropriation that encouraged new forms of landuses . This act of reappropriating land was happening simultaneously at two scales - the global scale, where land in the colonies was being utilised to produce food products and raw materials, and on the domestic scale where land was being reappropriated to introduce new forms of industrial typologies. Within the city privately owned land was progressively sold or rented out to speculative house builders and merchants to build small scale mills factories , while on the other hand the small scattered strips of agricultural land in the rural were being enclosed and privatised to introduce large scale manufacturing industries. Over the years this gradual appropriation of rural land has led to its depopulation and has facilitated the decline of the small farmers, leaving valuable arable land in the hands of private owners. <br/><br/>Today, the decline of the small farms and the progressive privatisation of rural land has led to a severe lack of occupational and living diversity and has also dispossessed the rural of its means of agricultural sustenance . Large number of privatised rural farms in UK have shifted to commercial or animal based farms forcing the outsourcing of its increasing food demands to its former colonies. Currently 43% of the total food consumed by UK is imported by 2050, with a population of 75 million this number is predicted to go up by another 20%. <br/><br/>This project therefore focuses on food production within the UK, using two main aspects - the North sea :as its territorial frame of reference and the British colonial empire :as its backdrop . Together both these factors were crucial in developing a design proposal that explores both, the possibility of food sufficiency in a post Brexit future and speculative strategies to reimagine the rural as the new productive territory . Since food is a natural derivative of productive land, land becomes a key element of the project narrative. By overlaying new systems of production, occupation and habitat the project tries to both, establish new relationships between natural and man-made systems and also eschew the traditional distinctions between the city and the rural. Using a systematic sprawl the design tries to highlight the flexibility of a decentralised city to be able to accommodate and respond to future uncertainties without compromising on the sustainable and efficient utilisation of land.<br/><br/>By establishing new forms of ownership and occupation the design also becomes a tool to decolonize the rural land of its industrial remnants to make way for new forms of infrastructure and logistics . In this new city, the land is no longer a commodity, it is a mode of sustenance that is equally accessible to every citizen living in it. By internalizing the systems of production and distribution within this city the project tries to contest North sea’s current role as a facilitator of an unequitable decentralised global trade. The end result does not claim to be a definitive solution to the impending food crisis, rather it is a test of whether the revival and appropriation of one of the most archaic systems of land ownership and profit will be able to diminish the perilous consequences of years of consumerism that was a direct result of colonial industrialisation.<br","British Empire; UK; North Sea; Food; Agrarianism; Rural; Land ownership","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","Delta Interventions : North sea landscapes of coexistence","51.5459° N, 0.7077° E"

In recent years, however, climate change and anthropogenic pressures have exacerbated unprecedented coastal recession, threatening billions of dollars’ worth of coastal developments and infrastructure (Ranasinghe et al. 2012). In order to counteract the erosion trend and protect shoreline positions, it is necessary to carry out reliable assessments of shoreline dynamics to monitor the erosion process. Therefore, this thesis attempts to explain different spatial and temporal patterns of sandy shoreline evolution.The strict definition of shoreline is the physical land-water boundary (Boak &amp; Turner 2005). However, considering the dynamic nature of water levels and the cross-shore and longshore sediment transport in the littoral zone, many coastal state indicators have been used as proxies to represent the ’true’ shoreline position for practical purposes (Boak &amp; Turner 2005). The satellite derived shorelines (SDS), considered as a new type of coastal state indicator, provide a global shoreline dataset from 1984 to present. Hagenaars et al. (2017) stated that for long-time scales, similarities can be found between coastline dynamics based on the SDS positions and traditional indicators based on topographic measurements. Thus, for any coastal sandy stretch, time series of the SDS can be analyzed to get a first understanding of the coastline evolution in the period of 1984 – present.Three knowledge gaps are identified regarding using the SDS on unravelling shoreline dynamics:Does the time series of the SDS contain signatures of expected shoreline behaviour?To what extent is the limitation of the SDS important for unravelling shoreline dynamics? What is the application range of using the SDS for unravelling shoreline dynamics?The above knowledge gaps were addressed through the following steps. (1) We narrowed down the forcing types that would be focused on, including extreme storms, seasonal forcing, climate variability, land subsidence, sea level rise (SLR) and anthropogenic processes. (2) The shoreline changes at the eleven knowledge-intensive sites were focused on, each of which was selected based on the available documentation to verify if the influence of a specific forcing type could be unravelled through the SDS. The sites of interests include Narrabeen, Moruya and Pedro, Perranporth, Ocean Shores (CRLC), the Nile Delta, Perth, Ocean Beach, Fire Island, Gatseau sandspit and Cap Ferret sandspit (SW France), the Gulf of Valencia and Wrightsville Beach. (3) We decomposed the time series of the SDS with a range of data analysis methods, in order to extract spatiotemporal patterns of shoreline variation and correlate the variation patterns to forcing types at the eleven sites. (4) Three indices were calculated to classify rotational/non-rotational and seasonal/non-seasonal beaches based on the analysis results of the SDS. (5) The knowledge gaps were addressed through comparing the shoreline behaviour patterns derived from the SDS to the analysis within the related literature.We found that the spatiotemporal patterns of shoreline variation on the seasonal scale (due to seasonal forcing), inter-annual scale (due to climate variability) and decadal scale (due to land subsidence) extracted through the SDS are largely in line with the conclusions listed in the related literature, in which the dataset such as field measurements or video monitoring were used. Moreover, the influence of groins and beach nourishment projects on shoreline changes can also be clearly unravelled using the SDS. However, the SDS cannot be considered as the best solution to study shoreline variation governed by storms, considering the low frequency of satellite image acquisition and the influence of the image composite technique. Moreover, only using the SDS to assess the shoreline responses to SLR may not provide promising results, since the limited length of the record (over 30 years) make it hard to capture the influence of SLR on open coasts on long-term scales.To sum up, the SDS could be used as an ideal tool for unravelling coastline dynamics on seasonal, inter-annual and decadal scales governed by the seasonal forcing, climate variability and land subsidence, respectively. The shoreline changes caused by beach nourishment projects can also be clearly unravelled with the SDS. The introduction of new satellite missions can be expected in the near future, which helps to obtain an increasing temporal, spatial and spectral resolution of satellite images (Hagenaars et al. 2018). Therefore, it is highly possible that the SDS will become a more powerful tool for studying shoreline changes governed by extreme storms as time goes by. Furthermore, when the longer-recorded SDS are achieved in the future, it can be expected that the capabilities of using the SDS for studying the long-term shoreline variation governed by SLR will be improved.","satellite images; coastal dynamics; shoreline variation; CoMEM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-02-10","","","","Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM)","ERASMUS +: ERASMUS MUNDUS MOBILITY PROGRAMME",""

There is a growing need for seaborne transport and, hence, seaport facilities, especially in emerging economies due to economic and population growth, such as in Africa. In sedimentary environments, port construction may induce coastal impacts regarding up-drift accretion and down-drift erosion. These coastal impacts potentially increase risks such as harbour siltation and coastal area erosion. To mitigate or even avoid these risks in the pre-construction stage, coastline evolution around ports needs to be well-understood. Analysis of long-term shoreline position data around existing ports can provide this understanding. However, long-term in-situ shoreline position data around ports are often unavailable or inaccessible, especially in emerging economies which are often data poor. Nevertheless, nowadays a growing database of satellite images provides these data on a global scale for the last decades. Furthermore, the launch of Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform in 2016 enabled accessibility and efficient processing of these satellite images. This development allows building an evidence database for shoreline positions around African seaports. With this database, coastline evolution trends around all ports can be analysed, inter-compared and related to environmental and port characteristics to derive lessons for future port development. <br/>According to the World Port Index, 165 African seaports (after excluding river ports, offshore platforms and anchorages from 266 African ports) are identified. Only 125 ports at sandy coastlines, where SDS detection has been validated, are focused in this research. The results from this study show that coastline evolution, especially coastal area erosion, around the majority of African seaports is limited by the narrow sandy beach and rocky substratum of Afro-trailing coasts. However, there are still some ports at sediment-rich coasts having dramatic erosion and/or siltation hazards. After analysing common characteristics of these high-hazard ports, lessons are learnt for port development. Regarding site selection and breakwater design, ports with massive river sediment supply and/or ports at open coasts have larger negative coastal impacts. For coasts with river sediment supply, it is better to construct ports at the up-drift side of the river mouth to avoid interruption of river supplied sediment transport, which is found helpful for ports around West Mediterranean Sea. Shoreline management plan should be coupled with methods to maintain or increase river sediment supply, which can be learnt from shoreline retreating around ports in West Africa. Furthermore, to reduce coastal impacts around ports, port breakwaters at open coasts should be carefully designed regarding length and orientation to achieve a smaller shore-normal projected length, especially when the gross longshore wave power is massive. Regarding mitigation methods for coastline evolution impacts, shoreline protection structures are effective in reducing erosion hazards in the time scale of 30 years. Extension of the port breakwater (s) can be a temporary solution to mitigate the potential siltation problem but to reduce the down-drift erosion problem at the same time, sediment by-pass system, which is proved to be successful in South African ports, can be designed.","Coastline evolution; African seaports; Google Earth Engine; Satellite Imagery; CoMEM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-07-01","","","","Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM)","ERASMUS +: ERASMUS MUNDUS MOBILITY PROGRAMME",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The use of conventional biological assay tools, such as Petri dish, has hindered the drug discovery studies ineffective and time-consuming. To cope with this problem, organ-on-chip (OOC) devices have been developed. Modeling organ functionality, topography, and pathology, OOC devices are expected to pave the way the drug discovery processes. Recently, a novel OOC fabricated using integrated circuit (IC) technology was introduced. It is called Cytostretch. It allows for mechanical stimulation of the cultured cardiomyocytes by delivering a certain pressure to the backside of the membrane to replicate a beating heart. The presence of micro-electrode arrays (MEAs) in the device enables to characterize the field potentials of the cells for certain strains. Meanwhile, topography features such as grooves were implemented to induce cell alignment.<br/><br/>During the development of this device, two crucial problems were noticed. The first problem is the poor adhesion of the polyimide (PI) to the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane. The PI functions function as insulation layers and provide mechanical integrity to the MEAs. Therefore, the good adhesion of these layers to the membrane is a must. Unfortunately, the recent fabrication results showed that the adhesion of the PI tracks to the PDMS membrane was poor. The second problem is the PDMS membrane itself. Naturally, PDMS can take up molecules, which is problematic in the drug screening studies, since it can compromise the bio-assay results. Furthermore, the presence of silicon backbone in the PDMS structure can also be problematic for the PDMS patterning. Many reports demonstrated that PDMS could not be dry-etched without any residues. The residues were also found in the previous Cytostretch fabrication after the PDMS patterning to form bondpad openings.<br/><br/>In this report, the solutions of these two problems are demonstrated. In terms of the PI-PDMS adhesion problem, the silicon carbide-silicon dioxide (SiC-SiO2) bilayer was proposed. In the previous studies, the use of this bilayer has been reported to promote the PI-PDMS adhesion in neural prosthesis devices and flexible body patches. In this work, the SiC-SiO2 fabrication was integrated into the Cytostretch fabrication using plasma-enhanced vapor deposition (PECVD). The immersion tests and the cyclic loading tests showed that the device with the SiC-SiO2 bilayer has an excellent PI-PDMS adhesion.<br/><br/>To replace the PDMS membrane, another elastic polymer, polybutadiene rubber (PBR), was studied. Different from the PDMS, the PBR is purely organic without any silicon backbones on its structure. Thus, it is hypothesized that the PBR can be processed more easily than the PDMS. In this work, the patterning of the PBR was elaborated. The PBR patterning experiments began using a bare silicon wafer. The PBR patterning with a wet-etched titanium hard etch mask demonstrated a good anisotropic etching profile. Based on this result, the PBR patterning module was integrated into the Cytostretch fabrication. The bondpad openings in the PBR membrane were also successfully patterned with an anisotropic etching profile. Unfortunately, this successful result was also followed by some issues regarding the non-uniform PBR thickness and the results caused by the errors during the fabrication.<br","Cytostretch; Organ-on-chip; PDMS; Polyimide; Polybutadiene rubber","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-07-10","","","","Biomedical Engineering | Bioelectronics","",""

Continuing a lineage of inquiry of human conduct that is underpinned by the notion that humans engage in purposeful behaviour; the sonic act in the field of architecture questions how people behave sonically in their environments.

On the steeps slopes between plan and hill. Drawing on the strong sonic research component the outcome presents four primary spatial interventions that each hold diverse qualities for the sonic act of presence to occur.

Each of which serve as precedent for the utilisation of the sonic act as being a core design tool in defining the spatial logic.

However, local gains in efficiency can reduce runoff and hence, have an adverse effect on downstream water availability (o.a. Perry (2018, 1999) and Simons et al. (2015)). The core of the water efficiency paradox lies in the positive connotation of efficiency, even though increasing irrigation efficiency can have negative consequences. On this paradox and how basin analysis can be included in World Bank financed irrigation projects. This is done in two parts.<br/><br/>The first part of this research looks into irrigation water consumption in the Amu Darya river basin in Central Asia. With the research question: ‘To what extent is it possible to analyze irrigation water consumption in Central Asia using a locally developed model combined with open source remote sensing data?’. Global open source data for evapotranspiration (ET), precipitation (P), areas equipped for irrigation and storage change are combined with outputs from the Aral Sea Basin management model (ASBmm). These are used to determine the actual irrigated areas, check the model data with water balances and calculate consumed fractions. The results show a trend of increasing CF with increasing irrigated area and larger CFs in downstream areas compared to upstream areas. It shows a big difference (40%) without and with complete reuse of upstream drainage water in downstream irrigated areas. These trends conform to the expectations. <br/><br/>The second part of this study investigates why basin analysis is not structurally included in World Bank financed irrigation projects. Knowledge exchange is crucial for innovation and adopting new paradigms (Filieri et al., 2014; Walter et al., 2007). This is researched with the research question: «\’To what extent can a social capital analysis of knowledge exchange between academic hydrologists, World Bank staff and World Bank water and irrigation consultants aid the incorporation of the basin scale perspective on water consumption in World Bank financed irrigation projects?’. The social capital perspective provides a systematic way to look at the dimensions of knowledge exchange in a social network (Adler and Kwon, 2002). The results from semi-structured interviews are compared to the conceptual framework which was deduced from a systematic literature review.<br/><br/>One of the main obstacles in knowledge exchange and including basin analysis in World Bank financed irrigation projects is lack of time and resources. Proper basin analysis is not conducted because it is not a formal requirement. Additional issues are: ambiguity of the term efficiency, spatial distance between people and differences goals and perspectives within the Bank and between the Bank and client countries. Client countries are leading in project development and the moment the Bank has a background role. The application of basin scale analysis in World Bank financed irrigation projects should be formalized. This does not mean that investments in irrigation efficiency must stop, it means that a basin analysis is necessary to make an informed decision about that investment. <br","Water; Irrigation efficiency; Water scarcity; Water management; World Bank; Social capital; Remote sensing; knowledge exchange","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Water Management","",""

Wave nonlinearities occur when waves encounter a flow. An opposing flow leads to waves with higher peaks and reduced wave length. During a following flow, the waves tend to flatten and the wave length increases. High peak and flat troughs is a condition referred to as wave skewness. Wave asymmetry entails a pitched forward wave shape, with a steep front face and a gentle rear face. These wave nonlinearities contribute to sediment transport. Literature shows that skewness and asymmetry are widely studied in the nearshore zone. However, nonlinearities in deeper water and under influence of flow are not well understood.

The variations in the velocity skewness seem to vary with the tide. Only the driving mechanism behind this variation is not clear. The wave asymmetry shows little variation over each tidal cycle.

The effective and efficient management of the performance of these infrastructure assets is therefore an important topic for (governmental) asset management organisations. Recent developments in the field of asset management, such as the introduction of the ISO55000 for Asset Management, show an increased interest in an integral approach to asset management (The Institute of Asset Management, 2014) and having a clear alignment of strategic mission, vision and goals and operational activities – line-of-sight – is promoted as an essential part of the performance management for asset management organisations. “Brownfield” asset management organisations, i.e. pre-existing organisations with already some forms of performance management systems and a history in asset management, are now increasingly looking to professionalize their systems, similar to the suggested developments in literature...","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Low frequency measurements suffer greatly from disturbance from man-made signals. Therefore, satellite missions are proposed which use the Moon as a shield from these disturbances, by making use of the Earth-Moon L2 Lagrange point. Such missions require large numbers of small satellites. One of the challenges for these missions is getting the satellites into their destination orbit with a very small Delta V budget. This research looks into the use of low energy trajectories for such a mission transfer trajectory.<br/>Low energy trajectories are found on the invariant manifolds of the CR3BP and may be classified into several categories. Different combinations of these categories lead to different types of transfer trajectories. Four possible combinations were considered in this research, and compared to see which one best suits a small satellite mission to the Earth-Moon L2 Lagrange point. One combination has been previously researched in literature, the other three are new options for a transfer to the Earth-Moon L2.<br/>The approach known from literature resulted in transfers with a required Delta V of down to 28 m/s. Using one of the other approaches, this could be reduced to 9 m/s. Additionally, one of the approaches allows for a station-keeping orbit around the Sun-Earth L2 point, which does not only make scheduling of the transfer easier, but also allows for additional mission objectives. These are encouraging results, showing that possibilities exist for the use of low energy trajectories for a lunar L2 mission.<br/><br","Low Energy Trajectory; Low Energy Transfer; Lunar; Lagrange; L2","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Exploratory research on quality improvement is performed by analysing the underlying mechanisms of single curved resin infused sandwich panels where the tooling surface is reconfigured to a concave shape. This will be done under the influence of diaphragm reinforcement, infusion pressure, and forming speed. It has become clear that a reinforced diaphragm reduces out-of-plane wrinkle displacement at the cost of residual stress. The effect of forming speed and infusion pressure on out-of-plane wrinkles is considered to be insignificantly small under the testing conditions as described in this work. For future research it is suggested to look in to reducing frictional forces and the application of tensile stresses to improve formability and panel quality.","Adaptive Mould Forming; Reconfigurable Mould Forming; Double curved sandwich panel; Single curved sandwich panel; Reinforced diaphragm; Wrinkle reduction; Inter-ply slip; Quality improvement; Geometrical model for slip","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-10","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Het is noodzakelijk dat leerlingen deze competenties zelfregulerend leren ontwikkelen; dit verhoogt de effectiviteit van het leerproces. Doel van het onderzoek was om een bijdrage te leveren aan de ontwikkeling van praktische handvatten, voor leerlingen en docenten, om het zelfregulerend ontwikkelen van competenties in groepen binnen het technasium te kunnen ondersteunen.<br/>De ontwikkelde handvatten bestaan uit een combinatie van een Competentiemonitor en een POP-formulier (persoonlijk ontwikkelplan). De Competentiemonitor wordt gebruikt om de ontwikkeling van de leerling visueel in kaart te brengen, over een langere periode, om sterke en zwakke punten te identificeren en leerdoelen te kiezen. Voor deze Competentiemonitor is gebruik gemaakt van een indeling in zes competentieclusters, en twintig daaronder gegroepeerde competenties, zoals opgesteld door de Stichting Technasium (Van den Brink, 2016). Het POP-formulier ondersteunt het leerproces tijdens een projectperiode door middel van prompting op drie momenten tijdens het project, volgens de drie fasen (forethought-, performance- en self-reflection phase) van het cyclisch proces van zelfregulatie volgens Zimmerman (2000).<br/>Het onderzoek is gedeeltelijk uitgevoerd in samenwerking met de Stichting Technasium. De methode is getoetst in de lespraktijk op het technasium van het Calandlyceum in Amsterdam, door middel van design-based research (DBR). Met het oog op triangulatie is gebruik gemaakt van een mixed-methods opzet. Voor het kwantitatieve deel van het onderzoek is dezelfde anonieme vragenlijst drie keer afgenomen onder 200 technasiumleerlingen van het Calandlyceum. De interventiegroep (3e en 5e klas) heeft gedurende twee projectperiodes (kwartalen) gewerkt met de nieuwe methode, en de controlegroep (2e, 4e en 6e klas) heeft gewerkt met de methode die voorheen al werd gebruikt op het Calandlyceum. Het kwalitatieve deel van het onderzoek bestond uit semi-gestructureerde interviews met 16 leerlingen van de interventiegroep over hun ervaring met het werken met de nieuwe methode, en groepsgesprekken met 8 leerlingteams, waarin hun leerproces en het ingevulde POP-formulier werden besproken.<br/>Uit de resultaten blijkt dat de methode een positieve invloed heeft op alle vier gemeten dimensies: (1) metacognitieve kennis over de competentie-ontwikkeling, (2) attitude jegens werken aan competentieontwikkeling met aangereikte methode, (3) volgen van drie stappen van cyclisch proces volgens Zimmerman (2000) en (4) intensiteit van samenwerken ten behoeve van persoonlijke leerdoelen. Resultaten van het kwalitatieve onderzoek hebben de resultaten van het kwantitatieve deel van het onderzoek bevestigd. Belangrijke aspecten van de methode zijn de specifieke gedragsbeschrijvingen in de monitor, visuele weergave van het niveau van competenties en de progressie van de ontwikkeling, structuur en prompts in het POP-formulier en het daardoor effectiever in groepsverband samen kunnen werken aan de persoonlijke ontwikkeling – leerdoelen werden (in de succesvolle gevallen) binnen het team bij de start besproken en de taakverdeling werd hierop aangepast door de teamleider.<br/>Het praktisch nut van, onder andere, de theorie van Zimmerman (2000) is bevestigd door de gemeten positieve effecten van de methode.

But despite a practicable global potential of 4.4 TW as well as benefits like continuous operation and wide-ranged scalability, OTEC's contribution to the energy transition has been marginal to non-existent, with alternatives like solar and wind power being preferred. This thesis continues the previous work of the OTEC research circle at TU Delft and determines the range of economic potential of OTEC on a national and global level. Supply Curves are modelled for a selected host of tropical islands which are aggregated and extrapolated to project the international and global prospects of the ocean technology. Subsequently, implementation scenarios are designed to simulate OTEC's deployment in the future, on whose basis global experience curves are approximated. It was found that OTEC could comprise a global economic potential of several hundred gigawatts if certain preconditions are fulfilled. Such requirements are low capital expenses, the involvement of public authorities and the presence of high national wholesale electricity prices. Then again, if these conditions are not met, OTEC's profitability declines to zero which underlines the inherent ambivalence of OTEC's economic prosperity. Implementation scenarios proved that OTEC requires rapid installation growth and strong learning effects to render the technology sustainably profitable for any cost estimation. This thesis contributes to the research field of OTEC by tackling several knowledge gaps in literature and conversely, provides plenty of opportunities to pursue further investigations. However, besides a more local scope of investigations, it is argued that pilot plants close to commercial scale are what OTEC needs the most.","OTEC; Economic Potential; Tropical Islands","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-07-02","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

This lead to the creation of several Monotowns, newly built industrial settlements based on one economical source or industry. <br/>The project takes as a study case the town of Togliatti, the largest built in Soviet Union and still functioning. Constructed in the 60s as an industrial complex for FIAT car manufacturing. The plan of the city, designed by the Soviet architect Boris Rubanenko, was inspired by Ivan Leonidov’s project for Magnitogorsk, and was based on a grid of squares of one kilometer per side, each of which contained the fundamental facilities for living such as housing, commercial spaces, hospitals, schools and green areas. The fixed urban layout, together with the very regular organisation of infrastructure was planned in order to facilitate and accelerate citizen’s movements from one place to the other, minimising what was considered an unproductive time expenditure.<br/>The city, with its very readable and concrete set of established routines, represents the fieldwork to study the creation of everyday life rituals and to understand their materialisation in architectural space. In particular, these established rituals have been unfolded in the research in order to uncover the eventual problematics that are representative of the critical condition of the city.<br/>The current economic stagnation in Russia and the slowing down of the production, has lead the mono towns to a state of inactivity, generating lack of jobs and a general feeling of discontent in the population, proving the need of finding alternative productive sources. <br/>Concurrently relating to the contemporary debate on the productive means of the capitalist system, the project deals with the current transformation of the concept of production, that is gradually shifting from production of goods to production of knowledge. In this scenario, the line separating life and work is blurred, and the city unfolds in an endlessly interlinked maze of spaces that don’t host any specific function and yet are able to host any.<br/>The project investigates how architecture becomes an instrument of control, bending to the needs of the market and imposing hierarchical systems over everyday life. At the same time, the project experiments with alternative solutions that question the common way we perceive architecture, working places and educational institutions, highlighting the need of a transformation in the design processes and goals, considering architecture not as a problem solving practice or a profit maker tool but rather as a tool to investigate new ways of working and living. <br/>More in detail, the project wants to question the possibility of liberating production from pre-imposed economical constraints, therefore challenging the necessity of accumulation and classification and most of all private property, considering knowledge as a common good instead. The criticality of this reflection acts specifically in relation to the economic system and the contemporary lack of attention that is currently experienced in the everyday life, simultaneously putting forward the necessity to improve social interaction and awareness, the processes of thinking and reflection, aiming to the creation of a consciousness that starting from the individual would eventually spread and influence the entire social body.<br/>The intervention unfolds design concepts against classification, categorisation, compartmentalisation but also against material and immaterial accumulation. The scale of the project seeks to represent this vision and therefore surpasses the limits of what can or cannot be built to put forward an idea, an alternative that doesn’t want to be a solution but a starting point for a further reflection. In the same way, every aspect of the design is conceived to be able to be appropriated, re-interpreted and re-proposed in a different scale and condition therefore allowing the project to be not only a site specific intervention but a trigger for new ideas, questioning the way we design contemporary architecture.","capitalism; production; russia; work; machine; infrastructure; assemblage; city; post-fordism; loop; rituals; resistance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","53.5086,49.4198"

Whilst providing a specific analysis of the outcrop in question, creating a general guideline is also an aim. Prior to the processing the significance of the geologic history of the area is touched upon along with the practical acquisition of that data, concerning equipment and procedure. The physical principles of LiDAR and other possible options of acquiring data such as photogrammetry are explained, each with their benefits and shortcomings. The practicality of LiDAR is especially analysed followed by explanation and usage of processing methods such as registration, geo-referencing and computation of geometrical parameters, specifically with the help of software’s such as CloudCompare and MATLAB. Once the results of such parameters are derived, their integrity is discussed by comparing MATLAB oriented methods to those of CloudCompare. These quantified results include values of dip angle and direction over the entire outcrop and the corresponding normal vectors. Varying roughness over the surface of the outcrop and analysis of the intensity distribution present. Whilst also validating these results by comparing them with manual recorded results of dip angle and direction taken at the site. The significance of these parameters is discussed and their application in the characterization of layering. Finally, suggestions regarding the methodology both during acquisition and processing such as during geo-referencing are made by displaying obstacles encountered and flaws realized in the author’s own work.","LiDAR; Scanner; Outcrop; Feature Extraction","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Earth Sciences","",""

Public space was an important part of Greek people’s lives in the different chronological periods of its history. Starting from antiquity, the ancient agora and the Greek polis were considered as prototypes of democratic public spaces. In more modern years though, the relationship between Greek people and public space was gradually lost, leading to the present-day function of the Greek public spaces. Nowadays, most Greek people spend their free time in cafeterias and bars, neglecting so public spaces, such as squares, parks etc. Even though it is undeniable that cafeterias play an important role in the sociability, liveability and the economic vitality of an area, the way they function in Greece leads to the extreme privatization of public space due to coffee tables, the absence of people in areas where there are no cafes or the occupation of the empty public spaces by marginalized groups. Hence, the present thesis is dealing with the problematic use and the poor quality of public space in the Greek context, and especially in the city of Chania, as a case study. Many of the public spaces are extreme privatized, causing problems of accessibility and walkability, while others are not used at all or used by specific social groups developing urban voids or ghettos in the city. This existing defective Greek reality results in social exclusion and poor social interaction among different demographics, questioning the serving of needs of the different users. Taking into consideration the above-mentioned problem statement and the results by the different research methods used, it is concluded that the enhancement of sense of security, social interaction and inclusion are the main goals to be achieved in the project. Since these three concepts are more social than spatial related, design patterns are used as a method for their translation into space and urban environment. Moreover, they function as a bridge between research and design. In the end, to avoid generic solutions the definition of the patterns is a forth and backwards procedure between research and design.","Greece; Chania; democratic; public space; design patterns","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","35.51124"

These farmers construct and maintain their own irrigation systems with local inputs and have a commercial intent. Organization is often individual and farmers receive zero to minimal external support from donors, government or non-governmental organizations. This type of agriculture seems to work quite well. It is increasing quite fast and has a high production rate per hectare. In addition, it can boost agricultural production and contributes to higher food security, poverty alleviation and economic growth. However, it is unclear what the actual extent of irrigated agriculture is. A way to obtain this might be making use of satellite imagery and remote sensing. However, the feasibility of this depends on various factors and is not proved yet. Therefore, this study aims to provide insight in the possibilities and limitations of remote sensing regarding the identification and mapping of farmer-led irrigated agriculture in Central Mozambique, by using optical satellite imagery combined with ground data. This study consists of three parts: ground data collection, classification and additional analysis. Ground data is collected during fieldwork in Central Mozambique in three catchments. Classification is performed with a Maximum Likelihood classifier and uses optical satellite imagery acquired by Sentinel 2. Additional analysis consists of terrain analysis with a Height Above Nearest Drainage raster, examination of distances to streams for land uses throughout the research area, determination of the reach of irrigation canals and looking into the possibilities of thermal remote sensing. The classification results are mixed and inconsistent, especially regarding irrigated fields and light seasonal vegetation. A more detailed analysis of spectral signatures and scatterplots shows spectral overlap between these land uses. Analysis on field level or with a more detailed division in land uses shows that spectral responses reflect agricultural practices in some cases, but in general results are unreliable. Results of the additional analysis show similarities between irrigated fields and light vegetation as well for Height Above Nearest Drainage and thermal remote sensing. Also, distance to streams is not suitable as an indicator for irrigation, because irrigation canals increase the reach of the streams. It can be concluded that optical remote sensing as applied by this study does not give accurate results regarding the identification and mapping of farmer-led irrigated agriculture in the study area, because of similarities in the spectral responses of irrigated fields and light vegetation. This low inter-class separability is mainly a result of the heterogeneity of the area and the flexibility of agricultural practices. Due to these diverse practices, the agricultural plots show different and unique patterns both over time and over space, which makes it hard to generalize and classify them. However, even though an accurate substantiation of the extent of farmer-led irrigated agriculture is not feasible, valuable information obtained by this study contributes to better grasping the presence of irrigated agriculture in Ruaca, Chirodzo and Godi catchments.<br","Water management; irrigation; Remote Sensing; Sentinel 2; Central Mozambique; farmer-led irrigation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","-18.905048, 33.124531"

Special logic for correct signal processing of analogical inputs and binary outputs of relays was designed and employed in RSCAD. Several test scenarios were recreated and analysed. Distance protection function was tested with radial connection of synchronous generator to check response of benchmark system and validate correct settings of the relays. Afterwards synchronous generator was substituted by generic PV farm model. Impact of different fault locations, types of fault, power generation level and fault impedance values were studied on a basis of the benchmark model.

To assess the feasibility, the influence of the characteristics of the drill resistance measurement tool; the Resistograph® and the wood species have been investigated. With respect to the measurement tool, drill sharpness, feed speed and rotation rate were examined. For the wood samples, the influence of extractives, moisture content, drill direction and density were investigated. It was found that the influence of drill sharpness cannot be ignored and a calibration procedure was developed. No significant difference in drill resistance was observed between drilling in radial and tangential directions; however, drilling in the longitudinal direction resulted in a significant higher drill resistance. Moisture content influences the drill resistance; however, the effect is small and not statistically significant, it can usually be ignored. The influence of extractives on the drill resistance most likely depends not only on the mass fraction of extractives but also on the sort and the composition of the cell wall. Meranti has a typical density within the range 350 to 860 kg/m3. With an appropriate calibration procedure, it is possible to predict the density of meranti with 95% confidence to an accuracy of ± 70 kg/m3","drill resistance; wood density; tropical hardwoods; Resistograph; meranti","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-07-10","","","","Materials Science and Engineering","",""

However, as the penetration rate of automotive radars increases, concerns arise regarding the mutual interference. In contrast to the predominant Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radars, Phase-Modulated Continuous Wave (PMCW) radars might provide solutions for the interference problem by coding the waveforms, which brings an additional degree of freedom. In this thesis, a system level overview of the phase-coded radar is presented. Regarding the popular code families, particular attention was given to the Gold, Almost Perfect Autocorrelation Sequences (APAS), and Zero-Correlation Zone (ZCZ) sequences. This thesis has proposed three distinct designs for 16-TX-element MIMO Phase-Coded radar that drives the requirements of a Medium Range Radar (MRR). The conclusion can be drawn that APAS and ZCZ sequences have shown to provide a (sub)optimal design that is emphasized by their perfect correlation characteristics within the designated distance of interest. Furthermore, in full-transmit capacity MIMO, the proposed designs use semi-orthogonal waveforms to provide excellent performance in synchronous PMCW radars. However, performance degrades in case Doppler-shifted reflections are received, whereas sidelobes arise in range due to non-orthogonality. This thesis concludes that the APAS-coded waveforms are most tolerant to Doppler shift; besides, its Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) MIMO Transmission scheme is computationally more efficient than the Code Division Multiplexing (CDM) scheme used in Gold and ZCZ coded waveforms. Finally, the radar-to-radar interference investigation has proven that for uncorrelated PMCW- to-PMCW interference, the noise floor undergoes a consistent increase, which is according to the interference-plus-noise power level calculated from the link budget analysis. This thesis emphasizes these results, as the interference effect in FMCW-to-FMCW (provided by NXP Semiconductors) have seen similar phenomena. Therefore, results in this thesis support the conclusion that coded waveforms do not remove or suppress the energy levels of the interference. For correlated interference, ghost targets might be formed, but this depends on the starting time as well as the starting coded bit of the interferer, as the correlation peak can be formed outside the distance of interest.","Automotive radar; PMCW; Phase-coded radar; Interference","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-07-06","","","","Electrical Engineering | Microelectronics","Microwave Sensing, Signals & Systems",""

Research shows that as a result of fouling the viability of the skin cells grown in the chip decreased to zero after 3 weeks.

Concentration of services on a location or within a building that is not associated with long-term care is recommended. It can result in more efficiency, higher quality and integrated care, and better expectation management. The client’s preference of care close to home needs to be taken into account as well.

The present study investigates the effect of resting period on the short-range stiffness and the resting torque in muscle thixotropy around the human ankle joint. Twenty participants were seated on a chair with the foot placed onto the footplate connected to the Achilles Rehabilitation Device(ARD). The experimental procedure was done using segmental passive slow movements (v=5° /s) applied to the ankle with each segment consisting of multiple dorsi-plantarfexion cycles (Amplitude 15° in dorsiflexion direction) controlled by the ARD. Six different resting period durations (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 32s) were applied to the segments with Balance Latin Square randomization rule. The results clearly showed the time dependency of the Short-range stiffness (SRS) (RM ANOVA, F(1.702,32.399)=210.776, p&lt;0.0005) and the resting torque (RM ANOVA, F(1.709,32.472)=210.776, p&lt;0.0005) with a negative exponential pattern. We suggested that the most responsible structures for SRS and resting torque were the cross-bridges. We found that the resting torque was significantly affected by the multiple movements in the primary procedure (Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test, Z=-3920, p&lt;0.0005) which had not recovered to its initial value. However, the insignificant effect was found in SRS (dependent t-test, t(19)=1.512, and p=0.147). We suggested that the SRS was generated as long as having enough resting period whereas resting torque was not. Our interpretation is that the resting torque was influenced by the mechanical-history of both dorsi- and plantar flexor muscles. The compliance of the tendon and the parallel connective tissue of plantarflexors, as well as the stiffness recovery of the dorsiflexor muscles, caused the slow resting torque recovery even though the cross-bridges in plantarflexors already started reforming.","muscle thixotropy; muscle mechanics; short-range stiffness; filamentary resting tension; ankle joint","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-07-01","","","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Koorstra, P.A. (mentor); van der Meel, H.L. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The title of the research, and consequently the guiding principle behind the design, making is thinking, stemmed from a frustration with the often-held view that the latter is of greater importance than the former. That thinking, as our intellect of the mind, is of a superior motive to the things we do or make with our hands, and this is a condition which belongs to both society and the individual’s psychology. However, I believe this is not the case. I have the view that making is fundamental to our being and complements our thinking as its equal. <br/>Part of the research was a search through history, to explore whether this distinction had always been made, and if not, why and how it had happened. The history of our intellectual developments is a long and very rich one, and it is the reason why we practice architecture the way we do today. It is essentially a question of representation: what architecture, and the other things of our making, represent, but also how those things are representative of the tools we use to make them. Yet the idea that the thing in question represents a larger, intellectual or philosophical field might not have always been the case. A contemporary art historian, makes an extraordinary case for an origin of architecture in the Archaic Greek temple which had to first exist before man could have the necessary perception of things to theorise about them. Like Heidegger before her, she reasons that it is in the beautifully made art work, through the human perception of depth, which belongs to all of our senses, that human beings can take the outlook upon themselves. In her argument, making is what allowed man to think.<br/>But really, the most fundamental conclusion from the research, and essential to the project, was that things, and architecture most definitely is a thing—philosophically speaking—are defined by the matter from which they are made. Yet this is often a mistrusted truth. Our history has made us doubt this truth. That same history has given us the practice to which we adhere today, but for those of us who believe in the importance of things, and their importance as our frame of reference for a sense of being in the world, or as Heidegger would call it, a sense of dwelling, then how those things are made is an ethical and extremely important question. <br/>However, to accept only our origin is to deny the rest of the human condition which belongs to the entirety of human history. Therefore, the scientific and political realm to which architecture now rightfully belongs, through our intellectual developments in representation, cannot be dismissed. Design then is about the mediation between the two—between our poetic, communicative origins, and our intellectual, instrumental present condition. In practice it is about the balance between thinking and making—our heads and our hands.<br/>Along side the philosophical undertaking of the research a series of making exercises were undertaken. These four cubes were made with only two rules. Firstly, the shape, the cube. And secondly, the knowledge and potential of the material itself. These cubes were specifically about the making of things bound to their inherent material properties. They were made by the material guiding me, and not the other way around. This is the definition of making, thought of by its philosophical and etymological definition. In Greek poiesis means to make, but furthermore, and as Heidegger defined it, it means to bring something into being that did not exist before. It is the mimesis of nature. And so, the poet takes from the things that surround him and he makes them his own. This is how the architect acts ethically too—by making things appropriate to the place and for the people who they provide space. <br/>And this was the very objective of the design thesis, <i>Moments for Repose; Making Along the Pennine Way</i>, to explore, through making, how one can act poetically. <br","Making; Poetics; Landscape; Philosophy; Architectural design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, this often introduces increased power demands and heat generation that the aircraft was not originally designed for and can result in a reduced flight performance and increased wear. Netherlands Aerospace Centre (NLR) and the Netherlands Ministry of Defence have set up a project to investigate power and thermal management of different aircraft platforms and to optimise the operational capabilities of the F-16. As part of this project, flight tests with the F-16 fighter jet performing various challenging aerobatic maneuvers were conducted and also replicated in a simulation environment by the pilot to validate the simulator accuracy. In order to evaluate the effect of different flight configurations on the power and thermal loads, it is necessary to track the same trajectories numerous times while changing the aircraft settings. Having a pilot in the loop introduces undesired variability to the results and is infeasible. Instead, a controller is required that is able to use the recorded reference trajectories and closely reproduce these flights in a simulated environment.<br/><br/>In this thesis, a publicly available F-16 model was used and extended with a feedback linearization controller to generate an analogous set of aerobatic reference flight trajectories. To track the reference trajectories two controllers were developed. A nonlinear model predictive controller and a nonlinear model predictive controller combined with a feedback linearization controller in the form of incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion. Adding feedback linearization reduced computation time and improved tracking of engine dynamics but made the controller dependent on reference actuator angles while the nonlinear model predictive controller alone is slower, but is able to track accurately with and without thrust and actuator angle reference signals. Tracking accuracy was tested on a set of well known aerobatic maneuvers such as Barrel rolls, loops and Half Cuban Eights. The NMPC controller was able to track the aircraft position in these maneuvers with a mean error of 0.44 ft (σ = 0.39 ft) while the NMPC-INDI controller achieved a mean position tracking error of 0.20 ft (σ = 0.10 ft). Further tests included mismatches in initial fuel weight and position and finally both controllers were validated by tracking a reference generated by NLR F-16 simulator. Here both controllers were able to adjust the thrust level to counter the effects of the speed brakes that were present for the trajectory generation but not for tracking. The NMPC was able to track the aircraft position with a mean position error of 20.01 ft (σ = 13.74 ft) while the NMPC-INDI achieved a mean position error of 8.70 ft (σ = 2.38 ft). These tests showed that both controllers are able to handle significant differences in the aircraft models and still keep the mean position tracking errors within one wingspan length (30 ft) which was the size of the reference tunnel for the pilot to track.","trajectory tracking; nonlinear model predictive control; fighter jet; aerobatic maneuver","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Mechanical Engineering | Systems and Control","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","A first step in designing aircraft with optimal sound is the development of a module that is able to assess noise in a sophisticated way, which is the exact goal of this research. In this research the Audio Assessment Module (AAM) is completed with the addition of tonality, roughness and fluctuation strength. The AAM is now able to assess sound in terms of five sound quality metrics, specifically loudness, tonality, roughness, sharpness and fluctuation strength, but also in terms of conventional metrics such as EPNL. The five sound quality metrics can be combined to form a psychoacoustic annoyance value PAmod. The AAM is applied to a variety of sound recordings, including 255 measured aircraft flyover measurements of 26 different types of aircraft, in an attempt to find relations between design variables and the five sound quality metrics. The only significant correlations observed are those of the wingspan, wing loading and engine diameter with loudness. High values for roughness are observed for helicopter sounds due to the buzzing sound produced by the helicopter rotor, indicating that roughness is an important metric for propeller aircraft or aircraft with open-rotor engines. Listening tests, with the aim of learning whether the psychoacoustic annoyance value is a better annoyance predictor than EPNL, were conducted in which twenty subjects participated. From the listening tests it was found that the metrics did not outperform each other in terms of annoyance assessment. However, some deficiencies of the PAmod metric came to light during the listening tests. For a valid comparison of two sounds in terms of PAmod the duration of the sounds has to be the same, since the values ""exceeded 5% of the time"" are used in the calculation of PAmod. It was also found that the loudness contribution to PAmod might be too high. More research into PAmod can potentially improve correlations with subjective evaluations. The ultimate aim of an audio assessment module is to use it for sound engineering of aircraft designs. The sound quality metrics are capable of capturing the different characteristics of sound in a more comprehensive manner than for example EPNL. Differences in sound for current aircraft or future concepts such as aircraft powered with open-rotor engines can be captured by the individual metrics. This can then be used for sound engineering of aircraft designs in which the design is modified in such a way to arrive at a sound which is as close as feasible to the target sound. In this way, it is possible to design aircraft which sound inherently more acceptable and reduce the annoyance caused to residents by aircraft noise.","sound engineering; audio assessment module; psychoacoustic annoyance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Starting from a given network, this method constructs a new Bell inequality for a network containing one additional source and one additional party. We use this procedure to find new Bell inequalities for specific network structures and analyse how these can be used to detect nonlocality within a network.<br/>In the first part the Bell inequalities are considered from a more theoretical point of view.

We look for quantitative bounds describing a set of states that lead to violation, giving an indication of the required quality of the sources.<br/>Finally this method is applied to a setup similar to the one described by Bernien et al. We consider a network consisting of three parties and two sources. The effect of errors during preparation of an entangled pair of photons on the ability to detect nonlocality is evaluated. The same is done for the effect of measurement errors. Using numerical computations we show that violation of the Bell inequality can be improved by choosing different measurement angles.","Bell inequalities; Quantum; Networks; Nonlocality","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","",""

When well implemented, the use of BIM as a tool for communication and collaboration can lead to a higher design quality and quality of the realized building, as well as increased efficiency and costs savings. <br/>BIM can be used for integrated communication and collaboration between different stakeholders, from the same as well as from different project phases. For a good collaboration with BIM, clear objectives should be communicated between stakeholders. With BIM, project team actors can work together in a shared environment, existing of a 3D model and other tools. The project stakeholders can be architects, engineers, (sub)contractors, but also new roles that emerge due to BIM, such as BIM managers and BIM designers. Existing roles of project actors, such as architects, can also change because e.g. different technical BIM related skills are required. BIM can be used for information management between these different roles of the design team and the client and its end-users. <br/>Considering the project lifecycle, the design and operation phase are critical because in the design phase the usability for the use phase is defined, and the use phase is the longest phase of building projects. BIM can be used for communication between the different actors that work in the design and use phase. Also, end-users can be included in the communication about design and operation of buildings, to make a building better fit to the end-use. When communicating about the design and its specifications, the design and corresponding BIM model should be validated and verified.<br/> Although a lot of benefits are given in literature, the findings of empirical research show that these benefits are often not met in practice: interviewed stakeholders stated that the benefits are not always working out as proposed by BIM programme makers, and the connection between design and use with BIM is often not implemented well enough, e.g. due to different information needs of different actors. <br/>The process of communication in the project, as well of the way stakeholders validate and verify the design, are influenced by the project context, including language, culture, background and interests of different stakeholders. Further, incidents during the process can influence the extent that the BIM documents such as protocols and execution plans, as agreed upon in the start of the project, are followed during the project. Critical points towards a successful project are: 1. To use BIM as a means, instead of a goal in itself: the reasons why BIM is used should be well defined upfront, and good agreements should be made about it.; 2. BIM is not only a way to resolve design errors, but also to involve different stakeholders, including the client. The interests and competences of different actors should be defined upfront; 3. If the client does not have extensive knowledge of BIM, or does not know exactly why and how to use BIM, it is also up to the design team to help the client sort this out. 4.

The project merges the spatial archaeology of urban hydrological infrastructure and its architectural implications with a series of public programs to act as public services on a new civic backbone. Hence, the project becomes a construct of site-bound reprogramming and civic speculation.","border; reclaim; barcode","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

This is pursued through, firstly, gaining an understanding of the fossil dependency and how this has affected our cities and practices. In order to overturn this effect and open the way for the urban energy transition, urban design needs to become more responsive to the climate in terms of buildings’ energy use and to incorporate renewable energy technologies. In this direction climate-responsive and energy-active urban design is introduced as part of sustainable urban design, and the steps taken in the project contribute in its implementation within existing residential areas, and more specifically dutch post-war neighbourhoods. Because apart from facilitating the urban energy transition there is a need to sustain the rapidly growing urbanization rates in a different way than the one followed in the post-war era. The illusion of free space is no longer in place and densification needs to take place first and foremost in post-war neighbourhoods. Their open space and inherent unsustainability makes them an ideal case for climate-responsive and energy-active urban design to be applied. Therefore the knowledge gathered in this project in order to review the practice of urban design is combined with the morphological qualities of post-war neighbourhoods to provide with design solutions that act on three levels: lowering energy use, generating energy locally and offering the potential for densification. In the end the steps taken are combined in a design method that can contribute in developing climate-responsive and energy-active urban design.","energy transition; climate responsive; renewable energy technologies; post-war housing; Urban Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methane oxidation systems are `low technology' systems that can treat these methane emissions. Yet, methane oxidation systems are herein still sub-optimal and leave room for improvement. A numerical model was established to research the effective gas permeability ratio between the gas distribution layer and the methane oxidation layer, and the centre-to-centre distance of the gas inlet points, necessary to achieve a spatial homogeneous methane load. In order to relate the permeability ratio to the design choice for the materials, laboratory experiments were performed to asses the influences of compaction level, hydraulic conditions and physical properties of a soil on the effective permeability of that soil. Overall, it is concluded that the effective permeability is predominantly influenced by the compaction level and soil texture. The water saturation only has a significant influence at near saturated levels. This means that the choice of suitable material and adequate construction practice has more effect on the effective permeability than seasonal changes in saturation levels in moderate climates. Furthermore, it is concluded that there are two parameters that govern the spatial homogeneity of the methane fluxes from the gas distribution layer into the methane oxidation layers: the permeability ratio between these layers, and the centre-to-centre distance between the inlet points. The required permeability ratio increases quadratically with an increasing centre-to-centre distance. <br/><br/>Nederlands: <br/>Stortplaatsen zijn aangeduid als een belangrijke bron van methaanemissies. Methaanoxidatiesystemen zijn technisch simpele systemen die het stortgas kunnen saneren. Op dit moment zijn de bestaande methaanoxidatiesystemen nog weinig efficiënt en is het noodzakelijk om de homogeniteit van de laterale distributie van het stortgas te optimaliseren. Er is een numeriek model gegenereerd om inzicht te geven in de benodigde ratio tussen de effectieve permeabiliteit voor gas van de gasdistributielaag en van de methaanoxidatielaag, en in de maximale hart-op-hartafstand tussen de gasinlaatpunten om deze lateraal homogene methaan distributie te bereiken. Om de effectieve permeabiliteitsratio te relateren aan de materiaalselectie zijn er laboratoriumexperimenten uitgevoerd, die de invloeden van het compactieniveau, de hydraulische condities en de fysieke grondeigenschappen op de effectieve permeabiliteit voor gas vaststellen. Al met al kan worden geconcludeerd dat de effectieve permeabiliteit hoofdzakelijk wordt beïnvloed door het compactieniveau en de grondtextuur. Het watergehalte blijkt alleen significante invloed te hebben onder bijna verzadigde omstandigheden. Dit betekent dat een geschikte materiaalkeuze en adequate constructie de effectieve permeabiliteit voor gas meer beïnvloeden dan de seizoensgerelateerde veranderingen in het watergehalte in gematigde klimaten. Daarnaast kan worden geconcludeerd dat twee parameters bepalend zijn voor de laterale homogeniteit van de methaanstroom van de gasdistributielaag naar de methaanoxidatielaag: de ratio tussen de effectieve permeabiliteit voor gas tussen deze twee lagen, en de hart-op-hartafstand van de gasinlaatpunten.

More and more, devices are used to help with simple tasks in our lives. Little computers are installed in a large variety of consumer products and are often connected to the internet. The large increase of these “resource-constrained” devices that are connected to the internet results in security challenges. Communication between IoT devices often occurs through asymmetric key encryption where keys are distributed through a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). Traditional PKIs have a number of downsides: they have a single point of failure, provide a difficult revocation scheme and lack transparency. The emergence of Blockchain technology has provided a new direction for the research on PKIs, solving certain downsides of traditional PKI systems. In this thesis, we present DEcentralized Key INfrastructure (DECKIN). Our solution addresses scalability, key management for recovery and revocation and verification of the identity that is being registered in a fully decentralized context. We do this by building an infrastructure on top of blockchain technology.<br/>The system uses cryptographic accumulators to enable resource-constrained devices to lookup if certain identity-key values are correctly registered within the system without requiring these devices to traverse the entire blockchain. Our system also contains an identity validation protocol. This protocol is executed by each device that wants to register its identity in our system and requires the node to successfully interact with other nodes in the network for the duration of a block creation. When a node successfully conducts this interaction, his identity will be confirmed and the registration will be completed. Participants can now lookup his key in the system. Lastly, we use Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) technology to handle key-management challenges in our system. PUF technology uses hardware specific features to create a digital fingerprint for each device. This technique enables devices to recover their secret key without requiring them to store anything locally.","cryptography; pki; security","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Data Science and Technology","",""

Despite being a modus facilitated by and generative of a typically postmodern, neoliberal reorganisation of capital, this urbanistic dictum is not a late 20th century phenomenon, but an ever ongoing material-discursive project, following the steps of the likes of Cerdà and Saint-Simon. Naturally, a well-developed mobility network is capable of breaking centre-periphery dichotomies, redistributing capital, providing just-in-time, around the clock goods and services and rendering accessible a greater variety of spaces for a greater variety of people – theoretically enabling everyone to 'choose' their lifestyle. However, the deterritorialisation of internal boundaries always entails a reification of external ones; something of which, to mention one example, the migration politics of the European Union is a clear example – its policies struggling to adapt urban territories to the increased flux of asylum seekers and intra-european economic migrants; an influx which which, although perceived as a threat to the European Project, is facilitated by its very own hypermobile raison d'être Furthermore, transit space is not something to 'enter' and 'exit' - ”you are not stuck in traffic, you are traffic” - and all mobile societies require intense synchronisation, monitoring and control - modulation - of bodies and spaces. <br/><br/>The project argues that we ought to remain aware and weary of the effects of the positive feedback loop of interiorising forces and hypermobile ideals, on subjectivity in general, and the built environment in particular. As a response, 'Intensely Infrastructural' suggests a permanent intervention for (con)temporary needs for shelter as well as future civic desires of ever more mobile subjects, located in Strasbourg, one of three administrative centres of the European Union, historically defined by a binational identity, and currently in possession of France's most sophisticated multi-modal transportation infrastructure. Wedged between vast train and road systems, and set within the long stretch of artificial slope – glacis - that marks the previously fortified western boundary of the city, the intervention attempts to rearticulate this residual boundary condition, currently defined by technologies of mobility and defense, as a relatively autonomous ”processual ecology”, consisting of factors which affect and are affected by the Seamless without being immediately involved in its system – an 'immanent outside' . Unlike the systemic environment of the Seamless Paradigm, which quantitatively defines its singularity through interior-exterior relations, the immanent outside is defined qualitatively, through the very surplus, externalities and contingencies brought about by the Seamless. By locating, articulating, appropriating and intensifying the immanent outside, the project seeks to provide a facilitating environment for growing truly ”nomadic subjects” willing to not only consume space through vectorial movement, but to produce it by staying put; to change not simply their habitat, but their habits.","intensive; Infrastructure; Shelter; Nomadic; Subject","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

RES is developing the WEpod, a shuttle capable of autonomously navigating through mixed traffic. This research has been done in cooperation with RES to improve the localization capabilities of the WEpod. The WEpod currently localizes using its GPS and lidar sensors. These have proven to be not accurate and reliable enough to safely navigate through traffic. Therefore, other methods of localization and mapping have been investigated. The primary method investigated in this research is monocular Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). Based on literature and practical studies, ORB-SLAM has been chosen as the implementation of SLAM. Unfortunately, ORB-SLAM is unable to initialize the setup when applied on WEpod images. Literature has shown that this problem can be solved by adding depth information to the inputs of ORB-SLAM. Obtaining depth information for the WEpod images is not an arbitrary task. The sensors on the WEpod are not capable of creating the required dense depth-maps. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) could be used to create the depth-maps. This research investigates whether adding a depth-estimating CNN solves this initialization problem and increases the tracking accuracy of monocular ORB-SLAM. A well performing CNN is chosen and combined with ORB-SLAM. Images pass through the depth estimating CNN to obtain depth-maps. These depth-maps together with the original images are used in ORB-SLAM, keeping the whole setup monocular. ORB-SLAM with the CNN is first tested on the Kitti dataset. The Kitti dataset is used since monocular ORB- SLAM initializes on Kitti images and ground-truth depth-maps can be obtained for Kitti images. Monocular ORB-SLAM’s tracking accuracy has been compared to ORB-SLAM with ground-truth depth-maps and to ORB-SLAM with estimated depth-maps. This comparison shows that adding estimated depth-maps in- creases the tracking accuracy of ORB-SLAM, but not as much as the ground-truth depth images. The same setup is tested on WEpod images. The CNN is fine-tuned on 7481 Kitti images as well as on 642 WEpod images. The performance on WEpod images of both CNN versions are compared, and used in combination with ORB-SLAM. The CNN fine-tuned on the WEpod images does not perform well, missing details in the estimated depth-maps. However, this is enough to solve the initialization problem of ORB-SLAM. The combination of ORB-SLAM and the Kitti fine-tuned CNN has a better tracking accuracy than ORB-SLAM with the WEpod fine-tuned CNN. It has been shown that the initialization problem on WEpod images is solved as well as the tracking accuracy is increased. These results show that the initialization problem of monocular ORB-SLAM on WEpod images is solved by adding the CNN. This makes it applicable to improve the current localization methods on the WEpod. Using only this setup for localization on the WEpod is not possible yet, more research is necessary. Adding this setup to the current localization methods of the WEpod could increase the localization of the WEpod. This would make it safer for the WEpod to navigate through traffic. This research sets the next step into creating a fully autonomous vehicle which reduces traffic accidents and increases the mobility of people.","monocular SLAM; Depth-estimating CNN; ORB-SLAM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Subsurface flow can be controlled by changing the soil permeability. In order to change soil permeability rigid structures are often installed (for example the installation of sheet pile walls into dike bodies), however, these solutions are costly and disrupt the environment. Alternatively, the SoSEAL project aims to provide an in-situ solution to reduce the permeability of highly permeable soil layers in an ecological friendly and cost-effective way. The SoSEAL project is inspired by podzolization, which is a soil formation process. It reduces soil permeability via the precipitation of metal-organic matter complexes in the pore space. During earlier practices a need has arisen for a cheap, environmentally friendly and naturally available aluminum source. Accordingly, the goal of this research is to investigate if gibbsite can be used as the aluminum source to form metal-organic matter precipitates.<br/><br/>A literature study was conducted to investigate the interplay between gibbsite and dissolved organic matter (DOM). Four processes are primarily studied in this research, they are: the release of free Al via dissolution of gibbsite; the complexation between free Al and DOM; the protonation and subsequently precipitation of DOM and the adsorption of H<sup>+</sup>/DOM onto the gibbsite surface. Thereafter the following hypotheses were formulated: <br/><br/>•The extent of gibbsite dissolution is larger at low pH. However, due to its low solubility and slow dissolution kinetics, a low concentration of free Al is expected.<br/>•The organic matter (OM) source used in this study is a humic acid, therefore it is expected to become completely insoluble when the pH is below two.<br/> •The contradicting pH dependency of gibbsite dissolution and OM solubility leads a narrow transitional pH range, that is favourable for the occurrence of complexation between free Al and DOM.<br/><br/>These hypotheses are tested by performing experiments in the laboratory, where the pH varies from 2 to 8 and the aluminum/carbon (mol/mol) ratio is 0; 0.05; 0.1; 0.3 and 1. A synthesized crystalline gibbsite powder and a potassium humate are used.<br/>\bigskip<br/><br/>The results are subdivided into three pH ranges in which similar behaviour was found. In the low pH range (pH = 2 - 2.5), the protonation and subsequently precipitation of DOM is the dominant process in short term. However, when considering the long term behaviour, gibbsite dissolution is the dominant process as the DOM has precipitated. Due to the difference in time scale, there is very little complexation between free Al and DOM. In the transitional pH range (pH = 3 - 3.5), the competition for H<sup>+</sup> between DOM and gibbsite is profound. This increases the solubility of DOM and slows the dissolution of gibbsite down. As a consequence, this favours the gradual complexation between free Al and DOM. Nevertheless, due to the ambiguity of free Al measurement method used in this research, it is difficult to quantify the complexation. In neutral to high pH range (pH = 4 - 8) DOM undergoes protonation over time but stays soluble. The release of free Al via the dissolution of gibbsite is negligible in this pH range. Therefore complexation between free Al and DOM should not be expected.<br/><br/>The results presented in this research indicate that gibbsite may not be suitable as the aluminum source to form precipitates with organic matter in engineering solutions that require fast soil permeability reduction. However, the slow release of free Al from gibbsite in combination with the gradual formation of precipitates with organic matter might be interesting for robust problems that require a self-healing ability. For efficiency concern, another OM source that is rich in fulvic acids (higher solubility at low pH than humic acid) and a natural gibbsite source (higher solubility than synthesized gibbsite) should be investigated. <br/><br","SoSEAL; Gibbsite; complexation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geo-Engineering","SoSEAL",""

Its inherited planning frameworks keep contributing to the self-sustaining systems of socio-economic inequality and exclusion of the urban poor in a capitalist society. At the same time, its urban planning reflects postcolonial processes, characterised by the global dominance of Western knowledge and the assumption of its universal applicability, as well as the pursuit of the ‘modern’ urban imaginary. Derived within this context, the standard mainstream upgrading and (re)development practices to address informal areas are unsustainable: showing ineffective (participatory) processes, providing solutions unfit to local circumstances and needs, and mainly indicate our limited epistemological understandings. This project responses to this trend, by approaching the informal settlement as spatial manifestation of implicit knowledge by the subaltern (‘subaltern urbanism’ (Roy, 2009;2011)(Varley, 2013)) in order to explore alternative development perspectives. It approaches local knowledge as the implicit knowledge that arranges space and governance. The research analyses Mathare Valley, Nairobi, and uncovers its spatial, social, and economic structures, including the organisation of local governance. The aim of the project is to explore how local knowledge and a community-based approach can provide a base for a strategic framework to guide sustainable development in Mathare Valley. As a final outcome, the proposal of an integrative strategic framework combines spatial and non-spatial interventions, introducing a local co-operative organisation that forms the heart of the community’s collective process of empowerment. Accompanying the strategy is the community action plan, meant as inspiration for the community on how to instigate such a process. This thesis’ relevance derives from its appreciation of the depth of informal settlements, its contribution to a contextualised understanding of sustainable development, and the promotion of a broadening of urban concepts and understandings to discover new insights on more effective and sustainable solutions within the context of development of informal urban areas.","Sustainable development; Local knowledge; Informal settlement; Community-based development; Co-operative organisation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","-1.263598, 36.856251"

Atmosphere is a familiar conversational subject, but at the same time it is remarkably undefinable. We return to the use of the term constantly despite its ambiguous quality, or maybe even because of it. And this atmospheric description that seems to be applicable to every situation always concern a spatial sense of ambience. <br/><br/>Remarkably, the notion of atmosphere remains largely unaddressed in architectural education and practice. The appreciation for the art of building is still largely dependent upon the supremacy of it’s functional, aesthetic and conceptual value. The essential task of architecture to support human life by engaging with human experiential reality has been frequently overshadowed by these formal inclinations. Atmosphere could be defined as the very initial and immediate experience of space, and thus can be understood as a notion that addresses architectural quality. Fortunately, there has been a development in which architectural practices are showing a renewed interest in atmospheric quality in the built environment. Leading advocates of the value of the atmospheric dimension in architectural design include architect Peter Zumthor, architectural theorist Juhani Pallasmaa, philosopher Gernot Böhme and environmental sociologist Jean-Paul Thibaud. <br/><br/>Despite the fast-growing research field, the discussion on architectural atmosphere does entail a certain ambiguity. After all, the atmospheric experience is something personal, ephemeral and vague, but above all it is hard to conceptualise. We seem to be able to immediately sense the atmosphere of a place, but it seems to be very difficult to capture in text or design. We are able to intuitively recognise atmosphere, like when we recognise the essence of the weather in a glance, but we are not able to define, analyse or understand its phenomenological origin. The Argentinian poet Jorge Luis Borges captures this difference between intuitive and analytical identification as follows: ‘We might say that we know something only when we are unable to define it…This is what we know what poetry is. We know it so well that we cannot define it.’. <br/><br/>Despite the elusive character of atmospheres, is it suggested by the intuitive recognition and appreciation of the atmospheric dimension that we are able to share this intuitive sense with a larger community. The atmospheric experience seems to have a collective quality about it. Therewith the atmospheric experience has the inherent quality to be as much the realm of the layman and daily use, as it is the realm of the expert and professional discourse. I believe that non-architects primarily sense the atmosphere of a place or building, opposed to appreciating distinct visible and formal concepts. Therewith non-architects have the advantage of approaching places and atmosphere more intuitively, whereas architects to often assume an intellectual and theoretical approach. Layman may not have the vocabulary to verbalise their sensitivities for the atmospheric dimension that is acquired through an architectural or artistic education, but the notion that the sensitivity for the atmospheric dimension is largely intuitive indicates that the actual sensitivity does not necessarily differ between layman and expert. And this exceptional transcending quality is why atmosphere may be the ultimate intermediary between architectural quality as perceived by the architects who design the architectural plan and architectural quality as perceived by the inhabitants of the architectural environment.<br/><br/>I believe that architectural atmospheres are more effective than the architectural discourse has been willing to rationally admit. I would even argue that the atmospheric dimension of a constructed environment is the key to architectural quality. Therefore in this research I would like to explore how the atmospheric dimension may attain its proper place in architectural design. The main question of the research considers:<br/>How can an architect integrate atmospheric quality in the design of architecture and the built environment?<br/><br/>Dissecting this question into four parts, we will consecutively explore the phenomenon, the perception, the process and the plan. The research thesis will start with an introductory chapter in which we will look into what the perception of atmosphere entails. In chapter one we will look into the conditions under which atmosphere may be perceived. Subsequently we will look into the atmospheric dimension in relation to the design process, and finally we will explore its relation to the architectural realm. <br/><br/>Atmosphere by definition, seems to lack definition. This inherent paradox will echo throughout this research on how to construct atmosphere. The very act of analysing and defining the atmospheric phenomenon may result in the dissolution of its very quality. Therefore the research approach is built around the duality between an analytic and an intuitive approach. Even though the main body of this research considers a theoretical exploration of the atmospheric dimension in architectural design, I have sincerely attempted to protect the ambiguous quality and integrity of the atmospheric phenomenon. However in order to counteract this theoretical and analytical approach and to appreciate the personal, ephemeral and ambiguous qualities of an atmospheric experience I simultaneously kept a so-called atmospheric journal. This highly personal document, called Encountering Atmosphere - a personal account of the atmospheric dimension, contains memories, observations and encounters of atmospheric experiences. A multiplicity of sketches, images and words illustrate the way matter, light, rhythm, age, imperfection, fragility and life move me to evoke a rich emotive response to space and matter that seems to be the essence of atmosphere. <br/><br/>Furthermore, I aim to integrate the acquired knowledge on the integration of atmospheric quality in the design of the built environment in the subsequent design project of my graduation. I aim to have absorbed the acquired theoretical knowledge on this topic in a way that makes it part of the subconscious dimension of the design process, ultimately allowing me to intuitively integrate atmospheric quality in my own architectural design. My search for the integration of atmospheric quality in the design of architecture and the built environment will not end at the closing of this document, but will continue as I explore its application during my own design process. I aspire both the research project and the design project to accumulate the knowledge and experience to provide me, and hopefully others, to find the essence of the atmospheric dimension in architectural design.","atmosphere; experiential architecture; built environment; contextual design; existential task of architecture; ambience; phenomenology; architecture of inclusiveness; contextual embedment; intuitive sensitivity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","51.902105, 4.485130"

To reduce the energy consumption buildings are designed airtight. This leads to the accumulation of indoor air pollutants, which are associated with multiple health and discomfort problems. Poor indoor air quality has been linked to a number of health symptoms, like headache, nausea, dizziness, irritation of eyes and breathing problems, also known as the Sick Building Syndrome. In some metropolitan areas, indoor air has been found up to 100 times more polluted than outdoor air. The negative effects of indoor air pollution are major, also given that people in industrialized nations spend an average of 80-90% of their time indoors. Air pollution is also causing an increase in the number of lung patients. Research even shows that in Europe 99,000 premature deaths were attributed to household air pollution. <br/>The negative health effects of the indoor environment have contributed to a renewed interest in green building practices. A couple of decades ago, NASA conducted a research where they found that plants could reduce indoor air pollution and have a positive effect on the indoor environment. More recent research has shown that plants also have a positive mental effect.

The centre follows the concept of centralisation and therefore has fine grain, marked by the richness of connections between the different scaled grids. Centrality happens on the streets and so these streets, including the radials, function as high streets full of vital urban life. The periphery, however, follows the concept of decentralisation and has a coarse grain with a disengagement between the different scaled-grids. The vivid high streets of the centre change into traffic arteries, characterised by a thinness of experience of public space. Centrality happens in self-contained pockets and neighbourhoods are culturally and socially homogeneous. In between centre and periphery the Ringzone is located, which is actually a grey zone dominated by the metropolitan scale.<br/>Meanwhile, the municipality aims to maintain welfare and prosperity for all residents and therefore should acknowledge the social and economic importance of public space. The social benefit of spatial interventions is, however, not visible in the municipal strategy and in the scale and character of the projects close to the Ringzone. Moreover, trends like gentrification and fragmentation cause a growing dichotomy between centre and periphery. Amsterdam should not take this for granted, but needs to restore the balance between centre and periphery by creating continuity of vital urban life instead. Therefore, the city should focus on linking the concept of centralisation and decentralisation by making use of the radials connecting both city parts and crossing the Ring. The radials have potential as arteries of public life and the local economy, leading towards a reorientation process from centre towards periphery. Vital urban life is the end-product of the different scaled grids in the city and creating urban life therefore starts by integrating these grids. The strategy shows how Amsterdam can make a step towards continuity by zooming in on several locations in Amsterdam’s peripheral district Nieuw-West. This new approach towards the radials contribute to ‘The City in Balance’ and offers new insight for both other city parts and entire cities dealing with a dichotomy.","Amsterdam; centre; periphery; continuity; Ringzone; infrastructure; dichotomy; gentrification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Windows have long been used in buildings for daylight and ventilation. From many studies, health, comfort, and productivity are improved by the well-ventilated indoor environment, because ventilation dilutes the indoor concentration of contamination for indoor air quality. Also, too high indoor air velocity is perceived as draft or chilly, but too low air velocity may create stuffiness. Besides, natural ventilation is one of the most prominent issues of energy consumption within buildings. In summer, cooperated with chimney effect, natural ventilation can reduce the use of the cooling system. Even in winter, the operable window should dynamically adjust the ventilation rates based on actual population to control human CO2 emissions. Consequently, the use of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system will be reduced. <br/>Windows influence the natural ventilation of a building directly and guarantee indoor comfort level, indoor air quality and minimize energy consumption. Windows can be opened manually, or center controlled mechanically. Unreachable windows for instance, in atrium or skylight, are opened by window actuators which are centrally controlled or passively controlled for the reason to optimize indoor comfort. There are advantages using window actuators in terms of controlled natural ventilation. Window actuators can make a significant contribution to a building’s indoor environment and energy performance.<br/>Today it should be easy for the window to control opening sizes for adapting wind direction and wind load, meanwhile, the inlet air velocity should be possibly manipulated to optimize indoor air velocity. In this thesis, the dynamic way of opening windows by using window actuators for the reason of manipulating inlet wind velocity and adapting wind direction and load will be developed. Inspired by that air velocity varies on a curved surface because of curvature changing, inlet air velocity can be manipulated continuously and smoothly by changing window curvature.","Thin Glass; pneumatic actuator; Predicted percentage dissatisfied due to draft; 3D Printing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The only drawback is that the noise produced by current drones is deemed by humans as more annoying than car noise due to its high frequency. The mission of the Silent Delivery Drone project is to provide a drone delivery system that is faster, less expensive and has lower emissions than truck delivery while complying with Dutch noise regulations. The presented innovative configuration is a combination of a quadcopter, suitable for Vertically Taking-Off and Landing (VTOL) in densely populated regions, and a flying wing, optimized for the cruise phase. It consists of a horizontal propeller used during cruise and four vertical propellers for VTOL. The drone can carry a payload of up to 2.5 kg, which corresponds to 89% of the packages delivered yearly worldwide. Four packages can be delivered while flying the maximum range of 30 km. Thanks to the low required revolutions per minute, the absolute maximum noise caused by the drone is 58 dBA at take-off from 7.5 m and 25 dBA during cruise from a distance of 120 m. This meets the Dutch night noise regulations which stablish a peak noise level of 65 dBA and average noise level of 40 dBA.

This thesis is made by Alex kouwenhoven in the time-span of three-quarter of a year and tutored by Andrew Borgart and Ate Snijder.<br/><br/>With the increasing complexability of the built environment, the challenges for both the architect and the engineer are becoming bigger. Architects tend to make new shapes or free-forms and the engineers are challenged to make it buildable. A shape often used as a support of this free-form architecture is the tree-like column or branching column. A structure branching out and redirecting forces from a big roof surface to one single point.<br/><br/>However, the design of these complex columns is often done by the computer and optimizing software. There is a missing link in the field of structural mechanics and these types of columns, the knowledge of forces flowing through these complex three-dimensional structures.<br/><br/>In this thesis, a method of designing these complex structures is proposed. By an analytical approach, an efficient structural column can be made and multiple optimization strategies are proposed. Following these strategies, a design can be made. In the final chapters of the thesis, an example of a design is made using this strategy.","Branching structure; Form-finding; Complementary energy; Freeform architectural surfaces; Optimal path; Structural mechanics; Graphic statics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

(mentor); van den Ham, E.R. (mentor); Koolwijk, J.S.J. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The building sector is responsible for more than one third of resource consumption globally. Concerning the new construction, new regulations have been set, which impose that by 2020 all new buildings constructed within the EU should reach nearly zero-energy levels. The building envelope plays a strategic role in the energy and environmental performance of the building, significantly affecting the levels of indoor comfort. The increasing necessity of sustainability in built environments is leading to the need of the adaptive façade adoption. The façade is no longer a mere static element offering just a shelter for users. The future building skin is required to respond dynamically, being able to react to non-continuous, ever-changing climatic conditions, occupant comfort and energy efficiency requirements. It is apparent that building facades need to be transformed to fulfill adapted roles of high performance integration and façade elements need to be designed to provide the necessary flexibility needed in terms of energy flow and thermal comfort. <br/>Companies like “Rollecate”, which is a facade construction company in the Netherlands with worldwide projects have grasped this change and are interested in creating new products, which reflect the current trend of adaptivity. This graduation project started with the existing research project “Future Adaptive Facades and Components” with the question from “Rollecate” about the direction the facade industry is heading to. “Rollecate” wants to know what the future of adaptive facades is and how this is translated into a new product or a modification of an existing one that could be developed soon and be relevant for the building sector in the next five years and on.<br/>The aim of the research project is the development of a Multi-functional Façade Module (MFM) that consists of several functionalized layers that could be separately assembled depending on the architectural design of the building and the corresponding climate. Moreover, the proposed design is modular, which gives the possibility to be altered easily throughout its lifecycle, thus being also adaptive to future technological innovations. In order to evaluate it, this facade system is tested for an office building in Amsterdam, Netherlands with the main objective of providing thermal comfort to the occupants, whilst minimizing the energy consumption. <br/>In the framework of a decade-long research activity on Advanced Integrated Façades (AIF), MFMs show a considerable potential for building envelopes, being one of the most promising Responsive Building Elements (RBE) in terms of energy reduction potential. In addition, the results of this research project prove that MFMs are performing well, offering considerable energy savings. They are a promising facade concept for future applications, offering not only an adaptive but also a sustainable solution to the construction of office buildings. Nevertheless, there is still space for future improvement, as well as further research and development as explained at the end of this research project.","facade; adaptive facade; Adaptivity; multifunctional; modular design; smart materials; energy efficiency; thermal comfort; energy saving; sustainability; sustainable design; climate adaptive; climate responsive","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","Façade and Climate Design | Sustainable graduation studio",""

The main focus is placed on improving speech intelligibility, which is the task of recognizing the message from the din, by evaluating the speech-in-noise perception. The research is based on a promising hypothesis that hybrid devices should allow for low-frequency absorption and high-frequency diffusion which correspond to certain properties of vowels and consonants respectively. Given the transition to the modern aesthetics of the flat wall, compared to the inherent complexity of surface ornamentation in the past, there is a growing demand to provide acoustic solutions that allow for a higher level of complexity towards an improved acoustic environment. The effect of periodicity on a uniform scattered distribution is investigated by examining different geometrical patterns, aiming to convert traditional materials into sound controlling devices. Customized and mass-produced versions are developed,arguing whether a lower level of complexity can meet the same goals if certain low-level rules with high level of self-organization are applied, introducing the idea of simplicity and architectural smartness by preserving the economy of means for the end users. Last but not least, since speech transmission is related to spatial context and surface properties, both the macro-scale and micro-scale are examined. </p><p class=""text9THESIS"" style=""text-indent:1.0cm"">The study envisions an open-source toolbox for designers for generating design alternatives providing a deeper understanding on how periodicity affects the acoustics of a given space. Since periodic surfaces reduce the complexity of the reflected sound field, designers are encouraged to focus on a-periodic patterns aiming for a non-repetitive sequence via the geometry articulation.Further it suggests the manipulation of certain parameters, such as period,depth-to-width ratio and well width, towards an integrated workflow to achieve an optimized acoustic design. These alternatives can then be used as input fora software similar to Pachyderm Acoustics plug-in for Grasshopper, in order to get a glimpse which of those showcase a high scattering performance within the relevant frequency range. This should for no reason substitute the necessity for a thorough acoustical study as a next step but would however, involve designers more actively in the initial process of form-finding, while gaining awareness of the impact of their design choices on the acoustic environment.","Building Acoustics; open-plan preschool; transdisciplinary; Hybrid devices; absorption; diffusion; periodic; aperiodic; micro-scale; macro-scale","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology | Sustainable Design","",""

Dar es Salaam is one of the fastest growing cities in the<br/>world.

Research setup, II. Research and III. Design. It is divided into six chapters, respectively (1) investigating the problem, (2) setting up a methodological framework, (3) researching: what is experience, (4) analysing the spatial and socio-cultural conditions, (5) experimenting with possible future scenarios and lastly (6) developing a strategic plan and design interventions that address the problems.<br/><br/>The problem statement outlines that in Vlissingen trends have bigger impact then elsewhere, because the experience that the city offers, is affected. The city cannot compete on the field of city experience, which leads to a setback in prosperity, an indistinct identity and a negative city image. Since the inner city is representative, it should function optimally, so it has to turn into a place of experience. Six spatial problems make that this is currently not the case. Furthermore, the city is facing three main trends: growing harbour activity, an aging and shrinking population and growing tourism.<br/><br/>In possible future scenarios is researched how to address the spatial problems and at the same time how to deal with the possible impact the trends can have on the inner city. In the first scenario the harbour industry becomes important on a European scale and the prosperity of the city skyrockets. In the second scenario the population shrinks and especially elderly are attracted to the city. In the third scenario the touristic pressure increases and tourism becomes versatile and covers the whole year. The scenarios formulate recommendations for the spatial problematics and explain which developments should be stimulated and which should be limited or avoided, to continue in the direction of the optimal strategy.<br/><br/>The most reasonable concepts, relevant recommendations and design interventions result in the strategy concept to create a high-quality network that attracts a high-quality program and a diverse audience. This high-quality network consists of multiple layers regarding mobility, program and image quality. Design interventions show how the layers come together and how to actual design a place of experience. Furthermore, they show how the design of the public space can ensure a specific place unites with the past, present and future.<br/><br/>The design of the high-quality network will enable the inner city to function properly and become a place of experience, where trends will have less impact, prosperity is able to grow and an identity is able to emerge.","experience; city experience determinants; prosperity; trends; scenario method; Vlissingen; Dutch inner city; Dutch mid-sized city; decontextualized; historic analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Design of the Urban Fabric","","51.442882, 3.573983"

Urban stress however, stress caused by and in the built environment of urban areas, is less known. Still, quite some research has been done on this topic from the fields of sociology and psychology, but there are not many resources that focus on urban stress - with all its stressors - in general, and the relation between urban stress and urban design is also still thin. Therefore, this thesis focusses on getting a better overview of urban stressors, their relation to the public space and how urban stress can be reduced through urban design. This is mainly done by literature research and design, and the interaction between them, but is also supported by interviews, site analysis, data review and testing. <br/>Stress can be reduced using a direct approach or an indirect approach. The direct approach focusses directly on the stressor, while the indirect approach tries to decrease the negative effect of the stressor, or of the stress itself. The indirect approach can be divided into three sub-approaches: perceived control, pro-social places and restorative environments. Perceived control is important because people experience less stress if they feel like they are in control of their environment. Pro-social places, or social support, is one of the ways to cope with stress. Restoration is recovering from stress and might therefore be the most important indirect approach. <br/>It turns out that the scale of the public space within the scale of the project area of this thesis is very suited for the indirect approaches. An urban design is made for four different locations in Caledonian, London, using these indirect approaches.","Stress; Urban stress; Urban design; Public space; London","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Design of the Urban Fabric","",""

Characteristics of PDs, such as: rate of occurrence, magnitude, location and the type; gives information of the assets that must be considered. Nowadays, there are many different methods for sensing PDs in GIS (Gas Insulated Substation), however none of them can give fully information of the PD. The most important sensor is the antenna, with great advantages over other sensors, but still, with the limitation of not giving the magnitude of the discharge. The Delft University of Technology has patented a new method for measuring PDs in HVDC GIS. It is believed that this new method has great advantages over the current method, namely charge determination and improved sensibility.<br/><br/>The aim of this work is to find the measuring characteristics of this new method for sensing PDs in a GIS. These characteristics include resolution, attenuation and sensitivity. The most important feature of this new sensing method is the capacity of measuring the PDs magnitude. Therefore, a calibration method for charge calculation is provided. Finally, the new method and the antenna are compared with real measured PDs in a GIS.<br/><br/>To analyse the calibration of the new method; electrical characteristics of the sensor and GIS were simulated and compared with measurements. The results demonstrate that a PD can be calculated using the calibration method with low error values. This error value will depend in the measuring situation. The thesis also demonstrates some measuring advantages of this new method over the antenna. <br","PD measuring; PD monitoring; GIS monitoring; gas insulated system; GIS; PD; partial discharge; promotion; high frequency current transformer; HFCT","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-06-01","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The project challenges the current model of fabrication that factories are all excluded from the city by bringing fabrication back to a vertical urban factory specializing at prototyping and customization of products. Local production of building material is made possible with integration of robotic arms and 3D printers to fabricate with local collected resource. By doing so, digital construction with recycled resources enables customized architecture and builds towards circular economy.

Continued pressure being applied to the same spot causes<br/>the skin to decay, possibly continuing into underlaying tissue if the wounds are not treated. A common<br/>and proven practice to prevent pressure ulcers from forming is to regularly change the posture of the<br/>patient, so that there is not too much pressure on any one part of the skin.<br/>Momo Medical is creating a sensor system to assist in preventing pressure ulcers.

The prototype is able to detect if a patient has moved enough, whether on their<br/>own or by the nurses, to prevent pressure ulcers.

Momo Medical uses<br/>the piezoelectric sensors to measure human bio-signals, mainly respiration and heart rate, through the<br/>mattress. Two different printed circuit boards (PCBs) were designed as test set-ups to be able to easily<br/>modify the amplifier to measure the piezoelectric sensors separately.

The PVDF sensors did showed even more promising results when<br/>using them in a different mechanical configuration.<br/>In the test set-up the amplifier was also changed to improve the read-out of the sensors. Multiple<br/>iterations on the amplifier design were tested. In the final design a non-inverting amplifier was chosen to<br/>decouple the amplification from the input impedance of the amplifier and a input impedance of 100MΩ<br/>was chosen. Because of the high input impedance in the final design the signal was dampened less<br/>and less amplification was needed, thus reducing noise.","pressure ulcers; piezoelectric; ballistocardiography; Respiratory rate; Heart rate","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2023-07-04","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

The main contributions of this master thesis are the usage of style transfer for image colourization and the pipeline used for image selection. <br/><br/>By using a small set of selected colour images collectively showing the same content as the to be colourized image we can use style transfer in order to create a colour image even if the original image is somewhat damaged. This task is split into the sub tasks of identifying what is in the grayscale image, selecting a small set of images that contain the identified content and then applying a style transform based on those images. In this report we experiment with such a system, examine a few different approaches to these methods and calibrate a number of parameters. We will then compare the results of our method with a state of the art method and see that our method is especially good at providing colour to images with diverse colour pallets. An added benefit of the style transfer method is that it requires no training time, though this comes at the cost of a relatively high colourization time. <br","neural networks; graphics; Image; colourization; colorization; Image processing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science | Data Science and Technology","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","A turbulent flow is composed of swirling eddies of many sizes. Energy, which is added to the flow at the larger scales, is transferred down through consecutively smaller eddies until the scale is small enough that viscous forces dominate, at which point the energy is dissipated. The mechanism by which energy is transferred down the scales of eddies is generally described as eddy break-up, but the process of eddies breaking into smaller eddies has never been directly observed. The objective of this research is to identify and visualize eddies and their breakage into smaller eddies in numerically simulated isotropic turbulence flows. A corre- lation vector is defined at each point in space, based upon the dot product of velocity over spatial distance. This function shows eddies as the result of correlation over the entire field for each point, in contrast to ear- lier eddy identification techniques which focus only on local properties of the flow, such as kinetic energy magnitude. The resultant correlation field shows blobs of high correlation, which can be interpreted as the kernel of a coherent structure in the flow. These kernels can be seen splitting into smaller kernels over time — an indication of the turbulent energy cascade at work. Making use of the Biot-Savart law, the veloc- ity field associated with a coherent blob of correlation is generated from the associated vorticity field. The reconstructed velocity field is vortex-like in structure, and appears to break into two separate vortices as the kernel separates into two distinct kernels, yielding a visualization of turbulent eddy dynamics in real space — the first step towards the visualization of the turbulent energy cascade.","Turbulence; transport phenomena; fluid mechanics; energy cascade; turbulent cascade; richardson cascade; eddy break-up; cfd; biot-savart","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2020-07-06","","","","","Molecular Science & Technology",""

The absence of agriculture is not a problem for them - the countryside is not a place for making a living, it has become a place for living. These modern nomads tend to organise themselves in communities occupying the countryside while still being connected to the city. <br/><br/>During the last two years, people of various backgrounds gathered at the Silent Lake in order to celebrate the experience of “untouched” nature and exchange about alternative ways of viewing the world. These Gatherings initiated a participatory thinking process pointed towards understanding the potentials and future development of the site, taking into account the current context and successive urbanisation of the countryside. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, the principal question remained, being: how should one approach the development of such a site? In fact, the complexities and potentials of the rural area in which the Silent Lake is embedded seemed hard to grasp during the numerous group discussions that took place during the summer visits. On these grounds I decided to focus my research on the country surrounding the Silent Lake in order to develop a methodological framework that would allow a better understanding of the landscape composing this site which would possibly result in a more sensitive development of the Silent Lake community as well as constitute an approach that could be extrapolated into similar scenarios in different sites.<br","Community; Participatory design; Countryside; Poland; Natural materials; Straw bale construction; Vernacular architecture; Vernacular practices; Digital Nomads","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Explorelab","","51.919438, 19.145136"

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","The Spoorzone in Delft is an area that was once occupied by the railway. The historic city grew organically, and later expanded around this transportation hub. Nowadays, the railway is situated in a tunnel underground. Leaving behind a substantial vacant plot in the middle of the city waiting to be reterritorialized. On one side is the historic city centre and on the other many neighbourhoods with their own identities. The Spoorzone finds itself in between territories; in between old and new, west and east, city and neighbourhoods. <br/>Given the fact that we live in a rapid changing society, the question arises how to develop a substantial plot in the city in a durable way. How to approach a design project on a site that once was a border in between territories ànd is able to keep up with rapid changes that characterize our time. This project proposes a shift in thinking to approach the design as a dynamic process rather than a final image. This research and corresponding design project is about thinking in territories. <br/><br/>The goal of the project is to see architecture as dynamic. The main question therefore reads as follows: ‘How can an architect change its view on architecture from static to dynamic, and become able to trigger a perpetual re-assembling of space, by using territoriality as a working concept?’ The answer to this question will be explored by two ways of working. A theoretical and practical one. The practical part will be examined in the design project. <br/><br/>The research paper is the theoretical part and consist of a literature review in the field of philosophy (focussing on Deleuze and Guattari) and design studies. Concepts as territory and in-between are examined in detail to gain a basic understanding and help the reader to approach architecture from a different angle. <br/>The main finding is that a building can be approached as subject producing. Encounters between the subject and the building are affective and determine what a body can do and what it can undergo. By thinking in territories, it is possible to discover affects and to open up multiple possible outcomes of encounters between subject and physical environment. By being able to see architecture as dynamic, a building can be seen as durable, because of being able to trigger a perpetual re-assembling of use of a space. <br/><br/>The design project proposes a living room for the city that is able to keep up with the rapid changing desires of our time and, additionally bridges the gap two between the different sides of Delft, inviting people to overcome this border. The design is based on a simple structure with set of frames. Variation of this structure are make up the whole building. The frames will affect its users, giving it limits to move in between. However can be can also be affected upon, keeping it open to future activities. <br/><br/>The project is organized along a structure that moves from explaining the tiniest ingredients of a territory to the reassembling in new circumstances. This is done by breaking down, including and excluding, and finally re-assembling the components of a territory. The transition from research to the design will be made by constantly following these steps and evaluating them. <br","territory; living room; in between; change","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Explorelab","","52.0115769, 4.3570677"

The ultra-thin glass is a relatively new material which could be replaced with the thicker glasses in traditional windows to create a new concept for the building. Its promising prospects due to its low weight and its ability to be bent could develop a novel adaptive glass panel concept as a breathing skin in the building. Adaption can be implemented using smart materials capable of inherently sensing and responding to environmental changes with a type of actuation action. In this research study, the advancements of smart material technologies have been elaborated, together with the feasibility of these materials in adaptive architecture aspect. In the end, a novel adaptive glass panel concept has been offered by means of shape-memory alloy (SMA) cables in order to create a breathing skin for façade. The panel has been placed as an inner and outer skin in the selected case study. Its validation has been assessed through Finite-element numerical studies and experimental tests. The structural efficiency of the panel is evaluated by analyzing several glass laminate configurations under bending for inside and outside the situation and taking into account the effects of ordinary wind pressures for the outside condition.

The topic of this studio as mentioned in its studio manual concerns problems with ecology, climate, overpopulation, mass-migration, a shifting global power balance, changing demographics, etc., cities like Amsterdam will face in the future. But the question is: how do we want to live and what kind of buildings do we need to make that possible? Stated tin the studio’s manual ‘In the Dutch Housing Graduation Studio you will formulate a vision on the future of the city of Amsterdam and design a housing project that exemplifies this vision.’ First of all, my graduation project theme deals with the problem of the lost connection between people and their food and their lack of awareness about how food can shape the urban fabric and people’s lives nowadays. Therefore my projects research question was: How the architecture of a housing complex can contribute to raising of people’s food awareness inside the urban fabric?<br/>Furthermore, by researching different case studies of urban agriculture I came to the conclusion that food production in urban environments is a subject that is closely connected with both social and technical issues. From the research I realized that if future cities need to reach to a level that they are self-sufficient and self-sustained in the case of food supply, people need first to be more conscious about it. That meant for me that people had first to start being more aware about the problem of their lost connection with their food, and when they succeed to be aware about it, then they can move forward to the next step, which is to start creating self-sufficient neighborhoods and dealing with more technical issues. Therefore the most important factor for my design was that of educating people about the food supply problem and urban food production in general. And that could be achieved by having some food-based activities situated in the premises of the building and which have an educational character.","FOOD; urban agriculture; Architecture; Housing; Dwelling; Amsterdam; food production; Urban farming; Greenhouse; Sustainability; High density housing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","Stonghold Amsterdam","52.3668941,4.922801299999946"

The combined use of noise barriers as energy generating facilities, usually coined as PVNBs has been occurring since the late 80’s. It has not realised wide spread implementation, remaining mostly in the research domain. These structures are predominantly built in urban areas with high populations and energy consumption. In an attempt to shine light on the economic potential of these projects, an engineering design study has been carried out. By focusing on the retrofitting of current infrastructure it is hoped to stimulate investment for Energy wall projects.<br/><br/>The initial concept was coined as the Energy wall, which differed from PVNBs in that it consisted of a hybrid wind and solar system. However, in this thesis the focus remains on the solar aspect but the name Energy wall remains. An initial investigation of the infrastructure in the Netherlands was carried out using GIS, to determine what lengths of suitable noise barriers are currently available for conversion. A dataset gained from the Rijkswaterstaat, part of the Dutch ministry of infrastructure and the environment, was the base of this analysis. Calculations were made to add relevant attributes for determining the infrastructures suitability for conversion considering nearby spatially relevant data. The output of this, was used to develop a model that would perform a multi-criteria analysis, exploring PV types, configurations and PV systems costs. The focus was around the Rotterdam ring road to allow the methodology to be developed but with the hopes that the same process could be applied to a nationwide or multinational level. System costs were implemented based on interviews and research, which allowed for comparisons to be made and costs of energy to be found. A stakeholder analysis was also used to find the relevant parties for different system sizes, from here subsidies could be applied.<br/><br/>The model offers a guide for pricing of major components, highlighting critical parameters that could affect the success of the project. The main methodology for system comparisons is the LCOE. The application of subsidies can make project much more attractive to cooperation’s or nearby companies for tax refunds or self-consumption. While on a large scale, economies of scale make the project competitive with conventional PV systems. Installations of this scale are rarely seen in the built environment and could have a major contribution to grid balancing.","PVNB; Solar road; Renewables; GIS; Infrastructure; Engineering study; Economic analysis; stakeholder analysis; PV systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

This will be done by calculating the correlation between control inputs and low-frequency vibrations. For this, Airbus Helicopters provides flight test data and a non-linear helicopter model. This work adds knowledge on how much the control inputs and vibrations are correlated and in which frequencies region they are correlated.

So detecting and predicting stress are necessary, it can alert people and let them take actions to deal with stress in advance. In this thesis, with the purpose of classifying and modelling stress under the real-life scenario, two experiments and datasets were analyzed with different sensors, physiological signal features and machine learning methods. The first dataset was collected from real life records, which is called SWEET study project. In this experiment, problems like missing data and imbalanced class issue were discussed. Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and Naive Bayes classification techniques were compared, with Support Vector Machine achieving the highest performance. The second dataset was collected from designed experiments including Stroop Color Word test, math test and a stressful talk.For both datasets, relevant features include the heart rate, the galvanic skin response and skin temperature. The second dataset was also used to improve the prediction accuracy on the real-life dataset by applying transfer learning method, namely Tradboost algorithm and its adaptive technique, Dynamic Tradaboost algorithm. The limitations of this Tradboost model were also discussed in this thesis.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-07-06","","","","","",""

Multi-tenant buildings occupied by creative sector companies, i.e. creative residencies, are thus assumed to improve the neighborhood’s socio-economic quality. A lack of objective insights however, gives rise to the discussion about whether the creative sector indeed provides added value for it’s location, and if so, what this added value exactly entails. <br/>Therefore, this thesis provides a more objective approach in measuring the added value of creative residencies, by combining theory, emerging data sources and statistical modelling. Using Jane Jacobs’ theory on vibrant neighborhoods and data retrieved from the social media platform Facebook, a vibrancy model is constructed through factor analysis. This model is then applied to the city of Rotterdam, to assess the impact of four different creative residencies. <br/>The results show that these cases are indeed located within vibrant clusters. However, the exact results, in terms of dispersion of the clusters and change over time, differ per case. Based on a cross-case comparison, the distinguishing case characteristics influencing the contrasting results are assessed, leading to a number of hypotheses. These hypotheses however, are still open for interpretation, providing opportunities for further research. Nevertheless, a strong connection between a creative residency and it’s neighborhood, through the presence of diverse hospitality and an open, public character, appears to contribute to a more dispersed vibrant cluster, and thus a higher added value for the neighborhood in terms of vibrancy. <br","City vibrancy; Creative Residency; Impact Assessment; Factor Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","51.9225, 4.47917"

The prediction of full-scale flow phenomena, which eliminates scale effects, is becoming available due to increasing computational power. However, the complexity of full-scale CFD calculations combined<br/>with a lack of validation data results in unknown uncertainties. This study contributes to the uncertainty estimation for full-scale calculations by answering the question With what uncertainty can we currently numerically predict resistance and propeller power on full-scale Reynolds numbers?.<br/>The resistance and propeller flow predictions are done for the general cargo vessel MV-regal for three cases; a double body, a free surface resistance simulation and an open water propeller simulation. The simulations are performed for the design speed of 14 knots, resulting in a full-scale Reynolds<br/>number of 푅푒 = 1.12 ⋅ 10ዃ. The discretization error is determined by the grid refinement study as presented by Eça and Hoekstra for the propulsion parameters; resistance coefficients and the wake factor. For each case the flow field is analysed, an uncertainty assessment is made and the results are compared to a group of numerical results for the same simulation performed by 20 participants of a case study organised by Lloyd’s register on the same vessel as is considered in this thesis.<br/>Modelling the boundary layer of a flat plate on model and full-scale Reynolds numbers encourages the use of unstructured grids for full-scale Reynolds numbers. The uncertainties as predicted by the grid refinement study, vary between 0.6 and 24.5 percent for the friction coefficient. For the 푅푒 = 10^7 the values are compared to a structured grid study, which had a better trend over the grid refinement series. Comparison to theoretical friction coefficient calculations confirmed the absolute friction result.<br/>The double body simulation, performed on the full-scale number 푅푒 = 1.12 ⋅ 10^9, demonstrated the use of the unstructured grids on the full-scale Reynolds numbers. The iterative error had to be closely monitored in order to get a stable solution. While the iterative errors had the same order of magnitude, the uncertainties as predicted by the grid refinement study for the propulsion parameters varied between 1.5 and 140 percent. This is an unacceptable large scatter in uncertainty which calls for another method to determine the uncertainty.<br/>The free surface simulation added complexity, by modelling the free surface resistance of the vessel. The order of convergence is lower for the free surface simulation, which creates a higher iterative error in the uncertainty assessment. The discretization uncertainty prediction varies between 2.7 and 23.5 percent. <br/>The open water simulation, which is based on a hybrid grid of structured and unstructured grids, showed for the monitored parameters a sufficiently low iterative error and a low discretization uncertainty (between 0.1 and 3.4 percent) for the thrust and torque coefficients. Although all different cases showed mixed results for the discretization error, the absolute values are well within the range of results from the test group of 20 participants. This is a good starting point of the repeatability of the flow parameters. It is noted that the current uncertainty estimation is larger than the difference between two grids.","CFD; full-scale; Uncertainty; Verification; Validation; Double Body; Free Surface; Open Water; Grid refinement study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Automobiles require a large amount of space and infrastructure in order to be an effective means of transit. This prompts constructing the urban environment at a lower density, which generates suburban sprawl. The low-density development then requires an automobile for ease of access, which generates dependence. In this way automobile dependence and suburban sprawl build upon each other. This relationship has a series of primary spatial effects and secondary socioeconomic effects on the urban environment. The United States is currently stuck in a system of automobile dependence that perpetuates nearly all cities across the country. But, automobile dependence is more severe than the mere use of a car. It instead, refers to the necessity of an automobile for accessibility within nearly all aspects of daily life. Todd Litman defines automobile dependence in terms of three criteria: 1) reduced transport alternatives, 2) automobile oriented land use patterns, and 3) high levels per capita automobile travel. The three definition criteria were used as the main methodology by dictating the spatial analysis, key goals, and strategy themes. The key design goals of the thesis were 1) to consider destination as well as transportation 2) work to attract suburban inhabitants back into the city and 3) focus on pedestrianizing public space. The themes of this thesis are transit, development, and culture. It is crucial that these three themes work together in a cohesive strategy in order to alleviate the effects of automobile dependence. The design of this thesis concluded with proposals at the city, district, and neighborhood level, with the design at the neighborhood level being the focus.","Automobile; Dependence; Mobility; Urbanism; Transportation; United States; Development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The blades of wind turbines are mainly made of fiber reinforced thermoset polymer composite, which is difficult to recycle. Most blades currently end up in landfill or incineration which is a waste of this high value material. In this project, a valuable application for mechanically recycled composite material is designed, which will ensure the wind turbine blades of an end-of-life situation that fits within the circular economy. Material research is executed to get a grip on the characteristics of the shredded composite. These specific characteristics are eventually used to generate ideas on valuable applications for the material in which the recyclate is a wanted addition, instead of a disturbance. Based on the formulated vision, requirements and wishes, an electrical car charger is selected as the best suitable idea. This product demonstrates how the shreds can be reused in a thermoplastic material. It has a symbolic link with the wind energy industry and anticipates on the energy suppliers, who own the wind turbines, by recycling the material into a product they offer.<br/>The electrical charger is produced by pressing the shredded composite between two sheets of thermoplastic material and shaping this with vacuum forming. After its use, the product can be again recycled into new applications. However, the shredded composite will be part of a cascading model in which the fiber size will decrease with every recycling procedure. The design is only reusing a small amount of the total supply of composite waste and is therefore not an all-encompassing solution to the problem. Additionally, mechanical recycling does cause significant down-cycling of the high value material. Therefore, it is best to replace the thermoset polymer composites with a better recyclable material, until a recycling procedure turning the fibers and resin back into raw materials is fully developed.","Shredded composite; Recycling; Wind turbine blades; Value; Composite","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","Integrated Product Design","",""

MoMPC is a configuration of Model Predictive Control (MPC) that explicitly incorporates the role of a mobile operator travelling between the points of interest, i.e., nodes, of the system as instructed by a remote centralised controller. The operator provides the controller with up-to-date measurements from the locations visited and acts as the actuator as required by the remote controller.<br/><br/>In this research, four areas of improvement of MoMPC from literature are explored and some possible solutions are proposed, resulting in a new method, called Multiple-Action Mobile Model Predictive Control (MaMoMPC).<br/><br/>First, the MoMPC approach is generalised to open water systems described as a network, wherein for each node a unique set of actions is possible, e.g., at some nodes only actuation is possible, while at others both measuring and actuation is possible.<br/><br/>Secondly, in MoMPC, controlling the system is only allowed until a predefined control horizon, after which there is often still some setpoint water level error present, which is penalised until the end of the prediction. Cyclic control is proposed to include some simplified estimate of future control in the MPC optimisation problem past the control horizon, without introducing extra computational burden. By including cyclic control the future effort to drive the water levels to the setpoints is better represented in the prediction, improving system performance.<br/><br/>The third area of improvement consists of the consideration of the limitations of the mobile operators in the optimisation problem. Until now, the human operators were assumed to be able to work continuously without requiring breaks. An extension that keeps track of the energy levels of the human operators is proposed, which can be used by the controller to schedule breaks for the human operators.<br/><br/>Finally, another shortcoming in the MoMPC approaches from literature is the discrepancy between the predicted state of the system and the actual state. Depending on the number of operators available the measuring and actuating actions will be sparse in time. Furthermore, the system is subjected to external disturbances and will always have some modelling errors. As a result, there is some uncertainty on the predicted state of the system. This uncertainty about the system can become large when some measurement locations are not visited regularly. Moreover, the uncertainty about the predicted state of the system may result in reduced system performance and constraint violations. To ensure the predicted system state does not drift too far from the actual state, the information gathering capabilities of the system have to be augmented. To that end, three methods to weigh the measurement frequency are proposed.<br/><br/>To evaluate, a case study is performed on a realistic numerical model of the Dez main irrigation canal in Iran. In the first part of the case study, the system performance when adding cyclic control to the Time Instant Optimisation Mobile Model Predictive Control (TIO-MoMPC) approach from literature is evaluated. Including cyclic control improved the reference tracking performance during a scenario without noise with statistical significance. In the second part of the case study, noise is added to the numerical model and the MaMoMPC approach with uncertainty weighing methods and cyclic control is evaluated. The results show that the addition of the uncertainty weighing methods yields enhanced disturbance rejection and reference tracking performance.","Model Predictive Control; Water management; Cyclic control; Human-operated; Networked systems; Irrigation canals; Open water systems; Mobile sensors","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Hordijk, Dick (graduation committee); van der Veen, Cor (graduation committee); Hendriks, Max (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","With the arrival of the Eurocode, the calculations regarding shear resistance, have become increasingly conservative compared to former concrete standards. For example in Voorschriften Beton 1974 (VB 74), a former concrete standard, a shear resistance combination of concrete, stirrups and prestress was allowed. Whereas the Eurocode assumes the shear resistance of the concrete is zero if it’s standalone contribution is insufficient. Meaning that once stirrups are required, the total applied shear stress is controlled by the stirrups. <br/>Prorail is the party in the Netherlands which is responsible for the construction and maintenance of the railway infrastructure. The change in regulations results in concerns for parties like Prorail and in particular to the shear resistance of concrete railway bridges constructed according to the VB 74. <br/><br/>A through railway bridge consists of a relatively thin floor and two prestressed girders. Whenever a train drives over the floor, a great deal of the loading is spread in transverse direction, causing large shear forces and torsion in the two prestressed girders. Because this combination can be critical for the shear resistance, two prestressed through railway bridges, constructed according to the VB 74, are investigated in this master thesis. <br/>It is verified with hand calculations whether or not these existing structures can guarantee structural safety by considering three shear resistance checks; the risk of shear tension failure, capacity of the stirrups and resistance against fatigue. Ultimately it is concluded, that the largest unity check is 1,01 and that both bridges can guarantee structural safety regarding shear resistance. <br/><br/>The reassessment of an through bridge, is an typical assignment for engineering firm such as Witteveen+Bos. But because hand calculations are too time consuming, the design loads are determined with SCIA Engineer (FEA program). <br/>However in the earlier days FEA programs were not available and torsion in the girders was derived from a set of differential equations (analytical solution). Because structural engineers from today completely rely on programs like SCIA, a comparison is drawn up between SCIA and the analytical solution for torsion in the girder.<br/><br/>The plate, beam model 1A and 1B are the three types of models available in SCIA to model a through bridge. The plate model consists of a 2D-floor and 2D-girder, where the beam models form a combination of a 2D-floor and 1D-girder. But the plate and beam model 1B have in common that rigid connections are applied every ¼ meter between the girder and floor.<br/>The analytical solution is derived with the assumption that the bridge is divided into strips with a length of 1,0 meter, which is implemented in the plate and beam models by reducing the E-modulus of the floor to roughly a third (cracked floor). For the governing load combination, this leads to values for torsion, which remain 10-15%, 40% and 10% behind the analytical solution for respectively the plate and beam model 1A and 1B. The large deviation of beam model 1A is remarkable and can be explained from the fact that no rigid connections between the girder and floor are applied, resulting in a loss of bending and torsional stiffness of the girder.<br/><br/>To conclude, the analytical solution is based on a number of assumptions, like no load distribution of the floor in longitudinal direction. In reality loads will be as well distributed in longitudinal as transverse direction and the analytical solution therefore needs to be considered as an safe upper limit.<br","Shear force; Torsion; Existing concrete structures; railway engineering; FEM analysis; SCIA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main traffic routes were executed as boulevards, with separate traffic lanes and wide sidewalks.<br/><br/>In the Reconstruction plan of 1946 by Witteveen’s successor Van Traa, the concept of expedition courtyards have been translated in a purely functional manner. The plan is clearly hierarchically set up with main streets, an alley and an expedition street accessible through an entrance gate. Expedition streets and courtyards form an important part of Rotterdam’s reconstruction city. In the centre of Rotterdam they are found in all sorts of sizes. The expedition streets were once the system for supply of shops and companies, whereas they went through change in use over time and this development of the expedition courtyards has resulted in numerous unused spaces.<br/><br/>The inner city of Rotterdam is on a turning point of becoming a more residential place. Converting underused spaces into defined places. Shaping the public space can be conceived as an important contrast be¬tween the traditional European city and the modern city. In the traditional city, the facades of the buildings define the boundaries of the public space and thus become a series of cavities in the urban fabric. While the public space in the modern city becomes an open space with detached objects, modernist buildings. This design proposes a structure in which the public, semi-public, collective and private spaces are shaped. This structure is related to the surrounding modernist building and creates various places with different degrees of publicness. <br/><br/>The following research questions are formulated: <br/>How could the identity of the Rotterdam perimeter expedition block Sint-Janshof be updated in a sustainable way, fulfilling the current demands of densification and qualitative public space? <br/>What are the spatial and functional characteristic qualities of the Reconstruction period? <br/>What is the identity of the expedition building block and what are the potential values of the identity of the Sint-Janshof? <br/><br/>The hypothesis is formulated that a sustainable reinvention is a critical revision of the architectural typology confronted with contemporary programmes and conditions. This approach guarantees the architectural and urban identity will live through. <br/>This design speculates on the future of the Rotterdam expedition building block. The design proposal engages in a retroactive densification of the inner city. A typological study of the expedition streets as urban artefacts has been made. <br","Rotterdam; Reconstruction architecture; expeditiestraten; expeditiehoven; densification; Wederopbouw; woningbouw; transformation; public space; architectural typology; architectural and urban identity; sustainability; Hoogkwartier","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","51.922854, 4.494442"

However, the costs are still high and the economic feasibility of offshore wind turbines is limited to shallow waters. This limitation plays a relevant role in the development of the sector and limits the offshore wind exploitation area to a small percentage of the potential one. In this scenario, floating support structures may represent a solution. Nevertheless, these type of support structures are not yet economically feasible as their design is challenging. In fact, with respect to bottom fixed structures, they present more complex dynamics and more degree of freedom. In order to cut the cost of floating support structures, it is necessary to be able to predict the wave- and wind-induced loads and motions of the floater and understand the coupling between them.<br/>The aim of this project is to develop a three-dimensional numerical model of a floating cylinder in order to study the Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) of a spar-buoy support structure for offshore wind applications. The model is based on the coupled use of the CFD solver fluidity, to resolve the fluid dynamics, and an in-house python-developed code, to numerically solve the equations of motion of a rigid body in three dimensions. To achieve this goal, firstly, the python code is developed. Secondly, a Numerical Wave Tank (NWT) containing both air and water is generated and validated with both linear and nonlinear waves. Here, both an unstructured adaptive mesh and a simplex structured mesh are used to describe the domain. Finally, a free heave decay test of a floating cylinder is performed to investigate the accuracy of the model in computing the hydrodynamic coefficients of the floater. Here, the immersed-body method is used to model the presence of the body in the fluid domain.<br/>The numerical wave tank developed in this work resulted to be quite accurate and capable of correctly describing both the linear and nonlinear waves propagation. The final model is developed with the use of a simplex structured mesh. In fact, mesh adaptivity resulted to be very challenging and the cost of its implementation exceeded the benefits. Also, a finite element based scheme including a Sweby slope limiter is used to limit advective fluxes in the setup of the NWT. Thanks to this, a less computationally demanding mesh could be used. Finally, the FSI analysis showed that, with the developed setup, the CFD solver is able to accurately predict the natural period of the floater but it underestimates the hydrodynamic damping. The cause of this was attributed to the use of the slope limiter aforementioned. In fact, it smooths the velocity field by means of numerical diffusion and this affects the resulting damping.","Numerical Wave Tank; Fluid Structure Interaction; Numerical model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Shrinkage is usually indicated by population decline but is connected to many more issues. It is a complex process that can have negative consequences for both the social cohesion as well as the economic viability of a region. Shrinkage can also tear into the physical structure of our environment, creating neighbourhoods with excessive vacancy, industrial areas with brownfields and sparsely populated mountainous regions. Given that growth is no longer an option for many European cities and regions, we must adapt to this reality. The process of shrinkage will have a strong spatial impact on our cities and regions, and poses a challenge for spatial planners to keep cities and regions functional and liveable. However, planning and designing for shrinkage is a relatively new challenge, one for which we are still missing much expertise. As several academics have noted, shrinkage is not only a challenge, it is also an opportunity for cities and regions to reinvent themselves as more sustainable and ecologically sound places (Ferber &amp; Schlappa, 2016; Haase, Haase, &amp; Rink, 2014; Hollander, Pallagst, Schwarz, &amp; Popper, 2009). The abundance of vacant land and buildings offer opportunities for less traditional land-uses, such as renewable energy, ecology, and agriculture (Hollander et al., 2009).What is currently lacking is a comprehensive approach that can capitalize upon these opportunities and scale them up to their full potential. That means finding the link between what could be done on a local scale, say on the scale of a vacant plot, and its implications for regional networks and structures. The discipline that is concerned with this activity is regional design (Neuman, 2000). The structure of this thesis is embedded in this discipline.The aim of this thesis is to generate a strategic regional design proposal that offers comprehensive steps for a sustainable regional transformation, responding to both the physical structure of the region as well as to the governance and planning frameworks. The design will identify the key potentials in the case-region and show how to best exploit them, with an emphasis on finding a synergy between the problems caused by shrinkage and opportunities for new forms of land use. The aim is to uncover new principles and strategies for spatial planning that can be transferred to other shrinking regions. Additional to the design will be an implementation strategy that considers the regional dynamic with regards to local planning systems and prominent stakeholders.","shrinkage; regional design; spatial planning; Governance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","43.363129, -5.951843"

The effects of climate change and urban growth, like extreme weather conditions and a larger paved area, cause undesirable conditions regarding storm water resilience of (Dutch) cities. Water nuisance and sewage overflows caused by heavy rainfall occur more and more often. This is undesirable since it may cause dangerous situations related to accessibility, water quality and ecology and it disturbs daily life. Most interventions which are currently used are insufficient as they could address way more sustainable urban aspects at the same time. Therefore, the goal of this graduation project is to make Amsterdam a storm water resilient city, while simultaneously address other local and sustainable urban aspects, in order to create a future-proof city.<br/><br/>Reaching this goal started with an extensive analysis of the current water nuisance in the city. The water nuisance has been explained by several correlations: the correlation between water nuisance and streets with a predominant retail function, and between water nuisance and the most common spatial typology. These correlations form the basis for the chosen strategic design locations: OLVG west on building scale, Javastraat on building (block) scale, Rokin on street scale and Rivierenbuurt on neighbourhood scale. Similar locations are of frequent occurrence in the city and could be transformed in the same way.<br/><br/>The four design sites have been extensively analysed to find out what aspects of that location were in need of improvement, apart from the storm water resilience itself. This analysis has been done on several scales and revealed guidelines for the desirable interventions, related to environmental and socio-economic urban aspects. At Rokin, for example, the high pressure on public space resulted in underground interventions related to storm water resilience and interventions above the surface that provide the human activities of that location. Most of the design components contribute to the stormwater resilience of the city, but address other, additional benefits as well. These additional benefits include both environmental and socio-economic aspects. The designed vegetable garden on the roof of OLVG west, for example, improves the storm water resilience of that location, but creates a recreational facility too.<br/><br/>Implementing interventions on several scales creates a network of interventions that work together. In practise this means that when the storage or infiltration of a design component has been reached, other components should compensate. In this way, interventions on smaller scales can create a network of interventions that functions on the city scale. When the locations similar to the strategic design sites are being transformed too, this network arises. In this way, Amsterdam will become a storm water resilient, future-proof and liveable city.","Storm water resilience; Sustainability; Amsterdam; Multi-lateral solutions; Network design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","52.370216, 4.895168"

Furthermore, the project aimed to be a flexible and long term building, which could create a sustainable and diverse urban environment. Based on the concept and approach of energy neutrality, the architectural design improves circular economy design and social issues. The building includes student housing, a fitness centre and an underground supermarket. In this building, student apartments are built to solving housing shortage problem in Amsterdam and a fitness centre is for generating power from human activities. Moreover, as refrigeration system in the supermarket continuing producing cooling all the year round, waste heat could be collected and heat other spaces, the supermarket is added to balance the heating and cooling consumption of the building in order to achieve energy neutral. Based on the goal of energy neutrality, my technical research examines utilizing energy waste flow between each function and using renewable energy such as human energy. I follow the instruction of three stepped strategy including reducing energy consumption in building scale,<br/>reusing residual energy stream, and generating energy sustainability. My research paper analysed space heating, cooling, heating for domestic hot water and electricity for lighting of each space first.

Usually, the excavation of mines and quarries is regarded as a purely economic process. There is no consideration about the way in which the excavations are changing the landscape spatially and the anticipation to an afterlife is not taken into account. Several countries are slowly realizing that such processes are detrimental to the landscape and have started thinking about rehabilitating the destroyed areas.<br/><br/>This landscape architecture design project is an attempt to explore excavation principles that adapt to the characteristics of the site and to “choreograph” a sand, clay and gravel quarry with the intention of facilitating ecological and recreational development. The park proposes routes and activities in which the experience of the unique spatial typologies formed by the excavators is at the center. The design is inspired by the spatial-visual experiences one gathers when one is at the top, in and around the vast space and its sections. In the tradition of European park architecture, loose organic and formal axial structures are combined to build up the scenic quarry choreography. Various minimal interventions capture the essence of a sand and clay quarry, creating curiosity and awareness about the landscape development of the site. This approach also helps to propose future possibilities for the part of the quarry which is yet to be excavated.<br/><br/>The design is a result of applying multiple excavation specific principles which can be tweaked to be applied to other quarrying sites as well. But because local geography and context heavily influence the application of these principles, they should be examined, questioned and translated into custom-made design. Once the land is exploited for its resources, it is very easy for a developer or any organization to further subject the land to economic exploitation without any consideration about the challenges and potentials the space possesses from a landscape perspective. However, the function(s) being employed on the land for economic viability must be carefully evaluated and a sensitive reading of the landscape can ensure an appropriate future usage. It should therefore be imperative for excavation companies to involve a landscape architect before the exploitation.","Exploitation; Brownfields; Rehabilitation; Natural processes; Future planning; Landscape; Kinesthesia; Spatial experience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","51.286071, 6.142160"

(mentor); Mulder, K.B. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","This thesis aims to exploit active bending as an approach to create complex curved geometries, which are structurally self-supporting systems. The simplicity of creating complex curved geometries from initially planar elements is the leading motivator for this research. The central research question is: ‘How can double curvature be exploited in a structural system composed of elastically deformed planar elements’’? This research answers questions like what double curvature is and how it can be measured and controlled. What is the relationship between an elastically deformed double-curved geometry and the structural characteristics of active bending structures? The literature review is composed of part A: research into double-curvature, and part B: the structural behaviour of active bending structure. <br/><br/>For the question to what extent planar elements can deform, the measure of Gaussian curvature has been used. The Gaussian measure provides the relationship between bending and torsional curvatures. Bending moments relate to these curvatures. However, the Gaussian curvature is a purely geometrical measure without incorporation of material properties. The problem is that deformation of planar elements results in double curved geometries rather than, according to the Gaussian measure, in single curved geometries. <br/><br/>The inclusion of material properties such as Poisson’s ratio and bending rigidity in the Gaussian measure allows for prediction of curvature and the related bending moments. The basic geometry of a rectangular plate has been used to do physical tests, followed by computational test and FEA analysis. It has been proved that the stiffness of an elastically bend plate increases for a large Poisson’s ratio. This makes the Poisson’s ratio an essential parameter for active bending plate structures. <br/><br/>Further stiffness can be achieved through torsion. Torsional displacement of a clamped planar plate leads to increased tension, which leads to increased stiffness. The combination of bending and twisting a planar plate leads to a structurally stiff arch, which is both a structural element and an architectural design component. <br/><br/>Suitable materials for active bending plates structures are composites. They offer a relatively high Poisson’s ratio and a high strength to flexibility ratio. <br/><br/>For a planar plate of epoxy glass fibre composite of fifteen by one meter, only 20 mm thickness is required to make it structurally sufficient. <br/><br/>The feasibility and application of an active bending arch plate depend on the building method. The building method aims to keep the bending process and building sequence simple and modular. The erection process of the arch will be performed through the motion of the ends of the plate in a single direction over a modular gliding rail system, which allows for a simple assembly process. <br/><br/>The double curvature, the structural performance and the aligned building method prove the feasibility of active bending plate structures. Active bending does not have to be considered just a formation process, but a structural system itself. The exploitation of active bending is found in the nuance of double curvature as a result of the material dependent Poisson’s ratio. The simplicity of deforming planar elements, which is feasible with the developed building method results in an active bending arch system which can be used as a cantilever, bridge support, or cladding system. <br","Bending; Active; Curvature; Double curvature; Gaussian curvature; Arch; Structure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

We need to densify our cities while at the same time preserve qualities and identities on different scales. One of these identities is that of craftsmanship and the rich industrial history of Amsterdam. <br/>The separation between living and working is outdated, especially for the growing part of the population that sees the benefit of working in their own business or as a freelancer. But the existing housing stock and urban planning do not reflect this need yet on a large scale. New types of housing that combine living and working should be developed to answer to this need. This approach is called live-work design, or zero-commute housing, and if done correctly it has many benefits for the people, as well as the city and the economy. <br/><br/>The Zeeburgerpad is a site that is centrally located on the east of the old Amsterdam Stronghold ring, but has been neglected since it’s rich industrial history of small scale crafts business became obsolete after the Second World War. <br/>At the same time, craftsmanship is rapidly disappearing from our city-life and culture. Especially the production crafts that need large spaces and are therefore being pushed out to the perimeter of the city under the influence of rising prices of housing and workspaces. This is not only an issue for the people involved but also for the city as a whole, which needs diversity and small-scale businesses in order to remain healthy. Also, we need prevent the destruction of knowledge and cultural heritage that will irreversible if we don’t start integrating solutions for this in our urban fabric. <br/><br/>In this master thesis I developed a proposal that re-introduces the small crafts business to the Zeeburgerpad in the more traditional way of living where you work. This proposal includes the collective use of a large woodworking workshop and its big machinery, dwellings that can be used in a flexible way according to the needs of the type of business and household composition, and shops and services on the ground floor. This strategy of combining collective use, collaboration, learning and shopping can bring the value of craftsmanship in our cities to attention, be a boost to the re-valuation of craftsmanship in our culture, and give craftsmen the opportunity to stay in the city center of Amsterdam. <br","Craftsmanship; Live-work design; Collective workspace; Flexible housing; Adaptability; Zero-commute housing; Zeeburgerpad; Amsterdam; Densification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Dwelling","","52.366937, 4.928506"

This will increase the pressure on our society and care system. This is especially true in relation to the portion of our population that will be diagnosed with dementia, because in 2040 this amount will have doubled. The focus of this research has been how to densify a city such as Amsterdam, and provide suitable housing for people with dementia. <br/><br/>In this case the choice was to reuse an existing building, located at the intersection of the Gillis van Ledenberchstraat and the Zaagmolenstraat in Amsterdam. In a city such as Amsterdam there are almost no vacant plots available and the existing buildings, public spaces and other characteristics of the city are often protected, making reuse of older buildings a method that can be effective in densifying the city. Not only is the old building reused, but a volume is added on top to be able to create a higher density of housing. In order to do this, the history and structure need to be analyzed as well as the future needs and developments. <br/><br/>The reused building is a compact volume, which is transformed into a building that hosts a co-housing scheme. This is not only housing for people with dementia themselves, but also for their partners. This concept of housing them together seems logical but is not yet being implemented on a large scale. In this way the couples can share the care and be each other’s support system, while at the same time lowering the stress on the caregivers and economy. The ability of couples to stay together when the disease progresses is a more dignified and effective solution than the current standard provides. <br/><br/>The research concluded three design elements of high importance for people with dementia, which were social interaction, contact to nature and accessibility. We see these things as normal necessities in our daily lives but for a person with dementia these elements become unavailable as their world becomes increasingly limited. This is why these elements are available on each floor of the building as well as in the urban plan. <br/><br/>On the ground floor the building offers space for other program to provide for the surrounding residents, integrating the building with the rest of the neighborhood, while at the same time providing inclusion for the people living in the co-housing scheme on the levels above. Two out of the five levels are reserved for the people who are left behind after their partner has passed away. They can also live in a co-housing scheme, preventing isolation and loneliness. In this scheme there is also housing reserved for music students. They can have an affordable place to live and practice music, which is beneficial to people with dementia, while at the same time providing a different dynamic and interaction for the single elderly. <br/><br/>This thesis is an attempt to see different solutions to a growing issue, that integrates elderly in our urban fabric and can be a step towards an inclusive city in the future. <br","Amsterdam; Dementia; Co-housing; Densification; Elderly housing; Reuse; Heritage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Dwelling","Stornghold Amsterdam",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Context Digitalisation enables students to study virtually everywhere. However, demand for study space on the campus remains high and is even increasing. Additionally, students place higher demands on the quality and availability of facilities (Valks, Arkesteijn, den Heijer, &amp; Van de Putte,  2016, p. 15). However, recent research on Dutch campuses (Campus NL, 2016) shows several problems were identified regarding the alignment of campus space. (1) The unpredictable nature of demand for campus space makes it difficult to align demand with supply. (2) Another reason for not being able to comply with campus space demand is a result of problems in finding a suitable study space. Objective Preference Function Modelling already proved its potential in designing accommodation strategies. Furthermore, there is the need to involve a greater number of stakeholders and a need to improve the usability of the modelling technique. A smart tool presents opportunities to improve the user involvement in the management of design accomodation. As a result of the scientific gap, this thesis will explore these opportunities by developing a smart tool which provides information on study space while simultaneously generating information to support campus management.MethodsFor this thesis an engineering design process is used. Literature research is used in this research to gain understanding of the design problem and its users. With this knowledge, a smart tool will be developed along a iterative sequence of prototype evaluations to support the design process. Design user involvement will be established by two prototype evaluations evaluations with the use of interviews. For the evaluation of the proposed smart tool an assisted approach is utilized. In this evaluation, the data collection methods Task load index and Post-Experience interview are used. A Task Load Index (TLX) measures cognitive workload by assessing how much mental effort a user expends whilst using a prototype or deployed system. While individual Post-Experience interviews are a quick and inexpensive way to obtain subjective feedback from users.ResultsAs a result of the first user interviews it was established that users had difficulty with understanding how the system works and which values needed to be entered. Therefore, the primary focus for version 2 was finding ways to improve understandability and usability of the system. One implementation of this, was to improve navigation by having all the input fields on the same tab in excel. Therefore, User forms were used, allowing to have a better overview of the system by preventing the need to switch between tabs. The database structure represent the storage (back end) of information which is needed to operate the proposed Smart Tool. To visualize this an Entity Relationship (ER) model has been constructed in MySQL workbench. The ER model shows all the tables relevant to the proposed Smart Tool. A wireframe model is constructed with use of the program Balsamiq. A wireframe is chosen in this stage of the design because it does not distract users with commenting on stylistic issues (i.e. colour schemes or transitions). Balsamiq allows users to interact with the screens, allowing them to get an idea of the workflow and how to navigate the mobile application.It was made clear that using Preference function modelling is not designed for users on this scale but rather in making complex decisions and by generating alternatives. The purest form of the method is not desired from a user perspective as it was shown users need considerable (mental) effort to determine their preference values. However, if these values only need to be input once the strain on the user is significantly reduced and acceptable. Users clearly showed that once they became familiar with the system they were able to more easily adapt their preferences. This indicates that there is a level of intuitiveness in the use of the smart tool.ConclusionIt can be argued that hypothesis is confirmed and that the described problem can be solved by providing information about study spaces with the use of smart tools. The findings from the interviews suggest that the proposed smart tool can potentially add much value for both the user and campus management. The users generally reacted very positive to the concept of the smart tool. This shows that the smart tool will have significant value in supporting study space findability when executed correctly. To achieve this, usability of the smart tool is crucial for ultimate use. As this research comprises a design problem, it is important to realize that design problems can be solved in numerous ways, each leading to various results. Therefore, this can be seen as one of the possible ways a smart tool is able to support users in finding a suitable study space. ","Smart Real Estate Management; Smart Buildings; Smart tools; Real Estate Management; Campus management; Study Space","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","Smart Real Estate Management",""

As a first step to achieve this reduction already by 2030 this project uncovers how much of the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions it is possible to reduce by combining the available state of the art technology. <br/>The reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is done in two steps. The first step consists in reducing the power demand in terms of auxiliary and propulsion systems. After that, cleaner power supply alternatives are considered to further reduce the emissions.<br/>In terms of auxiliary power, heavy consumers such the air conditioning, the lighting or water systems are considered. The reduction of auxiliary power is not only achieved with the introduction of more efficient equipment but also by the introduction of passive design strategies that enhance savings by reducing the loading on the systems. Altogether it is possible to reduce the auxiliary power demand by 33% in comparison with the benchmark design. The reduction of auxiliary power demand has a significant impact on the yearly consumption due to the significant percentage of operational time spent at anchorage.<br/>In terms of propulsion power demand, the reductions achieved are even more significant, 51% and 70% power demand reductions are possible at cruising and maximum speed, respectively. The introduction of the Van Oossanen’s Fast Displacement Hull Form (FDHF), the reduction of displacement by making an aluminium hull and the application of the patented Hull Vane® are the main reasons for such a significant propulsion power demand.<br/>Finally, the switch in power plant arrangement of the yacht results in further 10% reduction. In this case, simply the change from diesel direct arrangement to a hybrid arrangement leads to yearly savings, mainly because emissions at cruising are reduced due to the power take-off operational mode of the power plant, saving generator set emissions.<br/>All in all, it is possible to already achieve a reduction of approximately 41% of the yearly CO<sub>2</sub> emissions on a 50 m motor yacht. One of the most important conclusions to be taken is that all these reductions are possible when finding the optimal interaction between components, from auxiliaries to power plant arrangement. Mainly, the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions reduction followed from a fuel consumption reduction, not yet introducing power supply from renewable energies nor alternative fuels which despite being the way to the future are not yet fully mature and suitable for this specific case.<br","yacht design; Emissions Reduction; CO2 reduction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Marine Technology | Ship Design, Production and Operations","",""

Despite its architectural meanings and values, Centraal Beheer Office is now disconnected from its surroundings and possess various problems such as sustainability. Since Structuralism Architecture pursued architecture that could flexibly respond to the individual’s way of life and could transform itself based on the changing needs of users, this project also aimed to make a design experiment of balancing between preservation and modification in heritage design. Under the motto of ‘Returning to the Origin,’ this project considered the initial idea of Herman Hertzberger as the starting point of every re-design process. Based on this, the primary position in this project toward re-designing Centraal Beheer Office is ‘keeping the rule while breaking the rule’; more precisely, modifying the existing situations while reusing the underlying principle of the building. In other words, instead of conservation nor mere transformation, the project is aiming to become ‘the reinterpretation’ of Centraal Beheer Office.<br/><br/>Based on the study of Hertzberger’s architectural idea and Centraal Beheer Office, I set my architectural themes as ‘in-between space, interaction, and coexistence.’ Along with this themes, I set my research question as 'How to make Centraal Beheer Office create interaction through in-between space?' With the new program, Art Academy, the project aimed to 1. how to retrieve the publicness of Centraal Beheer Office, 2. how to accommodate the new program, and 3. how to improve the comfort of the building while keeping the existing value of the building. With this purpose, I connected the building with the city through the urban axis and broaden the inner street to attract the people to come. As follow step, I reorganized the spatial system of the building to apply the new program, Art Academy, to the building. At the last phase, I used a double façade scheme on the building not only for the building comfort but also for creating in-between space between in an outside world.","Interaction; in-between space; Centraal Beheer; Herman Hertzberger; Heritage & Architecture; art academy; Structuralism Architecture; double facade; inner street","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","",""

Drawing on microgrid research, we argue that the potential synergy between microgrid energy management and provision of flexibility services to the wider grid could be further explored. In addition, the trade-off between cost minimisation and energy autarky of a community microgrid has not yet been fully investigated. This study therefore investigates the role of community microgrids in managing the volatility of renewable energy production in the wider grid, while also considering local optimisation trade-offs. The goal of this study is threefold: (1) identifying possibilities for market interactions, (2) developing simulation models and optimization/decision software, and (3) conducting exploratory experiments. <br/><br/>To illustrate our ideas, the community microgrid of Schoonschip was used as a case study. This Schoonschip microgrid contains 30 floating houseboats, that are equipped with the following energy resources: PV panels, batteries, modulating heat pumps, thermal collectors, buffer tanks, underfloor heating systems and electrical boilers. The resources are centrally controlled by an energy management system and the Schoonschip microgrid is connected via an interconnection of 160kVA. Simulation models were created for simulating the energy resources and heat demand of the houses. Optimization/decision software was developed and used for microgrid energy management and control of flexibility services.<br/><br/>This thesis provides insights into (1) potential market interactions between a community microgrid and the Dutch electricity wholesale market, (2) the trade-off between maximisation of the forecasted solar self-consumption and minimisation of electricity costs, and (3) the potential value and the problems associated with the provision of grid stability services. This study has resulted in a simulation model and decision software, which can also be used and further extended for additional experimental studies into microgrids and flexibility services.<br","Flexibility; Microgrids; Energy Market; Aggregator; Business Model; Simulation modelling; Scheduling; Optimisation; Thermal energy storage; Thermal analysis; Forecasting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The complete and holistic understanding of the local character of the area and the interpretation of it with contemporary means will create a basis of a self-conscious design. Time-resistant structures accompanied by peculiarities of the specific place can be the answer to our fragmented urban landscapes avoiding the overimposition of direct solutions on top of them. In such a way, the creation of a place derives from the physical characteristics of the area and its significant historic structures which restore the connections between the variant landscape patches.<br/><br/>Considering Poldervaart as a time-resistant structure for healing the fragmented landscape of the area between Schiedam and Vlaardingen and from the Schie to the Maas, this project proposes its reinforcement as a backbone structure that will act as a connector and a generator of connections in two scales. In a regional scale the monumental axis of Poldervaart establishes a connection between the area of Midden Delfland to the river Maas while on a local scale the canal receives the role of generating connections between urban fragments, city parks, allotment gardens, and parts of historic cultural landscape.<br/><br/>By focusing on three areas-nods along Poldervaart, the project promotes and safeguards the continuity of its axis by re-establishing connections and creating the conditions for unique unifying public spaces. Together with that, smallscale interventions along the canal shield its coherence and readability and offer conceptual connections and noteworthy experiences that reveal the cultural aspect of the landscape.<br/><br/>This action if repetitive can inform a strategy that acts against fragmentation as a more situated approach for connecting and restoring a fragmented urban landscape, by taking advantage of time-resistant structures that exist along it.","Time-resistant structures; Landscape urbanism; Fragmentation; Poldervaart; Old waterways; Connections; Multi-scalar approach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","51.917672, 4.375496"

Energy use within the built environment is closely related to the organization of urban form and functions. Spatial planning can influence diverse sectors in urban areas including the energy sector. The role of spatial planning in the energy transition is a crucial one since it can challenge fundamental norms that don’t promote energy efficiency. Planning processes and systems can pave the way for a collective investment in public goods that can help to promote long term environmental benefits. The results of this research illustrate the impact of spatial planning to change the relationship of space to energy. Energy strategies need to start having a stronger link with urban development plans to be able to effectively change the ‘decision rules’ that can lead to an improved energy performance. Through this research I want to contribute to this question and explore the parameters of planning that can impact energy use in Dubai. The intention of this research and design project is to begin a discussion about the role of spatial planning in the energy transition in cities. My assumed role in this project is of an urban planner to inform Dubai government on how to facilitate a process for developers, urban designers and architects to work within. This project has a strong research base which will guide the redesigning of the planning process in Dubai to better balance competing interests and engage with all stakeholders.

This involves being able to accurately calculate the curvature at the interface. This study focuses on the use of convolution in smoothing the VOF colour field in order to obtain better approximations of the curvature. Given the sudden jump in values of the VOF colour field, the calculation of its derivative for the curvature is sensitive to errors, given the large values of high order terms that determine the truncation error. To deal with this problem, convolution of this abruptly varying field can be used to create a smoother transition. The curvature approximation of a circular interface improved as the support of the convolution was increased.<br/>It was proven analytically that, for these interfaces, the original curvature is retrieved from the convoluted field. Interfaces along which the curvature varies were also considered, and it was found that there is a critical convolution support that minimizes the error in the curvature, given that the choice of the support length can modify the curvature that is estimated.<br/>An algorithm was implemented in OpenFOAM that calculates the convolution of the VOF colour field. The resulting smoothed field was then used to calculate the curvature, which is needed for the surface tension force of the system. The simulations of a two-dimensional rising bubble resulted in more accurate results for the circularity and the rising velocity, when compared to the original OpenFOAM implementation with no smoothing. With the convolution algorithm, the terminal velocity deviated only 0.01% from a well-accepted benchmark case, a great improvement when compared to the 4.2% difference when no smoothing was used. However, simulations of a static bubble in zero-gravity rapidly resulted in unphysical flow, manifested as a wavy interface, when a convolution support larger than 2 cells was chosen. An improvement of the estimation of the surface tension force direction may be needed for this behaviour to disappear.","convolution; multiphase flow; OpenFOAM; curvature; VOF","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently spanning 1189 sq. km, the region forms a unique delta with three rivers, namely, the Koshashtalaiyar, Coovum and Adyar, which eventually drain into the Bay of Bengal. With an estimated population of 10 million and a population density of 9900 per sq. Km, the CMA is the fourth largest metropolitan region in India and forms the country’s fourth largest economy (Statistics, 2017). The region has undergone substantial industrial growth in the last two decades and is still rapidly urbanizing, often in conflict with the natural hydrological patterns. Meanwhile, due to its deltaic nature, the CMA is naturally prone to floods from mainly extreme rainfall and cyclonic activities. As a result, Chennai has faced an aggravated risk of flooding and in 2015 was devastated by a 100-year flood event. The frequency and intensity of these events are projected to increase due to climate change. Set in this context, this project addresses local adaptation strategies by building socio-ecological resilience at the neighbourhood level. Rapid urbanisation has led to the rupture of the traditional drainage network which was once the flat terrain region’s flood defence mechanism. The main problem recognised is hence understood as a conflict between human and nature and attempts a shift towards socio-ecological harmonies. For this purpose, the relevance of social capital was identified as a crucial link to design for local resilience. Hence, social and cultural networks were used as leverage to link economic aspirations and environmental restoration. This was set within a theoretical framework comprising of the works of Davoudi (2012) and Wilson (2012). To recognise the spatial manifestation of this conflict and to tap into social capital, the edges and community infrastructure were identified respectively. The water edges which are the transition zones from the human to the natural environment were mismanaged and left untreated, in turn influencing perception and its subsequent neglect from regional functionalities. To tackle this neglect and reintegrate these hydrological elements with daily life, community infrastructure was used as the tangible medium to bring people together, engage them and in turn create a sense of ownership and responsibility. Hence the strategies used were that of first designing an integrated water network across multiple scales, second, identifying community infrastructure and open spaces that can support the functioning of the system and third, designing interactions between people and the environmental to motivate them to engage and maintain the network. Together the project made a strong case for using socio-cultural networks and contextually grounded strategies to bring about a collective community based restoration process.","Local flood resilience; Community building; Collaborative participation; Blue-green infrastructure; Global South","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","13.067439, 80.237617"

We introduce an improved Mumford-Shah model to improve the computational time without losing accuracy. An artificial force is added at the beginning of the simulation to quickly yield an approximation of the contour. Finally, we consider a simplified version of the model, which we solve analytically. The solution is used to find suitable parameters for the model.","Boundary Detection; Variational Methods; Active Contours; Image Segmentation","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some species survive and reproduce, while others become extinct. This paper proposes a model to simulate these strategies and test their performance. Natural behavior is represented as strategies for the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD). Agents wielding one of ten common IPD strategies are deployed in a natural spatial environment with biologically realistic conditions, where they continuously play Prisoner's Dilemma games. If the payoffs are well enough, agents are able to reproduce. The harshness of the environment is determined by three factors. The cost of living directly controls the climate and age limitation and energy limitation affect an agent's ability to reproduce. Another influencing factor is evolution, which gives agents the option to adopt different strategies in later stages. Harsh environments are defined by high costs of living, high reproduction costs and low life expectancy. Results show that cooperative strategies are more likely to survive and reproduce in harsh environments. Moreover, evolution is in the advantage of cooperative strategies, because many unsuccessful defectors evolve into cooperators.","Multi-Agent systems; Spatial design; Game Theory","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The team was tasked with making a system that could solve bike delivery scheduling problems with limited bike carrying capacity, time windows, dynamic delivery additions, movable pickup points and delivery time estimates.<br/><br/>The project started with two weeks of research, which concluded that the main algorithm should be a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The final product contains an app for visualising results as well as a backend that runs the genetic algorithm. Both systems are written in TypeScript and built upon a boilerplate provided by MakeTek. To calculate routes an open source routing provider is used, and the project is executed with an agile development workflow to ensure the product conforms to the client's expectations.<br/><br/>The implemented system contains almost all desired features and the missing ones were chosen to not be included due to time constraints and limited functional benefits. It is well-tested, extensible and adheres to software quality standards. <br/><br/>A solution is constructed by first clustering deliveries by location to distribute them over the bikes, then the genetic algorithm is run on each cluster separately. At the end of every generation of the GA the intermediate best solution is saved in a database. This ensures a valid solution is available at all times. Finally, postprocessing can be run on the final solution which checks if it is more efficient for a deliverer to wait between certain deliverers to prevent them from being early.<br/><br/>Testing shows that the implemented system and its features work as intended on different datasets. The effect of different parameters on the performance of the genetic algorithm is explored, with the following conclusions:<br/><br/>The algorithm should have enough opportunity to explore the solution space. This is achieved by setting an appropriate mutation parameter.<br/><br/>No significant performance differences are present between single point, two-point and uniform crossover.<br/><br/>Tournament selection converges faster than roulette selection, but explores less of the solution space.<br/><br/><br/>The resulting system successfully implements all of the requirements as set by the client. It includes an algorithm that converges to an optimum, it can adapt to new changes and a solution can be requested at any time during runtime. It can be concluded that the project is brought to a successful end.","Pickup and Delivery problem; Genetic Algorithm; Software Engineering","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This occurs when a patient is in the same posture or position for a long period of time. To prevent this Momo Medical is developing a sensor plate that uses sensor data attained from the patient laying on his bed to guide the nurses, whom are responsible for re-positioning the patients. The sensor data is processed by an algorithm to detect the patient and determine the position of the patient. The sensor plate is placed between the mattress and the frame and has sensors to detect the dynamic and static behaviour of the patient.The goal of this project as a group is to facilitate the performance of the Momo medical system. This is done by studying the currently used system to find ways to improve it or find better alternatives for specific parts of the system and by giving recommendations based on the outcome of this project. The group was divided into three subgroups. Two subgroups focus on the two different types of sensors used to detect the dynamic and static behaviour of the patient. The last group facilitates the Momo system patient detection algorithm by detecting a patient’s heart rate from pressure sensor data using a microcontroller-implemented algorithm. The data received is also displayed real-time on a user-interface to aid the testing and validation of the system. The designed algorithm uses wavelet transformed peak detection to analyze the data for a ballistocardiography heart signal. The wavelet transform is used to extract the ballistocardiography heart signal from the sensor data and the peak detection is then used to find the specific heartbeats present. The algorithm was simulated and tested in MATLAB and this resulted in a less than 10% error compared to an electrocardiography based reference signal, that was measured using the Polar T34. The different functions needed for the algorithm were implemented on the microcontroller and are functional. Also the interface used to display the incoming sensor data is functional. The actual implementation and testing of the algorithm on the microcontroller has not been finished yet. However based on the design of the algorithm in MATLAB and the function implementations that already work on the microcontroller, the detection of a patient’s heart rate from pressure sensor data using a microcontroller-implemented algorithm should be entirely feasible.","Ballistocardiography; Heart rate; Microcontroller; Wavelet transform; Algorithm","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2028-07-06","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

To come to an answer, a multitude of steps were taken. <br/><br/>The first step was an assessment of the principles of Circular Economy, the principles which lie at the foundation of the, Technological and Biological cycle. A number of different assessment methods were analysed on their circular implementation, they have been evaluated on five assessment criteria for the Circular Economy. The Material Circularity Indicator and the Disassembly Potential are concluded to be the most effective, especially when used in tandem. The Material Circularity Indicator is used to determine the circularity of a material used in a building component. The Disassembly Potential gives an indication how well a building can be brought back to its original materials, it determines if disassembly or demolition will be most likely. These two methods used for the next step.<br/><br/>This next step is the analysis of the Specification of the Lidl. The 6 S-model of Steward Brand is used in combination with both the MCI and the DP to determine the circularity of the most important components mentioned in the Specification. The components are divided into three categories, sufficient, partially sufficient and insufficient in their circularity.<br/><br/>As the third step, a redesign was made, to change a component from insufficient to sufficient. The roof was chosen as this component. Most of the roof components were partially sufficient, but has a lot of functionalities, which make it a broader applicable example.<br/>In the redesign, two design were evaluated, a technical redesign and a green redesign. The technical design mainly focussed on rematerializing the original roof design so it would receive a higher MCI, the result showed that just changing materials isn’t a sufficient strategy, the design needs to enable disassembly. The green redesign instead focussed on used biological degradable materials, it fully redesigned both the materials and the connecting principles. The green redesign showed which changes were necessary to enable circularity in the Specification. <br/><br/>Each of the steps provided answers to main research question. The result are the following five changes:<br/>•Exchange non-circular materials, materials which can’t be economically recycled at the end of their technical life span, for materials which can be recycled.<br/>•Enable reuse of materials, by removing static constructions methods, making all connections reversable.<br/>•Make dimensions and connections generic.<br/>•Implement the criteria from the Material Circularity Indicator to the Specification for circular materials.<br/>•The development strategy of the Lidl needs to be changed, reusing elements and components instead of employing new ones.<br/>These recommendations are a reasonable first step on a long journey to a circular supermarket chain.<br","Circular Economy; Specification; Bouwkundig Bestek; Material Circularity Indicator; Disassembly Potential; supermarket","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

QD research in the past decade has progressed rapidly, allowing<br/>a deeper understanding of the physics behind the functioning and the effective synthesis of such materials. The wide spread opto-electronic applications of such QD semiconductors in LEDs, lasers, electrochemistry and solar cells with the potential to outperform traditional bulk semiconductors has fuelled inspired research in this field.<br/>Quantum dot solar cells (QDSC) are solution-based third generation solar cells that possess the potential to overcome the Shockley-Queisser limit using multiple exciton generation (MEG). The large Bohr radius, wide bandgap tunability and large light absorption coefficients of PbS QDs have made them the most common material used in the absorber layer of such solar cells and shall also be the material used in this thesis. PbS QDs are used in conjunction with an n-type metal oxide to form a heterojunction that enhances charge separation at the interface. ZnO and TiO2 are common metal oxides used for this purpose while different synthesis methods of the same metal has been observed to show different results. While different research groups have used different metal oxide layers, there has been no systematic study on the interaction of the metal oxide layer synthesized by different methods with the absorber layer. Such a study could help improve understanding of the heterojunction interface and shall<br/>be briefly looked into in this thesis. Another area of improvement in device performance is the depletion region across the heterojunction. Varying the doping of the n-type material affects the depletion width which has been explored in the past by adding impurity atoms to the metal oxide. However, the<br/>emergence of an alternate method to dope ZnO electrochemically has triggered an interesting novel pathway to integrate doped materials into solar cells. In this thesis, we have successfully fabricated PbS QD solar cells for the first time in TU Delft at the Synthesis lab of the Applied Sciences faculty with<br/>power conversion efficiencies exceeding 5%. Additionally, a systematic study on the absorber layer and the metal oxide layer was also carried out to optimize the device performance and set protocols for any future work. Finally, electrochemical doping of the PbS absorber layer was attempted to develop<br/>a precise doping mechanism for QD films.","Quantum dots; Photovoltaics; Electrochemical doping; solar cells; Lead sulphide; quantum confinement; Nanoparticles; Thin film; nanocrystals","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-12-31","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

In these physical and mostly group based games, players are locked in a room with the goal to solve puzzles within a certain time limit in order to ’escape’ the room. To make sure players have a pleasurable experience, they are monitored during the game by a so called game master. This person helps players during the game. When players get stuck the game master gives players a hint. Another possible task of the game master is to create an immersive story within the escape room. The game master can do this by communicating with the players while taking on the role of certain characters that are part of that story.<br/>The goal of this project was to develop the Escape-Master system: a system that automates the role of the game master. In the system the game master can define an arbitrary escape room by inputting puzzles, characters and dialog for those characters. This dialog can include hints or storyline narrative. With this information provided, the system can automatically interact with the players. The system keeps track of the progress of the players and uses this information to interpret questions they provide to the system using natural language processing. After this the system can provide a fitting response, which can be a hint or narrative that progresses the story of the escape room. The system can also start interactions with players on its own, based on time passed of their progress in the game.<br/>The project consisted of two phases: research and development. During the research phase information was gathered on player interaction, user engagement, and chatbots. During the development phase a system was constructed that permits the game master automate the process of giving hints and create an immersive story. Additionally, an interface was build to give the game master the ability to define an escape room and start games while being notified of the actions the system takes. It was tested in a live setting on two occasions, which yielded favorable results in terms of user engagement and immersion.","chatbot; escape room; engagement; messaging; puzzles","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","Bachelor End Project",""

(mentor); Sepulveda Carmona, D.A. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Reversed risk<br/>With more than 80% of Thames River banks transformed into concrete storm walls, with the Thames Barrier in place since the 70s, the dynamic tidal force is persistently causing storm surge flooding and flash floods throughout London’s dense urban areas, putting the UK coastline as a priority area among the North Sea adjoined territories – both from the point of view of event frequency but also of prospective impact. Based on this assumption, one might consider the flood adaptation strategy as a priority point on the governance list, however, the Environment Agency’s funding for maintaining flood assets has fallen by 14% nationally. Recent press investigations undertaken by The financial Times quote John Pettigrew as he raises a pressing point on the British investment agenda - ‘It is important that the UK is seen as a place that is attractive to inward investment. In terms of the energy sector, a lot of infrastructure needs to be built in the UK over the next few years. Post-Brexit, it is important that it is coming in.’ Looking further into the matter, while flood defence seems to lose importance on the hierarchical chain of monetary distribution, current trends in the energy field are attracting increasing capital in the UK’s national strategy. As a consequence and if inundated, the Greater Thames Estuary region which currently contains 1 million properties would suffer direct damage of at least £ 97.8 billion at 2003 prices. <br/><br/>Surely, the planning focus shift Is justified as the North Sea is facing an era of fossil fuel depletion and the overpriced electricity bills urgently demand the transition to clean, renewable sources. In this matter, the UK is a leading power with the most extensive exclusive economic zone coverage, with intensive fossil fuel extraction platforms that are currently being transformed into energy farms throughout the continental shelf, creating a new ground for exploring a projective dimension for productive landscapes triggered by the ocean dynamics, a possible paradigm for extraction that focuses on the potential of the contiguous maritime zone as well as the territorial sea as main generators. Additionally, the focus of the thesis supports another conceptual shift – from the recent focus of sustainability in the advancement of human development (Keenan and Weisz, 2016) to the necessity to change current behaviors in favor of a conscious awareness of the externalities of society’s unrestrained consumption (Bowen and Hepburn, 2014) – or in simpler phrasing, a new paradigm focused on the sustainability of resources and raw materials to be allocated to the promotion of resilience of the status quo and the adaptation of societies, economies, ecologies ( Keenan and Weisz, 2016). <br/><br/>Already shifting the focus of energy production to the maritime territories that engage in exchanges with the land, we are discussing implicitly coastal flood strategies. From a theoretical point of view, there would be a clear interdependency between the particularity of the territorial sea hydrodynamics and the coastal adaptive response to risk. However, the UK planning system regard these issues as separate entities, under separate departments, directly subordinated to Her Majesty, The Queen. From the central government level, to the regional, county and village level, flood risk and energy efficiency run parallel under the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy [ BEIS ] and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs [ DEFRA ], while spatial planning is addressed through a different branch - the Department for Communities and Local Government [ DCLG ], thus making any communication hard if not unlikely. <br/>On this note, the thesis is trying to converge these fields into a coherent, integrated new approach – flood risk and energy transition pressure – putting forward a strategy for extraction in estuarine waters, that would require a control body to involve the highlighted departments and ensure the pairing up between policy, investment and the department in charge. Thus, this thesis looks beyond the 2030 effective lifespan of the Thames Barrier and explores an alternative system of hybrid infrastructure that can reverse the flood risk factor towards a profitable tidal energy source, creating a protection/production cycle, simultaneously defending and “fuelling” the city as well as retrieving its original investment. Practically, understanding natural forces value, paired with adaptive capacity patterns builds up towards the gradient of spatial and performance suitability. This creates a system of critical intervention areas directly supporting and conserving their anthropic activity within the urban system. A coherent spatial assessment framework which results in critical location identification and a paired governance implementation model, followed by a design approach zooming into a transitional system – from restrictive, regeneration urban area, to natural protected landscapes. As a result, this hybrid approach to protective infrastructure boosts the regional economy through the overlaid programme pairing, promoting an agricultural transition to aquaculture and energetically self-providing urban district. <br/><br","Tidal energy; Coastam managed realignment strategies; aquaculture; tidal city","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","D-i 2017-2018 Studio – North Sea: Landscapes of Coexistence","51.517083o N, 0.578411o E"

The game host indicates the number of chests (key points in the game) that need to be unlocked and the time it should take players to open it. The application then processes the incoming video streams and detects chests that have been opened, as well as the level of current activity. The progress is measured against time.

There is certain agreement on the theses of practice intensity and duration as a factor for learning. However, the content of the practice sessions is still, only, partially understood. One point which is still to be confirmed is the ""Part-whole transfer"" paradigm. This theory promulgates the fact that motions are rather a composition where alphabet items are skillfully combined to produce a dexterous movement and that the better the ""alphabet"" is known, the faster the learning will be and dexterous the result. The importance of the whole practice of a full motion remains still unknown.<br/><br/>Our hypotheses were that inclusion of the full motion is crucial for correctly learning a complex motion pattern. We hypothesized, also, that the way of re-composition of a motion would play a role in the performance after the training and the retention of the learned skill, as well as the transferability of its fundamentals to a new skill.<br/><br/>In this thesis, these questions are investigated. For this, an experiment with 16 healthy subjects has been conducted. The subjects where pseudo-randomly assigned to one of the following groups: whole visuo-haptic coordination training, anatomical visuo-haptic coordination training, anatomical visuo-haptic training and anatomical visual-only training. The importance of the haptic coordination training (i.e. practice of the whole motion together) was investigated in the first two groups, while the coordination pattern was shown only visually in the last two groups. Additionally, the way of showing the single components (anatomically or holistically) and the type of feedback (visual-only or visuo-haptic) was investigated in the different groups designed. <br/><br/>The results showed that the full trajectory is better learned by subjects who were shown the full motion visuo-haptically (opposed to only visually). The transfer and the consolidation of the motion pattern (also translated into a better retention) are also benefited by adding special emphasis to the single components of a motion first (Group 2). Only the training of the speed profile is benefited by more practicing the full motion visuo-haptically (i.e. group 1). All these aspects have, obviously, an impact in motivation. The groups which were more guided (i.e. visuo-haptic full motion guidance) felt less pressure, committed with less effort but got higher sense of competence and more motivation, not necessarily translating in better performance (somewhat in agreement with the Guidance Hypothesis). <br/><br/>The results of this study contribute to the field of motor learning bringing some more insight in the mechanisms of complex motion learning and could have a transfer to the clinical practice to improve re-learning of lost motor skills (e.g. after a stroke).","Motor Learning; Part-whole Transfer; Robotic Training; Complex Motion; Exoskeletons","en","master thesis","","","","","","This thesis' results will be published in the for of an academic paper before December 2018","","2018-12-31","","","","Biomedical Engineering | BioMechatronics","IDEA League",""

(mentor); Smith, G.M. (graduation committee); van den Bos, J.P. (graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Currently, sand retaining rubble mound structures are often constructed with geotextiles, lining the interface between the core material and the sandfill. These geotextiles are placed to make sure the sand from the sandfill is not flushed out through the core by incoming hydraulic forces from the surrounding water. It is proposed that difficulties faced during placement, or uncertainties regarding the correct installation of these geotextiles can be overcome by curtailing the geotextiles. The potential for this abbreviations is stressed by Polidoro et al. (2015) as this author concluded, that at the lower inner corner of rubble mound structures with a closed inner slope, pressures are dampened below a certain estimated critical value. However, no proof was found for the applicability of this critical value. Despite several researches predicting hydraulic loading in rubble mound breakwaters, and studies assessing the stability of sand to stone interfaces, insight in the behaviour of sediments in this particular interface configuration of a sand retaining breakwaters was lacking. Therefore, the aim of this research was to study the behaviour of sediments at the interface to a core in a sandfill. Under supervision of VAN OORD and DELFT UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY (TU Delft), a physical model is designed to study specifically this interface. The model tests took place in the Fluid mechanics Laboratory at TU Delft, where a relatively small setup (1 * 0.5 * 0.15m) was used to model on a relatively large scale (lambda= 15). An exact scaled representation of a nominal breakwater by Polidoro et al. (2015) was used. In the model both the Development of the interface during placement of the sandfill as the behaviour of the sediments when subjected to hydraulic loading is studied. The research concluded that a stable initial interface was found with a slope of approximately 35degrees. In what extent the infill migrated inward through the core varied depending on the installation<br/>method. When subjected to hydraulic loading, a critical hydraulic gradient was found of 0.05m/m on average and 0.04m/m in the most conservative case. These results were established with a measurement accuracy of » 5% and the consistency over different series of tests was¸ 80%. Sometimes segregation of the stones was observed. The main attribution to the deviations in the measured hydraulic gradients and sediment transport were concluded due to this variation in the positioning of the stones. It is concluded that the current existing literature is able to give reasonable initial approximations of the critical gradient in the system(5¡40% accurate), however, the deviation can be significant and further research by varying more geometrical parameters should conclude if the obtained approximations are constant. Concluding, the results obtained in this research suggest that the critical loading conditions for the interface stability of to a rubble mound in a sandfill are of comparable order to conventional filter criteria and are higher than the currently calculated and measured appearing gradients by for instance Vanneste and Troch (2012) and Polidoro et al. (2015). These results justify the further exploration towards the potential of the abbreviation of geotextiles at the considered interface. In order to guide further research a list of recommendations is given as well as additional model improvements.","Rubble mound; breakwater; sandfill; retaining; suffusion; geotextile; interface; Stability; reclamation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering | Coastal Engineering","",""

This way the low throughput of current scanning electron microscopes can be increased proportional to the number of parallel beams. The Wien filter uses a magnetic field to separate the array of primary beams from the secondary beams. A design for the Wien filter is described in [6] consisting of electric and magnetic deflection arrays. In this report a first model of the magnetic deflection array is presented and tested to investigate the uniformity of the magnetic field. The magnetic field strength was computed by measuring the deflection distance caused by the field. As predicted by theory, the field has been found to scale linearly with the applied current. Current optimization was done in simulations to find the most uniform distribution of the magnetic field. Experiments showed against expectation that the uniformity of themagnetic field between slits does not increase with increasing current on the auxiliary coil while current on the main coil is kept constant.

Companies spend a lot of money on marketing without knowing how eective certain marketing campaigns are. To solve this problem for bunq, we will be using machine learning to create a marketing attribution system which outputs the optimal parameters for advertisements, based on data from all previous bunq advertisements. This tool can be used by the marketing department of bunq to increase its eciency. The marketing attribution project consists of three parts: the machine learning model itself, the input data of the machine learning model and the system through which people can get output of the model. The machine learning model is created by a data scientist at bunq. The model uses supervised learning, a method that uses a set of annotated training data as a supervisor for learning patterns. We specically make use of deep learning models that use regression to nd either the expected amount of clicks or the cost per acquisition of an advertisement. The results of these models are presented as a JSON le containing the best n advertisement options and their features. The input data to train the machine learning model was created by us. One component of the input data are the so-called touchpoints from Adjust. Adjust is an advertisement tracking company, which helps bunq with gathering data about all online encounters people had with bunq, like clicks on bunq advertisements or visits to the bunq website. The Adjust data gives the machine learning model information about how often an advertisement has been seen or clicked on, but it does not give information about how ecient an advertisement was in terms of the gained users. To solve this, we wrote an algorithm that anonymously matches the Adjust data to user data in the bunq database, based on IP-address and timestamps. The more links an advertisement has with users, the more ecient it is since it has been part of a process that convinced many users to become a bunq user. With this input data the machine learning model can be trained. The second part of the project is creating a connection to the machine learning model in such a way that the marketing department can use it. We created a python server that accepts calls from the bunq backend and sends the calls to the model, which is written in Java. It will then pass on the response of the model back to the bunq backend. In the python server, we use a bayesian technique to determine the best inputs for the marketing attribution machine learning model, to nally get the best possible parameters for a certain advertisement. All code in the backend is written in PHP and .json in a very clear Model View Controller structure, with strict bunq coding guidelines.

A circular economy does not produce any waste. The construction sector is the most polluting sector in the Netherlands and uses 50% of the used raw materials. Therefore, circular building methods might decrease the demand on raw materials in the Dutch construction sector. This research aims to identify what factors can stimulate the adoption of circular building methods by the general contractor. <br/><br/>In this research a cross-case analysis is conducted with two building projects that aimed to use circular building methods. During the interviews for these case studies, some barriers for the adoption of circular building methods were identified. The six barriers which are mentioned most often are the perception of high costs, limited regulation, lack of a circular business model, unattractive esthetics, negative attitude from actors involved, and lack of integrality within the building process. <br/><br/>To have a positive influence on the adoption of circular building methods, and resolve the identified barriers, the general contractor may take the role of an integral manager to manage the social network, supply chain, and building process and facilitate the learning process. When taking this role it is suggested that the general contractor works together with other actors to develop a new business model. This new business model should aim to take away the current barriers for circular building methods. <br/><br/>The main difference between any other innovation in the building sector and circular building methods is that circularity needs more integrality. Other innovations are often only on a specific part of the project, it suffices with only changing or managing on a small part of a building project. However, circularity affects every small part of a project and therefore needs an integral manager. <br","Circular; General contractor; Collaboration; adoption of innovation; Building sector","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Construction Management and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Defence institutions and military aircraft manufacturers are increasingly exploring the ways to im- prove stealth in new aircraft designs. Design for low observability, more specifically for low Radar Cross-Section is the fundamental design aspect during design of a new military aerial vehicle. Acoustic stealth is also an important characteristic of an aerial vehicle and is one of the main objectives during the design of a stealth aircraft to avoid being heard by the enemy troops below. <br/><br/>Although there has been some work done in the past on flap morphing of wings, there are still some engineering aspects of flap morphing which are still left unexplored. Previous research focused more on aerodynamic and structural aspects of flap morphing. Couple of these unexplored aspects are the Aero-Acoustic Noise and Radar Cross-Section assessment of flap morphing. Flap gaps, kinematics and side-edges are a source of generating noise and radar signature and through flap morphing potential merits of these two aspects can be assessed. <br/><br/>Flap morphing technology is most likely to be used on unmanned military aerial vehicles. Therefore, the GA-ASI MQ-9 Reaper was used for achieving the research objectives in this thesis work. The study focuses on the Aero-Acoustic noise and Radar Cross-Section merits through flap morphing of the GA- ASI MQ-9 Reaper. Aero-Acoustic noise analysis were performed experimentally as well as analytically whereas Radar Cross-Section merits were obtained by performing simulations. <br/><br/>From the Aero-Acoustic noise experiments on the scaled 3D printed morphing and conventional wings of GA-ASI MQ-9 Reaper, noise reduction in the morphing wing have been observed in all configurations and operational settings. From the 35m/s noise experiments, Overall Sound Pressure Level reduction is observed between 4.7% and 38.2% for dierent angles of attack whereas reduction in the overall Sound Pressure Level between 20.66% and 32.2% have been observed with 50m/s. Similarly, with the Werner Dobrzynski’s noise prediction technique, together with Karl-Stephane Rossignol’s flap side-edge noise prediction model, benefits in the noise generation are observed for the morphing wings. For similar geometrical configurations as experiments, noise reduction variation in the predicted Overall Sound Pressure Level lies between 37% and 46% for dierent angles of attack at 50 m/s. <br/><br/>For the mono-static Radar Cross-Section with trailing edge and flap deflection of 0°, a significant reduction in the radar signature is observed for the morphing wing, whereas for 25°trailing edge and flap deflection it turns out that the radar signature for the morphing wing is very similar or slightly higher than the conventional wing. For the mono-static radar signature with 0° trailing edge and flap deflection, after summation of total RCS in all 360 directions, a maximum and minimum decrease of 10.52dBsm and 9.95dBsm have been observed by flap morphing whereas for 25° trailing edge and flap deflection an increase in radar signature between 1.54 and 2 dBsm was noticed. Bi-static RCS analysis were also performed on the 0° trailing edge and flap deflection of where the decrease in radar signature between 4 and 18 dBsm was observed. <br","Radar Cross-Section; Beamforming; Aero-Acoustic Noise; Mono-static RCS; Bi-static RCS; Acoustic Experiments; Flap morphing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-07-04","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Energy production has historically been a centralized process without citizen participation. Recently, the energy production system is becoming increasingly decentralized. However, a polycentric energy production system requires active citizen involvement. Renewable energy (RE) cooperatives are exemplary of citizen involvement in decentralized energy production. In RE cooperatives, citizens collectively own and manage RE projects, oftentimes at the local level. While wind cooperatives have been around since the 1980s, the establishment of a local energy market has increasingly led to the emergence of RE cooperatives. <br/>RE cooperatives have been previously described as collective actions, facilitating to overcome the social dilemmas associated with climate change mitigation. However, research has not been conclusive in this matter. Moreover, RE cooperative research is mainly qualitative in nature. If RE cooperatives are to thrive in an increasingly competitive decentralized energy production system, quantitative research on their successful functioning is imperative. <br/>This thesis aims to provide an empirical and quantitative account on the extend at RE cooperatives operate as collective actions. The question of this research is which factors stimulate success in RE cooperatives and how can this be explained by the RE cooperative’s function as collective actions?<br/>The most important predictors of success in RE cooperatives are a high focus on renewable energy and high dividends. These are all determined by democratic decision making. Thus, the outcome of democratic decision making is a more important predictor of successful cooperation in RE cooperatives, than collective action variables. Collective action variables had some effects on cooperation, but most of their effects were limited. Moreover, the exact operationalization of these variables in RE cooperatives is different than what theory prescribes. Additionally, it is unsure how the core relationships of the collective action framework are exactly operationalized in RE cooperatives.","agent-based modeling; ostrom; cooperation; collective action; renewable energy cooperative; Community","en","master thesis","","","","","","The Master's programme Industrial Ecology is jointly organised by Leiden University and Delft University of Technology.","","","","","","Industrial Ecology","",""

Due to the deep uncertainty of the causal representative carbon pathways, the plausible range of sea levels rise varies between 0,26 - 2,43 m for 2100 and 0,50 - 15,52 m for 2300. To address deep uncertainty, decision making methods arise which struggle with including measures preparing the shift from incremental to transitional strategies required for the case of extreme sea level rise scenarios. This research addresses flood risk management in the Netherlands, a country which will face ecological, economical, technological and political challenges as sea levels climb. In anticipation to extreme sea level rise and its challenges, the Dutch process of coastline shortening and solidating can be carried through. Another viable option is a more gradual zone between land and water. To review both options, the distribution of systems sensitive to flooding is mapped. The overlay of systems facilitates the establishment of a framework which distinguishes elements based on their pace of transition and offers a multilayered image differentiating regions with an emphasis on either population or nature. This dichotomy structures the proposal for the transitional territorial outline by harmoniously applying a superimposed coastline and a dynamic coastline respectively. Tipping points of flood defence measures assess the physical feasibility of the transition which is mainly constrained by societal limitations. This results in incremental improvements, further increasing transfer costs, path dependency and the difficulty to shift to transitional strategies. Throughout history, only catastrophic floods were leading to transitional flood measures, but transition management is referred to as enabling development of a long-term sustainability perspective, linked to desired societal transitions, to guide accelerated social innovation in the short term. The theory’s transition arena with frontrunners and a transition image is capable of opposing the resistance-giving, established standard and is instrumental for communication, discussion and evolvement of the transition of flood risk management.","sea level rise; flood risk management; transition management; mapping; layers approach; incrementalism; flood defence; climate change; adaptation; pathways","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

McHARG<br/> <br/>Over 220km² of the UK’s land surface was transformed from farmland, forests or wetlands to urban development in just six years up to 2012. Soil sealing is happening and even accelerating in Southend-On-Sea, to respond to the regional regeneration project, the Thames Gateway. During the last decade, Southend has been transformed from a seaside resort into a cultural and economic centre, by enhancing transport infrastructure and starting numerous construction projects. The cost of this old development paradigm, which emphasizes the significant socio-economic development, is to seal the land, to erode the landscape structure, and to weaken the ecological services.<br/> <br/>In the context of climate-change, the old development paradigm over the last decade seems to create a dilemma for Southend. As a high-density town with a high degree of soil sealing, Southend has been exposed to climate-change related hydrological threats. In the long-term, considering the extreme sea level rise (1.8m) projection model, it is necessary to prepare and introduce sea defense interventions. In the short-term, influenced by the extreme rainfall events and record tide events, as well as the insufficient surface-water run-off system, the northwest and south parts of Southend-on Sea repeatedly suffered from pluvial floods. It is high time to rethink the development paradigm and consider that nature comes first.<br/> <br/>Southend in the old and new development paradigm, which is like an inverted world in the mirror. This project aims at changing the logic of urbanization and putting an emphasis on nature. Nature comes first does not mean denying or ignoring the social-economic development. On the contrary, learning from the landscape means reserving space for nature, playing with density and guiding the land use suitability. The aim is to reduce the risk and reserve space for future development, then achieve greater social-economic development and benefits.<br","urban landscape infrastructure; carrying capacity; landscape structures; urbanization logic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","51.534555, 0.714856"

Urban administrators often strive for a successful realization of such projects, to give a social and economic power impulse to poorly performant neighbourhoods. In some cases, though, a balance between the three dimensions of sustainability (environmental, social and economic) is a hard matter to achieve. Indeed, in some occasions, the neighbourhood-boosting role takes over, leading to the establishment of mechanisms that might only partially work from a sustainable viewpoint. Big Open Linked Data (BOLD) methods are offering new opportunities to design decision-making models for urban planning and management. The combination of social media, census, sensors and traditional data gives a new perspective to solve modern urban challenges through a holistic and inclusive approach. Compared to the mere use of traditional sources, BOLD methods rely on a bigger-scale, more accurate, real-time, data set. In this research, BOLD potential is explored to estimate the extent to which it can help solving the described urban issue. Therefore, the research question can be addressed as follows: How can BOLD help city planners and managers determining the real-time and holistic impact on social, environmental and economic dynamics in projects of re-use of obsolete or underused infrastructures? How could these projects enhance sustainable benefits without neglecting the positive economic and social impact for the neighbourhood? An in-depth literature study on public parks and brownfield redevelopments can help setting criteria and variables related to sustainability. For each of these variables, it is established whether a BOLD approach could bring more satisfactory results on a selected case study, the High Line Park, in New York. The final product is a framework that serves as decision-making supportive tool, to assess through BOLD and traditional data combined the way these aspects of sustainability connect to each other in such projects. Finally, the framework is tested and adapted to a case study in Rotterdam, the Hofbogen viaduct redevelopment. This case study in the Netherlands is not only useful to test the validity of the framework built in a different context, but it serves the purpose of solving the main problem concerning this case study: social sustainability. Indeed, the framework is used to improve this aspect thorough the next phases of the redevelopment, defining a frame for both project and neighbourhood assessment and inclusive participatory model for all stakeholders involved.","BOLD cities; Urban regeneration; Sustainability; Big Data; Landscape architecture; Re-use of infrastructures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, the fashion industry produces, distributes and utilizes clothing in a linear way, making it among the main industries responsible for the negative environmental and social aspects of sustainability (Madsen, Hartlin, Perumalpillai, Selby, &amp; Aumônier, 2007). In recent years several studies have addressed the potential of the Circular Economy by taking a more consumer led approach to reduce the environmental and societal impact of the fashion industry (Armstrong, Niinimäki, Kujala, Karell, &amp; Lang, 2015; Laitala, Boks &amp; Klepp, 2015; Mugge, 2017). However, the role of educating consumers by design, something that is seen by industry leaders and researchers as crucial if we want them to play more active roles in enabling a circular fashion economy, remains unanswered and is therefore explored in this thesis. Fashion prototypes that fill the gap between fast fashion and slow fashion are used as design case studies and offer a different perspective on designing for a more efficient and thoughtful use of resources. By qualitative interviews with four types of millennial consumers and the identification of six opportunity areas, the sock service SwapSocks was designed, that improves the environmental impact of socks by saving 38% of CO2 emissions and 50% of energy, compared to traditional socks. In addition to this, it educates consumers towards a better textile life by actively involving them in the swapping process and encourages them by means of packaging design, a website and online community to apply the principles of the service to other fashion items in their wardrobe as well. By providing a suitable solution for sustainable fashion consumption, this thesis addresses the potential of design to educate consumers towards a better textile life and therefore contributes to ongoing research efforts in the field of the circular economy and circular fashion design. As our changing mindsets are going to be key for our circular futures, the report illustrates, several future opportunities for the fashion industry specifically for millennial consumers, and identifies four types of millennial consumers. These, together with the final design solution, could help to inspire the fashion world and bring industry actors across the network together in finding solutions for a better textile world.","Circular design; fashion; socks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","","","","","",""

Urban green is regarded as big part of the solution for the environmental challenges that cities are facing. Ecosystem services, (Bolund &amp; Hunhammar, 1999) in cities should be planned for. Physical needs, security of existence, social and psychological needs can all benefit from green interventions (Hop &amp; Hiemstra, 2013). Therefore, it is very important that local governments have ambitious green policies. The challenge in a densified city is space, where new dwellings need to be built, which leaves almost no space for green development. However, since the 1980s rooftop green was introduced. Projects were developed which resulted in beautiful green roofscapes. There are some critical remarks though: First, they primarily occur in the private sector. Second, public green roofs are often unknown by citizens, as they are hardly seen from ground level and often have bad accessibility. Since mid 2000’s, green façades began to emerge and green architecture became a fact. The advantages of green façades, in contrast with green roofs, is that they are visible from the street level. However, one cannot walk through a green façade. The third problem of green vertical and rooftop interventions is that they are implemented on a small scale scattered all over, with little to no interaction with the ground level. The effects of those green interventions are still very local, many potential synergies are unused.Green roofs and façades are mainly architectural projects and are connected to the isolation of the building. There is not enough attention for this type of green interventions yet from a landscape architectural point of view. This research shows an exploration of how city green can be optimized by integrating the facade-and rooftop green into the neighbourhood landscape. Rotterdam, the Netherlands, will be the main focus due to the many green roof interventions and number of flat roofs. The results show a stepwise approach how an existing city can transform into a biophilic one. Rooftop and facade green can be an extension of the ground level landscape and together form a new green urban landscape. To integrate the surrounding landscape into the city, requirements for new developments are set regarding historical structures, view lines, native species, etc. The city becomes part of the ‘natural’ landscape again. So there is ""daily human contact with nature as well as the many environmental and economic values provided by nature and natural systems"" (Beatley, 2011).","Biophilia; Landscape architecture; Rotterdam; Ecosystem Services; Neighbourhood scale; Green infrastructure; Rooftop green; Facade green","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","","51.9207979, 4.4768939"

We have to recognise that every place is a complex and layered phenomenon, a physical platform of lived space. Complex locations like Sarajevo and its mountain, its bobsleigh track, with a particular geological, political, social and cultural history, demand analysis and design approaches that take into account the experience on the ground, the lived space, the different layers and meanings of a site, the experience of movement and time. Furthermore, the central position of the designer<br/>in the transformation process needs to be questioned by demands for participation and even co-creation with the different urban actors, which require specific tools that take into account the multiple stories embodied in a place. Top-down design and planning has increasingly made way for a complex process that involves many actors, creating a need to redefine the question of what design is. Rather than a linear, rational character of traditional planning, a shift towards more open design approaches should be made, which take into account experiential responses to the sites at hand, and which allow more relational ways of doing.<br/><br/>My aim is that through the cinematic narrative and the use of film as a method, I open up the possibilities for a new reading of the void, beyond the existing interpretation, a new understanding of the bobsleigh track as an open space. Open space as a space for opportunity, imagination, un-programmed and free for uses not yet conceived, accepting changes in the mode of life. The space is to be shaped by the users. Forms should emerge spontaneously as an effect of human activity and are not defined beforehand in its manifestation. Within this open construct, the bobsleigh track is accessible and interpretable in various ways, thus preserving the void. By showing a multiplicity of viewpoints the void is preserved, maintaining its temporary appro- priation by different users, and giving it a place in the larger urban landscape. The user has to reflect and engage in a personal dialogue with the urban landscape. This is not a pre-determined role, but an active and open-ended part. More than simply leading to a final representation, this could be used to develop an architectural strategy as a structure in which time has room to breathe, and to let aging, growth and even decay unfold.","mountain; border conditions; cross-media; transitional architectures; post war; role of the architect","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","43.84111, 18.44222"

In the climate accord of Paris, the Netherlands came to an agreement with the rest of the world leaders to limit the overall temperature rise by reducing the consumption of and by switching away from carbon-based fuels. The gas mining induced earthquakes in the northern part of the Netherlands increases the pressure on Dutch society to reduce natural gas consumption. The residential sector can play a role in reducing the consump- tion of natural gas in accordance with the Paris accord and to mitigate gas mining induced earthquakes. The amount of natural gas consumed per household is dependent on the behavioural aspects of residents, which are the biggest cause of uncertainty in estimating natural gas consumption. Current natural gas consumption based calculations are based upon dwelling characteristics and are not adjusted to individual behavioural as- pects. The inside temperature in a dwelling is seen as the primal indicator of residential heat consumption. The behavioural aspects of residents in the form of thermostat interaction are analysed in this thesis. The potential saving in the residential sector is addressed by including thermostat practices of residents in the estimation of potential savings.<br/>The goal of this thesis is to identify thermostat practice in dwellings by the use of disaggregated energy con- sumption data and estimate the impact of adjusting individual thermostat practices on the natural gas con- sumption in the residential sector. Disaggregated energy consumption data is seen as detailed individual household consumption data. To reach the goal the following research question is answered:<br/>What insights in thermostat practices that influence natural gas consumption of individual house- holds can be identified by a combined analysis of electricity and thermostat use?<br/>Practice theory is used to understand the underlying mechanisms at play in household interaction with their thermostat. Disaggregated consumption data is used to gain insights in thermostat practices of individual dwellings. The thermostat practices of households are used to group specific practices and indemnify poten- tial savings in the residential sector.<br/>The smart meter/ thermostat Toon is used to gather individual thermostat interactions and gas and electricity consumption data. Grouping of individual households with the use of clustering on the basis of thermostat settings is used to determine similar thermostat practices. Households with similar thermostat practices are grouped together, with the use of unsupervised classification in the form of hierarchal clustering. Similar thermostat practices groups are used to shape potential thermostat adjustments and assess the impact of these adjustments.<br/>Thermostat practices of households are evaluated with the use of occupancy detection to identify potentials savings. A connection between thermostat practices and household occupancy is made with the use of elec- tricity consumption data. Individual electricity consumption data of households is used to determine the occupancy in a dwelling, by detecting moments of relative high consumption. Residential occupancy is de- tected with model ensemble of a Hidden Markov Model and a Rolling Mean Model to determine an overall occupancy schedule. The combined analysis of occupancy and thermostat practices is used to determine potential savings and determine the extent of these savings.<br/>The generated insight in saving possibilities by a combination of thermostat practices and residential occu- pancy is used to develop and estimate the impact of 4 different thermostat practice adjustments. The esti- mations are based upon 3 different calculation methods: relative shift, heat demand and temperature and gas regression model, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the impact of each of the saving options. The potential savings are expressed in condition based lowering of the thermostat settings inside individ- ual dwellings. The relative shift method calculates the potential saving by relating gas consumption to the difference between in and outside temperature. Heat demand calculations are based upon the number of non-active heating hours for each of the saving options. In the regression method, a linear regression model for every individual household is build, to estimate the gas consumption on the basis of the difference be- tween the in and outside temperature.<br/>More than half of the households in the sample group heats their home during daytime while the occupancy of these dwellings is detected at around 50%. The other half of the population has a clear heating pattern of<br/>i<br/>ii<br/> morning and evening heating. For each of the detected thermostat practices, adjusting thermostat settings result in a potential gas saving. There is a factor 2.5 difference in potential saving between the different ther- mostat practices. Residents are able to save from 2% to 5% depending on their thermostat practice, resulting in an overall average saving of 34 euro per year. The largest saving potential of lowering the thermostat to 15 degrees overnight. Thermostat practices of households have a bigger impact on the gas consumption than currently used household characteristics. Natural gas consumption of households with similar thermostat practices have shown disparate consumption due to dwelling specific characteristics. Household specifics as thermostat practices and thermal inertia have shown to impact natural gas consumption. The detected ther- mal inertia of dwellings with the use of disaggregated consumption data is not in line with estimated values based upon physical characteristics of dwellings. The potential savings based upon physical characteristics of dwellings over estimates the potential saving in the residential sector. The impact of thermostat practices and thermal inertia of dwellings determined with the use of disaggregated consumption data is substantial. Cur- rent energy consumption studies and energy labelling are based upon physical characteristics of dwellings. The mismatch between estimated energy consumption and measured consumption indicates that estimat- ing residential gas consumption for individual households on the basis household characteristics alone is redundant. By including actual residential consumption data in energy labelling and shifting policy towards adapting household behaviour future policy measures can be improved.<br/>The overall potential savings in the residential sector by adjusting thermostat settings are relatively small but can help to reach the climate goals. The results are based upon occupancy detection in a dwelling by analysing dis-aggregated consumption data. By improving the occupancy detection, the confidence in the results and number of included households can be improved. Expanding the size and representativeness of the sample group improves the applicability and confidence in the results. The personal preferences of residents in both the adoption adjustments and the actual impact on their thermal comfort is unknown. Fu- ture research is needed in order to close the gap between actual savings and potential savings by thermostat adjustments and to determine the impact on thermal comfort.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the resulting stability formulas, depth-averaged flow parameters are used, and the loads caused by turbulent fluctuations are taken into account by the modelled turbulent kinetic energy k. A load caused by turbulent wall pressures is never explicitly taken into account before. With the use of a 3D eddy resolving modelling technique, turbulence can be resolved to a certain extent, by which local parameters can be used to determine the load on the bed. This may result in a more accurate prediction of stone stability, and a more economical design method for granular bed protections.<br/><br/>Due to the computational requirements needed for the most detailed eddy resolving modelling techniques, it is concluded that for the aim of assessing stone stability, Improved Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation (IDDES) is the most appropriate 3D eddy resolving modelling technique for now and the nearby future. This modelling technique is also applied in a study regarding the influence of tidal energy turbines in one of the gates of the Eastern Scheldt barrier. In this thesis, special attention is paid to develop a stability formula, which can be used to assess the stone stability in the highly turbulent flow region behind the Eastern Scheldt barrier, based on the output of these simulations (hereafter ”Eastern Scheldt case”).<br/><br/>In order to derive a new stability formula, IDDESs are made of the two long sill experiments of Jongeling et al. (2003). In these experiments, an accelerating flow region is present above the sill. At its downstream end, the flow is separating, causing a highly turbulent flow region behind the sill. Thereby, the dominant flow characteristics are similar to those at the Eastern Scheldt barrier. In both regions of the experiments, on top of the sill and in the area downstream of the sill, damages to the granular bed protection are measured.<br/><br/>A new stability formula is proposed. To avoid the new stability formula to be grid dependent, the wall shear stress and the pressure gradient are used to<br/>represent the loads by drag and inertia respectively.<br/><br/>It appeared, that the proposed stability formula does not predict the number of measured stone movements well, for the entire modelled domain of the long sill experiments. Nevertheless, it is hypothesised, that the assumed pre-dominant load terms are right, but that the ratio between those load terms on top of the sill differs from the ratio between the load terms in the downstream area. Two different entrainment mechanisms are described, that may not be predicted accurately by the same stability formula.<br/><br/>With regard to the Eastern Scheldt case, the choice is made to derive a stability formula that is only valid for the entrainment mechanism in a highly turbulent flow region behind a sill of backward-facing step. The data, behind the point of separation in the long sill simulations, is used to derive this stability relation. It appeared that the best results are obtained for a stability formula that is similar to the stability relation proposed earlier, with a Cm:b-value of 1. This is in agreement with the hypothesised entrainment mechanisms for this region.<br/><br/>Finally, the proposed stability formula is applied to the Eastern Scheldt case. A firm conclusion about the exact influence of the tidal energy turbines on the granular bed protection, cannot be drawn based on this study. However, it can be concluded, that the influence on the stability of the stones seems to be insignificant. At the analysed locations, the loads on the bed even seem to be slightly reduced in the simulation with turbines, compared to the simulation without turbines.<br/><br/>At least as important, is the conclusion that IDDES potentially is an appropriate modelling technique to assess the stability of stones in a granular bed protection. For the long sill experiments, the measured flow characteristics are clearly reproduced more accurately when using IDDES, than by applying a RANS model with the same boundary conditions. The computational effort needed for the Eastern Scheldt case is comparable to the computational requirements of the long sill simulations. Nevertheless, in both cases, the effective grid resolution was not yet sufficient to resolve all fluctuations towards the size of 1dn50. Despite the given that the desired resolution is not yet reached in this thesis, the simulated velocity signals of the long sill experiments are in good agreement with the measured ones. The choice between the use of IDDES or a RANS model should depend on the available computational power, time and required accuracy.","Stone stability; CFD modelling; Improved Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation; Flow over rough bed; Highly turbulent flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","DMEC project - task 3.7",""

Large scale infrastructure like highways<br/>and railways connect the cities from distant places to each other in an efficient manner.<br/>The hard and dominant structure only provides for connection on top of it, but<br/>acts as a barrier for the perpendicular connections, which can even lead to separation<br/>of the two sides entirely. Large scale infrastructures were built from the perspective<br/>of the traffic on it and took little consideration of its surroundings and lead to the<br/>creation of the undefined spaces around it. The spaces that are created around large<br/>scale infrastructure usually only function as buffer zones. These are needed to keep a<br/>certain amount of distance between the highway and its surroundings. This distance<br/>can vary depending on the type of surrounding. While these spaces are used as buffer<br/>zones, the presence of the highway also causes certain limitations on the functionality<br/>and other usages of these spaces. This then often results in the spaces not being<br/>used or even being abandoned and neglected all together. This phenomenon occurs<br/>all over the world in large cities where highways go through urban areas. Especially<br/>in such a small country as The Netherlands, the space we have is limited. Nowadays<br/>we always stress the fact that we should be making multifunctional spaces, but these<br/>spaces around the highway usually only have the function of buffering between highway<br/>and its surrounding. However, these spaces have the potential to become something<br/>much more than just the leftover spaces of a highway. In my graduation project<br/>I want to address this issue, especially when considering that in the near future, most<br/>of the cars will be using electricity instead of fossil fuel, which will decrease the air<br/>pollution and noise from the engine. With this, the view on the spaces around the<br/>highway will change for the better and will allow for more different uses of these<br/>spaces.<br/>The main research question of this project will be: “How to transform the<br/>leftover spaces created by large scale infrastructure into places that can incorporate<br/>new functions that can solve the local or urban issues, while at the same time stays<br/>coherent?”<br/>Rotterdam was chosen as my location, because it is the longest orbital highway<br/>of the Randstad cities, it has many different types of areas it goes through and<br/>highway itself is also tightly encased by the city for most part. For the analysis I separated<br/>it into different layers, representing the leftover spaces and infrastructure, the<br/>potentials on large scale networks and the triggers for development. When overlapping<br/>these layers, we can see which potential is best suited for which area. The ring<br/>road is strongly divided into two halves. And within the halves, it breaks up into<br/>smaller pieces. So it is important to start with strong relevant ones.<br/>One of these important spots is the area near Kralingse Zoom. This area has<br/>the potential to improve the blue-green connections. As a conclusion of the local<br/>analysis, there is a wish to connect the city center with the green areas in the north,<br/>but the infrastructure form a strong barrier in between. And the forest itself is also<br/>only facing towards the south, making the connection to the north harder. By looking<br/>at the different heights and environments of the infrastructure, different zones are<br/>marked. And with the main goal in mind, each of these zones can contribute to by reacting<br/>in their own way. By utilizing the different spatial qualities that the area already<br/>has, the area around the large scale infrastructure can be divided into different parts,<br/>that each can react according to what that specific area needs. For instance by lowering<br/>the ground to increase the height of the structures, so both sides can be united.<br","Infrastructure; multifunctional; Leftover space","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","","51.9244201, 4.4777325"

Due to this rise in occurrences, more people are affected. An important indicator for people affected is the amount of damage to buildings. To gather this information aid workers now have to go into the field to gather data on the amount of destruction. In response to the possible dangers these people encounter in the field, remote sensing and analysis techniques have been developed for automated damage detection. However, due to various limitations on the implementation, these techniques are not yet widely adopted in emergency response and humanitarian aid.<br/><br/>This work compares two methods and two data sources for the detection of building damage. The methods are evaluated on their accuracy and implementability within humanitarian aid in disaster situations. The main methods considered are equalisation of histograms of pre-event and post-event imagery, followed by Univariate Image Differencing; and a convolutional neural network on features withdrawn from post-event imagery, using OpenStreetMap data. Remotely sensed data sources considered are synthetic aperture radar and very high resolution optical imagery. All results are analysed and compared to current standards in damage detection. <br/><br/>From the results it can be concluded that more research is required for a practical implementation of deep learning techniques. The constraint posed by the requirement of large datasets, make these methods impracticable without sufficient preparation and resources. More simpler methods, like Univariate Image Differencing, can be validated on smaller ground-truth datasets, and are therefore easier in implementation when resources are limited. The possible accuracy increase of deep learning methods does, at this moment, not outweigh the ease of an elementary differencing approach.","Geomatics; Remote Sensing; Building Damage; Neural Networks; Univariate Image Differencing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Geomatics","",""

As it allows for rank reduction of the input data matrix, it is not only able to compress the information contained, but can even reveal underlying patterns in the data through feature identification. This thesis explores algorithms for large-scale SVD calculation, and uses these to demonstrate how the SVD can be applied to a variety of fields, including information retrieval, recommender systems and image processing.<br/><br/>The algorithms discussed are Golub-Kahan-Lanczos bidiagonalization, randomized SVD and block power SVD. Each algorithm is implemented in Matlab and both error and time taken by each algorithm are compared. We find that the block power SVD is very effective, especially when only the truncated SVD is required. Due to its simplicity, speed and relatively small error for low-rank matrix approximation, it is an ideal method for the applications discussed in this thesis.<br/><br/>We show how the SVD can be used for information retrieval, through Latent Semantic Indexing. The method is tested on the Time collection and we find that the SVD removes much of the noise present in the data and solves the issues of synonymy and polysemy. Then, SVD-based algorithms for recommender systems are presented. We implement a basic SVD algorithm called Average Rating Filling, and a (biased) stochastic gradient descent algorithm, which was developed for the Netflix recommender-system prize. These are tested on the Movielens 100k dataset, resulting in the best performance by biased stochastic gradient descent. Finally, the SVD is used for image compression and we find that, while not very useful for face recognition, the SVD could provide a time- and space-efficient method for searching through an image database for similar images.","Singular value decomposition; Recommender System; Latent semantic indexing","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Applied Mathematics","",""

The TetraSpar floating wind turbine achieves these goals by being constructed using components highly suitable for standardization and industrialization. The design makes use of a suspended submerged counter weight to obtain a low center of gravity for the floating system, while also allowing a low draft during transport and installation. An analytic analysis of the counter weight suspension system is presented that investigates the behavior of the system. The main concern of the novel system is its motion relative to the upper floating platform which it is connected to. It is demonstrated that the suspended system's motion is described by the axial elongation of the suspension lines when positive tension is maintained in all suspension lines. An analytic solution for the equivalent stiffness of the suspension system is given. This suspension system stiffness introduces additional natural frequencies into the system, and the effects of these frequencies are demonstrated. <br/><br/>This novel concept requires a multibody modeling approach to perform a dynamic loads and response analysis, as the stiffness between the floating platform and the counter weight is provided by chains. Additional design criteria are required for the counter weight system dependent on a combination of chain capacity and maintaining positive tension in all of the suspension lines. To satisfy these design criteria a global hydrodynamic load and response analysis of the floating system is performed. In this concept, the counter weight depth contributes significantly to the dynamic properties of the system and therefore a parametric study is conducted. The global response parameters of the rigid-body motion, natural frequencies, nacelle accelerations, counter weight chain tensions, and maximum platform-pitch angles are compared. Following the parametric study, an ultimate limit state analysis is conducted on the original and alternative designs. Design recommendations are made for the counter weight depth and configuration of the suspension system layout.<br","Floating Wind Turbines; Offshore Wind Energy; Floating Support Structure; Suspension System; Counter Weight; Suspended Keel; Offshore Technology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","Energy Technology Development and Demonstration Program (EUDP): TetraSpar (Grant number 64017-05171)",""

This project takes the renovation of these apartments a step further than just renovating them. What is the status of the local flows (water, energy, waste, material, nutrients) in Carnisse, how can we create locally closed loops of these flows and what interventions are needed to be able to connect the walk-up apartments to these flows? The design is based on four principles that arose from the research of the questions mentioned before; close local flows, improve the public space, diversify and upgrade the walk-up. A new construction was designed that enabled greenhouses to be built on top of the existing buildings, but also creates the possibility to extend the dwellings or the option to make them life cycle proof, creating a more diverse neighborhood that is less dependent on external resources, making it more resilient and ready for the future.","Portiekflat; Walk-up apartment; Renovation; Carnisse; Rotterdam; flows","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Intecture","Beyond the Current",""

The shared spaces are designed in a way that the residents can meet each other in a natural way. Since the apartments are intended for social rent, the housing is relatively small; 30m2, 45m2 &amp; 60m2. The apartments are not only designed for the elderly, but also suitable for other target groups, like single households, students and starters. By small adjustments, such as sliding walls, the housing can still enable aging in place.","Architecture; Elderly; Informal encounter; built environment; social interaction; Social housing; social architecture; loneliness; Amsterdam; Healthcare architecture; Aging in place","mul","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Health","","52.356947, 4.787218"

The number of people above 65 is expected to grow from 3.1 million in 2017 to 4.8 million in 2040. The increasing ageing population results in more elderly in need of care and a lower percentage of young people able to provide formal care. The classical welfare state seems to gradually change to a ‘participatiesamenleving’, a society in which people initially take the responsibility for themselves. Elderly live independently as long as possible instead of living in an intramural setting. When they are not able to take care of themselves, they can appeal to their social network for more support. Formal care will be additional to the informal care. The participation of the social network is therefore important, not only to handle the shortage of formal care, but also to give people the possibility to live their own, trusted life. The research provides insight into the importance of the relationship between architecture and the provision of informal care to elderly in need of care, which is an increasingly important issue. Architectural tools that fulfil the needs of the informal caregivers can be used by architects while designing environments that stimulate informal care provided by people of the social network of elderly in need of care.<br/>'Het Verticale Hof' is an example of such and environment.

This has a negative effect on their wellbeing, healing process and more important, their cognitive, motoric and social development. The goal of this thesis is to describe a set of generic properties for the built environment to reduce this negative effect by stimulating the imagination of children, aged 3 to 6 years. The generic properties are derived from the analyses of spatial elements, present during activities, in which the imagination is active: playing and perceiving art. Through play they develop their motoric, social and cognitive skills, including their imagination. In addition, not all children in healthcare institutions are able to play, therefore also perceiving art is studied. Through observations at different play areas and the (spatial) analyses of these areas, playgrounds (designed by Aldo van Eyck), fantasy worlds of children and different artworks a set of properties is determined; a place which stimulates the imagination must be created by the composition of different elements. In this composition their scale, number, variety and interrelationship are taken into account. Each of these elements can be described by their properties: height &amp; planar differences, contrast, whether they can exists of loose materials, can be manipulated or that they support enclosure. The composition of these elements and the abstraction of their shape creates a framework of information. Certain aspects are visible and other aren’t. This results in the stimulation of the imagination. These results are translated into a design tool and forms the starting point for the design of a treatment and prevention centre for obese or overweight children. Obesity is a problem which has increased the past few years and probably will become bigger. This centre is located in Zuidwijk, Rotterdam. The percentage of children with obesity is higher in this area than in other parts of Rotterdam or The Netherlands. This centre exists of a treatment centre, sport centre and restaurant.

Man made climate change, caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and causing an array of negative environmental effects. The raw material input and throughput currently necessary to sustain our human activities which create large quantities of waste. The built environment plays a large role in both: accounting to 50% of the raw materials used, 40% of the national waste stream, 40% of the total energy use in the Netherlands and 35% of the CO2 emissions. A proposed solution for the waste problem is the shift from a linear economy to a circular economy. A proposed solution for the energy problem is transitioning to a (nearly) zero energy built environment. In this context, the depth of energy renovation of the existing building stock - which poses the biggest challenge for a (nearly) zero energy building stock - and building for the circular economy both needs to grow. <br/><br/>However, in the current policies in place, energy efficiency and high energy performance of buildings are prioritised over circularity. This can unintentionally result in building design and materials that do not lend themselves for circularity. It is not the high energy performance hindering the adoption of circular building design, but the choice of construction technique and materials. Furthermore, there is also a lack of consensus about how circularity in buildings can be assessed, while there are well known methods of assessing energy performance of buildings. <br/><br/>In this research, technical building design(s) for an energy renovation project are examined, implementing both circularity and energy performance ambitions. These building design(s) are assessed on their energy performance on the one hand, and on their circular performance on the other, by use of an assessment method partly based on existing circularity assessment methods and partly redefined and further developed for use in this thesis. The assessment method contains the following performance indicators: MAT1 intensity of material use, MAT2 environmental cost, MAT3 design for disassembly, MAT4 design for circular life cycles and E1 energy efficiency. This assessment is used the answer the main research question: “To what extent can circularity be implemented in the designs of energy renovation projects?”<br/><br/>The technical design(s) and the assessments of the design(s) thus support the scientific knowledge about the codevelopment of circularity and (nearly) zero energy ambitions in renovation projects, focusing on the meso scale of individual buildings. The research also supports the development of consensus about how the level of circularity in buildings can best be measured.","circular economy; circular building; energy renovation; circularity assessment; design for disassembly","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

These iconic developments are not rarely associated with high public investments, which often tend to be based on ambiguous assumptions and ill-defined objectives.<br/><b>Problem statement - </b>Despite the high level of academic attention for the phenomenon of urban icons, the current state of research lacks the availability of a comprehensive methodology by which the spillover effects of urban icons can effectively be measured. Therefore, municipalities are yet unable to apply quantitative measurements to justify previous investments or to substantiate future investment decisions with regards to urban icons.This research is focused on the establishment of an impact assessment approach, as it addresses the following main research question: <i>How can the spillover effects of urban icons be effectively measured?</i><br/><b>Methods - </b>A qualitative strategy has been applied in this research. A literature study and case study have been conducted to establish the impact assessment methodology blueprint, by which the spillover effects of urban icons can be measured. Based on a literature study and focus group meeting with an expert panel, the implementation feasibility of the prescribed methodology has been determined.<br/><br/><b>Findings - </b>An impact assessment methodology blueprint has been designed to comprehensively, quantitatively and longitudinally measure the spillover effects of urban icons at a high spatiotemporal resolution. The blueprint consists of three consecutive steps: (<b>1</b>) The integration of evaluation in the building process cycle, (<b>2</b>) the development of a big data-based project evaluation methodology and (<b>3</b>) the establishment of a data-driven urban planning practice. The results from the measurements can be applied to justify previous investments and to substantiate investment decisions.The implementation feasibility of the prescribed blueprint is potentially obstructed by the methodological implications, consisting of the high required investments and the culture shift in the urban planning practice that the methodology implies. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the methodology may be negatively affected by a limitation of applicable data sources, as a result of issues regarding data reliability, privacy or ethical concerns.<br/><br/><b>Conclusion - </b>In order to effectively measure the spillover effects of urban icons, municipalities should initiate a culture shift towards an approach in which research and urban planning are inseparably linked. Furthermore, municipalities should invest in the establishment of a methodology in which evaluation becomes an integral part of the building process cycle, big data sources are applied to effectively measure the impact of urban icons and a data-driven urban planning practice is established.<br","Urban icons; Flagship developments; Spillover effects; Project evaluation; Impact assessment methodology; Big data; Data-driven urban planning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Management in the Built Environment","",""

Standing on the dike gives me a feeling of conquest but also of separation. It stands out as a green wall between two worlds and stretches in the wide, open landscape as far as my eyes can see. This narrow edge has once been marshlands, a gradual transition between land and sea. Now, the dike abruptly excludes the exchange of the natural phenomena between them. Seawards, the tidal gullies are hardly visible as the sedimentation is too high. On the other side, on reclaimed land, straight ditches regulate the fresh water level to serve the big agricultural plots. The modernization of the last centuries has led to a functional coastal landscape in the Northern Netherlands with hardly any ecological, economic and social development along the dike. Instead, people have turned their back against the sea and forgotten the existence of, and potential coexistence with, it. <br/><br/>A dialogue is a continuous process. The increasing tidal volume and effect of salinization caused by relative climate change asks for a new perspective on the edge between land and sea. To what extent will we hold on to the belief that the dike as a thin, rigid line will protect us in a sustainable way against change? In my project these effects are not seen as threats but as a stimulus to deal with uncertain outcomes in spatial design. Creating a gradual transition zone will increase the level of resilience and establish ecological and social development. <br/> <br/>Looking at natural ecologies, the edge is after all the zone of the highest living activity. Making the dike more permeable has many gradations but in all cases the existing landscape with its traces will be taken as found. Using site-specific differences in topography, soil type and water infrastructure including the generic processes, will help to locate the suitable level and type of permeability. Revealing and reintroducing natural phenomena in different forms will make the narrative of the coastal dynamics in this landscape legible again. <br","Border condition; Coastal landscape; Transformation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Landscape Architecture","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Privately owned cars are an unsustainable mode of transportation, especially in cities. New Mobility on Demand (MoD) services should offer a convenient and sustainable alternative to privately owned cars. Notable in this field is the recent uprise of ride-sharing services such as offered by companies like Uber and Grab. Such services, especially when allowing for multiple passengers to share a vehicle, could potentially be a valuable addition to existing modes of transport to offer fast and sustainable door-to-door transportation.<br/><br/>The optimisation of vehicle routes for a MoD fleet is a complex task, especially when allowing for multiple passengers to share a vehicle. Recent studies have presented algorithms that can optimise routes in real-time for large scale ride-sharing systems, but have left opportunities to further enhance fleet performance. The redistribution of idle vehicles towards areas of high demand and the utilisation of high capacity vehicles in a heterogeneous fleet has received little attention. This work presents a method to continuously redistribute idle vehicles towards areas of expected demand and an analysis of fleets with both buses and regular vehicles. Furthermore, a method is proposed to optimise vehicle routes while taking into account vehicle capacities and the future locations of vehicles in anticipation to predicted demand.<br/><br/>In simulations with historical taxi data of Manhattan, 99.8% of transportation requests can be served with a fleet of 3000 vehicles with an average waiting time of 57.4 seconds, and an average in-car delay of 13.7 seconds. Compared to earlier work, a decrease in walk-aways of 95% is obtained for 3000 vehicles, with a 86% decrease in average in-car delay and a 37% decrease in average waiting time. For a small fleet of 1000 small busses of capacity 8 still 84.6% of requests can be served with an average waiting time of 141 seconds and an average in-car delay of 269 seconds. In comparison to prior work, a decrease in walk-aways of 15% is obtained, with a 14% decrease in average in-car delay and a 2% decrease in average waiting time. A heterogeneous fleet of 1000 vehicles consisting of 500 buses and 500 regular vehicles using this new approach can serve approximately the same number of passengers as a homogeneous fleet of 1000 buses using earlier presented algorithms.","optimisation; routing; mobility-on-demand; ride-sharing; ride-sourcing; mobility; transport; optimization; Integer Linear Programming problem; ILP; Mixed integer linear programming; MILP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When a library developer changes the internals of a library, this may unintentionally affect or even break the working of the library users' code. While it is possible to detect when a syntactic breaking change occurs, it is not as easy to detect semantic breaking changes, where the implicit contract of a functionality changes, sometimes unbeknownst to the library developer. Because library users rarely test the behaviour they expect of the library, neither the library developer nor the library user will be aware of the new behaviour.<br/><br/>As a library developer, you want to be able to see how a change in your library will affect your users before a new version of the library is deployed. More specifically, you want to gain insight into how users use the library, and want to see if and how changes affect users. This will allow you to determine whether the new version of the library is backwards compatible. Finally, after deploying the breaking changes, you want to notify the affected users of the changes and of a solution to the issue.<br/><br/>Schaapi, a tool for early detection of breaking changes based on API usages, addresses these needs. It mines public repositories for projects using a given library, analyses their usage of the API of that library, and generates tests that capture this behaviour. Finally, it offers a continuous integration service that automatically executes these tests against new versions of the library and warns developers of any potentially breaking changes in functionality. The tool has also been validated against real-world data to demonstrate its performance in realistic usage scenarios and to answer a selection of related research questions.","API; Breaking Changes; Mining Software Repositories; Continuous Integration; Software Library","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","Bachelor End Project",""

This report describes the effort of the sixth group of students who travelled to Nepal. Following conclusions and specific recommendations of Team 5, the present research has one main goal. This research focuses on improving the overall quality of CSEB and making sure that the final strength of the bricks is constant. This is done by predicting the final strength of CSEB during the early curing stage and using this knowledge to develop a testing method, so the Nepali can monitor the CSEB quality easily and accurately on site in an early production stage. The secondary goal was to perform a dynamic seismic analysis of the pilot house in Ratankot and to get a better understanding of earthquake engineering in Nepal.<br/><br/>To predict the final strength of CSEB, a research into the existence of a drying/hardening curve was performed. Different regions in Nepal ask for different CSEB mixtures because of differences in humidity, temperature, altitude and soil consistency. The biggest influence of the change in hardening process is presumably the cement percentage and therefore also the water/cement ratio. In the Nepali practice this percentage is between 5 and 15 percent, depending on local soil type. Therefore, in this research all soil parameters were kept constant except cement percentages, they range from 5 till 15 percent. To develop a hardening curve, bricks were tested after 5, 8, 14, 21 and 28 days. This was done using a (calibrated) compression machine. Results of these tests showed wide spread. The tested bricks were still moist and it was decided to test the CSEB after 38 days as well. This resulted in an even bigger gain in strength such that the bricks after 38 days were twice the strength of the bricks after 28 days. <br/>General conclusion can be drawn that the time period between the curing and testing of the brick makes a significant difference in the results, so this has to be monitored accurately. Furthermore continued curing does not necessarily contribute to the strength of the bricks or might even have a negative effect.<br/><br/>Results from the compression test showed that the general quality, and thus compression strength, of the bricks was lacking. Only bricks with 15% cement surpass the minimum strength of 3.50 MPa after 38 days. This showed that production site was not working properly, therefor Build Up Nepal was informed. This lack of strength is probably caused by a change in variables. The weather in the winter is very different than in summer, but the curing process wasn’t modified. Also the soil composition differs every time new soil is brought to the site, which can change the strength drastically. <br/><br/>While researching the hardening curves for CSEB, an alternative testing method was developed. Multiple ideas have been tested, such as a torque wrench with vice, a drop test and finally a lever arm test. The first two methods were deemed unusable as they broke down or were not able to produce reliable results. The lever arm test was most promising as this method produced constant results. Against expectations, the strength of the bricks tested by the lever arm tested was much higher than the strength of the bricks tested with the compression tester. This indicated that not exactly the same properties were measured. The results cannot be directly compared to each other. Before the method can be implemented there is more research necessary about which property is tested with the lever arm and the converting factor.<br","Nepal; Compressed Stabilized Earth Bricks (CSEB); testing methods; strength development; Shock Safe Nepal","en","student report","","","","","","","","","","","","","MP253 (Shock Safe Nepal)","27.7172453, 85.3239605"

Recently, Technolution is transitioning from the use of C in embedded systems, to Rust, a relatively new programming language developed by Mozilla. By design, Rust provides the programmer with higher security and reliability guarantees, such as memory safety, type safety and the absence of race conditions. These guarantees are ensured by means of an expressive ownership-based type system. However, it is impossible for the Rust type system to detect all errors statically. Hence, there are still many operations that contain dynamic checks to test for erroneous conditions. When such a check fails, an unrecoverable problem has been encountered and the current thread exits, this is called a panic in Rust. A panic causes the program to terminate, leading to a decrease in availability of the system. To avoid situations causing panic, Technolution wants tooling that detects possible ways a program could panic. For this purpose, we developed a static analysis tool: Rustig. When given a program, Rustig notifies the user of all the operations that either directly, or indirectly via another library, may cause a panic. The tools performs the analysis of panic calls in two stages. First, it builds a call graph from the executable of a Rust program, modelling functions as nodes and function calls as directed edges. Secondly, it performs an analysis on the call graph to determine which functions could cause panic. As part of the development of Rustig, we devised two new approaches. We have developed an approach to construct call graphs taking into account dynamic dispatch calls. This is based upon the assumption once a function address is loaded, it will also be called during execution. Furthermore, in order to efficiently analyze the call graph, a simplification of the all paths problem is proposed. In contrast with the all paths problem, the simplification is solvable in polynomial time. The approach involves finding the shortest path for every crossing edge on a graph cut.","Static analysis; Rust; Call graph; Graph analysis; Control Flow Analysis","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using this input, TAM is able to automatically create a schedule by assigning TAs to lab sessions. To provide an algorithm for the automatic generation of schedules, a model based on the minimumcost max flow problem is created. Due to complications with the implementation of the minimum-cost max flow model, the schedule generation is handled by a linear solver: Gurobi. By modeling the constrains for a schedule to be considered valid, Gurobi is used to process the input of the users into an optimized schedule.<br/><br/>TAM consists of three components: a MySQL database, a backend written using Spring, containing the business logic and the implementation of the scheduler, and a frontend website created with Vue to provide an interface to the users.

Furthermore, our project verified the existence of some previously known issues. In the future, when the software is run to verify all order logs of Optiver, the software will prove its value by either increasing the confidence that there is an absence of bugs in the RiskGuard and autotrading software of Optiver or by identifying breached limits, indicating a bug.","Data Analysis; Optimisation; Financial Algorithms","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Successive expansions of greenhouses and their typological and technological transformations have resulted in an unprecedented productive cluster that conditions both the spatial character and structure of Westland and its social dynamics. Shortages of high-skilled labor, international competition, and pressures to reduce production costs have prompted growers to invest in automated technologies and machinery. While mostly concealed inside greenhouses and overlooked by municipal visions, this project portrays how these technologies have spatial implications on the surrounding social and built environment, and on the future of work, that need to be addressed by designers in order to conduce the Westland to sustainable modes of urbanization. The project shifts from the socio-economic debate on automation to highlight the spatial implications of this phenomenon. In this regard, it documents emergent technologies and production processes in the horticulture productive cluster and depicts successive accretions in greenhouse sizes that are analogous to radical technological shifts and changes in production patterns. With the help of scenarios, the project formulated possible futures for Westland. An overall strategy consisted of shifting productive premises from one part of the cluster to another. Productive premises were merged with existing urban components to create mixed-use sustainable urban typologies afforded by automated technologies. The project culminated in a design for two pilot projects - Maasdijk and Honderland- and assumed automation as a platform that forced new spatial conditions. It engaged with the emergent phenomenon of automation to stir development in Westland and conduce the area to sustainable modes of urbanization.","Automation; Westland; Spatial implications; Horticultural cluster","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","51.99920, 4.21750"

The first is a housing program which is defined only at a superficial level. Secondly, the municipality has expressed the ambition to also take into account the migration of households, but has no data on which dwellings facilitate migrations the best. This research thus set out to first define the migrations chains which are found in Zoetermeer and then subsequently use this information in designing a suiting housing program.<br/><br/>The outcome of the Markov chain theory, which was used to determine residential migration chain length, showed that a number of dwellings facilitated migration the most. These were the more expensive dwellings in general and middle segment dwellings for households residing for social rental apartments specifically. Second, to construct the housing program, detailing on the living environments and dwelling models was defined and combined with ambition of the city.<br/><br/>Around this information an LP decision-making model was built which could use these constraints and find the optimal solution, if one existed. Ten different housing programs were designed, each with a different aim, and the results were assessed. Out of the ten programs, one seemed the most appropriate overall, as it achieved reasonable values in a number of important variables, including number of migrations, spread and value of newly added dwellings and area requirement. A surprising find was however that one of the programs, which in advance was seen as an extreme, proved to fit the ambitions of Zoetermeer in terms of increasing the city’s monetary value and attracting a new type of resident with new dwelling types.<br/><br/>Lastly, a program was designed with the aim of combining all benefits of the other programs into one. This program showed the results of the most overall appropriate program as well as adding a lot of value and the new types of dwellings. To conclude, this research found that the link between the two challenges could be made relatively easily and that the results of the model were very well received after even the first iteration. It should however be mentioned that the input of the model turned out to be very influential and that the municipality had difficulty in defining this input throughout this research as a shift in focus had recently occurred, which resulted in a change of thinking from quantitatively to qualitatively defining goals.<br/><br/>Finally, the two models designed proven to work for Zoetermeer, but were also designed to be used by any other party desiring to either determine migrations patterns, design a housing program or doing a combination of the two.","Household filtering; Residential migration chains; Decision-making models; Linear programming; Living environments; Zoetermeer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences","",""

Increasing availability of data and computational efficiency enables to assess flood hazard on a global scale. Implementation of salt marshes and mangroves as nature based flood defences has gained strong interest in the field of hydraulic engineering during the last decade, because these ecosystems can be an innovative, sustainable and cost-effective supplement to manmade traditional coastal protection measures. This thesis focuses on wave damping by salt marshes and mangroves and aims to map flood hazard reduction by foreshore vegetation on a global scale. <br/><br/>Wave attenuation by foreshore vegetation is accessed using transects which are aligned perpendicular to the Open Street Map (OSM) coastline. The study area contains in total 495361 transects, which have an intermediate distance of roughly 1 km and are individually assessed. The assessment of each transect involves construction of the foreshore profile, derivation of vegetation presence and the corresponding vegetation type, determination of the governing hydrodynamic conditions and computation of wave propagation over the foreshore. Wave damping by foreshore vegetation is determined by comparing the wave height at the end of the vegetated zone with a bare foreshore situation. The analysis is based on topobathymetric data from the Global Interidal Elevation map (20 – 30 m resolution, 1 m vertical accuracy) and a merged set of MERIT elevation data (3 arc-seconds resolution, 2 m vertical accuracy) and GEBCO bathymetry data (30 arc-seconds resolution, 10 m vertical accuracy). Vegetation presence is based on the VegGEE map (resolution 10 -30 m) and the cover type is based on the Salt marsh map, Mangroves, GlobCover or CLC. Wave characteristics are derived from ERA-Interim reanalysis and extreme levels from the Global Tide and Surge Model (GTSM). The nearshore wave height is based on a depth limited criterion and wave propagation over the derived foreshore is determined using a dataset of XBeach pre-runs. <br/><br/>The results of the global assessment show that 31% of the coastline in the study area (between the Arctic circle and -60 degrees South), is vegetated, of which more than half has a vegetation width that is larger than 100 m and 5% has a vegetation width exceeding 1000 m. Along 5% (15%) of the studied (vegetated) coastline is a significant wave height reduction observed of at least 30 centimetres. The performed global flood hazard reduction assessment is unique, as it uses global open source data to express quantitatively wave damping by salt marshes and mangroves on a global scale. The results show the effect of foreshore vegetation in terms of wave attenuation, reduced dike height and the potential social impact. Based on the performed analysis can be concluded that foreshore vegetation has a high potential to mitigate flood hazard at various areas around the globe.<br/><br/><br","Flood Mitigation; Building with Nature; Nature based; Foreshore vegetation; Salt marsh; Mangroves; Global assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-12-01","","","","","",""

However, for a lot of citizen initiatives, the current revenue-models and legal &amp; bureaucratic systems are not always suitable for the citizen initiatives. So, there is a mismatch between the government and its governance and the pursuit of citizen initiatives. Besides, governments are rather slow in adapting and utilizing certain platforms. So, local governments have to find ways to guide the organization through the process of necessary change in order to be able to stimulate citizen initiatives. However, there is a lack of usable mechanism and frameworks that give insight in and promote bottom-up collaboration and participation.

The received and demodulated pseudo-random codes are then correlated with multiple different peak detectors that will correlate with multiple different sets of the transmitted string of pseudo-random codes to gain a higher robustness for the estimated propagation times and a higher accuracy for these estimates. Results show that the the use of multiple different sets of transmitted codes indeed improves the propagation time estimation.

(mentor); Asut, S. (mentor); Jansen, K.M.B. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","In the EU, the heating and cooling of buildings consumes 14% of all energy. This is a major consumer for one type of activity, and it is compounded by the fact that 75% of it is sourced from fossil fuels. The thoughtful design of facades play a major role in the reduction of heating and cooling energy loads, and the reduction of both necessitates some form of adaptiveness between the cold season and the hot season.<br/>This thesis investigates a subset of adaptiveness called adaptronic. It has been defined as “the integration of actuators, sensors and controls with a material or structural component“, and it means that a device would be able to sense its surroundings and thoughtfully respond to it in a designed way, using the properties of its materials. Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) were investigated to achieve adaptronic architecture, with the idea of designing a courtyard atrium that is able to sense the temperature of the outside and thereby open up in hot weather. Such a seasonal atrium could in theory result in a 21-30% heating energy saving for houses in Amsterdam, due to the Greenhouse Effect in the winter.<br/>The aim of the thesis is therefore to investigate and design the adaptronic ability of an auto-responsive façade module, with regards to the structural and detailing aspects. Literature studies were carried out on the material behaviour and reference projects, which appreciated the complexity of the behaviour and the remoteness of the material towards designers with no specialist knowledge. A computational tool was produced in Grasshopper, a plug-in of Rhino 3D, to allow a designer with no specialist knowledge to track and predict the movement of an SMA structure as the temperature changes. The tool is now available online with a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence. <br/>Thereafter, a concept design was made followed by experiments and explorations with prototypes to produce and test an “engine” that could deliver the actuation for the adaptronic atrium. The prototype was able to successfully actuate a 61.3 degree rotation when electrically heated, and then return to the rest position when cooled. The prototype was also able to be actuated by the environment with the help of a constructed solar-heated chamber, under zero-stress conditions.<br/>A final design was made for an adaptronic façade module, composed of a custom-made adaptronic engine that is fitted onto a set of 4 standard pivot-window profiles to animate them. The engine features an environmentally powered heat chamber which provides a pattern of temperature to the SMA piece. The entire module is prefabricated, so that the required precision of the hardware can be attained. In a future study, the for saving HVAC loads as a result of the modules can be quantified and thereafter the design can be optimized.<br/>The thesis hopes to lay the foundation for both adaptronics and architecture animated by SMAs. Both show a promising future towards a smart-materials based adaptiveness for sustainable progress. <br","adaptive; Shape memory Alloy; adaptronic; computational; Facade; nitinol","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Building Technology","",""

Therefore, remote sensing is expected to provide valuable information on Antarctica, in order to monitor its mass balance and gain insights on the extent of climate change.<br/><br/>As one of the factors to the mass loss in Antarctica, subsurface melt can be critical yet hard to capture.

It is expected that by using this technique, the gap can be filled in when optical images are not available, or pure SAR images are not informative.

Therefore, the United Nation concluded with the Paris climate agreement to reduce and limit their emissions to keep the global average temperature increase below 2 degrees Celsius. Based on the agreement the European union introduced new regulations to limit the average fleet emission of car companies. In this push towards lowering emission the companies introduced their first generations of electric cars. To further improve the efficiency of the electric drive train new multilevel topologies were introduced. One of the topologies is called modular multilevel converter (MMC) introduced by R. Marquardt and A. Llesnicar in 2003. This new topology main advantage are its modularity and the option to use low voltage component. However, no company industrialized the MMC for drive train application. The reason therefore are the extensive control architecture, hardware and software wise. This thesis investigated possible ways to reduce the wiring and complexity by introducing a low level communication bus together with distributing the control to remove the centralized architecture. Therefore, the different possible low level communication bus were analysed and compared. The different bus protocols were compared based on speed and time to send the same amount of information to control a MMC. It was concluded that the serial peripheral interface bus (SPI) shows the highest capability for the proposed single phase 5 level converter set-up. Therefore, an experimental system was built to validate the performance. The system itself was designed with the goal to use low cost and low voltage component. The validation of the experimental set-up showed the stable operation of the system with an open loop control. Thereby it proofs the possibility to integrate and control the MMC with a low level communication bus. The results can be used as a baseline to further research on integrating theMMC and make it viable for drive train applications.","Modular multilevel converter; Communication; Drivetrain","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Voorendt, M.Z. (mentor); Schuurman, F. (mentor); Van Heereveld, M. (mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","Tidal basins are highly dynamic environments with a complex behavior that is often disturbed by human activities. Considering that tidal dynamics have a direct impact on surrounding engineering infrastructures, adjacent coastlines, nature environment and socio-economic human activities, it is crucial to know the impact of human interventions on these dynamics. This research focuses on the closure of the Gulf of Khambhat in India, which aims at the creation of a fresh water reservoir in the gulf by partly closing the current estuary with the Kalpasar dam. The most recent design of the closure concerns a 30 km dam from the eastern bank near Aladar to the western bank near Bhavnagar. This closure will significantly reduce the total basin area. Consequently, major and morphodynamic changes are expected in the basin. The Kalpasar project has been on the Indian Government's agenda since 1986. Royal HaskoningDHV was involved in the pre-feasibility study, which was presented in the late 1990s. Since then, the existence of a detailed report study has not been confirmed and the status of the announced feasibility studies by the Indian government is unknown. The main objective of this research is to investigate the morphodynamic response at the seaward side of the dam after the closure. A process-based morphodynamic model has been developed to study this response. Deltares and NIOT have provided a two-dimensional (2DH) numerical model of the Gulf of Khambhat to study the tidal propagation in the basin. After calibration and validation of the hydrodynamic predictions, the model has been extended to a morphodynamic model in order to perform morphological calculations. Several adaptations have been made to improve the hydrodynamic simulations of the model; the main contributing factor was the new initial bathymetry. An extensive spin-up simulation has been performed to gather this. To deal with introduced model artefacts, the model results are compared to the reference case. Therefore, two almost identical simulations are performed: the only difference is that one run contains the Kalpasar dam while the other does not. This way, the relative effect of the dam is determined. Moreover, the morphological results have to be interpreted qualitatively, since the predictive skill of the model has not yet been determined. Model results show an overall increase of the tidal range in the basin after the closure, which will have effect up to 100 km from the dam. Close to the dam, the range will initially increase from 7.88 to 10.25 m, and up to 10.50 m after 96 years. Besides, the tidal signal switches from being ebb-dominant to flood-dominant. The velocities around the dam become negligible and the velocities at the main western channel significantly decrease. The eastern channel remains the main channel of the gulf, although its maximum flood- and ebb-velocities also decrease. As a consequence of the hydrodynamic changes, the basin will start importing sediment, directly becoming a sink. On the long term, the area up to 40 km southward of the dam partly fills in. The eastern side of the main channel will also accrete, although its western side will erode over the years. The implementation of the dam will have negative impacts on several locations at the study area. Four vulnerable locations are identified, namely Dahej (India's largest LNG-terminal), Hazira (container terminal), Surat (&gt; 6 million inhabitants) and Alang (largest ship wrecking worldwide). All of these locations will become prone to flooding because of the increased maximum water levels. Moreover, sedimentation at the approach channels of the ports of Dahej and Hazira may hinder their accessibility. The increased water levels at Alang may lead to the suspension of heavily contaminated sediments from these beaches. Furthermore, coastal erosion might be a problem for the entire study area, if the ebb-tidal delta is not large enough to balance the sand hunger of the basin. Relocating the dam is not an effective measure to prevent the negative impacts. Maintenance dredging activities will probably be required to maintain the accessibility of the ports. Moreover, major infrastructural changes will be needed to prevent floods. It is recommended to execute follow up studies with more detailed tools to determine the exact response at these locations. More accurate and up-to-date hydraulic and bathymetric data is required to develop these tools. To this end, it is highly recommended to partner with local parties like the Government of Gujarat, the EAG and local universities.","Morphodynamics; Delft3D; ebb-tidal delta; Gulf of Khambhat; Coastal morphology; Closure; dam; Tidal basin; Human interventions; Gujarat","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering | Hydraulic Engineering","Kalpasar Project, Royal HaskoningDHV","20.682041, 72.178834"

We propose a new method, that can work with a reflective object of any shape and that requires minimal work from the user. After a suitable reference pattern is generated, the user can give a picture of both the reflective object and the pattern along with a picture of the reflection of the anamorphosis as input and the output is the corresponding anamorphosis. The results show that the method creates accurate catoptric anamorphoses for most differently shaped reflective objects.

This research introduces a two level hierarchical model: it deals with complexity at the system level and with repairable, deteriorating assets at the component level. At the component level the asset manager has to select between a condition based or failure event based model. A flowchart supports the decision making process for this choice.

The aim of this redevelopment proposal is to strengthen the (architectural) characteristics of the existing 1950’s buildings and to reintroduce this part of the city again as an urban node and gateway to the city.","Zutphen; Nieuwstad; Heritage; Heritage & Architecture; Baudartius; post-war; visual; arts; revitalization; redevelopment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Heritage & Architecture","",""

The client for this project was Relive, a company that has a tracker for outdoor activities with a focus on the experience of the activity. They wanted a route recommendation engine for their users, in particular users that are unfamiliar with the area. The specific task from Relive was to use the Relive database to find popular, dissimilar routes to recommend within an area, and then find context for those recommended routes. The first attempt to find these routes was using a heatmap to see which routes were popular, and then clustering routes to find dissimilar routes to recommend. This had some problems with unwanted biases towards cities, so the second attempt switched it around by first clustering on general area to make sure recommendations are dissimilar, and then using clustering and finding big clusters to see which routes are popular. This last approach worked decently: it can recommend 73% of the expected routes. One of the key problems for now is the long waiting times. There were two kinds of context that were considered: keywords and photos. Keywords can be extracted by processing titles from nearby routes with significant search. Photos are added to routes by the users but may not be relevant as context. Examples of such useless photos are selfies, which also bring privacy concerns. Due to time constraints, giving context was not integrated into the final product. The final product is a web application client and a server for that client. The users interact with the web application, and the recommendation algorithm is run on the server.","Route planning; Recommendation; Relive; Relivecc","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Computer Science","",""

They also have several limitations in combining real-time data with historical data and doing aggregations on streams from multiple sources. The developed product is a plug-in framework on top of Apache Flink, that provides a pipelining system for streaming queries. This product includes abstractions for well-known sources like GitHub, TravisCI and Twitter as well as support for historical data in mongoDB.

The equalizer, which is the inverse of the linear model of the loudspeaker, is used to compensate for the linear distortion. The PI controller with negative feedback is used to suppress the non-linear distortion. Not all measurement results are available at the moment of submission of this thesis.

In Europe, railway stations were originally placed at urban periphery. Step by step, as the urban dense core area expands outwards, the railway station areas were pulled in and now absorbed by the urban fabric. Because of large-scale and special facility form, Railway surrounding Area (RSA) always acts as a boundary breaking urban in pieces. The physical fragment and even social segregation lead to compromises in both urban operations and quality of urban environment. At the same time, ongoing trends of train station area redevelopment and ambition of tripling the current network (White Paper of Transport, EU) further exacerbate the seriousness of this problem. It is time to rethink our city's relationship with the Railway Surrounding Area (RSA). Can we solve those existing problems? Can we attach new meanings to a station and its facilities? Can we improve the pedestrian-friendly and livability around RSA for meeting the request for redevelopment? The Netherlands offers a valuable model- Since 1998, 6 major railway stations have started to be redeveloped. These projects which not only the stations are transformed, but also their connecting surroundings. A railway station and its surrounding were seen as one entirety to be designed. Whereas in China, The rapid development of high-speed railway is not only facing the request of technological updates and urban development in the city center, also are acting as a driving force to promote the new town growth in the rural area. In last 30 years, more than 800 stations were built up, new or upgraded. Even though China is the biggest railway construction site right now. But due to this very early stage of HSR and urban development in China, the impact is still blurred. The methods I adopted in this research is that by clarifying the multiple barrier elements and collecting the current design patterns, I can build up an interpret that how Dutch projects perceive and design connectivity issue in RSA. Then, based on the different context, the application of Dutch experience to China could be explored. The results obtained in this research include Barrier Elements Clarifying, Dutch experience summary and Application Design in Shanghai Station area. Hopefully, this research could contribute to solving the current physical fragment and social segregation problems around railway surrounding area, and also offer new thinking for railway area redevelopment, both theoretically and practically.","Railway Station Area; Connectivity; Barrier effect; Dutch approaches; Shanghai","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Architecture, Urbanism and Building Sciences | Design of the Urban Fabric","",""

The so-called Actively Heated Fiber-Optic (AHFO) technique, however, has the potential to provide high-resolution distributed observations, allowing for better understanding of different processes. However, before it can be widely used, its performance needs to be tested in a range of settings. Therefore, in this work, experimental results on this novel observational wind-probing technique are presented. We utilized a controlled wind-tunnel setup to assess both the accuracy and the precision of AHFO as well as its potential for outdoor atmospheric operation. The technique allows for wind speed characterization with a spatial resolution of 0.3 m on a 1 s time scale. The flow in the wind tunnel is varied in a controlled manner, such that the mean wind, ranges between 1 and 17 m/s. Comparison of the AHFO measurements with observations from a sonic anemometer shows a high overall correlation, ranging from 0.94-0.99. Also, both precision and accuracy are greater than 95 %. As such, it is concluded that the AHFO has potential to be employed as an outdoor observational technique in addition to existing techniques. In particular, it allows for characterization of spatial varying fields of mean wind in complex terrain, such as in canopy flows or in sloping terrain. In the future the technique could be combined with regular Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) for turbulent heat flux estimation in micrometeorological/hydrological applications.","AHFO; DTS; wind; speed; tunnel; distributed","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-07-02","","","","","",""

(graduation committee); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2018","In almost every device cryptographic functions are used to protect data and sensitive information from being intercepted. A commonly used encryption algorithm is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which is a symmetric block cypher. Side-channel attacks against AES are well known and are often performed either directly on the surface of the integrated circuit or by attaching wires to the target device. These attacks are more difficult for devices with tamper protection, which can detect such an attack because the device enclosure must be removed. This limits the attack possibilities of these side-channel attacks for these real-world applications. Attacks using electromagnetic radiation from a further distance, called the far-field, can be used to prevent opening the enclosure.<br/><br/>For these power based side-channel attacks against AES, power traces must be recorded with the exact timing before an encryption or decryption starts. This is used to align the recorded traces and perform statistical analysis to extract the secret key. In order to achieve this often an GPIO trigger is used to indicate the start of a new trace. When such an GPIO trigger is not available a smart trigger can be used, which uses a pattern to generate a trigger based on the measured power. This removes the need for making a connection with the target device.<br/><br/>In this thesis an approach for performing non-invasive far-field side-channel attacks against multiple target devices is evaluated. For this approach near-field analysis is performed to analyse the target leakage, with the use of Test Vector Leakage Assessment. Then for each of these targets far-field side-channel attacks are attempted using a Software Defined Radio set-up and several smart triggers are tested in real-world scenarios. The results of these attacks showed that far-field side-channel attacks without an artificial trigger are possible, and thus the enclosure of the target device can stay in tact and non-invasive attacks can be performed. For the Microsemi SF2 Basic development kit attacks up to a distance of 15 cm can be achieved in an office environment. This means that far-field side-channel attacks against AES are possible in real world applications, and when designing cryptographic devices precautions must be made to protect against these attacks.","Side-Channel Attacks; AES; Electromagnetic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Within a wide range of patients, pressure ulcers occur, often accompanied by severe pain.<br/>This is resulting in a prolonged hospital stay. The company Momo Medical is developing a sensor plate<br/>with the goal of preventing pressure ulcers by using sensor data attained from the patient laying on<br/>his bed to guide the nurses, whom are responsible for re-positioning the patients. The sensor plate<br/>is placed between the mattress and the frame and has eight force-sensing resistors (FSRs) and two<br/>piezoelectric sensors to detect the static and dynamic behaviour of the patient. This data is processed<br/>by an algorithm to detect a patient on the bed, the position of the patient, and how long the patient<br/>has remained in the same position. At the moment the sensors are not reliable enough to detect the<br/>position of a patient on the bed yet.<br/>This bachelor graduation project focuses on the goal to improve the reliability of the sensors. The<br/>group has been divided into three subgroups, where this thesis focuses on the improvement of the<br/>reliability of the FSRs in the sensor plate.<br/>First a state-of-the-art analysis was conducted to get a deep understanding of pressure ulcers, the<br/>existing ways to prevent them, different sensors to measure pressure, the operation of a FSRs, and<br/>lastly different ways to calibrate such a sensor.<br/>Then a set of quick measurement on the sensors in the plate were done to get get an overview<br/>of the current system and it’s cause of the unreliability. The biggest aspects were drift, hysteresis and<br/>repeatablility. After that it was a clear that a reliable setup was essential and was therefore developed by<br/>the use of a strain gauge load cell as a reference and a stepper motor for time efficiency. Both the output<br/>of the strain gauge and the FSR needed to be amplified and converted by an ADC to retrieve a digital<br/>output. The readout of the FSR, load cell and the control of the stepper motor were all programmed<br/>and controlled on a Nucleo F103RB micro-controller. Then measurements were conducted on the<br/>sensors, and the errors where visualised. Then first-order and third-order polynomial approximations<br/>of the sensor output were used as calibration and it was resulting in a major reduction in errors.<br/>Lastly this thesis consists of a recommendation and future work since the calibration setup was a<br/>prototype and is a foundation for a setup in production but needs to be expanded to be able to handle<br/>eight FSRs at the same time. Also duration tests need to be conducted to retrieve knowledge when<br/>a sensor plate needs to be re-calibrated. Besides that the domes should be changed to avoid shear<br/>forces, since this a big cause of the error in the FSRs in this application.","pressure ulcer; FSR; force sensing resistor; calibration; setup; decubitus","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2023-08-01","","","","Electrical Engineering","",""

Information plays a crucial role in MASs:<br/>in centralized approaches, a central node utilizes global information to achieve synchronization,<br/>while in distributed approach agents only utilize local information, i.e. neighbors’<br/>information. A big concern in MASs is the presence of parametric uncertainties<br/>(unknown dynamics), which might require adaptive control gains instead of fixed control<br/>gains.<br/><br/>This work thus provides a novel adaptive distributed control for MASs of heterogeneous<br/>agents with unknown dynamics based on model reference adaptive control (MRAC).<br/>We study both the synchronization of linear systems and the synchronization of Euler-<br/>Lagrange (EL) systems. The implementation of this scheme is based on distributed<br/>matching condition assumptions. We study such matching conditions both for the statefeedback<br/>case and output-feedback case. Since all matching gains are unknown in view<br/>of the unknown dynamics, the gains are adapted online via Lyapunov-based estimation.<br/>The asymptotic convergence of the synchronization error is analytically proven<br/>by introducing an appropriately defined Lyapunov function, and numerical examples<br/>show the effectiveness of the approach. The practical advantage of the proposed distributed<br/>MRAC is the possibility of handling unknown dynamics by simply exchanging<br/>the states/output, and inputs with neighbors, without any extra auxiliary variables (distributed<br/>observer) nor sliding mode. Because of the mutual dependence of control inputs,<br/>well-posedness problems will arise in the presence of cyclic communication, if the inputs<br/>are generated without a prescribed priority. In this work, we study such well-posedness<br/>problems via parameter projection methods.","Adaptive control; Uncertain Heterogeneous Agent; Multi-Agent systems; Euler-Lagrange Systems; platooning strategy; UAV; Synchronization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering | Embedded Systems","",""
