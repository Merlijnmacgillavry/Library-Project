(mentor); Verbree, E. (mentor); Dias, E.S. (mentor)","2007","he increasing availability of digital camera devices and camera phones enable users to capture and upload digital photos at any a time and any place. Online image collections face the problem organizing increasing photo collections. Because users experience adding qualitative photo annotations as a time-consuming and tedious task, they omit to do it. However, good photo annotation is very important for fast and reliable photo retrieval. The integration of positioning devices (e.g. GPS) with digital camera enables to capture position along with the photo and this location metadata has been applied in previous research to automatically caption digital photos. The disadvantage of describing a photo using location metadata only is that it only enables to add information about its surrounding and not about the actual objects pictured. This research carried out in the framework of the EU research project Tripod assumes in the near future camera devices integrated with GPS and digital compass will be available. Using this full spatial metadata, it is possible to exactly identify and localize objects inside the pictured scene. Digital photos with 3D position and view direction are collected on the Market Square in Delft (The Netherlands) using a Topcon imaging total station and Nikon D100 camera mounted with digital 3-axis compass and GPS to carry out a proof-of-concept. Using the output of a perspective viewer service, a tool that renders an three-dimensional model, a virtual abstraction that matches the digital photo is created to be able to identify and localize visible objects in order to place a label next to it. The three-dimensional models applied for this research are created from conventional GIS datasets (e.g. TOP10NL and GBKN) and a digital elevation model (AHN) by extruding the building footprints. The best possible for a label is defined at the empty areas and constraints and rules are added to ESRI ArcGIS label Engine Maplex to carry out the label placement inside the digital photo in a GIS environment. Misidentification and misplacement due to lens distortions, and GPS and compass inaccuracies are evaluated. A demo-application is developed in ESRI ArcGIS using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) programming and system architecture is proposed for implementation of a photo labelling service. It is concluded that the virtual scenes as output of perspective viewer services are appropriate to apply for object identification and localization. In doing so, the problem of label placement in three-dimensional geographic environments is reduced to a two-dimensional map-labelling problem. The best location of label placement is determined using constraints and rules to be applied to the virtual scene and the reclassified-to-binary image of the input photo, and the depth map enables to vary in label font size depending on the object distance.","photo annotation; label placement; object identification; extrusion models; geographic information systems","en","master thesis","TU Delft, OTB, Geo-Database Management Center","","","","","","","","OTB Research Institute for the Built Environment","GIS technology","","GIMA","",""

A shallow sill at the north end of Admirality Inlet separates Puget Sound from the strait of Juan de Fuca. To better understand Puget Sound and the changes the region undergoes, it is necessary to be able to predict the impact of environmental change such as the effects of sea level rise or changed river-runoff. When aiming at predicting these effects a large scale numerical model covering the entire Puget Sound is imperative. The aim of this research is to gain more insight into the effects of changes in timing and amount of freshwater input on circulation, stratification and mixing in Puget Sound. For this research a new numerical model of Puget Sound is created with Delft3D. The model is built from scratch, involving grid schematization, model validation, etcetera. The analysis of the results focuses on three main aspects: salinity distribution, residual flow patterns for one month (covering a spring and a neap tide) and for the assessment of the research question and the hypotheses the analysis of longitudinal and cross sections, as well as observation points along the axis of the main channel. In a period of approximately one month the effects of changing river discharge can clearly be seen in the salinity of Puget Sound. The effects of changes in amount of fresh water input in the sensitivity study are most clearly noticeable in the case of a strong increase of fresh water input. Stronger stratification will occur with higher fresh water discharge, causing less vertical circulation. The scenarios with seasonal variation enforce changes of -21% for drier seasons and 25% for wetter seasons. Although the effects are noticeable in this study as fast as in the sensitivity study (approximately one month to take full effect), the effects are much smaller. This hardly causes any difference in vertical salinity distribution, nor does it cause any significant (new) stratification or alterations in vertical circulation patterns.","Puget Sound; circulation; Delft3d; salinity; river run-off","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

In current practise the complex material behaviour is simplified due to the uncertainties that exist around the material behaviour. Testing and modelling the membrane material may provide a more accurate tool for structural analysis. Research has been performed on PTFE coated fibreglass, a widely used architectural textile. Non-linear material properties have been identified as well as other material characteristics. Different aspects of bi-axial fabric testing have been researched. A bi-axial test protocol must provide accurate measurements that will provide insight in the non-linear stress-strain relation of PTFE coated fibreglass. Various bi-axial tests have been performed in the Stevin Lab at the Faculty of Civil Engineering, Delft University of Technology. Accurate displacements measuring devices have been designed and created to record the strains of the fabric. These tests supplied insight in the non linear material properties. Bi axial tests at preset stress ratios have been performed on six identical cruciform test samples of PTFE coated fiber glass (Verseidag B18089). Various approaches have been made to model the fabricâ€™s stress-strain behaviour. Modelling the stress strain relation by creating a best fit surface through the experimental data did not result in a useable model. A different approach where the nonlinear stress strain relation is linearized and where Hooks law was applied did not result in an accurate model. The best results were obtained by a non linear model based on the fibresâ€™ geometry. This model showed good resemblance with the experimental data. The model is calibrated by three parameters, fibre diameter, fibre spacing and Young Modulus of the fibres. The material model is programmed in FORTRAN language and is linked to the general purpose finite element software Ansys. Several test cases have been analysed, based on the material model. It appears that non linear geometric behaviour combined with non linear material behaviour demands an accurate description of the Jacobian matrix for convergence purposes. The performance of the model is not yet at the level of industrial application. Calculation times exceed the reasonable for desktop application. Various recommendations have been made in order to improve the modelâ€™s performance. Additional tests on other fabric qualities may contribute to the applicability of the model. These tests must turn out whether the model can easily be adapted to other fabric qualities.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","","",""

The objective of the present study is to programme a reliable MathCADTM code based on the Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) to calculate the induced rolling moment on an aircraft during wake vortex encounters (WVEs).

(mentor); Simons, W.J.F. (mentor)","2007","The SUBDUCT (Surface Behavior and Dynamical Units of the Southeast Carpathians Tectonics) research program, in which the TU Delft participates, aims to model the surface kinematics of a 350 x 350 km wide area around the Vrancea seismic region in Romania by means of GPS observations. The goal of the project is to relate surface motions to the active crust-lithosphere dynamics of the southeast Carpathians. The main objective is to model the surface expressions of the subducted slab at 70 to 200 km depth, which is the common origin of earthquakes in the Vrancea region. Since 1995 GPS field campaigns have been performed by various research groups, and since 2002 in the framework of the subduct research program that increased the number of episodical observed sites to more than 50 and maintains 7 continuously observing permanent stations in the region. This master thesis focusses on the precise processing with the JPL GIPSY software of the GPS data from permanent and campaign stations in Romania from the years 2004 to 2006 and the combination of these newly processed solutions with previous obtained results from the period 1995 to 2003. From the total set of available solutions linear site velocities have been estimated and a complete velocity field for the entire observed region has been produced for the horizontal surface motions as well as the vertical motions. The GPS data showed to be of high quality, resulting in daily repeatabilities for campaign and permanent stations in the order of 1-2 mm for the north and east and 3-7 mm for the vertical position component. However due to the use of different antennas in subsequent observation considerable vertical position offsets were introduced for all campaign stations, which limit the reliability of the constructed vertical velocities. The most reliable estimated horizontal velocities are for the region in the order of 1-2 mm/yr with respect to the stable Eurasian plate, indicating only small relative motions in Romania. The 95% confidence limit for the sites with the longest observation history is around 0.5-2 mm/yr. The total figure of the combined horizontal site velocities shows for most areas stable and regional uniform motions. Even though the vertical site velocities are unreliable in quantitative terms, the complete vertical velocity field shows in a qualitative sense nonetheless uniform subduction and uplifting zones. Most notably is the uniformly uplifting zone north of the Trotus fauls and the subsidence in the Moesian Platform and Transilvanian Basin. After previous preliminary DEOS publications, this thesis presents a first reliable qualitative vertical velocity field of the region that can be used for geophysical interpretation.","gipsy; gps; Vrancea; tectonics; Romania","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Aerospace Engineering, Astrodynamics and Satellite Systems","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""

(mentor); Fraaij, A. (mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor)","2007","This thesis shows a set of equations that define the micro-stability and macro-stability of reinforced grass revetments with geosynthetics on inner dike slope during an overtopping event. At micro-stability level, it has been analyzed that the equilibrium in a soil particle using the criterion of incipient motion of soil particle. The forces in normal direction to water flow are considered the most important to keep in equilibrium the soil particles of the reinforced grass revetment. As unstable forces are considered: Lift force, this force can be defined in function of depth-averaged relative turbulence intensity and averaged-velocity (Hoffmansâ€™ Model, 2006). Likewise, the averaged-velocity can be defined in function of concentration factor of stems, bent vegetation height and vegetation height (Carolloâ€™s Model, 2005). As stable forces are taken account: Friction force due to cohesion stress, the cohesion forces produced by root and geosynthetic in the soil are assumed in the same direction of the water flow and they cause a frictional forces in the normal direction of water flow when the particle tend to detach. Also, gravity force, as it is referred to submerged weight of soil particle. The stability equation of a soil particle of reinforced grass revetment is deduced from the application of the equilibrium between these forces; it means unstable forces must be equal or less than stable forces. At macro-stability level, it has been analyzed the acting forces on reinforced grass revetment during an overtopping event has been applied to the equilibrium in the system. The diagram of free body of reinforced grass revetment is divided in two wedges and identified like active and passive wedges (Koernerâ€™s model 1991). The wedge located at top of the slope exerts an active function in the system that means it tends to push away the soil of the revetment so that is in the toe of the slope. The other wedge located at toe exerts a passive function that consist to hold the active wedge giving equilibrium to the system. The forces taken account in the diagram of free body of both wedges are: the weight of the soil, the shear force of the water, the cohesion forces produced by cohesive soil, roots and geosynthetics, reactive forces located in the failure plane and pressure forces between the passive and active wedges. To define the stability of the system, the safety factor is introduced in the friction angles of different soils and soil-geosyntethic besides in the cohesion produced by root and geosynthetics. The polygon method is applied in the forces acting on each wedge and it is deduced in a quadratic equation in function of safety factor. A safety factor higher than one defines a stable system. The geosynthetic analyzed are the geogrid and geocell. Unlike geogrid for the geocell an additional force is considered and this is the shear force which is generated in the contact between geocell wall and soil and it is in normal direction of the surface. This additional force is independent of the geocell tension; it means the geocell does not need to be in tension to help the stability of the system. In the case of geogrid could not be affirm the same. With much analysis of micro-stability as macro-stability of the system, the cohesive forces produced by roots and geosynthetics are important. In this thesis is described in brief mathematical models, based on equationâ€™s coulomb, which defined these cohesions. The cohesion produced by root in the soil is calculated using the simple root perpendicular model (Model of Wu et al, 1979). The additional cohesion produced by the geosynthetic uses the model of Jewell, 1980, to be calculated. Both cohesion models are based on the tension stress of the root or geosynthetic located inside of the soil layer produce shear stress in this layer. The shear stress could be in any plane but it is used the failure plane. This shear stress in the failure plane is composed of two components, one of the component is the projection of tension stress in the failure plane and the other is the friction stress produced by the normal component to the failure plane of tension. The tension of roots and geosynthetics are important in both cohesion models. The tension of root is easily to obtain from laboratory.","grass; overtopping; dikes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

This report handles the erosion problems on the main tourist resort of Cuba, Varadero, situated on the Peninsula de Hicacos. With a length of 22 km, a maximum width of 500 m, The Peninsula de Hicacos constitutes a natural barrier separating the shallow waters of Cardenas Bay from the Florida Strait (Figure 1-3). Measurements in the past decades have indicated a local coastal regression of 1.2 mjyear on this peninsula, endangering future tourist activity and structures on the beach. The main objectives of this research are to make an analysis of the erosion and to find a way to protect the Peninsula de Hicacos from future structural erosion. First, extensive research to the history and characteristics of the peninsula is done, provid ing information on i.e. former research, bathymetry and sand characteristics. After that, possible causes for the erosion problems on the whole peninsula are identified. Identified possible causes are longshore transport gradients, sediment transportation by wind, reduction of the input of sand by the Algae Halimeda, global sea level rise and sand mining in the past. To investigate the possible causes on its' significance, they are quantified . The longshore transport is quantified by using a software model called : UNIBEST, which was used after computations by hand with the formulas of BIJKER, CERC and QUEENS to verify the model and to get insight in the matter. The mean longshore sediment transport capacity found along the coast was about 100,OOOm3 per year (varying between 89,000 and 134,000 m3 per year along the coast). Wind causes about 175,000 m3 of sand of the peninsula to move landward per year (using CRESS), but as it is not clear how much sand is trapped in the dunes no estimation can be done about the amount of sediment that is lost by wind transport. The input of sediment by the Algae Halimeda is neglected in this research as no sensible estimation can be given, and neglecting is the most conservative approach. Global sea level rise causes a coastal regression of 0.132 m/year, resulting in a loss of sand of 11,500 m3 of the peninsula per year. Sand mining in the past could have influenced the erosion problems, but as it is almost 30 years ago, it does not cause extra erosion nowadays.","Cuba; artificial beach nourishment; coastal protection","en","student report","TU Delft, Section Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""
