(mentor); den Uijl, J.A. (mentor); Scarpas, A. (mentor); Houben, L.J.M. (mentor)","2005","Objective of the thesis is the study of the influence of the connection characteristics on the seismic performance of precast concrete structures. To that end a six storey high building with moment resisting frame was analyzed and designed. The precast concrete building consists of 3x6m span frames at 7.8m centre-to-centre in the transverse direction and 7x7.8m span frames in the longitudinal direction. A 350mm floor spans in the longitudinal direction. The capacity design method is applied in all the solutions; the concrete structure is verified according to EC8. The principle of weak beam strong column connection is applied. The bending moment in the column beam connections is calculated through the analysis model considering the stiffness of the connected members. The distribution of the seismic loading on the columns is influenced by the connected beams strength. Capacity design accounts for the connected members strength and its interaction influence during seismic loading. The required seismic design strength in the columns is verified against the action of the connected beams due to seismic loading in a direction and its reversal action. It is a function of the connected members bending moment strength with an overstrength factor and the seismic bending moment proportion to its bending moment resistance, which accounts for a seismic magnification factor. In the design with monolithic and HFC connections the strength reduction and the over strength factors are applied in the design of the shear in the beams and the columns and the flexural design of the columns, while in the design with DDC and the posttension assemblage, the capacity design principles are applied considering those factors within the design criterias. In the design of the connections the main aspects as yield locations, drift, ductility and degradation is considered with a specific solution for each type of connection. The emulated R/C connection is composed of cast in place elements on the column top. Hybrid-fibre concrete connection composed of precast elements connected on the column top and connected with interior precast concrete B55 beams The two connection types provides continuity in the stiffness, stresses, and shear. The yielding is relocated from the column faces in the beams where the ductility is provided. The required high shear resistance at the column faces is designed with conventional diagonal shear. In the design with HFC additional reinforcement in the connection core is applied in order to get a stiff and strong connection while the reduction in the reinforcement at the yield locations is used to get use of its high ductility. The Ductile Dywidag connection and the hybrid posttension connection are attached to the columns with ductile bars passing inside the column core and with posttension tendons passing inside PVC through the column. By posttension assemblage mild reinforcing provides energy dissipation during a seismic event is placed at the top and bottom of the beam through the joint and is grouted in place. The design with monolithic connections is verified using the non-linear analysis program Ruaumoko using two records scaled to the design shear force of Ag = 0.24g. Both design results are verified for degradation, using Takeda degrading and plastic hinges at the column bases. The design results in available ductility in the beams greater than the ductility resulting from the non-linear analysis. The design with the modified stiffness resulted in improved moment curvature hysteresis behaviour in the column beam connection.","earthquake; precast concrete; performance connection design; hpc","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Buildingg Technology","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor); Muttray, M. (mentor); Groenewegen, R. (mentor); Vrijling, J.K. (mentor); Meek, J. (mentor)","2005","This document focuses on the weather downtime in the offloading cycle of a generic LNG Floating Storage and Regasification Unit (FSRU). Results from these weather downtime assessments are essential for site concept selection and design of FSRU's, and are also used as input for logistics simulating the total gas supply chain. The FSRU is an unproven concept as none yet exists and so far Shell has not designed one in detail. Therefore, the analytical knowledge of and operational insight in operating limits with respect to the FSRU side-by-side offloading cycle is not available. This leads to difficulties in determining downtime and its most sensitive factors. Objective The objective of this project is therefore twofold:  To determine the most sensitive operating limit that causes weather downtime  To create a tool that can assess weather downtime of an FSRU The study focused on a near shore import terminal that is weathervaning around a turret and is supplied by LNG Carriers (LNGC's) with a capacity of approximately 135,000 m3 and offloading the LNG in a side-by-side mooring configuration. The duration of this offloading cycle is 25 hours. These are general characteristics and figures practical in today's industry. Methodology In order to achieve this goal, three building blocks were designed and implemented:  Operating limits of the typical operations in an offloading cycle of the FSRU  A downtime calculation tool  A model that calculates the heading direction of the FSRU As an FSRU has never been built before, root criteria and operating limits could not be derived from historical data, and thus had to be derived from other (concept) projects, literature, guidelines and operational experience on comparable operations like lightering and conventional LNG operations. The downtime model designed for this study has been based on the Downtime Assessment Tool of DMC: this tool calculates downtime based upon the availability of suitable weather windows to perform an offloading cycle. Fleet logistics or other causes of downtime are not included in the model. The model considers a continuous time trace of hindcast environmental data. An essential component of the downtime tool is the rotation model, which has been designed to calculate the heading direction of the FSRU, resulting in the relative angles of incidence of the environmental forces. This model takes into account the transverse forces and yaw moments based on empirical approximation equations of forces on vessels and LNG Carriers, taken from the guidelines of the Oil Companies International Marine Forum (OCIMF). To find the most sensitive operating limit, each operating limit was varied by ±20% for three locations during downtime assessments performed with the FSRU downtime tool. These locations are:  Gulf of Mexico (US)  Hazira (India)  Long Island Sound (US) These locations have also been compared to each other. Comparisons and conclusions with respect to the most sensitive operating limit have been based on two characteristics of operability that emerged from the tool:  Theoretical average uptime, which is the number of calculated potentially available offloading slots divided by the maximum number of theoretically offloading slots (350 sots for a 25h offloading period). This gives an estimate of the theoretical annual throughput.  Waiting time distribution, which can be used to present an indication of the required storage capacity by using the waiting time that has a probability of exceedence of 1%.","LNG terminal; offshore transshipment; downtime","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-03-01","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Everts, H.J. (mentor); Schippers, R.J. (mentor); Bakker, K.J. (mentor)","2005","Veel gebieden in Nederland worden omringd door dijken ter bescherming tegen het water. De dijken moeten voldoende veiligheid bieden tegen overstromen, alleen door klimaatveranderingen met een stijging van de zeespiegel als gevolg en door het klinken van de dijken, neemt de veiligheid af. Wanneer de stabiliteit van een dijk niet voldoende is, kan de dijk bezwijken. Het belangrijkste mechanisme dat voor instabiliteit van de dijk kan zorgen en kan leiden tot het bezwijken van de dijk, is het afschuiven van een deel van het binnentalud. Wanneer dijken instabiel dreigen te raken, worden ze verstevigd. De traditionele methode die hiervoor wordt toegepast, het ophogen en verbreden van de dijk, loopt echter tegen beperkingen aan. De ruimte die nodig is voor het verbreden is vaak niet beschikbaar doordat er bebouwing langs de dijk staat of het beleid om ruimte aan de rivier te geven geen beperking van het afvoerprofiel toestaat. Om het versterken van de dijken toch mogelijk te maken, worden innovatieve methoden ontwikkeld. Eén van deze methoden is het toepassen van vernageling. Vernagelen is een methode om grond te verstevigen, waarbij er trekelementen in het grondlichaam worden aangebracht, voorzien van een groutomhulling (nagels). Bij het verstevigen van een talud zullen zij zorgen voor een grotere weerstand tegen het afschuiven van een deel van het talud, wat een hogere stabiliteit als gevolg heeft.","","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geotechnology","","Geo-engineering","",""
