(mentor); Janssen, M. (mentor); Bennett, I. (mentor)","2008","The most advanced production lines for H-pattern poly-crystalline solar cells use wafers of less than 200 micron thickness. The reason for this development is the cost reduction that can be achieved by reducing the amount of silicon required. Unfortunately, the cells produced from thinner wafers suffer from bowing. The extent of bowing and the delicacy of the cells are problems for the building of modules from cells thinner than 200 micron. In this report the origin and extent of bowing is examined for wafers and cells of different thicknesses, by analysis at several stages in the production cycle. Not only the production of the cells is taken into account. A functioning solar panel requires cells that will have a good performance for 20 years. To realise such long lifetimes, the damage induced by the production process should be minimal. In several steps of the production, stress and possible damage is introduced. The presence of surface cracks at several stages was examined by microscopy for this purpose. The presence of microcracks in soldered solar cells was studied using acoustic emission monitoring. Four point bending experiments of cells taken from different stages of the production process were also monitored by acoustic emission. Surface cracks have not been observed and the presence of microcracks after soldering could not be confirmed in this research, although acoustic emission. measurements imply the possibility of their propagation or initiation during soldering. Losses in the production process did not occur during the soldering of the cells, but in production steps preceding soldering. The research shows that the bowing is caused primarily by the addition and more specifically the thermal contraction of the aluminium underside of the solar cells. Bowing increases as the thickness of the cell decreases and the experimental fracture strength of the cells and wafers reduces as the thickness reduces. The weakest area of the solar cells appears to be the transition between aluminium and silver on the rear of the cell. This work reports on a preliminary research study, which will be followed-up by a more detailed graduate study. ECN is currently working on poly-crystalline cells with an open underside. These cells, even thinner ones, should have a higher fracture stress, than those with an aluminium layer.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Materials Science and Engineering","","Joining and Mechanical Behaviour","",""

The TriAngle Tower has a total area of 40.000 square meters and a maximum height of 144 meters. Therefore it will become the highest building of the Plaspoelpolder and an important landmark. This master thesis is divided into three subjects: Problem definition 1. the constructive analysis: The TriAngle Tower is a large building, which consist of multiple and different building segments. It is not known, whether it is possible to built the TriAngle Tower as one constructive section. 2. the system of elevators: It is not known whether the system of elevators, which is designed in the architectural design meets the formulated demands. 3. the inconvenience of wind on the pedestrian level: Because of the shape and the height of the TriAngle Tower, there will probably be inconvenience of wind on the pedestrian level. In this part of the master thesis is explored where and how the inconvenience is leading. Research and results 1. For the main bearing structure of the TriAngle Tower two alternatives were designed. Both designs were explored concerning the deformations caused by the dead load, the wind load and the changes of temperature inside the building. By the exploration of the deformation of the main bearing structure, is determined which alternative contains the least problems. 2. The designed system of elevators is explored, where after multiple alternatives were made. Because of the different demands for the different users of the TriAngle Tower different alternatives meet the formulated demands. 3. The inconvenience of wind on the pedestrian level is studied in a wind tunnel. This was done by making a scaled model, which was placed in front of the wind tunnel. Then the wind speed an wind flow were measured to determine the problem areas.","","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","","",""

(mentor); Dilo, A. (mentor); van Loenen, B. (mentor)","2008","The aim of this master thesis has been to answer the question: How can a vario-scale IMGeo be designed and developed by applying the constrained tGAP structure with Top10NL as initial constraint? This research has been done under authority of Gemeentewerken Rotterdam and TU Delft. For Gemeentewerken Rotterdam the main goal is to investigate the possibilities of automatic generalisation based on their project ""Basisregistratie Geografie"", for TU Delft the main goal is to see the concept of the constrained tGAP structure being investigated. The models IMGeo, a new large scale topographical standard in The Netherlands, and Top10NL, the authentic registration for medium scale topography in The Netherlands, are both derived from NEN 3610; they form the basis for the generalisation in this research. The main differences are explained by their backgrounds. IMGeo originates from the GBKN, whereas Top10NL is based on Top10Vector. The fact that these models are not made cooperatively is bad luck for this research; no object class hierarchy could be made from these models, because there are object classes in Top10NL which don't even exist in IMGeo. The Top10NL object classes therefore can't be seen as a generalisation of the object classes of IMGeo. The generalisation approach in this research was the constrained tGAP structure, a concept from the universities of Hannover and Delft. In this research IMGeo objects were assigned to Top10NL regions. Four possible methods to assign IMGeo objects to Top10NL regions were developed: - Simple overlay method. An intersection between the models where every IMGeo object is split at the borders of the overlapping Top10NL object. In the end result only Top10NL geometry will be visible. - The maximum area method. The Top10NL object which overlaps the IMGeo object the most is the shape to which the whole IMGeo object is assigned to. The IMGeo geometry is kept in this method. - The 35%-split method. If an IMGeo object belongs for more than 35% to two Top10NL objects we consider this Top10NL geometry as enrichment of the structure; therefore the IMGeo object is split and a new IMGeo object is created. For all IMGeo objects that don't have two Top10NL objects overlapping for more than 35% the maximum area method is applied. - The building first method. This method assigns IMGeo-buildings to a building region in case of some overlap with a Top10NL building without considering the amount of overlap. The other IMGeo objects are selected as in the maximum area method. The building first method has been developed because the results of the maximum area method and the 35%-split method were unsatisfying. This building first method gives the best results of the four methods. With this method further research was done. For the test dataset from the municipality of Almere class weights and class compatibilities have been derived, which are input values for the tGAP structure. This has been done after tuning the weights and compatibilities of the constrained tGAP structure and comparing the end result to the Top10NL dataset. Final conclusion of this report is that the constrained tGAP absolutely offers possibilities for automatic generalisation from large to medium scale data. However, the amount of pre-processing of the data and the state of development of the tGAP structure are reasons for a governmental organisation like Gemeentewerken Rotterdam to not yet develop a product like this. A topological structure of the models might possibly solve these problems. Cooperation between researching parties, industrial parties and governmental organisations in projects like DURP Ondergronden could be a good opportunity to develop a vario-scale IMGeo as described in this report.","map generalisation; IMGeo; top10nl; constrained tGAP","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Aerospace Engineering, Geo-Database Management Center","","","","","","","","OTB Research Institute for the Built Environment","GIS technology","","","",""

(mentor)","2008","Voor een locatie in het centrum van Rotterdam, direct aan de Verlengde Willemsbrug en de Blaak, heeft architectenbureau KraaijvangerUrbis een ontwerp gemaakt voor de woontoren Domuslokatie. Vanwege de moeilijke vorm van het kavel, blijkt het vrij lastig om de parkeervoorzieningen (op traditionele wijze) efficiënt in het ontwerp op te nemen. Daarom heeft de architect een mechanisch parkeersysteem voorgesteld, waarmee op elke verdieping geparkeerd kan worden. Naast de ruimtebesparing die een dergelijk systeem kan opleveren, is het voor bewoners mogelijk om voor de deur van iedere woning bij de auto te kunnen komen; bijvoorbeeld om de boodschappen uit te laden. Vanwege de beperkte ruimte kunnen maximaal vier parkeerplekken per verdieping worden gerealiseerd. Om aan de minimale parkeernorm voor de hele woontoren te voldoen, worden er onderin het gebouw 28 extra parkeerplaatsen opgenomen. Deze combinatie van parkeerplekken blijkt het meest efficiënt gerealiseerd te kunnen worden door het combineren van twee volautomatische parkeersystemen. De werking is als volgt: Na identificatie parkeert de bestuurder de auto op de begane grond in één van de twee entreeruimtes. Na het verlaten van deze ruimte, wordt de auto volledig automatisch naar de juiste parkeerplaats gebracht. De bestuurder neemt zelf de personenlift omhoogt, waar de auto vervolgens weer beschikbaar is. De grootste moeilijkheid bij het vinden van een geschikte hoofddraagconstructie binnen het V.O. van de woontoren, zijn de grote verschillen tussen de plattegronden van de boven- en de onderbouw. Er zijn in de bovenbouw voldoende (woningscheidende) wanden om de stijfheid van de woontoren te garanderen. Vervolgens is er onderzocht welke mogelijkheden er zijn om de maatgevende (wind)belasting uit de bovenbouw, over te brengen naar de fundering. Het blijkt constructief voldoende efficiënt te zijn om de stabiliteitswanden uit de bovenbouw van het noordelijke bouwdeel, door te zetten als stalen portalen in de onderbouw. Op deze manier blijft de door de architect gewenste transparantie in de onderbouw zoveel mogelijk gewaarborgd.

(mentor); MEDUSA explorations (contributor)","2008","A promising new method for measuring sediment properties in the field is called MEDUSA RhoC. This device measures mud and sand content, sediment density, and water content in the field using Radiometric Sedimentology. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the accuracy and applicability of the MEDUSA RhoC system with its new components. This is done by comparing results obtained with the RhoC to results obtained with traditional analyses, both in the lab and the field. Besides this, also the general characteristics of natural sediments are investigated in order to see what other properties can be derived from mud content, sediment density and water content alone. The radiometric activity of sediment is related to its mud content. The MEDUSA RhoC system determines mud content by measuring the radio-activity of sediment, and translating the activity to mud content. The relation between mud content and activity concentration is called the radiometric fingerprint. Depth averaged sediment density is determined by pushing a radio-active source into the soil, and measuring the attenuation of the activity coming from the source. The water content is determined with a technique known as Time Domain Reflectrometry. To investigate the performance of the RhoC under controlled circumstances, tests are performed in the laboratory and field. The field tests of the RhoC are performed on tidal flats in the Western Scheldt. On several locations in the Western Scheldt the RhoC is used to measure radiometric activity, density profile, and water content. At the same locations, sediment cores are collected. These samples are taken to the laboratory to determine sediment density, water content, grain size distribution, organic matter content, and radiometric activity concentration. This is done using ""ordinary"" techniques. The laboratory analyses on the sediment samples taken from the Western Scheldt show several relations between various sediment properties. The RhoC measures only the mud content, bulk density, and water content. From these properties other properties such as the silt content, clay content, porosity, and relative water content are derived. These properties are important for the mechanical behavior (such as erosion) of the sediment. In general, the MEDUSA RhoC system is able to supply valuable information on the composition, density, water content, and stratification of sediment. Although these properties are the only things the RhoC measures, the known relations between these properties and other parameters enable the user to derive much more qualities. This makes the MEDUSA RhoC system a valuable measuring device for sediment mapping, which can improve the quality of the input parameters for large-scale numerical models.","sediment; radioactivity; density; composition","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

The core of this visualization thesis is based on a requirement analysis process using the software approach of Requirement Engineering. It contains two important aspects. The requirement analysis part of the thesis identifies the functionalities that can be used in visual interaction between actors in the planning process. The second aspect of the thesis investigates the use of visual materials in geo-virtual environments to visualize the different planning phases of urban development. The relationship between the urban planning phases and the use of multi-dimensionality, realism and Levels of Detail (LoD) in models has been established here. Through observation, the thesis has analyzed the relationship between the use of visual materials and the human perception to understand them. Moreover, it has stated a process to create 3D base models on the basis of geo-data through widely used GIS software. The thesis elaborates the functionality domains of geo-virtual environments through the introduction of the construction, capabilities, experiencing, controlling, use, exploration and components functionalities. This taxonomy is achieved through the analysis of requirements of specific Dutch municipalities. These functionalities can be used for collaborative design process by the municipalities and facilitate visual interaction with actors like citizens. Based on the requirement analysis, the thesis sheds light on the knowledge-gap with regards to the classification of functionalities and visual materials.

(mentor)","2008","Ion exchange resins have found an increasing application in the drinking water treatment sector over the last few decades. The ion exchange resins have a positive ability to remove the charged natural organic matter (NOM). To apply this process in full-scale treatment, the most suitable resin has to be selected and the hydraulic behaviour of the treatment process must be known. This study has the purpose to study the NOM fractions removal with different resins and select the most suitable resin for NOM removal of the Weesperkarspel water. Another purpose is to study the hydraulic behaviours of fluidized ion exchange and testing of the fluidization models of Ergun and Richardson-Zaki. The thesis study is characterizing NOM into the specific fraction and later observing the removal of each fraction with the different ion exchange resins. The kinetic and the equilibrium of NOM removal of each resin are also studied. Four ion exchange resins are tested (Lewatit VP OC 1071, Purolite Macronet 200, Duolite A7 and MIEX DOC). The ultraviolet absorbance method (UV), dissolved organic carbon detection method (DOC), specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA), fluorescence excitation emission matrix (fluorescence EEM) and liquid chromatography-organic carbon detector method (LC-OCD) were applied. Weesperkarspel water contains a high degree of aromatic NOM fractions, mostly in the form of humic substances. The Lewatit VP OC 1071 is the most suitable resin for removal of NOM in general view, especially aromatic NOM and humic substances fractions. It appears to be removed as high as 65% and 94% respectively. The MIEX DOC removed 57% aromatic NOM fraction and 70% of humic substances. The pH was found as the dominant parameter for the NOM removal by the weak base Duolite A7. In normal raw water (pH = 7.8), this resin is almost ineffective while it can remove the aromatic NOM up to 35% and humic substances fraction of 45% in raw water pH adjusted to 5. The sorbent Purolite Macronet 200 can remove only biopolymers and neutral NOM fractions. Adsorption is an important mechanism for the removal process of high molecular weight NOM fractions and the neutrals fractions. By using the linear driving force model (LDF) to describe the ion exchange rate of the resin, it was found that MIEX DOC resin can remove NOM faster than other resins. The LDF- k constant of MIEX DOC is also higher than other resins. MIEX DOC has the smallest resin bead size. This can be the reason for the fast removal of NOM. The resin exchange capacity is related with the Freundlich constant K and n . Increase of K and n values lead to increase of exchange capacity. The Lewatit VP OC 1071 has the highest K and n values and thus the highest exchange capacity. The exchange rate and exchange capacity is a specific property of each resin. With help from the LDF model and Freundlich isotherm the breakthrough curve can be determined. The Lewatit VP OC 1071 has longest running time compared with the MIEX DOC and Duolite A7 due to the highest exchange capacity. The hydraulics behaviour of fluidized bed ion exchange has been investigated with the strong base gel resin Lewatit VP OC 1071. The temperature and the feed velocity influence the expanded behaviour. The wet density and wet porosity are important parameters for the model prediction. Combination of mathematical modelling of ion exchange and the treatment conditions of Weesperkarspel drinking water treatment plant, the fluidized ion exchange process can be designed. For Weesperkarspel drinking water treatment plant, the aim is to decrease the DOC concentration of 7.2 mg C/l to 3.0 mg C/l with the fluidized ion exchange process. The 20 fluidized ion exchange reactors with a height of 9 m, 10 m2 of resin bed surface area, a bed height of 2 m and a feed velocity of 20 m/h are designed. The reactors consist of 4 groups, each group is started with delays of 15 days. With this operational step, the running time of each reactor is 60 days. The cost is estimated 11-euro cent per m3 treated water.","NOM characterization; ion exchange resins; ion exchange rate; linear driving force model; Freundlich isotherm; fluidized ion exchange; fluidization model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Watermanagement","","Sanitary Engineering","",""

This mud can be transported to these places in fluid state or can become fluid under certain wave conditions. Fluid mud may have a strong damping effect on surface waves. Dissipation of up to 90% of the wave energy within a few kilometers has been measured. In this study, the wave model SWAN is modified to make it possible to model the dissipation of energy during the propagation of a wave field over fluid mud. A two-layer model is used to describe the water-mud-system. The upper layer represents the water and is non-hydrostatic and non-viscous. The lower layer represents the fluid mud and is quasi-hydrostatic and viscous. Based on this schematization a complex dispersion equation is derived and compared with other dispersion equations from literature. A numerical solving procedure is formulated to solve this implicit complex dispersion equation for the wave number. When the wave number is known, information on the damping is given by the imaginary part, while the real part is associated with the wave length and the propagation velocity of energy. To compute wave damping for situations in practice, the influence of mud is incorporated in the wave model SWAN. First, the energy dissipation term consistent with the dispersion equation is derived and added as a sink term to the energy balance in SWAN. By making the mud-adjusted wave number available through the whole code, also influence of fluid mud on energy propagation is included in the model. The performance of the model for both energy dissipation and energy propagation is validated and compared to analytical solutions for some simple cases. Result The final result of this study is a modified version of SWAN which allows to model the decrease of energy during the propagation of a wave field over fluid mud. The model is ready for use in engineering applications by specialists.","waves; damping; SWAN; fluid mud; two-layer models","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor); Van Oord (contributor)","2008","In coastal regions where the land is sensitive to erosion, but also for harbours and ports, numerous types of defensive structures have been developed to protect it from the effects of incident waves. More recently breakwaters have been constructed which combine the stability characteristics of a conventional two-layered uniform sloped breakwater with the wave energy dispersive character of a berm breakwater. This type is referred to as a 'breakwater with a bermed slope' or a 'bermed sloped breakwater' In order to develop more insight in the development of damage on bermed sloped breakwaters, small-scale experiments have been performed in which the two most important parameters related to a berm were tested. These governing parameters were the relative berm length and the relative water level with a range of respectively 0.00 < B/Lm-1,0 < 0.35 and -0.8 < Rc/Hm0 < 0.7. It is concluded that the development of damage on a bermed slope has a similar, but more stable, trajectory as predicted for a uniform slope with the stability formula of Van Gent (2003). The increase in stability can be indicated with a constant factor rD. Also the damage level parameters for 'start of damage' and 'failure' on a bermed slope are independent of the governing parameters and correspond to the values of a uniform sloped breakwater. The influence of the governing parameters on the stability of the lower slope for 'start of damage' is shown in Figure 1. Conceivable trendlines are drawn for constant values of Rc/Hm0 and B/Lm-1,0. It can be concluded that when regarding constant values of Rc/Hm0 the test results show, for initial values of the relative berm length, an increase in stability as B/Lm-1,0 increases. As the relative berm length gets increasingly larger, the increase in stability indicates a horizontal limit. Also the range for which the relative berm length has a positive contribution on the increase in stability is strongly related to the relative water level. For Rc/Hm0 < 0 this range is small but it widens quickly as the water level approaches the berm level. As the water level on the berm increases, it gradually becomes smaller again. A research by WL|Delft Hydraulics (Vermeer (1986)), which performed similar tests but for Rc/Hm0 > 0.9, showed different results. The development of the increase in stability for constant values of the relative berm length showed a peak at B/L0 = 0.15. This peak seemed to flatten out as the water level on the berm became smaller. This process could possible link the findings of this study to the findings of Vermeer (1986), however, more research has to be done to confirm this hypothesis. Finally the two design principles, which in practice are used as indication of the increase in stability, were validated with the results of this study. The first principle applies stability formulae for uniform slopes on the average slope of a bermed profile. The second principle adopts the characteristics of low-crested structures on the bermed profile. The correlation between the predicted increase in stability and the results of the test series was very low. Apparently the complexity of the processes related to the (in)stability of armour layers on a bermed slope can not be overcome by means of the design principles. This is most probably caused by the influence of the return current, which has large impact on the stability, is not accounted for. Therefore both principles are not well suited to predict the increase in stability of armour layers on bermed slopes.","breakwater; berm; armour; layer; stability","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor); Echavarria, E. (mentor)","2008","Since the early 90s, wind energy industry has stepped offshore due to a number of interesting characteristics compared to onshore wind harvesting. At least when initially realized, offshore wind farms were not really different than onshore ones, since the same wind turbine technology with slight modifications was directly applied to the new environment. In these early cases, low water depths and small distance to shore may have justified this option. For future large scale offshore wind farms however, it is doubtful whether simply applying the existing onshore wind turbine technology will lead to the desired outcomes, e.g. high energy yield and revenues. Technical reliability of wind turbines affects the economics of an offshore wind farm since failures increase maintenance costs and decrease operational time, thus energy production. In the beginning of this report, the most important aspects that drive modern wind turbine design are investigated, followed by a review of different design choices for the various parts of a wind turbine as well as overall wind turbine topologies. A thorough reliability analysis, focused on comparison of the most prominent architectures, is then carried out using failure data from two German databases, LWK-SH and WMEP. Total annual failure rates of 2 to 5 failures per wind turbine per year were observed but no specific topology seemed to clearly stand out in terms of reliability. Most critical components proved to be blades, electrical and electronic systems, as well as hydraulics. Gearboxes, generators, and shafts and bearings are also important not because they fail very frequently, but due to the high associated downtimes. Using a widely used reliability growth model, there seem to be more failures during the first years of operation for most subassemblies. In order to identify the most important parameters affecting offshore wind farm availability and O&M costs per kWh, several Monte-Carlo simulations were performed using the software tool CONTOFAX. Results showed that availability is not only affected by technical reliability, but also availability of heavy lifting equipment and spare parts, site accessibility, crew and vessel strategy, and distance of the wind farm to shore.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","DuWind","","","",""

By connecting the Technikon building to the Hofplein railway there will be a connection between the fast traffic from de Schiekade and the slow traffic on de new Hofplein route. This connection supports the use of this area by the public. In the area where the public crosses the students there will be a commercial zone where the students can use and show there skills. In this way the area and the students will have a connection with the city again.","Technikon","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Architecture, Architecture","","","","","","","","Architecture","","","","",""
