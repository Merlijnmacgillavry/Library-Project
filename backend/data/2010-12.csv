(mentor); Long, J.R. (mentor)","2010","The fast development of CMOS IC process technology and the opening up of high frequency bands by regulatory bodies has aided wireless communication industry with development and commercialization of long-medium and short range wireless communication applications, for example GSM, Wireless LAN, Bluetooth and UWB. Ultra Wideband (UWB) is a promising technology that covers a bandwidth from 3.1GHz to 10.6GHz, which features distinctive advantages, such as high data rate over short and medium range, low interference or co-existence with other wireless technologies and robustness towards multipath fading and possible usage in personal area network (PAN) and body area network (BAN), targeting especially health care monitoring applications. Impulse radio UWB or ir-UWB, is one of the UWB technologies, which applies transmission of short duration (pico-nano second) and carrier less pulses. Several receiver architectures [1, 2 & 3] based on the principle of correlation has been proposed, with Quadrature Downconversion Auto-Correlation Receiver (QDAcR) [3] being one of them. This thesis work builds up further on the generalized QDAcR model of [3], starting with an advanced time domain analysis of principle of Downconversion in QDAcR and exploring the dependency of QDAcR on downconverter related stochastic perturbations such as phase noise, jitter and amplitude perturbations. The use of Stationary Stochastic Process Theory, Fokker-Planck Equation and Floquet’s Theory resulted in a simplified equation, incorporating the effect of stochastic perturbations; this equation of prominence, further can be extrapolated to perturbation analysis of Zero (low) – IF receivers. A complete system modeling of QDAcR downconverter resulted in vital specifications for the QDAcR downconverter being the requirement of a 5.6 GHz quadrature voltage controlled oscillator (QVCO) with a minimum phase noise of -90dBc/Hz at 1MHz offset and with a maximum permissible phase error of 4 degrees. This relaxed nature of specifications has opened a plethora of trade-offs. The main aim being the design of low power Quadrature oscillator, a push-pull LC tank voltage controlled oscillator, consuming 1mW of power and exhibiting figure of merit of 187.1dB with a tuning range of 12.7% was designed. The Bottom Series QVCO, Parallel Coupled QVCO and Push-Pull –Polyphase QVCOs were compared for their respective advantages and disadvantages, which resulted in the selection of the Parallel Coupled QVCO, because of less power consumption and robust design. The Parallel QVCO consumes a power of 2.4mW, while having a FOM of 186.36dB. The final design includes the complete QVCO system and differential buffer (Common Source) with neutralization capacitors having ability to drive variable loads.","Ultra-Wideband; Q-VCO; Oscillator System; Phase Noise","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-12-27","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Analog and Radio Frequency (ELCA)","",""

(mentor); Eftekhari, A.A. (mentor); Bruining, J. (mentor)","2010","At the moment global climate change is one of the most prominent environmental and energy issues of our life time. Currently CO2 levels in the atmosphere stand at 387 ppm, almost 40% higher since the start of the industrial revolution and the highest for at least the last 650,000 years. About 96% of these carbon emissions are the result of using fossil fuels. Another problem is that the fossil fuel reserves will be exhausted within 200 years and the nuclear energy within 260 years. Something has to be done to stop the addiction of fossil fuels and carbon dioxide emissions! However investing in renewable energy is still expensive but high energy prices, CO2 emissions, rising temperatures, fossil fuels depletion and the demand to be less dependent on other countries makes it more and more attractive to invest in renewable energy, like solar energy, wind energy, biomass, geothermal energy, tidal power and hydro power. Not all renewable energy sources are suitable in the Netherland. Geothermal energy, still unknown by a lot of people, has a very good potential to succeed in the Netherlands. The average temperature of the Dutch subsurface at a depth of 2,000 meters is around 75 – 80 °C. This energy is very suitable to heat houses, afterwards the rest heat can be used to heat low heat demanding facilities like swimming pools and greenhouses. In spite of the good potential, geothermal energy is still used on a small time scale in the Netherlands. Hopefully DAP can make a change in this by making more people aware that geothermal energy has a great potential for the Netherlands. The Netherlands has a geothermal potential of 90,000 PJ in heat. The benefits of geothermal energy are that it is clean and available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Also geothermal power plants have average availabilities of 90% or higher, compared to 75% for coal power plants. The greenhouse gas emissions of the geothermal plants are only 91 gCO2/kWh, this is very low compared to other fuels. The annual Dutch CO2 emission is nearly 180 Mt CO2 at present, of which approximately 100 Mt CO2/year emitted by the energy and manufacturing industry. The biggest emitters are large point sources like the power generation sector and large energy-consuming industries like oil and gas processing, iron and steel, cement and chemicals production. CCS can lower the emissions from the large point sources by capturing the carbon dioxide. CCS is not a new technology, this proven technique is already used for nearly 100 years for industrial purposes or to increase oil or gas production. CCS technology can reduce carbon dioxide emissions from large industrial sources and coal-fired power stations by approximately 85 - 90% depending on the used type of capture technology. Also transportation of CO2 is not a new technology in the Netherland because there is already a pipeline of 85 km from the Shell refinery in Pernis to greenhouses in the Westland area. However, large-scale CCS will require a new transportation infrastructure to link sources and sinks. In densely populated countries such as the Netherlands this can become a considerable challenge, think of Barendrecht. Even though the Netherlands has a very good storage potential there is a spatial mismatch between CO2 sources and sinks. When a new energy source is discovered the first and most important thing to know is how much energy (quantity) can be extracted from this source. But what we really need to know is the work potential (quality) of this energy source, in our case a geothermal well beneath the TU Delft. Work potential is the amount of energy which can be extracted as useful work, this property is called exergy. The maximum available power from the DAP geothermal reservoir is 0.66 MW and is obtained at a flow rate of 180 m3. It is not smart to increase the production rate above 200 m3 because the losses are increasing faster than the extra gained exergy. The invested energy in materials and drilling are minor compared to the energy needed for capture and compression. Over 94% of the total energy demand is needed to capture the CO2 over a life-time of 30 years.","CCS; Carbon Capture Storage; geothermal; exergy; exergy analysis; CO2; CO2 analysis; pay-back time; emission; aquifer; sustainable; energy; transportation; carbon dioxide; capture; storage; DAP; Delft Aardwarmte Project","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Section Applied Geophysics and Petrophysics","","","",""

(mentor); Marieke, S. (mentor); Dijk, E. (mentor)","2010","Before you starting read this report, I would like to ask you to take a moment to recall how you experienced your wake-up process this morning. Did you enjoy the moment? Were you dreaming before that moment? Did you feel delight, pleasant or just sad and depressed? How did you wake up? Were you still sleepy or fully wake up then? Were you in hurry or still lazy? What did you do to make sure that you won’t be late for work this morning? Were you waked up at the right moment? Is it different from yesterday? How about the weather? Was there sun shine? How do you feel your wake-up experience? How would you like it to be? Look, your personal waking up experience is determined by a series details and factors relating to the time, the context and your mental status etc. Everyone has its own waking up experience every morning. But lots people indicate that their waking up experiences are not always pleasant. For example, an alarm clock disturbed you from a deep sleep. Unexpected noise forced you to wake up much earlier than usual. Or a dark morning may lead you to oversleep and mess up your morning schedule. All of these are bad waking up experiences. Unpleasant wake-up experiences may result in drowsiness or inability to concentrate during the day. Most people would rather like a pleasant vigorous and refreshed wake-up experience to start their new working day. So how do we make change of this problem? Lots of surveys indicate that lots of people, especially those college students or office workers who need to be punctual in the morning, have very limited knowledge and wrong beliefs about what sleep is and how we wake up. For most of them, an alarm clock is a must in the morning and to some extent, the alarm clock helps them adapt to their highly organized life. On the other hand, an alarm clock may disrupt their natural waking up system and do harm to their health. 1.1 PROJECT GOAL As more and more people came to realize that a pleasant waking up experience could benefits their wellbeing and working status during the day. It becomes necessary to improve people’s waking up quality and find a way to create a pleasant waking up experience. In this project, we will apply tactile stimuli into a waking up context to help people to improve their waking up quality. To achieve this goal, Philips Research, one of the world's largest corporate research organizations, will focus on people’s experience, what drives people, what dilemmas consumers face, and how we can help them in the best possible way to enjoy a healthy, refreshed, energetic and pleasant waking up experience by applying proper tactile stimuli into morning wake-up context. In this project, first step, in order to have more deep understanding and knowledge of this topic, I had a literature study about people’s sleep and wake up. After that, mean to extract qualitative data from the waking up context, a 2 weeks duration context research which involved 18 participants has been conducted. Then, we had a group session with 6 participants whom participated the context mapping. In order to make the participants to express their own waking up insights and tactile experience, we used collage as a method to make the session. After the session, several end user insights were formulated based on the participants’ own wake-up experience. Then a new design vision of a pleasant wake-up experience was developed based on end user insights and the scientific insights about wake up experience which developed from the literature study. This vision is as the following: Using proper tactile stimuli to eventually make one fully awaken (energetic, bright, alert etc.), one needs to go through the process of waking up that involves body and mind, this process need to be taken care of. Therefore the user needs to be aware of. Considering this design vision as a start point of concepts development, I start exploring design directions and generating ideas. Then several product concepts were developed from these ideas. Finally a concept was chosen by using a method named matrix in making a design decision. Finally, a prototype evaluation is completed in a sleep lab of Philips. During the test, 5 participants were involved in a series tests and an after action interview was also completed for each participant. Finally, the results of evaluation experiment will be given and we will provide directions for the future design and further research. 1.2 RESULTS By analyzing the data of the research, a new design vision is formulated as I mentioned above: Using proper tactile stimuli to eventually make one fully awaken (energetic, bright, alert etc.), one needs to go through the process of waking up that involves body and mind, the user needs to be aware of this process. A design concept which applying vibration effects on people’s body that wakes people up at the right moment was developed. After a concept evaluation test, we got lots of feedback which could be used for improving the current concept and formulate the future design direction. For example, applying tactile stimuli in people’s waking up context can efficiently wake people’s body up as well as wake their mind up in the morning. In this report we will communicate the knowledge of sleep and wake up. And the process of the whole project will be described. The methods we applied in context research, designing and evaluation will also be described and discussed.","tactile experience; wake up context; context mapping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

The Least-Squares method calculates an underrelaxation matrix as a linear combination of states and residuals of previous iterations.

(mentor); van Oudheusden, B.W. (mentor); Goosen, J.F.L. (mentor); Remes, B.D.W. (mentor)","2010","Recent years have seen an increasing interest in Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs). MAVs are small (micro sized) aircraft and find their application in a multitude of commercial, industrial and military purposes. To perform their missions MAVs should be small sized, have good manoeuvrability, be well controllable and have a broad flight envelope. When flying in small confinements, the ability to fly at low airspeed and to have good manoeuvrability is critical. One type of MAVs, the flapping-wing MAV, particularly has attractive characteristics for flight in confined spaces. DelFly is a biplane flapping-wing MAV designed and built at Delft University of Technology. DelFly is able to hover and has an onboard camera for observation and vision-based control. For the DelFly project a top-down approach is followed, where from the study of a relative large model experience and theoretical insights can be gained, that can assist to create smaller, functional versions of the DelFly. The ultimate aim of the DelFly project is to improve the design to a very small full autonomous aircraft. For the current experimental investigation, force and flow field measurements were performed on a hovering DelFly II, since this model has a broad flight envelope and proven flight performance. The flow field is studied using particle image velocimetry. Due to the flexible wings there is a strong fluid structure interaction, therefore also the in-flight wing deformation is determined. The aerodynamic mechanism generating forces on the DelFly are related to those found in insect flight. Since leading edge vortices (LEVs) in insect flight are identified as the most important unsteady aerodynamic mechanism enhancing lift generation for insects, the development of these for the DelFly are very interesting. The vortex development is studied for various wings, at various flapping frequencies and at various spanwise positions. For the DelFly wing a conical LEV is developed, starting at out-board spanwise positions, approximately halfway during the translation. This LEV grows larger and is shed along the chord and at this time a new LEV starts to grow at the leading edge. This second LEV is dissipated at the end of the out-stroke during wing rotation, but at the end of the in-stroke this LEV moves above the wings and interacts with the counter-rotating LEV from the mirror wing. Inside the vortex tube a spanwise velocity component out-board is present. The shedding of the initial vortex and start of a second LEV is not completely consistent with LEV development for insect flight (which typically operate at a lower Reynolds number).","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","","","","",""

(mentor); De Jong, A.M. (mentor); Mys, M. (mentor)","2010","This is the master thesis of the graduation project entitled “Ironing out the interface: design of an iron user interface that elicits the feeling of simplicity”, performed for the Philips Garment Care marketing department based in Amsterdam. The goal of this project is to improve the user interface of steam and system irons, by designing an interface that elicits the feeling of simplicity. The term ‘user interface’ is defined for this project as the parts of the iron that the user interacts with. Simplicity plays a significant role in this project; therefore the term simplicity is defined during the first ‘exploration’ phase: ‘The new interface should be simple and intuitive, in order to create a product that is easy to use. The interface will create a feeling of being in control and of being able to use the product optimally.’ With the intention of grasping the existing user knowledge, previous Philips user research is explored. Recent developments of iron interfaces are also discussed, as they influence the interactions with the users. The second phase concerns two types of qualitative user research with one common goal: ‘Understanding the users and their needs when interacting with an iron’. The initial explorative research (consisting of observations) reveals interesting directions for the second research. This research strives to gain tacit knowledge about the context of use of the iron, by conducting contextual research known as context mapping. This research consists of generative sessions with users that have been sensitized beforehand. A booklet containing the findings of the research is created. The aim of this booklet is to inspire, create empathy for the user and share these findings with the involved parties within Philips. In order to describe the envisioned interaction between the user and the iron, the following interaction vision is created during the third ‘conceptualization’ phase: ‘By creating relevant and unambiguous features & feedback, the interaction with the iron will stimulate a natural flow of the user’s actions into a state of distraction’. Ideas are generated and some fundamental decisions (based on technical insights, user insights and interaction insights) are taken. A selection of the potentially interesting ideas is made and this results into concepts for the steam and system iron. The two concepts are created consisting of an amalgamation of features believed to improve the interaction for the steam and system iron. In order to evaluate if the concepts have potential of complying with the interaction vision, an experiential prototype and storyboards are created and tested on several participants during the fourth ‘evaluation’ phase. Overall the participants responded positive about the concepts and most features seem to be regarded as relevant and unambiguous. There are signs that the concepts could elicit flow, and it is believed that it can stimulate the distraction during ironing. This means that the concepts have potential to comply with the interaction vision and therefore have potential to elicit simplicity. Finally some recommendations are made regarding the concept and the future.","contextmapping; user research; iron; interface; simplicity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-12-17","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Van de Graaff, J. (mentor); De Boer, G.J. (mentor)","2010","In many coastal engineering problems the application of coastal structures to resolve these problems seems to be a proper solution. In a lot of cases, however, the implementation of coastal structures does not lead to the expected situation. Erosion management operations may have unwanted impacts on a coastal system. Decisions on the most appropriate management approach at a given site should be driven in part by the desire to minimise these impacts so as to preserve the natural characteristics of the coast. It is important to bear in mind that erosion of beach and dune areas is a natural and dynamical process and normally should not be regarded as a problem. Problems only arise when erosion threatens human activities or assets, or when the erosion is the result of human interference with coastal processes along an adjacent frontage. A profound study of the actual processes causing the problem should always precede the design of the structure itself. This report intends to provide some clear guidelines to facilitate the design process of coastal structures by discussing several cases and relevant design aspects that seem to be obvious but could easily be overlooked. Especially the recognition of the mechanisms that cause the occurring problem takes a central part in the design process of coastal engineering measures and thus the main emphasis of this report is to awaken consciousness of the mechanisms involved. The cases as discussed in this report are all examples of actual problems. Every solution has its impact on the morphological balance of the coastal zone; this report describes these impacts. It becomes clear after studying all cases that measures to resolve coastal engineering problems are very complicated and adverse effects can be expected in many cases. The main purpose of this report is to make decision-makers in coastal engineering matters aware of the complications that are involved.","coastal engineering; morphology; coastal structures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor); Verlinden, J.C. (mentor)","2010","Being a young company in the VIP conversions market, Fokker Services got hit hard by the Economic crisis in 2008. Competitors with more outfitting experience are able to keep the cost lower and the few clients that are currently looking for new VIP aircraft tend to select these cheaper options. Future clients will have to be convinced otherwise to desire FS to build their aircraft. The strength of Fokker Services, delivering high quality and well-engineered products, is their pitfall at the same time. Too much of a quantitative engineering approach is used for the qualitative concept design phase of the design process. This follows through in current communication with clients, but also in the design artefacts that are used to support this communication. Two important factors are at the base of the miscommunications between client and company in design meetings: 1. Fokker Services is using an engineering oriented design process, which underestimates the value of client-company interaction. 2. The presently used design artefacts used in meetings inadequately support sufficient understanding by the client for making proper design decisions. Instead of an engineering approach, FS should use a social design approach to the concept design process. This approach is attuned better to the clients’ world of thought and embodies the value of understandable communication. In previous projects clients tended to change their mind too late in the design process. To counter this, it is important to allow clients to change their mind in the concept design phase of the design process. They have to be confident about their decisions so that they will not change their mind later on in the process. Furthermore this thesis proposes a set of new and adapted design artefacts, which aim to create a better understanding of conceptual interior designs by the client. The focus has been put on the design and user test of an improved interior planner: the layout design kit.

(mentor); Vermeeren, A.P.O.S. (mentor); Romein, E.C. (mentor)","2010","This report is part of Graduation course for the master Design for Interaction at the faculty of Industrial Design Engineering of the Delft University of Technology. The project was done in cooperation with Exact, also in Delft. For this project, the interaction between the online bookkeeping application Exact Online and its users was analysed and redesigned, to improve the user experience of the first use. At the moment, a certain percentage of the people that try out Exact Online for free do not follow through with the purchase of a paid subscription. Some of the potential users are overwhelmed and confused by the many options that the program has to offer and are not sure where to start. The First Experience of Exact Online was analysed, to get an overall picture of where the user could experience problems. The main problems were:  The user was not guided during the first experience in a smooth process; it was fragmented and not always consistent.  Finding help could be troublesome, as there were many options and not all were easily found or were not up-to-date.  Communications from Exact were not always consistent or appropriate. Exact Online is mainly targeted at the Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) market segment. To find out more about this type of the user, a contextual inquiry was set up. Seven (potential) users from the SME were interviewed about how they experienced bookkeeping in their daily life. A probe (booklet with assignments) was used in advance to prepare the participants, and to be used as a guide during the interviews. Using the probe helped the participants to share personal stories of their experiences, wishes and needs regarding their work and doing bookkeeping. The interviews were analysed and interesting quotes were grouped into themes. To present the results of the research, several visualisations were made. The visualisations act as a summary of the interviews and other materials. The themes and the participants profiles were presented in a graphical way. The visualisations were used as guidance for the concept phase. Combining the results, storyboards were created, using a combination of personas and scenarios. Illustrating the two different types of user which were found in the research, two fictive characters were created:  Mary-Anne Peterson works four days a week, many of her tasks involve bookkeeping. Her bookkeeping knowledge is on an expert level, her computer skills are average. Words to describe Mary-Ann would be: cautious, efficient, friendly, calm.  Paul Rossiter owns a small shop selling books. He spends an afternoon per week on bookkeeping. His bookkeeping knowledge is between novice and average, his computer skills are on a high level. Words to describe Paul would be: passionate, explorative, straightforward and impatient. A storyboard was made for each character, in which they try out Exact Online. To illustrate what kind of interaction Mary-Ann and Paul would like from the experience, Interaction Visions were formulated. The current first experience of Exact Online offers many options to a user, for instance the different types of subscriptions. During the first idea generation for a design concept, trying to design for all these options and at the same time trying to solve all indicated problems became too complicated. To regain focus and develop concepts which were targeting the most important goals, design boundaries were created. The design boundaries were to:  Use Paul’s Interaction Vision (“open and straightforward”) and storyboard  Start when the user enters Exact Online  Use demonstration data, without wizards  Consider only the first use A corresponding design goal was formulated: “To make the experience of the first use of Exact Online open and straightforward to a new user, offering appropriate guidance when needed and satisfying curiosity, resulting in the user being pleasantly surprised and confident about the suitability of the program” After a new idea generation, three concepts were formulated:  “Time machine”, illustrating that bookkeeping is a process in time, using an interactive time line  “Trusted Guide”, virtual experts guide and help the user through Exact Online, offering advice using collaborative filtering  “Start-up gadget”, a physical gadget which contains explanations on the first steps, using short code to interact with Exact Online The “Time machine” concept was chosen to be developed into a design proposal. In the concept, a time line symbolises a period in which an example company, a bicycle shop, does its business. The user can, amongst other things, enter some of the shop’s last sales and purchases. These are presented as “example events”, assignments which are placed along the time line. By using the slider along the time line, the user can see what kinds of events occur during a year. On overview pages, the user can use the slider to jump back and forth in time. They can decide which events they want to try out and see what happens in the overviews. During each event, the user gets an explanation of the company’s activities and the terms used. Links to more (help) information are provided. To test the concept’s interaction, a prototype was made. After test sessions with (potential) users, some alterations were made to the design. Even though the test participants understood the concept of the time line and event examples, the way the events were presented was improved. The Time machine design proposal offers a new approach to introducing users to Exact Online. The user is offered an appealing way to start exploring the trial subscription of the program, without requiring them to invest a large amount of time and effort.","interaction design; contextmapping; Exact Online; Bookkeeping; Accounting; Saas","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Verheij, H.J. (mentor); Hermeling, V.M. (mentor); Van Rhee, C. (mentor)","2010","During the execution of reclamation projects by Boskalis, often a temporary work channel and basin are required. This work channel is used by the dredging equipment to reach the project site as close as possible. The project site is often located in very shallow water which makes a channel necessary. The basin is used to transport the dredged material ashore and to make a turn. Often, these work channels are only used during the execution of the project and are only used by trailing suction hopper dredgers (TSHD’s). Nowadays, the design of such a work channel is based on the guidelines regarding approach channels for ports. This often leads to an over- or underestimation of the channel dimensions, which could result in unnecessary high costs. Research on the optimization of the design of a work channel could lead to a saving in costs. During this thesis, first an inventory is made of the currently used guidelines for the design of approach channels. An analysis of projects executed by Boskalis and interviews with TSHD captains gave insight in the behavior of a TSHD in a shallow, restricted work channel. Combining this knowledge has led to a new design-tool for the dimensions of a work channel and basin for an arbitrary TSHD and project location. The reliability of the design tool is examined in a case study by means of a fast-time simulation. Eventually a rough analysis of the costs is made to gain insight in the differences between applying a one-way or a two-way channel.","channel design; work channel; dredging project; trailing suction hopper dredger; tshd; turning basin; land reclamation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-12-17","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Ports and Waterways","",""

Through the literature research, observational research and creative session discussion of EFHD research, it is found that the main influences of elderly drivers on the highway interchange are their restricted vision, uncertainty, tiredness, worse judgement of distance, slow merging speed, and overload information on the road. Elderly drivers need confidence and small quantity of workload. And the road should offer a peaceful and safe driving atmosphere, convey required information efficiently and guide elderly drivers in behaving correctly. Four road design concepts are created to build elderly driv­ers' confidence when they merge into main traffic stream on the highway by helping them to judge a perfect timing to merge with sufficient speed and gap acceptance, and by stimulating them on main traffic stream to cooperate with merging drivers.","elderly drivers; highway interchange; road design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

Trenches can be made before or after the pipelines have been laid. In the latter case, the excavation process is called post-trenching. The essence of post-trenching, as handled in this thesis, is erosion of sand by a water-jet. The literature study focused on the processes of jets and erosion. A lot of research has been done in the field of water jets and useful information is widely available. Nevertheless the available information on the subject of impinging jets is rather limited and the validity remains questionable. Water jets used for post-trenching create high flow velocities for which the traditional erosion equations are not valid. Therefore use is made of a special set of equations for high speed erosion. With the information provided by the literature study a description of jetting in sand was made. The known processes were arranged resulting in a set of equations. Following the rules for scaling the set of equations was converted into a properly scaled model. Preliminary model tests were conducted to observe the jet-process and narrow down the possible jet angles. These preliminary tests were followed by scale model tests to determine the erosion depth for different nozzle angles, flow velocities etcetera. A numerical model was developed to simulate jet-induced erosion. Since the erosion equations, making use of the average flow velocity, could not model the erosion behaviour of a jet, a turbulence term was introduced. The results of the simulations were compared with the model tests. Though the numerical erosion model showed promising results, it could not be validated due to a lack of data. The most important conclusions are that soil can be eroded to the desired depth, a data-set has been created and much insight is gained with respect to the post-trenching process. Last but not least, a numerical model was made that can prove to be useful after better validation.","post-trenching; TSHD; jets; erosion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-12-17","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2010","This is the final report of a graduation project at Delft University of Technology, faculty of Industrial Design Engineering. The project is executed in collaboration with the Dutch company Blue Fish Bags. The project was born through the ambition of Blue Fish Bags to develop a private label. Being a company that develops collections of bags under the license of other brands, Blue Fish Bags is experienced in initiating and managing new product development. The growing ambition to own a project that does not depend on the license of another brand arose several years ago. However, the company experienced difficulties with selling new brands to its customers: distributors and retailers of the so-called bag specialty segment. This market segment is mainly characterized by conservative leatherware stores and business-minded distributors, rather than buyers that are interested in new and innovative brands. Therefore, a private label has never been developed. This graduation project aims to advice a strategy for a new business to realize Blue Fish Bags' ambition, through the research question: 'Which brand strategy results into a successful private label for Blue Fish Bags?'. An answer to the research question is provided by advising Blue Fish Bags to develop a new business in which a private brand strategically functions as a tool to strengthen the current core licensing business model. This recommendation was created through the results of a comprehensive research in which Blue Fish Bags' characteristics and the developments of its environment were analysed. Through a conceptualization process with both scientific and creative methods, the findings of the analysis were transformed into a design brief for the new business. The design brief includes a conceptual direction from six key points: (1) create a tool, (2) stay in charge, (3) target youngsters, (4) make functional fashionable, (5) cooperate with creators, and (6) become a lifestyle. In this new business strategy a private brand has been developed to support the company's current business model. A brand concept is created that fit the six key points and is described as a platform where bags are created by young creative consumers. The brand, with the suggested name Doubstar, is a website where creators of the online community can co-create bags and relative products. This community exists of youngsters with a so-called 'constructing images' lifestyle that look for fashionable bags that are functional to take to school. To stimulate the style of the co-created bags a collection is developed by the brand team. Besides, inspiring feedings and guerrilla promotions support both the preferred brand image and the commitment of the community. The brand strategy adds value to Blue Fish Bags because it satisfies the company's ambition, it contributes to the objectives of the management, and it found solutions to difficulties of the current customers. Moreover, the new business helps Blue Fish Bags using its strengths, improving its weaknesses, anticipating on opportunities, and protecting from threats. To support a successful realization, the report provides a business plan, an implementation plan, and recommendations for future research. Furthermore, the accompanying Brand Book presents suggestions for the brand identity.","brand; design; strategy; fashion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-12-17","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

Aircraft manufacturers are responding to this trend and new aerospace materials are introduced to build lighter aircrafts. However material manufacturers, like Tata Steel, are unfamiliar with the determination of running loads and the behavior of materials in fuselage structures. Therefore an evaluation tool is needed for determining the running loads and evaluating the performance of new materials. This will give material manufacturers better insight in what properties and performance are specifically needed for materials in aircraft structures. The goal of this project is to develop an analytic design, analysis and evaluation tool for both metal and composite fuselage configurations in Visual Basic Application in order to gain insight into the structural performance of these material classes and to estimate the weight and required structural dimensions for both aluminum and composite fuselages. The fuselage geometry is setup parametrical and modeled as a simplified tube with variable crosssection without cut-outs and wing box, and it is divided in bays and skin panels. By modeling the aerodynamic-, gravity-, ground reaction forces and internal pressure a free body diagram and force/moment distribution is created for several flight and ground load cases, like 1G flight, lateral gust or landing load cases. The critical load cases are used for analysis. The running loads, like bending stress, longitudinal stress, circumferential stress and shear stress are calculated for the entire aircraft fuselage. A clear load pattern is created in order to evaluate the materials. The materials are evaluated for strength, stability and several other failure modes, like fatigue and crack growth. The skin panels are optimized for these evaluation methodologies and after doing so a minimum fuselage weight is obtained for conventional aircraft configurations. The Airbus A320 is taken as reference aircraft and the running loads and optimization results of the model are validated with this aircraft. The model proved to be valid and is therefore considered suitable to be used as an analysis and evaluation tool. The final stage of the project involved an initial assessment of aluminum and composite as structural material.","aircraft design; fuselage design; parametric modeling; structural analysis; optimization; aluminum; Ilhan Sen","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Mechanics, Aerospace Structures & Materials","","","",""

The kernel of the vision system is stereo matching. Stereo matching(correspondence) problem has been studied for a few decades; it is one of the most investigated topics in computer vision. A lot of algorithms have been developed, but only a few can be applied in practice because of the constraint from either accuracy or speed requirement. After the vision system is built, one can get some insights from it, and determine which part of the vision system needs to be improved through experiments. The result shows that the accuracy of current block matching algorithm is enough to be applied in specific environment. Thus, the focus of the afterwards optimization for the currently built vision system is mainly from speed acceleration aspect. After measuring each stage time cost of 3D sensing part of the vision system, the most time consuming stage is from the stereo matching which generates the disparity map or depth map. At last, the stereo matching part is executed on GPU(Graphic Processing Unit) in order to get some performance enhancement, the final result demonstrates that GPU can make the algorithm run in real time, and it is an ideal platform for the further application development of stereo matching algorithm. Because the original speedup of GPU against to CPU is round 35 times at least for desktop GPU, and the optimized speedup of GPU against to CPU can be more than 100 times at least for desktop GPU.","Stereo matching; GPU; Segmentation; Stereo vision; CUDA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Computer Engineering","",""

This allows the stereo cameras to be moved around and automatically re-calibrated without the use of a calibration object. This also allows the set-up to deal with ad-hoc camera relocation and to recover from accidental nudges that invalidate the extrinsic (external to the stereo camera) calibration. The obtained transformations can for example be used in virtual view rendering for 3D Video. The relative positions and orientations of the stereo cameras are obtained using sparse point correspondences found in different views of the scene. For each stereo camera, 3D coordinates of salient scene points are triangulated and their image feature descriptors are used to locate the same points in the views of other stereo cameras. The salient point descriptors SIFT, ASIFT, SURF and FAST are compared for this purpose, together with two different error measures to see which selects the best transformation. Two strategies are proposed and evaluated to deal with three or more stereo cameras. Given enough salient image points, the proposed solution accurately finds the transformation between stereo camera pairs with a reprojection error less than 1 pixel. Additionally we use the obtained transformations to perform virtual view rendering and evaluate the perceptual quality.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Mediamatics","","","",""

(mentor); De Jager, R.R. (mentor); Schweckendiek, T. (mentor)","2010","Properties of soils are spatially variable and to describe the behaviour of soils as a response to loading, this variability appears crucial in giving the correct range of possible solutions for structure response. Because site investigation techniques only provide exact information at a limited part of the site, random field simulations are used to assess this variability over the full test site domain. The random fields use the spatial statistical characteristics that are derived from the site investigation, which in geotechnical application mainly consists of cone penetration tests (CPT’s). To reduce the range of possible solutions to be found for structure response analysis, the random fields can be conditioned by the actual CPT measurements. This report describes the conditioning of the random field in order to generate conditioned simulations of sand state fields. In order to derive the state parameter from the CPT tip resistance, the NorSand constitutive model is calibrated against the results of 55 triaxial tests of the test site. Different methods of calibration using triaxial test data are described and the results are discussed. 140 CPT’s of the test site are then transformed into state parameter profiles. The statistical characteristics of the profiles are determined to be used for the simulation of the spatially variable fields of sand state. The statistical characteristics of the profiles are used in the conditional simulation of the fields. A conditional simulation algorithm to generate realisations of spatially variable sand state fields is derived and demonstrated. Using unconditioned random fields, generated with the Local Average Subdivision (LAS) method, conditioned simulations of the field around the CPT profiles are generated in a post-processing algorithm. The algorithm uses the geometry-dependent property of the kriging estimation error for the exchange of noise terms between estimation fields. The specific properties of the kriging estimator are demonstrated to be suitable to be used for the conditioning. The decrease in uncertainty by the conditioning with respect to the unconditioned random fields is presented. This decrease in uncertainty is used to demonstrate that the effectiveness of the conditioning is a function of the number and location of conditioning points relative to the scales of fluctuation of the field. It is demonstrated that conditioning reduces the range of possible solutions for the simulation of sand state fields with respect to unconditioned fields. This reduction will lead to a smaller range of solutions to be found when the conditional simulations are used in structure response analysis, leading to less uncertainty in design. The conditional simulation is shown to produce fields that honour the initial distribution function, the correlation structure and the actual CPT profiles in the simulated fields. To demonstrate that conditional simulation can be applied on the test site, a stochastic characterisation of the test site is performed and conditional simulations of the state parameter fields are generated for a small part of the test site.","NorSand calibration; CPT interpretation; statistics; stochastic characterisation; conditional simulation; random fields; LAS; kriging","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Applied Earth Science","","Engineering Geology","",""

The aim of the project is to realize a flexible ambient lighting device for the bathroom environment that is able to provide a spacious feeling. A literature study gave the insight into the ordinary bathroom in the Netherlands but not enough on people’s expectations regarding ambient lighting. Consequently, an elaborate investigation was carried in a user study. The contextmapping method that was used in the user study generated a rich context information and understanding of the users’ aspirations that resulted into creating a spacious ambience for bathrooms. Within Philips, this direction has not been explored for a lighting device. Therefore, it was a great opportunity to be inspired by various fields, including the study of lighting design in architecture, art, and aircraft cabins. After generating the concepts, the concepts were rapidly judged on their ability to provide a spacious impression. The result was used to develop the light effect and interaction design. Eventually, a lighting prototype and physical-interaction designs were realized and evaluated by end users. The evaluation results showed the lighting design is able to enlarge the impression of the tested space and to provide visual interest.

(mentor)","2010","Getting insight in a child’s world is important to be able to create valuable products for children. Contextmapping could be well suited to gain an empathic understanding of children, but little is known about how the underdeveloped abstract thinking abilities of children influence the results of a contextmapping session. Contextmapping is aimed at getting rich information from participants. This research investigates the influence of the abstract thinking abilities of children on the setup and richness of the results of a contextmapping session. Young children of six years old and older children of eleven years old participated in the contextmapping sessions that were part of this research. In this research, abstract thinking and richness of results are made measurable. The abstractness of statements children make is measured by two methods. The first method qualifies the statement on the micro-thinking level the child expresses. The second method relates the statement to an abstract thinking skill that is used by the child to make the statement. Richness is measured by counting the times a child shares a personal experience or memory. The richness of the reactions of a child is related to the measured abstract thinking level of a child in order to determine if there is any influence. In case the reached abstraction level during the session influences the amount of shared rich information, it is interesting to know how children can reach the desired abstraction level during a session. This research investigates which other factors influence the general abstraction level the participant is able to show. It was also investigated whether these factors influence how many rich information the participant shares. The investigated factors are the effort a participant has put into the sensitising package, the influence of peers that are in the same session, verbal guidance given by the researcher and the providing of ambiguous and non-ambiguous images. From this research is concluded that no relation between the shown abstract thinking level and the amount of shared rich information was found for the older children. Young children that show a higher general abstraction level during the session, also share more rich information. The cause for this relation is most probably the language development of these young children. Children that just mastered language are eager to use this new tool. These same children started to develop abstract thinking skills, since language is thought to be strongly related to the development of abstract thinking. Therefore, language development most likely influences both the sharing of a lot of rich information and the general abstraction level of the child. None of the factors that were investigated on their influence on the general abstract thinking level actually had this influence. These factors did not have a clear influence on the amount of shared rich experiences either. This research shows that contextmapping is suited for use with children that are verbally capable. Since the shown abstract thinking level is not directly influencing the richness of the results of a session, the setup of a session should not be aimed at getting children to reach a high abstract thinking level. When setting up a contextmapping session, the differences between children and adults should be taken into account. Furthermore, sensitising is recommended to create a bond between the child and the researcher and let the child look forward to the session.","contextmapping; children; abstract thinking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Van Boeijen, A.G.C. (mentor); Zou, Z.D. (mentor)","2010","Worldwide, consumers demand companies to take more responsibility for what environmental problems their products might cause. Companies are following this demand from consumers by producing more sustainable products. HP forms no exception and has implemented so called “Eco solutions” to reduce the environmental impact of their consumer inkjet printers. These eco solutions do not seem to work very well in China as the solutions that HP implemented are developed for a global market and are too generic. This graduation project reports on what Chinese users think of as sustainable and what motivates Chinese users to be more sustainable. The gathered insights have resulted in sustainable solutions that better fit the Chinese market. User research showed that there is a preference towards “green” products in China. However this preference is not based on intrinsic motivation of users to reduce the impact on the environment, but rather on the trendy image these products currently have in China. To raise more awareness about sustainability, green products have to communicate what benefits it directly offers the users, such as saving costs. Compared to the western world there is not only a different motivation to buy more sustainable products, there is also a different infrastructure. Extensive corporate recycling programs that work well in the West, might not always be as effective in China. This is due to the lack of infrastructure and due to the lack of proper law and regulations on recycling. Four different design directions, to reduce the environmental impact of printers, have been developed to fit specifically into the context of the Chinese consumer market. During this project, one of the four design directions has been further developed to be implemented into upcoming printers of HP. The design direction “Eco-feedback” has resulted in the concept of “Greenify”. Greenify is a software application on multiple platforms, that motivates users to change their behavior and raises more awareness about sustainability by tracking their behavior and giving feedback on it. Users indicate in evaluations that the ease of use of Greenify triggers them to print in a more sustainable way. They also indicate that the feedback raises more awareness towards sustainability and shows them that more sustainable printing benefits them directly by saving costs on printing. For this project to continue HP needs to develop a full working prototype in order to evaluate the design with users over a longer period of time. This will give more insight into how much Greenify influences user behavior and what the exact benefits for the environment are.","China; printing; behavior; feedback","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

The working at height industry is conservative. It is closely related to the architecture industry. While architects are using new philosophies and technologies to increase the aesthetic of the buildings, as an accessory on the roof top building maintenance units remains old-fashioned. The appearance is a traditional machine which is bulky and dull. XSPlatforms requires a new form signature for their product groups. An emotional connection with architects and other stakeholders who have strong concern on building aesthetic is added to the current brand format. Thus a new brand personality is created as the initiative for the form language design. “Access to Elegancy” The new brand characteristic is intended to shift the role of XSPlatforms from a maintenance unit supplier to a building aesthetic protector in the working at height market. Based on the styling boards made from the brand personality, several mock-ups were made for testing. The new form language was refined from the most appreciated models.

(mentor)","2010","Wave fields in the close vicinity of a coastal structure can be very complex, this is especially the case during extreme storm conditions and for complex geometries. There is a growing interest for numerical simulation tools capable of predicting in detail the complex hydrodynamic loads due to waves and currents and its effect at structures. In this context the model ComFLOW will be used in this thesis to study wave run-up on dikes. The code is a (3D) hydrodynamic flow model based on the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The evolution of the free water surface is described by the Volume-of-Fluid method (VOF). The model is capable of calculating velocities, pressures and water levels in a detailed level, while geometries are easily adjustable. The objective of this study is to analyze numerical simulation of wave run-up and other relevant wave-structure interaction processes on smooth and impermeable coastal structures with perpendicular wave attack and to investigate whether the Volume of Fluid (VOF) model ComFLOW is able to accurately represent these processes with 2DV simulations. A related aim is to determine whether the model is robust and which model settings are preferred. To investigate whether the numerical model different mathematical aspects properly solves for relevant processes, simulation results are compared with analytical solutions. Three test cases are considered: the classical dam break test with a horizontal bed, the dam break test with an upward sloping bed and solution of Carrier and Greenspan of a non-braking, standing wave on a sloping beach. General performance of the model for the analytical solutions is well and led to the following observation: numerical diffusion can lead to a decrease of run-up and run-down heights. Numerical dissipation factors that are indicate as influential on the results: the discretization of the geometry, the algorithm of flooding of dry cells, artificial viscosity. An analysis of the different wave-structure interaction processes is performed, by studying not only wave run-up, but also wave run-down, reflection and visual inspection of the type of wave breaking. Simulations are performed with regular waves, three different slopes are used (of 1:3, 1:4 and 1:6). In combination with seven different wave conditions, this gives a wide range of breaker parameters. The results are compared with data from experimental model tests of Schuttrumpf and Bruun and Gunbak. The results with respect to wave run-up are convincing, having very good resemblance with data of physical experiments, especially for breaking waves. Nevertheless, for non-breaking waves, the computed wave run-up values are in the lower regions of the experimental data. For these waves, the (relative) numerical dissipation is too high during structure-wave interaction. The numerical dissipation due to the discretization of the geometry is indicated as the main cause of the lower wave run-up heights as compared with experimental data. The results concerning wave run-down are less convincing than the run-up results. The relative wave run-down is overestimated (hence the lowest water level reached in the simulations is lower than in the experiments) compared to experimental data, especially in the region of breaking waves. No clear explanation is found for the lower values. The answer may lay in the different physical characteristics of wave run-up and run-down or the difference in handling of flooding and drying of cells by the numerical model. The calculated reflection coefficients show good resemblance with data from physical experiments, showing that the right amount of wave energy is reflected at the structure. Overall it can be stated that the model is well able to accurately represent different wave-interaction processes including wave run-up and the model proved to be robust for this type of simulations.","ComFLOW; VOF-model; Run-up; Run-down; Numerical modeling; wave-structure interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Environmental Fluid Dynamics","",""

(mentor)","2010","Prototyping Systems on Chip (SoC) on FPGA technology improves the time that the de- signer needs to spend in the verification stage when developing new systems or upgrading the existing ones. However, FPGA prototyping is very challenging due to the few resources available in this chips, and often the large designs do not fit into one single FPGA. Since Net- works on Chip (NoC) are used as SoC interconnects, extending them for offering communication services between two different chips will solve the problem. This work explores how a bridge can extend the NoC while providing Quality of Service (QoS) to the applications. After a detailed investigation of the NoC protocol stack, we found that the best layer for placing the bridge was at the transport layer. Here, the bridge multiplexes several NoC connections on an off-chip link, with data granularity of words. The bridge offers QoS by means of TDM scheduling and a credit-based mechanism preserves the end-to-end flow-control offered by the NoC. Software and hardware implementations of this bridge are tested and verified showing that they are fully func- tional. Moreover, two different NoC configuration procedures are developed, so the SoC resources can be monitored from an external host. Finally, this work concludes that it is possible to extend a NoC over more than one single chip without loosing the QoS and hiding the complexity of the off-chip link to the applications.","network on chip; NoC; system on chip; SoC; bridge; FPGA; prototyping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","The threat of flooding is of great concern to many countries and significant resources are spent to deal with this threat. A better understanding of the motivation of organizations responsible for flood control and their reasons for selecting certain modes and targets can help improve the decisions to allocate resources in the fight against flooding. The fundamental question addressed in this paper is: “How to identify the strategic capabilities of the flood control domain?” This question is addressed through engineering of a new generic approach which utilizes two methodologies of enterprise engineering discipline namely DEMO and CBM in a hybrid fashion. This approach is realized in the form of the SBCI-method which is an approach that allows the representation of the organization of the enterprise in terms of its essential building blocks, in which it is possible to identify those building blocks which are of strategic relevance. We take the view that preferences for actions are based on their values and beliefs. An important missing piece in our knowledge of these preferences is an understanding of their relevance and position in the construction of the system that is suppose to realize them. This paper uses a novel approach to determine these values and beliefs by determining them in full isolation from the systems that need to realize them, by using principles from enterprise engineering discipline and policy analysis paradigm. Hence instead of interviewing decision makers and stakeholders within organizations, as would be normal in policy analysis, we extract the objectives by examining the policy documents. And structure them in terms of strategic, business, and means objectives. These objectives are then mapped to the building blocks of the domain that is supposed to be responsible for their successful realization. This information is useful for understanding flood domain organizations motivations, intent, and likely actions, as well as for developing solutions to counter the threat of flooding.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Information Architecture","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","Geothermal energy is increasingly being explored as an attractive renewable energy source. In recent years several geothermal energy projects have been developed in the Netherlands reflecting growing governmental, industrial and scientific interests. Increasing the use of renewable energy is high on the policy agenda world wide. The degree varies to which governmental policies have been successful, but overall social acceptance has been recognized as crucial to the achievement of renewable energy targets. The Dutch geothermal community has also become aware of the need to take social awareness of its activities seriously, and the extent to which these activities are regarded as acceptable by lay publics. The Geothermal Energy Platform in its capacity of advocating geothermal energy and assisting geothermal project development has recognized the need to be prepared for the expected substantial rise in geothermal projects with the associated increase in the visibility of geothermal facilities, the public awareness of their presence and any disadvantages perceived to be involved. It has commissioned a communication strategy which is aimed at achieving social acceptance of geothermal energy and which takes into account the specific characteristics of this renewable energy source. Social acceptance is an often used term in the practical policy literature on renewable energy and has become a value-laden politicized concept with many dimensions. Despite a range of studies being carried out on public attitudes towards renewable energy technologies, genuine understanding of the dynamics of public acceptance remains elusive. From a citizen or consumer point of view, acceptance might signify positive approval, consent and active endorsement, but it might otherwise signify acquiescence, resignation and passive compliance because rejection or resistance is infeasible. From the standpoint of the advocate or promoter of a new technology, acceptance of any description might be sought, although it can be assumed that a more active form might be preferred by stakeholders because it appears to confer legitimacy. The first part of this report is devoted to uncovering the findings of psycho-social research into various aspects of social acceptance. By comparing the implementation processes of different but related renewable energy technologies clues have been found on societal developments which are considered relevant for geothermal energy. The various issues related to a geothermal project, i.e. topics that may be debated by stakeholders and may require settling, are grouped into three discourses: the siting discourse (where geothermal technology is experienced in terms of a proposed construction of a geothermal facility in a given locality); the energy-innovation discourse (where geothermal technology is experienced as an innovation that may or may not fit in with preferred ways of life); and the investment discourse (where geothermal technology is experienced as an investment opportunity that may be acceptable, or not, in the light of the possible gains it will produce). To establish what acceptance of renewable energy is in terms of a psycho-social phenomenon various models for the public acceptance of technology have been explored. From these models a communication framework has been developed that shows how social acceptance of geothermal energy may be created among stakeholders and how this process can be managed using a series of steps which are to be incorporated into the development process of a geothermal project. Effective communication is crucial to facilitating and maintaining the acceptance creation and management process. In the advisory second part of this report considerations and recommendations have been drafted on the elements of a communication strategy for geothermal projects. It is stressed that any communication process requires a thorough preparation in which communication objectives are established, a stakeholder analysis is performed, an approach to communication is determined, and messages are formulated. When considering communication objectives it is important to distinguish between acceptance and active support. Acceptance may signify positive approval, consent and active support, but also acquiescence, resignation and passive compliance; active support may be expressed by actual positive behavior toward the project: co-operation with project officials, agreement to publicly voice support, or some form of co-financing. A well executed stakeholder analysis provides information about interests, knowledge, attitudes, points of resistance with respect to the geothermal project, and relationships and co-operations between stakeholders. The leading approach for a communication strategy for a geothermal project is to take its societal surroundings seriously. Whether this is sufficiently accomplished depends on all parties involved and significantly determines the difference between resistance and acceptance. To take the project surroundings seriously has its consequences for not only the communication process but also the project development process itself. Key words for successful messages about geothermal energy are: concrete thinking, local significance and repetition. It is essential to present specific, preferably visible effects of geothermal energy which are of interest to the societal surroundings of the project. Demonstrable environmental effects appeal more than abstract issues, like global climate change. In addition it is important to connect effects to the local project area. This includes naming locations with issues or problems caused by the project. Such openness is not only important during the early developmental stages of a geothermal project, but also during its exploitation phase. Measuring a level of acceptability or evaluating a communication process aimed at its advancement is expected to be a precarious enterprise. Finally, various evaluation criteria are proposed concerning the transfer of information, the expression of support for contested issues, and the communication process itself.","social acceptance; renewable energy; geothermal energy; communication strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Science Education and Communication","","","",""

(mentor); Luthi, S.M. (mentor); De Boer, P. (mentor); Marquez, X. (mentor); Janszen, A. (mentor)","2010","The island of Favignana provides an exceptional three-dimensional insight in the architecture of a Lower Pleistocene bioclastic calcarenite complex. Due to the degree of quarrying, a large amount of outcrops is available in the eastern part of the island. Two campaigns resulted in the logging of stratigraphic sections, recording of sedimentary structures and palaeo-transport orientations, analysis of the fossil content and the collection of samples in order to test the reservoir potential of the calcarenite - associated with foramol skeletal grain types. A correlation between palaeo-transport directions and the stratigraphic logs distributed over the whole fieldwork area led to a conceptual geological model. Sediments were generated in the shallow temperate water of the Mediterranean, and are subsequently transported and/or reworked by storm events. Deposition on top of the middle to Upper Pliocene Trubi clay most likely took place in a topographic low between the already existing mountainous structures of Favignana and the nearby Levanzo island. A system of large scours characterised the depositional processes - which are described by three phases - significantly. Propagation of the calcarenite complex was dominated by a southeastern direction, making the Favignana calcarenite complex a rare example in the Mediterranean, as comparable deposits in the area propagate on a shelf towards the open sea instead of towards a major land mass. The use of a multi-point statistics algorithm, which is a suitable option when a large dataset and a good conceptual model are available, led to the generation of a facies model. Based on the analysis performed on the calcarenite samples, the reservoir potential is high, with porosity values of up to 0.65 bulk rock fraction and a permeability of tens of darcy. Because the fieldwork area has never been buried to depth, little diagenesis - such as cementation, compaction and fracturing - has taken place. The Favignana calcarenite is believed to be a relevant and important analogue for a several carbonate hydrocarbon fields in various regions of the world such as South America and Middle East. The detailed understanding of sedimentary facies distribution, internal architecture and reservoir property variability can therefore assist to guide and/or optimize the development of those reservoirs. In particular, the Favignana calcarenite is thought to be a relevant analogue for the Perla gas field in Venezuela, a giant reservoir consisting of foramol carbonates, and the reservoirs formed by the Asmari limestone in the Zagros basin.","Sicily; sedimentology; bioclastic calcarenite; cool-water carbonates; foramol; high energy shelf; multi-point statistics; reservoir modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-01-06","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Department of Geotechnology","","Section of Applied Geology","",""

(mentor)","2010","Modern embedded systems are far to complex to describe their hardware and software at a low-level of abstraction. SystemC is a popular modeling language which can be used to specify systems at a higher abstraction level. The primary way to deal with complexity in SystemC is to apply modularization. The module hierarchy of a SystemC model is dynamically constructed during the execution of the elaboration phase of the model. This means that a system designer can build regular structures using loops and conditional statements. Currently, SystemC tools can not cope with SystemC models for which the module hierarchy depends on dynamic parameters. We present a novel approach to extract the dynamically generated module hierarchy and its behavior from a SystemC model. In our approach the hierarchical information of a SystemC model is retrieved by executing the elaboration phase of the model under control of a debugger. Thereafter, the behavioral information of the model is retrieved by using a C++ compiler extension. Finally, the behavioral information is linked with the hierarchical information. Our approach is completely non-intrusive. The SystemC model and the SystemC reference implementation can both be used without any modification. The only precondition is that they both are compiled to include debug information. To identify the information which must be extracted by a SystemC front-end a SystemC metamodel is defined. This metamodel, models the module hierarchy of a SystemC model at the end of the elaboration phase. Currently, no other detailed SystemC metamodel has been published. We have implemented our approach in an open-source SystemC front-end called Systemc Hierarchy and Behavior Extractor (SHaBE). SHaBE can extract all relevant hierarchical information and a well defined subset of all behavioral information from a model. The implementation is based on open-source tools and is developed using a test-first approach during which more than 250 test cases were successfully implemented. To extract the module hierarchy from the model the source code of the SystemC reference implementation has been carefully analyzed to determine the function calls which need to be monitored. Breakpoints are placed on these function calls and crucial information is extracted by using debug commands to inspect the stack, the function arguments, the members of an object, etc. The extraction of the module hierarchy of the model has a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the number of SystemC objects used in the model. The behavior of the model is extracted by a compiler plug-in which extracts the abstract syntax tree in static single assignment form from the source code of the functions which define the behavior of the SystemC processes. The output of SHaBE is saved in an XML based format which describes the module hierarchy and the behavior of a SystemC Model. Presently, there is no other XML format available which can be used to describe the module hierarchy of a SystemC model as well as its behavior. This front-end facilitates the development of SystemC visualization, debugging, static verification, and synthesis tools.","SystemC; front-end; elaboration; module hierarchy; abstract syntax tree; debugger; compiler plug-in; system specification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Circuits and Systems","","","",""

(mentor); Van der Voort, H.G. (mentor); De Haan, A.R.C. (mentor); Mertens, F.J.H. (mentor); Kraus, J.J.A.M. (mentor)","2010","Medical technology is evolving at a remarkable rate, prompted by its major role in health care services. The Health Care Inspectorate monitors this technological advance and should take action whenever the quality of care and/or patient safety is at risk. Regulation is therefore inevitable. However, as far as the use of medical technology in care institutions is concerned, there are still some gaps. This research explores how a regulatory arrangement specifically aimed at the use of medical technology in hospitals could complement the Inspectorate?s current regulatory arrangement and how it should take form. The 2006 Twenteborg accident, claiming the life of a patient, served as the motive for this research, as it is a typical example of the complexity entailed in regulating the use of medical technology in hospitals. The main research question was therefore: ‘What amendments can be made in the Health Care Inspectorate’s regulatory arrangement to enhance patient safety when using medical technology in hospitals?’ In order to find the answer, the research included an analysis of the current regulatory arrangement of the Inspectorate, an analysis of several theories on regulation, a field analysis, and an analysis on the specific complexities entailed in regulating the use of medical technology. The research also included a design & evaluation phase, to make an assessment framework for a regulatory arrangement specifically aimed at the use of medical technology in hospitals and assess the Inspectorate?s current regulatory arrangement. The Inspectorate?s current regulatory arrangement includes a cycle of enforcement and three inspection instruments, namely phased, thematic and incident-based supervision. Medical technology is regulated by means of the Medical Devices Act and the Care Institutions Quality Act. The first act regulates the production and trade of medical devices and is thus essentially meant for manufacturers, whereas the latter regulates the use of medical technology, thus essentially regulating care institutions. In this way a clear distinction is made between supervision on the production and trade of medical devices and supervision on the use of these medical devices. However, actual practice has shown that it is hardly feasible to keep these two apart. The cycle of enforcement and the inspection instruments are based on three regulation theories namely system-based, risk-based and responsive regulation. Fundamental to the system-based regulatory approach is that the regulatee should have a self-regulatory capacity and thus aims for regulation on the system-level. The risk-based approach aims for selective regulation and requires the regulator to pick important problems and fix them?. The responsive regulation approach focuses on interventionist response and tries to establish a synergy between punishment and persuasion. Each theory has a number of opportunities and risks that need to be considered when applying them. Many of the risks or complexities that were identified in the theory were confirmed by the field analysis. The field analysis also provided some additional insights into other (practical) complexities. An analysis of the complexities has revealed that they are mostly created by the multi-actor environment, by organizational and technical issues, or by the formal obligations the Inspectorate has to comply with. An adequate regulatory arrangement and thus the standards of the assessment framework should be designed in such a way that the opportunities and the risks identified in the analyses of the theories and the field analysis should be reckoned with, in that one should try to gain advantages from the opportunities and try to reduce or prevent the risks. Furthermore, as the Inspectorate?s current regulatory arrangement consists of a combination of different regulatory theories, the assessment framework should also provide standards which enable a practicable combination of theories. Keeping the above in mind, I have designed an assessment framework. It is intended to serve as an assessment tool for the Inspectorate and can be interpreted as a normative checklist or guideline to verify if and the extent to which the standards are imbedded in the regulatory arrangement. Upon assessing the Inspectorate?s current regulatory arrangement by means of the assessment framework, a number of shortcomings were identified including communication issues, accountability issues and issues regarding the content and focus of the actual inspections. The recommendations to the Inspectorate therefore also include suggestions as to how to improve on these aspects. The general conclusion of this research is that the Inspectorate?s current regulatory arrangement still has a number of gaps, especially with regard to the use of medical technology in hospitals. These gaps can be narrowed by a more meticulous design of the regulatory arrangement. The general complexity of regulating the use of medical technology is mainly due to the multiplicity of aspects, each of which should be given careful consideration. The title of this report was inspired in the light of this complexity. Keep Your Eyes on the Prize is a warning that one should not lose sight of the main objective, which is the quality of care, with the focus on patient safety. The main recommendation is therefore to use the designed assessment framework as a guideline to gain perspective on regulating the use of medical technology in hospitals. It should be noted, however, that the designed assessment framework still needs some finishing touches, as it was not feasible to include them in the limited time frame of this research. The finishing touches include the aspects of a measurable assessment, which should enable the user to obtain a valuable rating of the situation, and the terms of reference, which should specify the usage. As medical technology is now also increasingly used in nursing homes, it may be worthwhile finding out if the assessment framework can also be applied in a wider setting than just hospitals.","assessment framework; regulatory arrangement; medical technology; regulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Safety Science Group","","Policy, Organization, Law & Gaming; Policy Analysis","",""

(mentor); Mooi, H.G. (mentor); Groenleer, M.L.P. (mentor)","2010","Large infrastructure projects in the Netherlands are often subject to discussion due to large time and cost overruns. Project management instruments are developed by the projects for the efficient management of time, cost and scope. These collections of methods, tools and approaches are often modified and further developed when projects face problems and situations that are not encountered before. When projects find solutions for problems in the complex world of large infrastructure problems, other projects might benefit from these developments as well. However, the literature study in this thesis shows that projects often re-invent the wheel instead of learning from other projects. Therefore, the main research question in this master thesis is to what degree the large infrastructure projects in the Netherlands share and implement knowledge about their developed instruments, and what might be the possible barriers that disturb this process of inter-project learning. First, a literature study is performed where all topics in the area of organizational learning, knowledge management, inter-project learning and learning barriers are explored. The findings of this study are used to develop a framework that can be used to describe the knowledge activities that are performed by the projects in the process of inter-project learning and the barriers that prevent that projects learn from each other. This framework connects learning processes inside projects with learning processes between different projects. The framework identifies four steps of knowledge activities: creation of knowledge, evaluation of knowledge, sharing of knowledge and implementation of knowledge. The barriers are present in the framework between the ‘share’ and the ‘implement’ steps and are grouped in four categories: social, organizational, project-related and knowledge- related. The developed framework is used in case studies where 14 large infrastructure projects in the Netherlands are researched. Project managers and operational project managers (managers projectbeheersing) of these projects are interviewed in order to find out which instruments are developed in the projects, how the projects deal with the knowledge activities in the four steps of the framework and what the possible barriers to learning are. The findings show that the two barriers that are identified most are the uniqueness of projects that makes it difficult to implement knowledge from a project with a different context and the lack of a higher level knowledge management system, that establishes knowledge connections between the different projects in a structured way. The main conclusions that can be drawn from this research are that all kinds of project management instruments are developed and that the projects are willing to share these developments with other projects. However, they are not able to see which knowledge is required in the other projects. A recommendation is to let the functional organizations use a higher level knowledge management system. People or a department from the functional organization that are on a higher level above the individual projects, should fulfill the role of ‘knowledge broker’. By having contact with the projects on a regular basis, they keep an overview of the knowledge supply and the knowledge demand. With this system, projects that can learn from each other are connected in a structured way, based on the overview of created knowledge in one project and the problems that are faced in the other project. Inter-project learning would also be more effective when more knowledge is transferred between projects that are in the same project phase, instead of only transferring knowledge between new projects and projects that are already in a later phase or are even completed. Knowledge transfers between projects that are in the same phase are more effective because direct interaction is possible, even as sharing of tasks and mutual adjustment.","project management; inter-project learning; knowledge management; learning barriers; infrastructure; public projects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Management of Technology","","Management of Technology","",""

Apache communities are groups of individuals that organize their code production efforts in order to develop enterprise-grade open source software. The ASF explains the success of its communities and the software they produce by claiming to have instituted a meritocracy that brings contributors together in a way that significantly influences code production, namely by building communities instead of only focusing on technical properties of the source code like modularity. Self-organization theory has found that the role of institutions is minor. In this research we test and confirm the theory of self-organization, and find that the meritocracy institution does not influence code production.","open source; self-organization; institutionalization; management of innovation; management of technology; software management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Policy, Organization, Law and Gaming","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor); Smulders, F.E.H.M. (mentor)","2010","In the world of communication a lot of developments are emerging and consumers have the need for faster communication. There are increasingly more ways of communicating with each other and the developments for these new ways of communicating are not stopping. What will be the way of communicating in the upcoming five years? That is a question many companies in the telecom sector are struggling with; should they proceed in offering telecommunication solutions for companies or should they focus on new markets? The main challenge of this research project is to find out what the telecom market will look like until 2015 and which services or technologies are expected to be important at that moment. As a case study, the company I-Plus is used, which is a company operating in the business to business communication sector. Therefore the main research question for this case study will be; how should the future service portfolio of I-Plus take shape in the next 5 years, taking into consideration the most relevant technological developments and what measures should I-Plus take to develop that future service portfolio? To answer the research questions, first the current and future service communication sectors have been analyzed, looking at the current and future market and technologies and their lifecycles, which is designed into a vision for the service communication sector until 2015. The communication market of 2015 will be focussing on large cooperations with a lot of niche companies or on the other hand a lot of medium sized companies which all provide the necessary wants on needs of the consumer. The IT sector will be in a high level of development, but can collapse at any moment when not being reliable and secure to the consumer. The vision of the market in 2015 shows that the future communication market will still be growing, but that the consumers trust will be doubtful in the future economy. Therefore a lot of research is needed in the future to keep analyzing what the consumer wants or needs. I-Plus’ current strategy aims at distinguishing itself from their competitors, because the company has a way of analyzing their clients problem in a simple and clear way. The experience from the CEO of I-Plus helps to analyze these problems even faster, which helps in staying ahead of the game. The current service portfolio of I-Plus provides their customers with national and international service numbers, which are both divided into two group, toll free and premium rate numbers. I-Plus offers different solutions to every company in the form of facilities to contact numbers to meet desired functionalities for their clients. According to I-Plus their benefits are:  I-Plus offers connections with 100 different countries over the world.  With I-Plus companies can generate worldwide revenue with their Premium Rate Number.  I-Plus offers competitive pricing and automated solutions to reduce costs.  The solutions I-Plus provides aim to deliver improvement to the client satisfaction.  I-Plus’ IVR manager and real-time online dashboard provide their clients full control over all incoming calls.  I-Plus gives its clients full control over all their services and provides them with the tools and solutions to maximize efficiency. Next to these benefits I-Plus works together with telecom carriers around the world, to ensure the highest possible uptime. In case a power outage or any other disruptions, I-Plus automatically reroutes the phone traffic to a pre-determined back up destination. In general I-Plus focuses on communication services and wants to expand its services. The medium and long-term goals show that I-Plus wants to discover new areas where they can offer their services and distinguish itself from competitors. I-Plus preferably wants to develop a completely new market and find other (eager and ambitious) people who can help them with this new direction. There are different types of technology roadmaps that can used to design a clear path for the future. The general roadmap that is used for these kind of research projects is the product technology roadmap, which is driven by product/process needs. But there is also another type of technology roadmap, which is the emerging technology roadmap. There are fourteen different types of emerging technology roadmaps that have been identified and that can be used to further develop the roadmaps for I-Plus and its future strategies. The emerging technology roadmap that is most suited for this research is the program planning roadmap with a multiple layers format, because this shows the technological developments separate from the project flow and therefore shows a clear overview of what steps I-Plus needs to take in the upcoming 5 years. The program planning roadmap with multiple layers has been further developed and integrated with the future possible scenarios in the telecom market of 2015. The roadmap that has been developed for the selected scenario 1 (vertical business model) for I-Plus to adopt their service portfolio in the period until 2015, focuses on a niche market. The steps I-Plus should take in this period are to consider whether they want to proceed in consulting. When I-Plus proceeds in consultancy, it should focus on providing different new services to their clients and divide their clients into specific categories, ranging from somewhat important to very important e.g. from bronze to gold. In this way different companies will be able to purchase different consultancy packages, which offer different kinds of services and support. Proceeding with establishing a new market for themselves, in scenario 2 (horizontal business model), with the green-IT and home health monitoring I-Plus should invest in innovation, employees and new partners. Considering that the health monitoring and green-IT sector are not that easy to target on your own, because I-Plus is does not possess the expertise on her own, it is recommended that I-Plus does research into finding a partner to start in these sectors. Both implementations include a lot of unreliable factors and risks, but when the research into these new areas is conducted properly I-Plus can start offering new innovative services. With the health care products I-Plus can establish a blue ocean market for herself, which she wants according to her future wishes.","communication; design; roadmap; future; telecommunications; service-portfolio; technological; developments","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-12-10","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","Spectroscopic observations of a large number of galaxies in the far-infrared are critical in the study of galaxy evolution. These observations are difficult at the moment, because of the lack of good far-infrared (FIR) detector technology. Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) are showing promising results to fill this void. A common MKID design is the antenna-coupled coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonator patterned in a superconducting film. These resonators are extremely sensitive to changes in the Cooper pair density. FIR photons are energetic enough to break Cooper pairs. This means a superconducting resonator can be used as a pixel for a FIR camera. The inherent multiplexing advantage of MKIDs means they can easily be fabricated in arrays of up to 5000 pixels. By putting such an array in the SAFARI instrument on the cooled SPICA telescope a blind spectroscopic survey that can detect Milky Way sized galaxies out to redshift z = 2 will be possible. However, to achieve background limited performance on a cooled telescope like SPICA the sensivity of MKIDs needs to be improved by at least an order of magnitude. This project aims to investigate if this can be achieved by reducing the width of the CPW to much below what has typically been made using optical lithography (> 1 ?m). CPW resonators with a central line width as narrow as 300 nm were made in NbTiN using electron beam lithography and reactive ion etching. Using this fabrication method NbTiN resonators with a central line width varying between 0.3 ?m and 3 ?m were made. These resonators were used to do a systematic study of the width dependence of the kinetic inductance fraction, quality factor, responsivity, read-out power, noise and NEP. It is shown that the width dependence of all these properties does not change down to 300 nm. Encouraged by these results two prototype submicron pixel arrays were made in aluminum. These showed sensitivities comparable to resonators with a few micron wide CPW. The main reason for this lack of sensitivity improvement is the lower maximum read-out power of submicron wide aluminum resonators. Based on these results power handling seems a key issue that will determine if submicron resonators are a viable route to improve the MKIDs sensitivity. These results of this project indicate that aluminum has a different width dependence of its power handling compared to NbTiN. Therefore, a systematic study of submicron resonators in aluminum, which focuses on the power handling, is required.","superconductivity; resonators; kinetic inductance detector; noise equivalent power","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Quantum Nanoscience","","Physics of NanoElectronics","",""

(mentor); Desmet, P.M.A. (mentor)","2010","This graduation project is aimed at improving the liveability of the Afrikaanderwijk by using the Design for Social Impact [DSI] method. Within the Netherlands, there is a large number of post war suburbs that face an accumulation of problems such as a high unemployment rate, neglected housing facilities, crime and a lack of social networks or contacts. The Afrikaanderwijk is one of these so called ‘Vogelaarswijken’, located in the district Feijenoord in Rotterdam Zuid. The Afrikaanderwijk was built in the late 19th century during the development of Rotterdam’s city harbours and is one of the Netherlands’ first multicultural residential areas. Vestia, the housing corporation responsible for over 85% of the housing in the Afrikaanderwijk wants to improve the quality of life within this neighbourhood. An important element of their plans is an urban renewal project, which involves 15 years of demolition, forced relocation, annoyance and constructional activities. By using the DSI method I was able to have the desired social impact as a starting point for design. By first looking at a societal context and the impact you want a product to have on this context, it is possible to subsequently design a product -interaction- stimulating this behaviour. The DSI method is based on this approach. Therefore, the aim of this project is to design a product which intends to improve the quality of life within the Afrikaanderwijk by realizing a specific social impact. This project was a part of the doctoral research of Ir. N. Tromp on this method. By applying the DSI method to the case of the Afrikaanderwijk, she was able to evaluate the applicability of the method. Aimed Societal Impact: Because of the (cultural) segregation within the neighbourhood and its habitation of entire families, the Afrikaanderwijk knows strong but small communities, which lead to a strong social attachment to the neighbourhood. Physically, residents seem to have only little attachment to the area; it is not so much the current physical environment of the neighbourhood, but the people that live here and the built memories over time which create pride and connectedness with the Afrikaanderwijk. This project wants to stimulate this physical attachment to the neighbourhood so people will also feel connected with their physical home environment, to trigger a feeling of responsibility and rootedness. With the upcoming renewal plans, and related changes, there is a risk of people losing this feeling of attachment. Instead of being a threat, residents can be stimulated to open up to the neighbourhood dynamics and incorporate the newly built environment in their habitat. This physical attachment can be created by explorative and personalising behaviour. Product: The welding works project is an integrated approach for improving the position and prospects of the local youth in the Afrikaanderwijk. While offering free welding courses, they get the opportunity to acquire a welding certificate and design their own fences which will be placed around the construction site within their neighbourhood. The fences are inviting residents towards the construction site instead of simply trying to keep them out. This way, the product stimulates personalization and exploration of the redevelopment activities within the neighbourhood. This way, the product responds to the concerns of three different parties; the certificate offers the local youth a qualification increasing their chances on getting a job or education, related residents have a personal connection to the redevelopment plans which increases their sense of rootedness and finally, Vestia has a positive solution for the upcoming years of fenced in spaces in their environment and a new way to find exposure for their commitment to the neighbourhood.","social; impact; neighbourhood; quality of life; urban redevelopment; fence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2010","With an increasing population in the Netherlands, people started to live relatively close to the primary road network. This led to major noise hindrance issues. As a solution it was decided to apply porous asphalt surfaces on the primary road network. These types of surface layers have a relatively open structure compared to traditionally applied dense asphalt mixtures. Application of porous surfaces brings along their first major advantage: noise reduction. A second major advantage of porous asphalt layers is an increased safety during rainfall. Due to its open structure water is stored and moved horizontally within the layer which reduces splash and spray effects and thus increases the visibility of drivers during rainfall. On the other hand the major disadvantage of porous asphalt layers is durability. The decisive factor for the relative short lifetime of porous asphalt is the loss of aggregates from the surface, also known as ravelling. This type of distress leads to a rough surface and decreases the material’s noise reduction potential. Further on the loosened particles cause damage to cars. In the winter ravelling develops at a much higher speed. This results in totally damaged sections as was noticed during the winter of 2009/2010 in the Netherlands. In this research a recently developed Lifetime Optimization Tool for porous asphalt was used to find out why different sections of the primary road network showed this type of excessive damage. Therefore LOT required information about the load, geometry and the response of these failed porous asphalt sections. In this research eight different sections were studied. The required input for LOT was determined directly from these eight sections. The results showed that in the winter the main cause for this increase in damage is caused by the reduced relaxation potential of the mortar of the mixture. Further on the calculated performance of the eight different sections was compared with the observed performance during the winter of 2009/2010 and it was shown that they were in good agreement with each other. From this it was concluded that the Lifetime Optimization Tool is capable of explaining winter damage of porous asphalt concrete","ravelling; porous asphalt; winter damage; LOT","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Road and Railroad Engineering","",""

The project was executed at Royal Philips Electronics, Amsterdam. The project dealt with the dilemmas of ironing faced by the users, especially using Ironing steam generators. The goal of the project was to design innovative Ironing steam generator for the year 2013. The target group assigned for this project were females aged between 25~35 with families. An assortment of methods were used to identify the user needs and gather in-depth insights into the usage of Ironing steam generators, for example: Observations, Home placements, Interviews and questionnaire. The research concluded that the users desire to have simplicity in their product and the associated functions. The water tank and cord/hose storage posed the biggest problems, technology was the last factor the users were interested in improving upon. The proposed solution Ironaire solves many of the dilemmas faced by the user. The main proposition is to convert the complete surface of the ironing steam generator into a water tank. This gives users the benefit of longest ironing time between re-fills and 360 degree view of the water level while ironing. The surface is also utilized to store the hose thereby improving the efficiency of the total volume. The iron design is very sleek , dynamic and is designed to give perception of speed. All the controls for steam and temperature control are on the nose of the iron along with LCD (dashboard/cockpit). This gives user improved control and feedback of the functions of the steam generator. The product was tested for various fundamental design elements and found to be very appealing, modern which could stand out in the shelves. The base was appreciated more relative to the iron, the iron was considered too smooth and sleek to remove the tough wrinkles.","iron design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-12-10","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

Shell factors play an important role in the analysis of these piles with 2-dimensional (2D) design methods. This study investigates if the limitations of a 2D method, in relation to the 3-dimensional reality, can be covered by shell factors. Starting points for this study were the conclusions from the recently published CUR-report 228: Ontwerprichtlijn door grond horizontaal belaste palen. First, by a literature study and an analysis of current 2D-methods, the role of shell factors in these methods is investigated. It appears that shell factors are being used in different ways, to take care of different 2D limitations, depending on the method. In current design practice, this difference in function of the shell factor is often not taken care of. Second, a PLAXIS 2D finite element model is made to calculate shell factors. With this model a parameterstudy is been executed, in which the influence of the following parameters on the value of the shell factor is been determined:  Horizontal soil stress;  Soil parameters: soil stiffness, cohesion and angle of internal friction;  Pile diameter and pile shape;  Size of the relative pile-soil displacement. A single pile is being considered, and time-dependant factors (consolidation and creep) are being neglected. Finally, a calculation is made with a 2D method, with calculated shell factors. The results are validated on the measurements of a laboratory test. From the study, it can be concluded that it is possible to make good predictions of bending moments in piles, with the use of correct shell factors. Because the study is executed with a 2D model, validation with a 3D finite element method is necessary. Further investigation of the time-dependant aspects, such as creep, is highly recommended.","Shell factor; pile; foundation; soil displacement","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-12-15","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

The purpose of this tool is to provide novice and expert users with inspirational material during a brainstorm session. When a closer look is taken at creativity in general and the creative process in specific, the idea generation phase is an interesting phase for this tool.

Providing the users with inspirational material is in service of the total session and it should not interfere with it. Speech recognition was researched as an input, but proved to be unsuitable for this tool. Instead of spoken out words as an input, the users will provide the tool with tagged photos. This is achieved by means of a sensitizing assignment. The results of this assignment are used twofold: the photos are projected on a wall and the tags are used to create an associative chain of images. The final prototype that was evaluated during the different evaluation setups is named MUSE.

(mentor)","2010","Based on satellite observations of Earths time variable gravity field from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), it is possible to derive variations in terrestrial water storage. Tiny variations of gravity from monthly into a decade time scales are mainly due to redistributions of water mass inside the surface fluid envelops of our planet (Ramillien et al., 2008). This allows us to derive variations in TWS (Terrestrial Water Storage) from satellite observations of the gravity field. Firstly, the Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and the Ensemble Kalman smoother (EnKS) have been applied to assimilate the GRACE TWS variation data into the HBV-96 model, a conceptual rainfall-runoff model over the Rhine river basin. Based on prior work on this field, in this thesis it was intended from the very beginning the improvement of methods used, starting from the study period, which was extended from February 1st 2003 to December 26st 2006. Afterwards, newer versions of TWS variation estimates were inferred from three sets of GRACE solutions, one from DEOS TU Delft, and another from CSR - University of Texas. A third dataset named as RBF, based on radial basis function was also included. All of the solutions use different filtering methods which yield different estimates. The following step was to change the state vector and how it is updated. In this way a more realistic method for the individual stores of the Terrestrial Water Stores was used. Finally the Ensemble Moving Batch Smoother have been applied to assimilate the GRACE data into the HBV-96 model. This new assimilation smoother uses observations beyond the estimation time, which are also useful in the estimation.","GRACE; Data Assimilation; Ensemble Kalman Filter; Ensemble Kalman Smoother; Ensemble Moving Batch Smoother","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Resources Department","","Msc Geomatics","",""

(mentor); Visser, A.A. (mentor)","2010","The purpose of this project was to create a product service system (PSS) that enhances the social cohesion in a slum community. This report presents the analysis and proposes an approach to develop such a social cohesive product service system, concluding with an example of how the approach works. Social Cohesion is a concept to describe the bonds or “glue” that brings people together in society. It relates to how well people and communities get on together for the benefit of all. It will stimulate socio-economic progress, which is important for people living in developing countries to have a better chance for the future. However the level of community bonding and actions are declining nowadays in slum communities. This project aims at developing a PSS that can enhance the social instead of breaking it down. A context research is performed to create an understanding of the surroundings and users of the PSS that will be developed. Three fictive households are created to gain more empathy with the target group. Next, the theory of social cohesion is explored, which is a multifaceted concept concerning tangible and intangible needs of the community. A dream vision is created which represents the ideal outcome of a good social cohesion. This is a balance between multiple factors: belonging, inclusion, participation, recognition, safety and trust. There is found that the ‘context factors’, these are the basic necessities in life (e.g. health, housing, employment), form the base of social cohesion. Next empowerment and participation of the community play a major role in social cohesion. Making use of the strengths of networks already available and stimulating interaction are other important aspects of stimulating the social cohesion. When stimulating these aspects the outcome will be an enhanced social cohesion. Since participation plays a major role in developing a PSS some research in done into the theory of motivation. It becomes clear that there is a ‘sustainable’ motivation required to generate a long-term participation of the community, this includes a positive intrinsic motivation. Based on the previous finding a list with considerations for the PSS in developed. Combining the findings of social cohesion and motivation led to a three stepped approach for creating a social cohesive product service system for a slum community. First, determine a social cohesive direction by finding a gap in the needs and actual situation of the community regarding the context factors. Second, involve all elements of the community and search for ways in which they can contribute to the PSS. Third, find out what can be a motivation for the residents to participate in the PSS. Combining the outcome of these three steps will lead to a creation of a social cohesive PSS concept. The residents of the slum are the experts; they know best how things work in their community. When using this design approach it is important to involve the residents (co-creation) intensively in each step of the approach. This will also contribute to the empowerment and motivation of the residents. To demonstrate the design approach a waste management system is developed. This is done without real end-users, which have normally a major influence. A concept is created in which the community is rewarded for handing in their waste properly. The residents can save coins for entertainment at the community center. A strong point of this concept is that the whole community benefits from the money that is made with the waste. The design approach is evaluated on theory and assumptions from experts. And in theory this proposed approach will lead to an enhancement of the social cohesion within the slum community. However if the approach really creates a social cohesive PSS can only be tested in practice.","social cohesion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor); Bosch, J.W. (mentor); Broere, W. (mentor); Jutte, A. (mentor); Staverman, T.A. (mentor)","2010","The underground space in the Netherlands contains a large number of infrastructure networks. The sewer network, which plays a vital role in our public health system, is one of these. Sewer networks in the Netherlands have different ages and show different levels of deterioration. The various components of sewer networks will have to be repaired, renovated or replaced at some point in their lifetime in order to restore their condition. During the last years there have been many developments in this field and nowadays there are many techniques available for repair, renovation and replacement of sewer pipes. Repair techniques treat defects in certain pipe sections that are deteriorated or damaged. Renovation (or rehabilitation) techniques increase the lifespan of the existing pipe by applying a new liner within the existing pipe. Finally, replacement techniques replace the old pipe completely by a new pipe. Within these three categories there are many techniques available. These techniques differ greatly in required level of investment, nuisance to the surroundings, risks and so forth. The question which technique is most suitable for a certain component at a certaint time is essential for sewer asset managers. There is however insufficient knowledge available in the local governmental organisations that are responsible for sewer maintenance, which results in sub-optimal decisions being made. Budget for operation and maintenance activities of sewer systems is limited, therefore it is essential that the decision making process is optimised and the available public money is spent in the best possible way. This research has looked into the question how asset management of sewer networks in the Netherlands can be optimised. This was done by first looking at the current state of decision making and the limitations it has. There are many tools available in different countries that are aimed at sewer networks. A number of these supports the decision making process regarding choice of techniques for sewer pipes. These support tools are often aimed at only very few aspects of the overall decision making process or they are based on local data and thus not usable for other locations. In the Netherlands there is no general tool available that can support the sewer asset managers. The tools that were investigated are too limited to use as a basis for an integral tool for the Dutch situation. The most ideal solution would be to develop a new tool from scratch that includes all important aspects and insights.In order to construct such an integrated tool it is vital to understand which aspects should be taken into account and what the relations between these aspects are. This report offers an extensive overview of all these aspects and how these should be implemented in a decision support tool. During the course of this research these insights were integrated into a new decision support tool. As said before, there are many different techniques available for repair, renovation and replacement of sewer pipes. Techniques that are available in the Netherlands have been investigated and their characteristics have been collected. In total 17 techniques are included in this research; this includes five repair techniques, nine renovation techniques and three replacement techniques (including open-cut replacement). Available techniques for manholes and house connections are also shortly discussed, but sewer pipes are the focus of this research. In order to make an objective comparison between various possible solutions for a sewer project, it is important that all costs and values that are generated by the various solutions are included. Decisions are often based on the lowest direct costs since these can be quantified and have a direct effect on the expenses that municipalities face. This traditional approach has a major flaw; the external costs that are generated by sewer works are not taken into account. Especially in dense urban environments these external costs can far outweigh the direct costs. Public organisations should thus be aware of these costsand use a sustainable approach when deciding which solution is most suitable for a certain project. This means that there should always be a balance between economic, social and environmental interests. An overview of external cost categories was created, which shows the various effects that should be taken into account. External effects are difficult to express in costs, but this does not mean that they should be ignored! For a number of external effects there are already values or calculation methods available, other effects will need to be researched. Not only various types of costs are required for a good comparison, but added value should also be taken into account. Some techniques may offer added value compared to other techniques, which can distinguish them in the decision making process. A number of above ground and subsurface added value items has been included in the decision support tool.Only when all these costs and values are included it is possible to the determine the real costs of various alternatives. The decision can then be made based on the lowest real costs. Every project is unique and has specific local conditions that should be considered when looking at which solution is most suitable. The developed decision support tool should be able to take these conditions into account when deciding which costs are generated and which techniques are possible. Specific project can be easily entered into the developed model. An effort has been made to construct an overview of the most important considerations that should be included in the decision making process. These considerations have been linked to cost components (both direct and external) that are generated when the considerations are answered in certain ways. The idea is that when the sewer asset manager uses these considerations as a check list, it is no longer possible to forget important items and he is able to get a complete overview of relevant cost components. The considerations have been divided into nine categories, which are combinations of three decision levels (strategic, tactical and operational) and three aspects (economic, environmental, social). In order to look at long-term investment strategies, the usershould have more information than only the previously mentioned overview of cost factors for a single repair, renovation or replacement. In order to determine at what time in the future which technique should be applied, it is necessary to know the condition of the considered asset at every point in time. Futhermore a calculation method should be used to take future cash flows into account. Both these items were added to the tool as a preliminary module. Condition prediction of sewer pipes is very difficult since the deterioration depends on local conditions. The achieved lifespans of sewer pipes vary greatly, making it unrealistic to use a single life expectancy for all sewer pipes. In order to be able to investigate long-term behaviour of various alternatives in the model, it was necessary to include some sort of condition prediction. Therefore a second degree curve was assumed to approximate deterioration behaviour. The condition prediction component was constructed with this theoretical curve and based on a number of assumptions regarding the effect of techniques on the condition of sewer pipes. The user can fill in a numberof variables, for example the condition level at which techniques should be applied. The program determines the change in condition for every year, subsequently it calculates in which years repairs, renovations or replacement activities are required. Now that the program knows in which years certain activities take place, it can compare cash flows by using a Life Cycle Costing approach. The cash flows of all alternatives are placed at a point in time and discounted to determine the Net Present Values. Note that his includes the external costs that were entered into the model. The solution with the lowest NPV is the solution with the lowest overall costs and should be chosen. In order to make sure that no vital aspects were forgotten, a case study was performed. This case study included two streets in a residential area of Amsterdam. These streets have various sewer pipelines in the underground with various characteristics. There were a number of errors and missing items found, which were improved or added afterwards. The case study showed that the tool covers the most relevant aspects. As long as the user understands the assumptions that were made and the limitations that exist, this tool can offer useful support to the decision making process. One of the biggest strengths of the developed tool is that it has a flexible design. Many parameters can be easily adjusted according to new insights and it is easy to add new components to the tool. This will prove invaluable when new research results become available. Concluding, this research presents a first step towards a fully integrated decision support tool for sewer networks. There are however still many topics in this broad field of knowledge that require more research. There is still a long way to go, but it is clear where the challenges can be found. Condition assessment and prediction are unreliable and should be thoroughly investigated. Future research will hopefully provide more accurate data, since there is little known about these processes at the moment. Furthermore it is important to look into cost figures for both direct and external costs. Once all external effects can be given cost values it is possible to determine the real costs of all alternatives for a project and the most optimal decision can be made. Sewer networks can be managed more efficiently when this tool is implemented and further improved. Large overall cost reductions can be expected, which will greatly benefit society and the environment.","asset management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction Processes","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","Alignment algorithms are used to find similarity between biological sequences, such as DNA and proteins. By aligning a sequence with a database, similar sequences can be found. These can be used to identify the source of a query sequence, to find commonalities between organisms, or to infer an ancestral relation. Various methods of performing biological sequence alignment exist, including dynamic programming and heuristic methods. Dynamic programming methods are guaranteed to find all optimal alignments, but are relatively slow; heuristic methods are faster but less precise. This thesis investigates the acceleration of one such optimal algorithm, the Smith-Waterman local sequence alignment algorithm, by using graphics processing units (GPUs). A fully functioning GPU-based protein database search tool was designed, implemented and optimized. The optimizations mostly concern the elimination of memory bottlenecks and the conversion of the database to a format well suited for GPU use. The final implementation offers the same features its CPU-based counterparts do, such as user configurable scoring and substitution matrix settings, and includes a web interface for convenient and remote usage. The performance of the GPU accelerated implementation was evaluated and compared to other solutions. It was found to attain a performance of more than 21 GCUPS (giga cell-updates of the Smith-Waterman score matrix per second) when searching the October 2010 release of Swiss-Prot on an NVIDIA Geforce GTX 275 GPU. With this performance, it is the fastest known GPU implementation on comparable hardware. It is also faster than the BLAST heuristic. However, the cost of purchasing a GPU, its power consumption, and the relative difficulty of maintaining a GPU software product are disadvantages of GPU acceleration.","sequence alignment; CUDA; GPU; Smith-Waterman","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-01-18","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Embedded Systems","",""

(mentor)","2010","This graduation project provides an answer to the question: “What user experience should be offered to the participants at what moment in the entire suborbital spaceflight experience?” by defining ‘a moment’ and designing the experience that should be offered at that moment. Abstract Despite the rapid development in the suborbital spaceflight industry commercial flights with passengers have yet to begin. There is still no clear vision on what the user experience for these spaceflight participants should be. Although the suborbital spaceflights will have a lot of similarities with other industries e.g. human spaceflight, theme parks and VIP aviation, as a whole it is a totally new experience. Because of this a spaceflight ticket holds more than ‘just’ the actual spaceflight, this also means that spaceflight companies should not presume that spaceflight participants will automatically be satisfied if the experience is basically just the activity. As there is no suborbital spaceflight with commercial participants to gain experience from, the question that remains unanswered is: “What user experience should be offered to the participants at what moment in the entire suborbital spaceflight experience?” This graduation project provides an answer to the question stated above by defining ‘a moment’ and designing the experience that should be offered at that moment. Context In the context phase of this project the suborbital spaceflights offered by Virgin Galactic are taken as a case to focus on. The future context of the entire spaceflight experience, starting with ‘thinking of buying a ticket’ and ending with the ‘reunion’, is represented as an Experience Flow. In the Experience Flow all the events and activities a spaceflight participant will experience are written down in individual scenarios. To know what impressions these events and occurrences have on the spaceflight participants different emotions are chosen to supplement the scenarios.?The ‘moment’ for which an user experience should be offered is defined as the actual spaceflight. Concept In the concept phase the user experience that should be offered during the actual spaceflight is constructed. A vision is created that addresses the desired surroundings, activities and emotions during the actual spaceflight, this vision states: ""I want the spaceflight participants to feel secure and alert, they immerse themselves in the experience without being distracted by the procedures."" Desired material- and social interaction qualities are listed and with an interaction metaphor product concepts are designed. Their specific functionality provide and enable the ideal experience. The designed experience of the actual spaceflight allows the 6 spaceflight participants to enjoy two different activities, looking outside and playing in zero-g, within one cabin. They feel secure and alert, as the procedures feel like one smooth flow of events so they can they immerse themselves in the experience without being distracted.","future context; manned spaceflight; ideal experience; experience flow; design; suborbital; virgin galactic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

Focus is on simulating the observed morphological changes for the post-jetty period of 1926-1958. The model is supplied with a high-resolution schematisation of river discharge and wave conditions in combination with a representative tide. Seasonal variations of the forcing conditions and their joint probability of occurrence are accounted for. Morphological acceleration techniques allow the simulations to stay with acceptable computation times. General patterns of erosion and sedimentation as a result of jetty construction as well as general bed level developments are represented by the model. Both the model and the observations show that jetty construction pre-dominantly pushed sediments from the inlet and the inner delta onto the outer delta. Differences in quantity and orientation are however present between the observations and the model. Despite the application of lower limit sediment transport calibration factors, a general overestimation of the morphological change is computed. Also, a wider and shallower inlet channel develops in the model. The interaction of the MCR with the adjacent coast is modelled to a limited extent only. Certain morphologically important physical processes may therefore still be missing in the model. The representation of forcing conditions responsible for morphological change at the MCR allows for optimization. Even though model results in this study do not fully simulate the observed morphological changes of the MCR yet, an important first step has been taken in the goal of simulating the long-term morphological change of the complex coastal area of the MCR. The products of this study provide a valuable base for continuing research.","Delft3D; long term morphodynamics; tidal delta; jetty construction; Columbia River","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

An architecture evaluation requires an up-to-date description of the architecture, which is often unavailable. In such a case, reverse engineering techniques can be used to recover it. For an effective and efficient recovery and evaluation of an architecture, the scope of the recovery should be narrowed to the parts of the system that are relevant for the evaluation and the recovered architectural views should be useful for a wide range of system stakeholders. This thesis presents a case study, in which these issues are addressed by using dynamic analysis and Prolog to recover architectural views. A survey involving representatives of several groups of stakeholders was conducted to assess the usefulness of a recovered view. The results show that the approach is potentially useful, but that more work is needed to further evaluate it and to make it more usable in practice.","dynamic analysis; reverse engineering; software architecture recovery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","","",""

This limited packet data capability of TETRA is used for the integration of the TETRA network with wireless mesh networks. The wireless mesh network used in this thesis work is part of the FIGO network. FIGO is a robust communication system mainly intended for public safety communications and it consists two main network parts. One of these parts is the wireless adhoc network which can be deployed on incident areas. The oher one is the infrastructure omponent (back office node) that is used to nterlink disconnected adhoc nodes and it can also offer access for controlling an incident in the adhoc network. The FIGO network uses different communication technologies to link the adhoc network with the back office node and the main aim of this thesis work is to integrate the TETRA network with the FIGO network so that the TETRA can be used as one of the links from the adhoc network to the back offie node of the FIGO network. The main problem of the TETRA-FIGO integration is that the wireless adhoc network generates a lot of control signals that can easily overload the narrowband packet data channel of the of the TETRA network. In addition to the control overheads, the excessive headers also contribute a lot of overheads to the narrowband TETRA channel. Two architectures are proposed in thesis report to integrate TETRA with the FIGO network and the performance of these two new proposed architectures is analyzed and compared with the existing FIGO network protocols in terms of control traffic and header overheads.","wireless mesh networks; TETRA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","WMC","",""

(mentor)","2010","In this thesis, an investigation is described to the measured horizontal displacements of a quay wall in the Port of Rotterdam. This quay wall was built in 2003 to replace an existing jetty. A combined tubular wall was installed and some of the concrete jetty piles were reused as foundation piles for the relieving platform. Anchorage for the quay wall is provided by an eight meter high continuous anchor wall, 38 meter behind the quay wall made of steel sheet piles. The connection between the two walls consists of high strength steel presetressed strands. Prior to describing the actual research in this report, measurements are considered that have been carried out over time on top of the quay wall. These measurements indicate that horizontal displacements increase nonlinearly in time. This trend was the reason for an investigation to all possible causes of the horizontal displacements of the combi wall. In this thesis, the research is discussed and possible causes of the measurements are revealed by considering one representative cross section of the largest part of the quay wall. The main part of this thesis deals with the investigation for possible causes of the measurements and is elaborated by considering the different influences for the representative cross section. Firstly, time dependent soil behaviour is examined. The Koppejan formula and the finite element method are used to determine the influences of consolidation and creep. Due to counteracting prestressing and gravity forces the effects in time due to consolidation and creep seems to be negligible. Secondly, the capacity of the anchor wall is investigated based on Coulomb’s theory and the finite element method. Due to a proven densification of the passive soil wedge, the capacity appeared to be sufficient. Subsequently, macro stability of the soil body between the anchor and combined wall (Kranz stability) is considered. Stability is proven to be sufficient by performing a hand calculation for the drained and undrained situation, followed by a verification calculation with a program based on the sub grade reaction method. Another considered possible cause is the difference in interpretation of the soil profile used in this report and the one used in the design. Therefore, a parametric study for the soil parameters is performed with the sub grade reaction method. These calculations show that the design profile resulted in larger deformations than a soil profile with expected values. Furthermore, it was decided to investigate the influence of the position and magnitude of a surcharge load. When the design load of 50kN/m2 is applied near the anchor wall, it was concluded from calculations that horizontal displacements are almost equal to the measurements. When a higher load is applied at positions further away from the anchor wall, again horizontal displacements appeared to be close to the measured displacements. Both the position and magnitude of loading are described as possible explanations for the measured deformations. Finally, it is concluded that saving money in the design stage by applying an anchor wall, resulted in more deformations than expected and made them dependent on the position of loading. Additionally, it is concluded that applying a higher load than was agreed upon in the terms of reference, resulted in more deformations than expected as well.","quay wall; anchor wall; cyclic loading","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-12-07","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Van Egmond, R. (mentor)","2010","This graduation report has the main purpose of making ExSilent’s development more efficient and predictable. In doing so it provides understanding on the current process and recommendations on the future process. From a literature study two distinct approaches in researching product development were found. Both of these approaches were found to be suitable for this project. Firstly, the rational analytical approach focuses on the steps taken in the process and searches for a standardized generic structure. Secondly, the constructive approach that questions the generalized or generic process. When applying a rational approach it was found that the Standard Operating Procedure —that prescribes how there should be developed— was criticized and did not suffice in aiding development . The procedure was not used during development, but it was primarily used to document development for regulatory approval. In analyzing how the actual development processes are executed in ExSilent two case studies showed that development is often unbound and milestones are missing or unclear in the development process. Prototypes play a dominant role and are the stepping stones in the dynamic execution of development. Formal prescription and actual developments differ. Moreover, the people in ExSilent also differ in their description of the development process. In applying a social constructive approach the development team was asked what the positive and obstructive events a the current development process are. From these events four problem areas were found. First, the non matching expectation to realizations between R&D en Marketing-Sales. Second, the chaotic materialization and unclear purpose of prototypes. Third, not having a clear objective or way to maintain focus. Fourth and last, the missing shared understanding of development as a whole. The discrepancies between formal, actual and individual product development and the four problem areas framed the core problem. The core problem is: Limited shared understanding of the product and process in development obstructs ExSilent’s development. The shifting between concrete representations (prototypes) and abstract reflection of them is chaotic and random. This obstruction limits the shared understanding on the process of combining knowledge. In providing the shared understanding multiple models were created that can be used as shared representations of the different aspects of product development. The aspects where shared understanding is to be created are: First, how the process is organized in terms of who should be involved. Second, what is the content of the project in terms of the developed product. Third and last, what is the process and how should development be executed. ExSilent can increase efficiency and predictability by early involvement of the user, retailer, manufacturing and marketing. Within the organization minimizing the chances of assumptions or unrealistic expectations and outside the organization to get feedback and insights on the product in development. Finding an agreement on what is being developed can be reached by discussing the to be developed product over three levels, (1.)What is the user’s benefit? (2.)What is the actual physical product? (3.)What is the augmented non physical product? Discussing them separately provides a shared understanding, focus and objectives. This in addition provides an opportunity for validating if the end product resembles the earlier stated objectives. The usage of intermediary objects (eg. prototypes) can be made more efficient by defining what ought to be tested, verified and/or validated with these objects. In executing a project, ExSilent should aim at determining a realistic project term. In addition to this report ExSilent is recommended to create shared objects that visualize: how development is organized, what is being developed, and what is the process and status of execution is in the steps taken, the steps planned and difference between them. ExSilent is provided different tools and a book on how these tools should be used in creating shared objects.","abstraction level; product development; hearing aids; organization; process","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Strategic Product Design","","","",""

(mentor); Van Egmond, R. (mentor)","2010","From previous research at Philips Research it was determined that sounds masking other, disturbing sounds, can be an aid for reducing sleep onset latency. This latency affects general sleep quality, which in turn has an effect on health. At least for the combination of the most disturbing sound with the most beneficial masking sound, sleep onset latency was significantly reduced. This project was to look into the relevant auditory parameters for such a masking sound. With the general setup for such a product being a generated masking sound through a speaker, and its adaptation being as automated as possible towards beneficial results, a selection of software and algorithms within it was made. Within MAX/MSP, a starting point was created for spectral adaptation. From psychoacoustics it was identified that for auditory masking, the model was to keep the spectrum of the masking sound as close to the disturbing sound as possible. From auditory scene analysis the workings of sounds forming a continuous stream identified. Current solutions do not take into account how a continuous stream of sound could be changed over time. More research into the workings of disturbing and masking sounds in this context was required. For reasons of completeness and possible broader implementation, such as a hospital context, all feasible sleeping situations considering adults with healthy sleep habits and no hearing disorders were reviewed. Determining the sounds and their workings meant looking into the field of product sound design and auditory masking. A context study into the sounds heard in the period surrounding and during sleep was held, leading to numerous examples of disturbing and beneficial sounds. It was found that for the type of sound heard the top-down parameters an important role. Attribution of meaning to sounds in the period of sleep onset led to the conclusion that recognition of a sound, and the extent to which a person accepts it in the specific sleeping situation, holds a big influence. It was decided to place both (clearly audible) music and speech out of scope for both masking and disturbing sound. A beneficial masking sound will have to meet both requirements as to form an improvement in the total sound situation whilst getting to sleep. Secondly, reviewing bottom-up effects, structuring of both beneficial and disturbing sounds was categorized. Finding an overlap between top-down beneficial sounds and described bottom-up masking effects, a selection of masking sounds was possible holding semantic descriptions (relaxing, calming, neutral, pleasant) and structuring (continuous, gradual changes). The latter has an overlap with assumptions of sounds drawing more or less attention following from auditory scene analysis. Psychoacoustics led to determination of frequency and sound pressure levels for optimal masking. All combined, it was found that neutral, continuous nature sounds should be used, adapting their frequency characteristics over time. Categorization of the disturbing sounds that were assumed relevant (considering occurrence and potential) for masking, was done to establish starting points to adapt the masking sound upon. The structuring was done based upon assumed steps to be undertaken for masking. This division (more easily adapted upon to more difficult to adapted upon) was; 1) Incidental, 2) Continuous, 3) Spectral and temporal varying 4) Soundscape. As to gain deeper insights into the workings of a masking and disturbing sound being heard at the same time, additional research was done. From the assumption that a masking sound reduces attention drawn by a disturbing sound while falling asleep, these effect were researched in the daytime during a selective attention task. On top of measuring performance, physiological response was measured and perceived aid self-reported. The sounds selected to be played during these tests were based upon previous research, and were assumed to provide insights into the ways at which structuring, spectral content, and attribution of meaning affect masking efficacy. The objective measures held no significant results towards which masking sound would be most beneficial for which disturbing sound. The self-reporting confirmed previous research however, with the sound of rain being perceived as the biggest aid. Furthermore, it was found to be consistently the greatest aid over the various structuring of disturbing sound. The insights into spectral and sound pressure level adaption were cross-referenced with existing auditory masking solutions. These could be found in the context of falling asleep, but also in the situation of open plan offices. While the first held examples of devices generating specific types of sounds that could be selected by the user, the choice of sound was mostly left to the end-user. The latter, open plan offices, was based upon one type of masking sound, adapted white noise, of which the spectrum is adapted to room acoustics and pre-determined spectra aiding in masking the most apparent ambient noise in such a space, namely speech. Adaptation of sound pressure level was however seen. Requirements were drawn up, consisting both of previous findings and ones that would still have to be validated. For the goal of combining both work on creating an functional adaptive model was done throughout the project. During the making of this model, a selection of solutions was made into specific ways of generation and adaptation. Considering the type of sound, it was chosen to adapt pre-sampled types of sound, since these were considered to give a more naturally sounding result. Considering adaptation both in the temporal and spectral domain, limits were set to determine up to which point the heard sounds were still considered natural (recognizable and acceptable adaptation over time). From creating and evaluating this prototype (which is both the adaptive model and the control device), feasibility of implantation in a product was also reviewed. This lead into insights into which components would suffice, and which algorithms are fast enough. The final evaluation was done based upon requirements that still needed to be validated. firstly showed that the target group for such a device is very specific. The four people used for the final test did not suffer from disturbing sounds, despite living in the most ‘noisy’ context identified from the study. The context of falling asleep plays a big role in what should be in the user’s control, and how the sound is perceived. (Without the presence of disturbing sounds, having a choice in type of sound added to the product being more fun. The sound of rain was indeed found to be most beneficial, the sound of a stream less, and a soundscape including birds was found disturbing. The adapted sounds were considered natural, despite the participants being fully aware of the fact the sounds were played through speakers. The control of general ‘volume’ was found beneficial, while the control of ‘masking’ was not appropriate in the absence of disturbing sounds. The adapting should be done by the device itself in the opinion of the participants. Ranges were found to be appropriate. With the device and the sounds still being new on the first night of using such a device, the controls were still changed falling asleep. Participants reckoned though that being used to the device, they would not change controls anymore in the period of falling asleep.","sleep; sound; masking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-12-06","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

DJ’s and music collectors still buy and listen to vinyl record for; the sound quality, the big sleeves, the exclusivity, the tactility, the collectability and the fact that 80% of all music made before 1970 is not available on digital formats. Vinyl is the only physical music format for which the sales figures go up every year (for the past ten years). Many people in the music industry think vinyl is the only physical music format that will survive the digital revolution. Although many people enjoy vinyl records one of the biggest problems with this format is the fact that you have to flip the record at least every 15 minutes. This is especially cumbersome when digitalizing your records collection of ten thousand records, or when you are a DJ and you end up digitalizing 20 new records every week. The vinyl is digitalized for use on the iPod or DJing in a club. The Jukebox plays side A & B of twenty records in a programmable order.

(mentor); Tromp, N. (mentor); Westbroek, J.F. (mentor)","2010","Society is changing. Technical progress has changed many social relations, for example, society has become more internationally orientated, it is housing many different cultures, and big cities have become more and more individualistic. These developments offer new possibilities but also bring a broad range of problems. Especially in the big cities, there are places where these problems seem to be collected, they reinforce each other while the possibilities are omitted. Laak Noord, a district located in The Hague, is one of those districts currently dealing with profound social issues. People living in Laak Noord are isolated and have little self esteem. They are not aware of possibilities they have. For these reasons a lot of their talents remain unused. The challenge in trying to solve these urban social issues is the nature of the problems: it is hard to pinpoint what causes the undesired situation since the issues are nontransparent and cause and effect are deeply intertwined. This graduation project aims to explore the possibilities of using products to implicitly guide people’s behaviour in a way that improves the social world of Laak Noord. A holistic approach is needed to solve these problems, for this reason, a very basic human characteristic is taken as a starting point in this project: the social phenomenon of group forming. The human need for social ties and the presence of social groups are seen throughout all cultures of all times. The benefits of social ties are evident: collaboration and sharing information enriches our lives by adding to it all that was learnt by our ancestors. It is important to use everyones knowledge and combine this within the character of The Hague. In order to achieve this, the identity of the Laak Noord people has to be integrated in The Hague. Individuals have peculiarities. Their personality and identity is expressed in their experience and skills. This is what makes them special and valuable. This is what forms their identity. A good group character will represent each and every identity of the small pieces it is build from. It is important that people see themselves reflected within the character of their surroundings so that they can feel at home. When people have a meaningful role within their framework of interactions they feel happy and respected. Connect people To make Laak Noorders part of the character of The Hague, it is important to extend their framework of interactions. New contacts will bring new ideas and enlarging their scope of possibilities. Weak ties connect people who would normally not be connected, this leads to new energy, new influences and ideas. Weak ties are ideal to achieve our goal to stimulate people to explore and develop their talents. Connect two different social worlds Talent development Engouraging people to use their talents by connecting two different social worlds to have new things to compare with. The focus is on people who know what there talents are but do knot know the value of them. The Tree of Talents The Tree of Talents is a website that facilitates contact between people from different social worlds by articulating needs and wishes from both worlds. Someone with a talent can offer this to someone who needs it and vice versa. The matches are made on a very specific level, the product helps you to get to this level. The Tree of Talents allows you to type in your skills and will show you what you can do with those skills. You do not have to think about your input much, the product is designed to just go with the flow in an informal and playful way and see where the product will lead you. The tree of talents has three main goals: Discover value of talents It helps to surface and articulate talents. It helps you discover what you are good at, but what would never occur to you as being a talent. You would not think that listening is a talent for example. The Tree of Talents shows the value this skill by showing that this it is needed by other people. When someone needs you for your ability to listen, it shows the importance of this talent. Realizing that others need your talent gives people the confidence to call themselves an interior decorator in stead of a cleaner. An urban gardener in stead of a weed expert. Also, it stimulates you to find talents you were not aware of, or did not see the value of. When someone explores the possibilities and sees new ones and starts to think; 'hey, this could be me' that is very good. The Tree of Talents stimulates the user to keep exploring their possibilities, enlarging the limits of the applience of their abilities. The Tree of Talents: Stimulates people to connect; Facilitates a process of positive classification which stimulates people to create a realistic future vision concerning their talents; Offers realistic leads to actions that can help applying talents within the organizational structure of The Hague.","Social design; Implicative design; Krachtwijken; Laak Noord; Talentontwikkeling; Talenten toepassen; Tree of Talents","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor); Klinkenberg, A. (mentor)","2010","Background: Incidents with medical equipment have been observed by several studies [6, 4], and the lack of proper training has been identified as one of the main reasons for the occurrence of these errors . Providing proper training is costly and logistically problematic for hospitals. Simulations can successfully resolve some of these problems, as has been proven in aviation and surgeons' laparoscopic skills training. Aim: The aim of this study was to develop a simulation meant to train tasks related to operating medical equipment and to establish content-, face-, and concurrent validity for this simulation. Methods: An interactive simulation of an electrosurgical device was developed to enable users to practice procedural band cognitive tasks on a computer. This gives the users the ability to independently learn by doing. A total of 18 certified operating room nurses participated in this research. The participants were divided into two groups: (1) Simulation Trained (ST) and (2) Real life Trained (RT). The ST group received 2 training sessions with the simulation, whilst the RT group received a traditional hands on training. Before users (ST group) started using the simulation the goals, content, and features of the simulation were explained. Then they were asked to answer 16 structured questions concerning their first impression, training capacities, and statements regarding the simulation (face validity). These questions could be ranked on a mark ranging from 1 = very bad/useless to 5 = excellent/very useful) and the statements had to be answered with \agree"", \disagree"", or \no opinion"". All participants were individually tested on their skills, related to en electrosurgical device, prior to, and after, having received their corresponding additional training. Errors were tallied and categorized into 3 types of errors: (1) connection, (2) identification, and (3) procedural errors, according to an assessment form. The results of the pre- and post test of ST group were compared with that of the RT group. Results: The results of the questionnaire show that the nurses rated the training capacities of the simulation and their first impression between a mean value of 4.0 for user friendliness and 4.4 for appearance and design of the software. In response to statements, 8 out of 9 participants (88%) considered this simulation useful for training procedural tasks related to the medical device, and all participants agreed that the simulation was useful to train identification tasks. All of the participants agreed with the statement that the simulation is suitable for training at home, whiles only 4 of the 9 (44%) learners agreed that the simulation is suitable for home use. During the experiment a reduction of 7 errors was observed for the ST group after having received the simulation training (p = 0.038). The RT group made 4 errors less after having received their additional training (p = 0.257). Conclusions: Content-, face-, and concurrent-validity of the developed simulation has been established. OR nurses considered the simulation useful for training tasks related to the electro-surgical device. Participants of the ST group significantly improved their performance, while this was not the case for the RT group.","training; skills; medical; equipment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-07-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME/MIMS","",""

(mentor)","2010","Breakthrough technologies can be defined by ‘new-to-the-world’ or ‘radical (improved)’ technologies which have the capacity to change the behaviour of end-users. The journey these technologies practise towards the mainstream market can be regarded as a dynamic process with lots of uncertainties. Companies investing in the development of these technologies face some serious risks. For the managers of these companies it would be of tremendous value if they could, even in the slightest way, make strategic decisions supported by reliable forecasts. This research aims to investigate the added value of electronic databases in determining the chances of succeeding in the market. Different kinds of electronic databases can measure the activity on a specific topic, which subsequently can be used in forecasting whether the activity will increase or not. This information, in combination with current forecasting methods, can be applied in a business intelligence tool; a tool supporting the decision making process of managers. One of these databases, besides the scientific and patent databases, is offered by Google News and includes business press and news articles from many different sources. This database indicates the activity and popularity on a particular topic among future consumers. Because of its potential, this database is included in this research as well. To answer this challenging question about the added value of electronic databases, two analyses were performed using data from 14 breakthrough technologies in the material- and pharmaceutical industry. The first analysis included different viewpoints in literature on scientific-, technological-, and market activity and when the databases appear to show the highest activity over the life-cycle of a technology. Then, the analysis based on these 14 cases, is used as verification. As a result, it became clear that scientific and market activity increases over time in parallel. The second analysis focused on a completely different aspect. A further dive was made into the history of these technologies, looking for a correlation between the patterns generated by databases and the historical patterns. Remarkably, about 50% of the cases showed a correlation with the patterns generated by Google News. Although this result seems initially not significant, future research is proposed, where even higher results might be found. Then, this database might be of added value for future forecasting tools. This explorative study adds new and improved perspectives on scientific and managerial aspects. It contributes to the concept of forecasting the development of breakthrough technologies. Also, it clearly shows the added value of electronic databases and what they could mean for future research. Nevertheless, this study bears with some limitations. The small sample size, the focus on only two industries, noise in the data, and the lack of more effective queries during the search ensure an inevitably bias in the results. However, the explorative nature of this study does supply the first large building block on this topic, which will be used in future research.","prediction of technological diffusion; technology life-cycle; large-scale production and diffusion; breakthrough technologies; forecasting methods; business intelligence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","TSE and PA","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor); Spanjers, H.L.F.M. (mentor); Yang, J. (mentor); Kleerebezem, R. (mentor)","2010","Membrane fouling problem is one of the most crucial issues which restricts the development of MBR and is, therefore, the prime research topic for many researchers worldwide. Anaerobic MBRs offer interesting perspectives as a potential solution for the treatment of wastewaters under extreme conditions, e.g. high temperature and/or high salt content, However, the research on membrane fouling of AnMBR system is still limited. Therefore, in this Master Thesis the research is focused on the flux determining conditions of AnMBR systems in hyper saline environment. Hyper saline environment is those containing salt concentration in excess of seawater which is 35g/l. The conditions of AnMBR in hyper saline environment are quite different from aerobic MBR system, so the measures applied in aerobic MBRs to prevent membrane fouling may not be useful in AnMBRs in hyper saline environment. In the first series of experiments of this thesis work, the efficiency of existing measures, which are applied in full-scale aerobic MBRs to prevent membrane fouling, are evaluated for application in AnMBRs under hyper saline conditions. Because the concentration of NaCl in hyper saline wastewater is quite high and NaCl can be used as flocculant (Mietta et al., 2009), one of the experiments was designed to induce proper shear force to the AnMBR reactor to test whether this manner could alleviate membrane fouling. Unfortunately, the result of this experiment was negative and membrane fouling was still serious. Then LCFA was added to the reactor to check its short-term effect on alleviating membrane fouling (Stumm and Morgan, 1995). The result showed that LCFA could not reduce membrane fouling within short time. Because the results of these measures in alleviating membrane fouling in AnMBR in hyper saline environment were not satisfactory, the second series of experiments of this thesis work were designed to analyse the foulant constituents of AnMBRs in hyper saline environment and their characteristics. The results of the second series experiments showed that sodium, calcium, iron and potassium were the main metal ions in cake layer. Likely, ion-exchange activities between calcium ions in the cake layer and sodium ions in the liquid phase were apparent under the hyper saline conditions in lab-scale AnMBR experiment. The functional groups of organic foulants on the fouled membrane were alkanes, carboxylic acid, nitro compounds, alkyl halides and alkenes in this research and chemical cleaning could only remove part of organic foulants.","MBR; AnMBR; saline; membrane fouling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Watermanagement","","Sanitary Engineering","",""

(mentor); Van Nederveen, G.A. (mentor); Vos, R.J. (mentor); Hubers, J.C. (mentor)","2010","Introductie In de huidige bouw wordt het aanbod geproduceerd vanuit een gefragmenteerde keten waarin samenwerking vaak slechts op basis van projecten bestaat. De markt is echter aan het veranderen en grote opdrachtgevers kiezen steeds vaker voor modernere bouworganisatievormen. Geïntegreerde contractvormen bieden meer ruimte voor geïntegreerde product- en procesontwikkeling en hierbij is de opdrachtnemer zelf verantwoordelijk voor ontwerp en uitvoering. Dit zorgt voor een regievoerende rol die de gecontracteerde partij moet spelen. De informatieuitwisseling in de bouw is inefficiënt en brengt een grotere kans op misinterpretaties, fouten en verlies van informatie met zich mee. Hierdoor is deze gebrekkige informatie uitwisseling een bron van faalkosten. De fragmentatie en de gebrekkige informatie- en kennisuitwisseling vormen een barriére voor de ontwikkeling van een integraal en dynamisch aanbod in de bouw. Via het werken met bouw informatie modellen (BIM) moet dit tot het verleden behoren. Doel van het onderzoek Het doel van dit onderzoek is het ontwikkelen van een visie en implementatieplan voor een BIM bij GMB. De veronderstelling is dat GMB door gebruik te maken van een BIM een integraal en dynamisch eindproduct kan aanbieden. De hoofdvraag die vervolgens gesteld wordt is hoe GMB dit kan bereiken. Aanbod gedreven markt Door marktprincipes toe te passen in de bouw kunnen aanbieders integrale en dynamische producten gaan creëeren. Een aanbieder kan een aantrekkelijk aanbod creëeren door betere producten te ontwikkelen of lagere kosten te maken dan de concurrentie. Voor de concurrentiepositie is een bedrijf afhankelijk van de waarde creëerende capaciteit van de gehele keten. De activiteiten in de keten moeten gericht zijn op het leveren van maximale waarde voor de klant. Het is noodzakelijk voor een aanbieder om zich te onderscheiden van de concurrenten en onzekerheden en risico’s voor de klant weg te nemen en hiermee vertrouwen op te bouwen. De bottom-up ontwikkeling van het aanbod zorgt ervoor dat het standaardisatieniveau omhoog zal gaan. Door met partners deel te nemen in producten is er voor partijen geen belemmering om kennis te delen en het proces en product te optimaliseren. Om hierbij de efficiëntie te verhogen kunnen bedrijven geïntegreerd en voor onbepaalde tijd samenwerken in stabiele combinaties. De eindaanbieder moet in staat zijn om producten en diensten van verschillende partijen te integreren in één aanbieding, en de productie en levering van het aanbod voor een individuele klant coördineren. Hij aggregeert en configureert de producten, systemen en diensten uit de keten en treedt op als vertegenwoordiger. Door de variatie van klantbehoeften is heldere communicatie van informatie en kennis in de keten heel belangrijk. Huidige bouwinformatiemodellen Het bouwproces kent een informatiesysteem dat stuurinformatie geeft aan het reëele systeem. Modellen zijn onderdeel van het informatiesysteem en geven de relevante eigenschappen van de werkelijkheid weer. De huidige programma’s waarmee een BIM gemaakt kan worden zijn gestoeld op parametrische principes. Objectparametrisch CAD gaat uit van 3D parametrische bouwobjecten met parametrische eigenschappen. Objecten en ontwerpen zijn ook te genereren vanuit parametrische processen. Deze objecten bevatten dan echter niet zelf de regels waarmee ze gegenereerd worden. Interoperabiliteit tussen systemen van verschillende partijen is mogelijk door dezelfde software te gebruiken. Er kan dan uitgewisseld worden in merkgebonden bestandsformaten of gebruik gemaakt worden van merkgebonden koppelingen. Met een partij die niet op deze software aan kan sluiten is dan geen directe samenwerking in het model mogelijk. Uitwisseling is dan mogelijk in Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) bestanden, wat door vrijwel elke applicatie ondersteund wordt. Bij het uitwisselen van informatie en bestanden is er een probleem van versiebeheer en gebrek aan overzicht. De informatie is verspreid bij de verschillende partijen aanwezig. Om alle informatie te beheren is met het gebruik van een database het overzichtelijk delen van data mogelijk. Dit geeft voordelen bij het bewaken van de consistentie van informatie en modellen. Dynamisch BIM Het dynamisch BIM is modulair waarbij elke ketenspeler verantwoordelijk is voor zijn module. De relaties en eigenschappen zijn hierin parametrisch gedefinieerd. Met combinaties van dergelijke digitale modules of productfamilies zijn concepten en eindproducten samen te stellen. De productkennis wordt parametrisch vastgelegd in de modellen en wordt zo met de keten gedeeld. Flexfilterconcept In het Flexfilterconcept werkt GMB samen met partners aan een zandfilter voor rioolwaterzuiveringsinstallaties. Het Flexfilter is modulair opgebouwd. Van de gebouwde exemplaren van het concept kunnen de relaties en variaties vastgelegd worden in het model zodat nieuwe productvariaties hiermee te genereren zijn. De gebruikte regels en relaties in het model moeten ervoor zorgen dat het model parametrisch aan te passen is. In het proces van aanbieding laat het waterschap nog weinig ruimte voor een volledig zelf gespecificeerd ontwerp van de aanbieder. Dit zou met een BIM betekenen dat de voorgeschreven objecten in het model verwerkt moeten worden, in plaats van eigen objecten. Visie en strategie GMB kan in de toekomst haar eigen aanbiedingen ontwerpen en heeft dankzij een BIM samenwerking zelf de kennis van de totaalproducten die zij aanbiedt in huis. Zij integreert de inbreng van co-makers en werkt zo dynamisch mogelijk. De strategie voor GMB om dit te bereiken is concepten ontwikkelen met vaste partners. Een pilot concept beginnen voor een geschikte markt, en ompetenties ontwikkelen, kennis vasthouden, en het concept en de BIMsamenwerking verbeteren. Implementatie Om een BIM te implementeren in de organisatie dient GMB gebruik te gaan maken van een objectparametrisch programma, Revit ligt erg voor de hand. Om waarde/kosten afwegingen snel te kunnen maken dient dit gekoppeld te worden aan een calculatieprogramma. IBIS4BIM is hiervoor geschikt. Verdere uitbreiding van het gebruik van het BIM kan zijn: koppeling met planningssoftware, gebruiken van extensies voor Revit zoals voor parametrisch ontwerp van bruggen, en uitwisseling met Civil3D voor bijvoorbeeld inpassing van een model in de omgeving. Er zijn twee geschikte manieren om een BIM werkwijze op te zetten met andere partijen. De eerste is in een conceptsamenwerking met vaste partners. Hiervoor dient een zo integraal en dynamisch mogelijk BIM systeem opgezet te worden, bijvoorbeeld op basis van Revit. Voor het delen van kennis binnen dergelijke samenwerking is een wiki een geschikt instrument. Een tweede optie is bij geïntegreerde contracten met geschikte partijen voor een aanbieding een BIM samenwerking opzetten op basis van IFC, zodat gezamenlijk een integraal product samengesteld kan worden. Conclusie GMB kan een integraal en dynamisch eindproduct aanbieden door met partners integraal samen te werken en kennis te delen. Producten en productieprocessen moeten met voldoende flexibiliteit worden vastgesteld om van herhaling te leren en kennis te hergebruiken. Hiervoor moeten partners kennis kunnen delen in ontwerp, uitvoering en exploitatie. Met behulp van BIM kan dit door het inrichten van een integraal en dynamisch BIMsysteem bij een conceptsamenwerking met vaste partners. Hiervoor moeten de objecten en relaties bepaald worden en de parameters afgesproken. Partners moeten bij elkaar gaan zitten en het concept en het BIMsysteem telkens verbeteren. Een wiki is hierbij handig voor het vastleggen, beheren en delen van kennis van product en processen, die (nog) niet in het BIM te vatten is.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction Processes","","","",""

This erosion has been investigated by the following research questions: - What are the contributions of the different erosion agents to the total erosion rate of the river banks along the Paraná de las Palmas River? - What kind of measures can be taken to decrease the erosion rate, and what are the effects of the different measures? Although the bank erosion occurs in the whole river branch, in answering the research questions, a smaller study area is defined between km 81 and km 90 of the river branch (measured from Buenos Aires), close to the city of Campana.

(mentor)","2010","Urban development and consequently covering more areas by the impervious surfaces, has led to the decrease in natural process of rainfall infiltration and as a result deduction in ground water recharge. This decrease in ground water recharge has caused number of environmental concerns such as the decrease in base flow in streams and drying up of drinking water supplies. In arid and semi arid areas with low annual rainfall and high evapotranspiration (P/ET<0.5) no excess water for run-off or ground water recharge would be available. Therefore capturing the rainfall for water supplies in such regions is more important. Due to these problems and by considering the role of permeable pavements in capturing water and replenishment of aquifers, using this kind of paving has been considered as a sustainable solution. Although permeable pavements have been used as a sustainable way to reduce the impacts of urbanization on water quality and improving water management in urban areas but they also have some disadvantages. Clogging in these pavements is the main problem which causes the decrease in infiltration rate. Review of existing researches shows that most of the researches about clogging have been limited to western countries with almost the same climatic condition and the effect of climate on clogging has not been considered yet, especially in dry regions. Although in these areas capturing more rainfall to recharge ground water is really vital. Therefore the effect of climate on clogging of the permeable pavements should be investigated more to choose the proper pavement for dry climate and increasing the infiltration rate. In order to investigate the effect of semi-arid climate on clogging of the permeable pavements, porous concrete was chosen in this research as the proper type to apply in these areas. As the fine dust in these areas is the main cause of clogging, the pavement behavior under this condition was evaluated by the lab experiment. During the lab experiment different sub-bases (sand and stone) were also examined to see the differences in clogging process under various conditions. The results from this research shows that the wind suspended particles, as the main cause of clogging in semi-arid areas, can be washed through the pavement and cause a very slow clogging process. Comparison the results of different sub-bases shows the significant effect of the pores size in the sub-base on the clogging process. In case of higher porous sub-base, sediments can be migrated from the pavement to the sub-base easily. But in case of less porous sub-base the blocking of the interface and first layers of the sub-base can create more resistance through the flow migration. As the clogging in case of larger particles happens rapidly, therefore in order to design the pavement, average size of particles that can go through it should be taken into account.","arid areas; permeability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","","",""
