(mentor); Leus, G. (mentor)","2011","The limited availability of radio frequency spectrum demands for more efficient ways to utilize it in future wireless networks. Spectrum sharing radios are an interesting solution to the spectral scarcity problem, where the available resources are adaptively used across time and frequency without affecting other user's transmissions. In this context, sensing the spectrum for its occupancy is needed to increase the awareness among technologies that share the same spectrum. In a typical wireless sensor network, each node senses and transmits data constrained by a very low power budget. At the same time, they should be capable of finding a free frequency channel with minimal latency. A solution to this problem is to make radios capable of sensing multiple frequency bands, in the order of a few hundred MHz, all at once. The technical challenge lies in the design of low-complexity wideband spectrum sensing techniques that increase context awareness at the wireless node. In this thesis, we address this problem with two approaches. The first approach is based on Compressed Sampling (CS) theory, where a new perspective is taken, different to conventional methods that estimate the spectrum and perform detection on the reconstructed spectrum. Instead a direct detection is performed on the sub-Nyquist rate sampled wideband signal. In the second part of this thesis, an alternative approach to reduce the power at an architectural level is proposed, by avoiding the Nyquist rate wideband Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) and pushing the conventional digital processing to the analog domain.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-08-22","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Telecommunication, Circuits and Systems","",""

(mentor); Hartmann, L. (mentor); Kwee, Z. (mentor); Khoury, E. (mentor)","2011","Turning from high-tech start-ups to a successful and stable company is the dream of all founders of the start-ups. Even though this journey is not easy and straightforward, the numbers of the start-ups are increasing yearly and they are playing an important role now in the global business arena. Launching their new products to enter the current market is one of most important steps that the start-ups will experience, which can decide the future destiny of the company. However, since most of the established, modeled and studied launching strategies are not particularly focused on high-tech start-ups and since most founders of high-tech start-ups come from technical backgrounds, it is quite necessary to have an overview about the relevant and possible choices of launching strategies. Additionally, it’s important to have a conceptual framework to guide entrepreneurs into choosing a suitable strategy based on their situations to enter the market. The frame work can be particularly important and essential in the industries, for instance life science, biotechnology, aerospace, automotive and many others, where innovative products are extremely welcomed, but the markets are normally dominated by several big companies. This research will consider air purification industry as an example. The main research question can be stated as follow: “What are the suitable strategies for high-tech based start-ups to launch their new products and enter the air-purification market?” In general, this research is done in an exploratory way, and therefore case study would be an appropriate approach to investigate the problem. More specifically, a single case study combined with embedded research will be used as research strategy. The complete research was divided and performed in four steps. The first step of the research is a basic literature study that consists of two parts: 1) Study of launching strategies:  The different aspects and levels under the term “launching” and the diverse options within a company for the launching.  The relationships and interactions between these options.  The influencing factors and forces, internal and external, on the selection and decisions within the company on the relevant options for the launching strategies. 2) Study of the characteristics of high-tech start-ups and the differences between high-tech start-ups them and general high-tech companies during the product launching phase. As a conclusion of the literature research, a basic framework and guidelines was created, by which entrepreneurs can formulate their own new product launching strategies. The second step of this research is to identify the special characteristics of air purification industry, and then figure out what kinds of general factors and options are still available in these particular cases. The purpose hereof is for entrepreneurs in this industry to be able to make better choices within the options mentioned by the conceptual framework. The third step consists of two parts: 1) Analyzing the current situation of a selected case: Virus Free Air (VFA), which is a reprehensive and typical newly established high-tech venture in YES!Delft in the air purification industry; 2) Applying final conceptual framework mentioned before to this particular case, and giving recommendations about the launching strategies that maybe suitable for VFA. This phase also included a general company and financial performance estimation. The last step of this research discusses the feasibility of applying the conceptual framework and guidelines for start-ups to formulate their launching strategies and promotion activities in the air purification or similar industries.","high-tech start-up; new product launching; air purification market","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-07-28","Technology, Policy and Management","Management of Technology","","Technology, Strategy & Entrepreneurship","",""

(mentor); Leeuwenburgh, O. (mentor)","2011","Recent improvements in dynamic reservoir modeling have led to an increase in the application of model-based optimization of hydrocarbon bearing reservoirs. Numerous studies and articles have indicated the possibility of improving reservoir management using these dynamic models, coupled with methods to reduce uncertainties in the static models, to optimize reservoir performance. These studies have focused on maximizing the life-cycle performance of the project. Thus life cycle optimization is essentially a single-objective optimization problem. In reality, short-term targets usually drive operational decisions. The impact of short-term targets should be included in the optimization to achieve a more realistic solution. The process of optimizing these short-term targets constrained to life cycle targets is a form of multi-objective optimization. Several methods have been suggested to achieve multi-objective reservoir flooding optimization (Van Essen et al. 2011). These methods have been implemented with the adjoint formulation. This thesis proposes the use of an ensemble-based optimization technique (EnOpt) for multi-objective optimization. The optimization of smart wells or production schedules (inflow control valve (ICV) settings) is the objective of this work. We also propose variations to the existing multi-objective algorithms suggested by Van Essen et al. (2011). We propose the use of the BFGS algorithm to improve the computational efficiency. Undiscounted Net Present Value (NPV) and highly discounted NPV are the long-term and short-term objective functions used in this thesis. We also propose an extension of the optimization functionality to better cope with model uncertainties. This robust ensemble-based multi-objective production optimization framework has been applied and tested on a synthetic reservoir model. In our test cases, the ensemble-based multi-objective optimization methods achieved a 14.2% increase in the secondary objective at the cost of only a minor decrease between 0.2-0.5% in the primary objective.","optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geotechnology","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2011","Ongoing urbanisation and the subsequent extensive use of the urban water system can lead to degradation of its surface water quality. In the Netherlands, urban water bodies often suffer from the manifestations of eutrophication due to (historically) high nutrient loadings. This research focused on the enhancement of surface water quality of semi-confined urban water bodies with a case study on a floating treatment system. Urban water bodies often function as amenities of the urban area. Their ornamental and ecological value depends on the state of their aquatic ecosystem. Excessive nutrient loading, leading to the collapse of the system’s biodiversity, turns a water body into a turbid state without submerged macrophytes. Restoration of the clear water state through reduction of nutrient loadings alone is hindered by hysteresis caused by the ecosystem relations and could be supplemented with an approach focused on increasing the system’s nutrient carrying capacity or an internal approach directly targeting the manifestations of eutrophication. The Bright Water Company floating helophyte filter actively drains a filter bed with bog plants growing in it. The influent of this biofilter is provided by free inflow of surrounding surface water. Its water treatment ability depends predominantly on filtration and adsorption by specific nutrient absorbents. Additionally, its inner reservoir serves as a habitat for small aquatic organisms. Insights on the functioning and applicability of the biofilter were gained through in situ measurements. Two biofilter were applied in the Floresvijver in Groningen and measurements were conducted on influent, effluent and surface water. Visual observations and laboratory analyses of the water samples showed effective filtration and daphnia flourishing in the inner reservoir of the biofilter. Accumulation of the residual solids as a sludge layer on top of the filter bed and formation of biogas inside the filter material proved to reduce the hydraulic capacity significantly. Nutrient removal efficiency could not be determined with the monthly measurements of the water board but for optimal functioning of the phosphorous absorbent the current filter bed design should be adjusted while effluent samples indicated leaching of absorbent components. Application of the biofilter can contribute to the enhancement of urban surface water quality by increasing the nutrient carrying capacity of a water body. Especially in urban areas with various diffusive nutrient sources and physical constrains, the application of the biofilter can be efficient. Additionally, the biofilter functions as a habitat for zooplankton which are an important ecosystem element for the prevention of algae blooms. Furthermore, the effluent of the biofilter can provide a local increase in transparency and improve conditions for macrophyte development. The number of biofilters applied in a water body determine the significance of these contributions relative to the existing conditions.","urban water management; surface water; water quality; floating treatment system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-08-16","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Watermanagement","","Water Resources","",""

New locations for placing the gear selector and different types of interaction are also possible with Sbw. This project explores these new possibilities of SbW. An approach was chosen in which brand values took a leading position in design. Ten car brands were analysed for their brand values and brand specific aesthetics. A framework for the analysis of car brands and generation of brand-specific ideas is also presented in this project. It includes suggestions for finding brand values, methods for interpretating of the values and methods for generation of ideas. The result of the project is a brand-specific design for a SbW gear selector for Renault. The gear selector is designed for MPV’s and placed in the car door’s arm rest to save space in the interior. It expresses Renault’s brand and style values in different ways. Function-wise, the gear selector features monostability, automated park, a sliding interaction for automatic mode and pivoting interaction for manual mode.","by wire; gear selector","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-07-26","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Jagtman, E. (mentor); De Brito, M. (mentor); De Bruijne, M. (mentor)","2011","In the past decade, there has been an increasing number of natural disasters that led to catastrophic damage to mankind. China is one of the countries most affected by natural disasters in the world. Although logistics activities account for a large percentage of total operations in aftermath relief, they have frequently not been recognized as key levers for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of humanitarian organizations and as being crucial to operational excellence. Meanwhile, due to the large number of relief actors involved in the Chinese context, the coordination among various players becomes a very prominent challenge to cope with. Therefore, this master study aims to explore how to improve the coordination among actors in the Chinese relief chain context. This research consists of theoretical and empirical parts. In the theoretical party, this thesis explores the prospects of transferring lessons learnt from the commercial supply chain to the relief chain by finding out the existing coordination mechanisms in the commercial logistics operations. Some coordination mechanisms- i.e. Joint Procurement, Quick Response, Continuous Replenishment Program, Vendor Managed Inventory, Joint Managed Inventory, Continuous Planning, Forecasting and Replenishment and 3rd party logistics are the practiced coordination mechanisms in procurement, inventory and transportation processes together with corresponding characteristics and requirements to adopt them. Besides specific coordination mechanisms, generic lessons learnt from the commercial supply chain are also abstracted. They are Resource Sharing, Joint Decision Making and Outsourcing, which can be performed on strategic, tactical or operational levels based on the orientations of relationships among coordinating alliance. These experiences from the commercial supply chain come as a foreground for relief actors to step on. Although the objective of the relief chain and commercial supply chain remains the same i.e. delivering right amount of materials to the right places, some factors existing after major disasters distinguish the relief chain from the commercial supply chain fundamentally. These factors are 1) Urgency 2) Uncertainty 3) Complexity of operation conditions 4) Co-existence of various actors. Due to the existence of these challenging factors in disaster aftermath, the current practicing coordination mechanisms in the commercial supply chain can’t be transferred directly into the relief chain. As the application level for these coordination mechanisms are evaluated respectively in this thesis, it turns out Joint Procurement, Quick Response and 3rd party logistics are those promising mechanisms with a high level of application prospect in the relief chain. Meanwhile, the generic lessons from the commercial supply chain still hold in the relief chain and especially when they are put in practice operationally or tactically among organizations. The theoretical study provides the research a direction to further explore the reality. The Wenchuan earthquake case study is conducted to test the prospects of these coordination methods in Chinese context. Through this case study, all the specific promising coordination mechanisms are found with some changes adapted to specific situations. Some coordination initiatives that reflect the generic approaches (Resource Sharing) in commercial chain are also discovered i.e. demand information sharing and inventory capacity sharing. Meanwhile, some new coordination initiatives are invented uniquely by relief actors. They are coordination to have a complementary supply effect and coordination for the sake of legal operation. In order to better involve actors in the relief chain, the following recommendations are offered to humanitarian organizations during the preparation phase 1) Non-governmental can be incorporated into existing relief system to achieve an overall complemented effect to governmental relief 2) Build up sustainable relations with suppliers on emergency supply 3) NGOs Identify strategic alliance before emergency. During response phase, it is advisable for NGOs to 1) Spot their position in less attention areas to avoid media’s framing effect 2) Coordination by standing by when information is unclear.","disaster relief; relief chain; supply chain management; Chinese context","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-07-26","Technology, Policy and Management","Values and Technology","","Safety Science","",""

(mentor)","2011","In the optimization of open pit mine design, the Lerchs-Grossmann algorithm is the industry standard, although network flow algorithms are also well suited, efficient, and known. The stochastic version of the conventional (deterministic) network flow algorithm is based on the use of multiple simulated realizations of the ore deposit, thus accounting for geological uncertainty. In comparison, the conventional pit optimization methods use only one estimated or average-type model of the deposit and assume it represents the exact deposit in the ground. The use of multiple scenarios results in the ability to generate risk profiles in terms of both grade and material types for pit designs and production schedules. This thesis focuses on the application of the stochastic maximum flow algorithm for multiple ore processing destinations at the Escondida Norte copper mine, Chile. The case study shows the optimal pushback layout minimising geological risk during the life-of-mine. The limitation of this method is that it uses only a part of the local joint uncertainty of the block grades and material types. However, it can be extended to account for simulated commodity price forecasts as well as discounting.","optimization; open pit; mining; stochastic; maximum flow; mine design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Department of Geotechnology","","Section Resources Engineering","",""

But, this flexibility comes at the price of high memory consumption and slow execution times, making it unsuitable for use in an embedded system. The possibility of using Embedded MATLAB (EML), a small subset of the MATLAB language compatible with code generation code, is investigated to generate production level C code from a MATLAB algorithm. The hypothesis of this thesis is that this has the potential of bringing together the best of two worlds; a flexible design interface coupled with a resource-constrained and optimized implementation. In this thesis, a workflow is defined to transform an existing algorithm from an unconstrained MATLAB algorithm to a constrained EML implementation. A new tool is also presented for assist- ing in automated floating-to-fixed-point conversion of MATLAB algorithms. This conversion will also transfer to the generated C code, thus potentially generating production ready C code. To demonstrate the workflow, a case study on a Real-Time Heartbeat Detection algorithm is presented. It is concluded that although this technology is very promising it still has performance and usability problems that is keeping it from reaching its fullest potential, even if existing workarounds for these problems are included. However, Embedded MATLAB might yet serve its purpose as a bridge between software engineers and scientists, providing a common platform for research and development.","MATLAB; C; Code Generation; Fixed-Point; ECG","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","SERG","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","Testing of Analog/Mixed-Signal (AMS) integrated circuits (ICs) has been one of the most challenging topics in the test technology community; this is because it is very time consuming and it is hard to distinguish between pass and fail as it is the case for digital circuits. For some applications, such as automotive industry, the quality requirements for AMS ICs can be as severe as zero Parts Per Million (PPM) level. This requires, in addition of optimizing test time, also test for all possible defects in the IC. Bridges and opens are the common defects considered for AMS circuits; they are analyzed in Defect Oriented Testing (DOT) flow in order to develop appropriate test program. With high/severe quality requirements new failure mechanisms have to be considered for test purposes. Investigating such defects and their impact on the quality is important especially for zero PPM level application. This thesis investigates the effect of dislocation defects for an NXP AMS IC which is an automotive product, manufactured in 140 nm technology. Dislocation defects cause leakage related failures while crossing a PN-junction of the device. It is very challenging in AMS testing to detect these defects. A schematic-based extraction methodology is proposed to extract the dislocation defects based on studying the cross-sections of different devices present in an IC. Using the proposed methodology for extraction, the defect list is limited to only 8% of the total active devices present in the IC. This is useful in guiding the failure analysis process and reducing the simulation effort considerably. These defects possess a high resistive signature and were simulated for different sets of resistance values. It was found that the detectability of these defects decreases as the resistance value is increased. Test selection algorithms such as ‘greedy’ and ‘unique detects first’ are used to obtain an optimal test set which is able to detect all the defects, including dislocation defects. The performance of both the algorithms in terms of test reduction is compared. The optimal test set obtained is used for validating the production data consisting of 1.3 million dies. The escaped ICs are diagnosed using a fault dictionary approach. The diagnosis results reveal that the current production data set does not suffer from dislocation defects. However, extra tests obtained for detecting dislocation defects can be kept for advanced technology nodes in the future, if these defects show up in the production environment.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-07-30","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Engineering","","Microelectronics","",""

These assumptions are then evaluated using the concept produced during an embedded design process. The explorative study leads to the assumptions that 1) perception and understanding of a display in the periphery could be achieved. That 2) this understanding could continuously be maintained when not extending too far into the periphery. That 3) the best features of light to be used individually are tone, intensity, shape, size, orientation and spatial location. That 4) change in these features would be more apparent than their static states. And that 5) change blindness may occur when the change between two states is not perceived. Based on the knowledge gained from the explorative research a design phase was conducted. The final concept employs several individual lights which can move around the windscreen, thus employing the near- and middle-periphery. The concept described how the proposed features of light can best communicate the information required for wayfinding. A prototype was made which included the most basic information and was used in a simulated driving scenario. During this study the intensions of the subjects were measured and compared to the intended message. The results look promising; participants were capable of using peripheral perceived information to correctly navigate the appropriate route. Although the majority of the subjects did at times feel the need to focus their gaze on the display, their estimation was that this would reduce with experience. Continuous awareness of the information is not plausible, in situations which require more than average attention from the driver it seems his functional field of vision prevents perception in the middle-peripheral field. The forms in which the proposed features were used were also not ideal. The concept included too much movement, unnecessarily distracting him. Also the change blindness that occurred rendered the functionality of several intensity states useless. Based on these deficiencies an iterative step was finally conducted towards a believable product.","navigation system; peripheral vision; peripheral perception; perception; vision; color; IVIS; wayfinding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Computer Aided Design Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Saaksjarvi, M.C. (mentor); Westenberg, F. (mentor)","2011","3M is an American company that was founded in 1902 in Minnesota. Their business originally started with mining (Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing) but they soon switched to the more profitable production of sandpaper. 3M is a technology and science based company with a very wide portfolio of products. It has more than 80.000 employees and over 55.000 different products. The divisions that 3M uses are Consumer and Office, Display and Graphics, Electro and Communications, Health Care, Industrial and Transportation and Safety, Security and Protection services. The Scotchgard  Protector brand falls within the Consumer and Office division and contains products based on the Fluorochemical technology. At this moment their main focus is on the business-to-business market with protective products. The Scotchgard  Protector products provide soil, water and oil repellency for a wide variety of materials. In 2000 there was a problem with the product and 3M has decided on a complete phase out of the Scotchgard  Protector products. Soon after the phase out an improved version of the Fluorochemicals was developed, and the product was re-introduced on the market. Up until this moment the strategy was to maintain as much as possible but no active role was played in the market. The brand has sustained severe damage in the professional market due to the phase out and it has been hard to regain market share. In 2011 it has been decided to revive the Scotchgard  Protector brand and develop a new strategy. This report is involved with the Benelux division with a special focus on the Dutch market, 3M Nederland. Due to constant improvements of the chemical formulations and the falling behind of competition, the Scotchgard  Protector products are now at a very good quality level. In the past the products have represented good profits and 3M has the wish to rebuild these sales. Therefore this moment has been selected to develop a new strategy for the brand in the Dutch market. From the literature it has been shown that the differences between business and consumer markets are decreasing and that it will be very difficult for 3M to re-establish the brand within the professional markets. Besides that, the value of a brand is still larger for consumers and could be used to benefit 3M as a company. In addition to this, it has been shown from the analysis of the current situation of the brand and its’ market environment that there is little potential for Scotchgard  Protector in the professional market. Main reasons for this are that the market is growing more global and therefore harder to address for a (small) subsidiary like 3M Nederland. Secondly, the former customers of 3M in this product category have sustained large damage themselves and therefore the entire market potential has been diminished. As a general conclusion it was decided to focus on a consumer market with the Scotchgard  Protector brand. User research done revealed a clear need for repellency and protective products and that a clear positioning is needed. Consumers think of cleaning instead of preventing because they are not aware of the possibilities. Three consumer types have been developed with their specific viewpoints. There are people that feel that they have to keep their home looking good, as a social pressure from outside. Their skills and the products they use are very important to them. A second group thinks that a clean home is relative and they do not put too much focus on it. It has to be done, but only to keep life pleasant and create peace of mind. The final group would like to keep their home looking good but feel that this is never possible. They feel insecure about their skills and use a lot of specialty products to cope with their issues. The most important problem areas are the bathroom, windows and their outdoor tiles. The market description showed that the potentials in these problem areas are very large and that if 3M is able to establish a new product category, there is little competition. The most important retail channels are DIY stores, supermarkets, drugstores and discounters. Since supermarket and drugstore channels need further development in the coming year a start will be made with the DIY stores and discounters. The new product category Protection will be introduced. The strategy for the coming year is to have several in/out actions in the discount channels and introduce the ceramics, glass and stone outdoor products in the DIY stores. The target group will be families with children. The key message to get across is that the utopia of a clean home is getting closer and that this product is about Protection, and therefore prevention of work. With the Scotchgard  Protector products, everyone can be an expert and that everyone has the needed skills to keep their things looking good longer. The financial estimates for the first year are very positive and would consist of, in the realistic case scenario, sales of around 355.000 products. This would result in around one million euro of turnover in the first year. The real-win-worth estimates, project feasibility, show very low risks and high scores for project feasibility. Finally, this project has shown that the Scotchgard  Protector brand still has a lot of potential despite the problems in the past. 3M has to reinvent the brand and with this plan it has a clear focus again. Scotchgard  Protector represents a great potential for the future. Further developing and maturing of the Protective category and staying close to user needs are imperative for success. These activities are well within the power and strengths of 3M. All in all, the introduction of Scotchgard  Protector on the consumer market will create a great future for 3M and opens many opportunities in the future.","branding; 3M; product category; strategy; new business development; user research; context mapping; market analysis; market description; market development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-07-21","Industrial Design Engineering","PIM","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2011","Background and problem Audio-visual cultural heritage content should be preserved for our children and their children. However, currently the devices on which this material is stored suffers from decomposition. In addition to that, the content should be unlocked on a larger scale by exploiting modern technologies such as Internet and mobile applications. Therefore projects are initiated by the Dutch government, by putting in 170 million Euro’s, on how to achieve this goal. One of these projects is the Archieven in Beweging (Archives in Motion or AiM), which has as a goal to unlock audio-visual heritage material to a large as possible part of the population of the Netherlands. However, success of projects like the AiM research is lagging behind, which results in lower new investments by the government, which results in less innovation, etc. A vicious circle might occur with the possible effect of never unlocking digital cultural heritage material. To successfully unlock the content, service innovation has to be conducted. However, in recent literature reasons for failing service innovation has become apparent. This failure in creating successful innovative new services is rooted at the non-management of stakeholders and their respective stakes on a strategic level in these innovation projects. The combination of these two problems is translated in the research question: “How does the involvement and management of stakeholders on a strategic level during a design process result in viable services for stakeholders and customers?” Approach First we conducted a literature study with which we made ourselves familiar with the relevant scientific topics in this research: stakeholder management and design science. From selected literature we distilled a framework, based on criteria, which allowed us to identify, involve and manage stakeholders during a design of an innovative service. We decided to conduct a design cycle and stop when a prototype of the design was realized. The second step initiated the design process where we made the design objective explicit, made the requirements of our design explicit, and did stakeholder identification and involvement. Also in this step we have chosen to implement a two-sided platform consisting of a consumer side and a business side. In addition to this platform we decided to put a third interface to our design in terms of a researcher interface, with which a researcher is able to manipulate the design for testing in the R&D phase of the design. The subsequent, third, step consisted of constructing the design in terms of design documents such as use-cases, class diagrams and sequence-diagrams. When these design documents were in place, we made a choice to build a prototype of the multi-sided platform in PHP/HTML5/Javascript/CSS and make use of a Javascript framework: jQuery. The last step of our approach was the validation of the prototype with involved stakeholders, which we planned to do in a workshop with these stakeholders. We designed an experiment with a pretest, treatment and posttest. However unfortunately, only one participant took part in this workshop, leaving us unable to validate our work. Conclusions Because we were not able to validate our approach to involve and manage stakeholders, we are not able to draw definitive conclusions. Furthermore, we are only partly able to answer our research questions for the Dutch digital cultural heritage content context. In this context, involvement and management of stakeholders does not directly result in viable services for stakeholders. We argue that stakeholders are not interested in solving this problem of unlocking digital heritage content, because they do not want to participate in workshop such as we organized. Though alternative explanations, such as weather conditions and other events, might also have influenced our findings. A second conclusion that we are able to draw is that involvement and management of stakeholders does not result in viable services if the problem for which the service is developed is a non-problem. We indicate the problem in the case we studied as a non-problem for stakeholders because they contradict their claims about the importance of unlocking cultural heritage content by not willing to put effort in the development of new services. We point out that this unwillingness might be the result of a learning curve stakeholders experience, we first interviewed them and presented solutions that they might find not worth to put effort in. Our research shows that stakeholder analysis as presented in literature is not sufficient to create viable services. Therefore we propose a stakeholder-centric design for designing and implementing new services. We recommend future research on stakeholder-centric design in combination with concurrent business model development in design cycles. In this way, we expect that a vicious circle is avoided and that invested community funds are, at least partly, returned.","service design; design cycle; stakeholder centric design; innovation management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-07-21","Technology, Policy and Management","ICT","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor); Secomandi, F. (mentor)","2011","Design research often falls victim to desires of describing an universal and perfect model of reality. The problem is that when one tries to describe a system (e.g. grassroots innovation methodologies) there is always a level of selection in considered factors. This selection alone, while logical and necessary, will prevent generalist and widespread application of the resulting vision. Nonetheless, designers conducting this type of research might fail to recognize these limitations and force fit a research model into a dynamic, lively and highly complex social, cultural and economic reality. Governments, as the holder of public authority, designs the governance mechanisms to attend their social demands. Typical government responsibility its to make decisions such as how to maintain the social order, creation and enforcement of laws, management of public needs, flows of resources and production, etc. These decisions are then consolidated in formal rules which establish the legal foundation of its underlying society. These rules shape and are shaped by the culture that creates them, and therefore can only cover perceived necessities. Governments have always been important stakeholders in world economy since they manage great volumes of resources. With globalization and mutual dependency, most have increasing participation and complex relations in global trade. A few of these, traditionally outside major economic or politic power plays, are now realizing their potential to influence the status quo of global economy and politics.These we call emerging economies.","design policy; design management; cognotivity; design center; strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor); Flipsen, S.F.J. (mentor); Reijns, R.G.C. (mentor)","2011","The objective of this graduation project is to develop a feasible design proposal for a residential portable fire extinguisher which makes use of aerosol extinguishing technology. The methodology used in this product design project is the Basic Design Cycle (Roozenburg and Eekels, 1995). In the analysis phase the target group is defined (as result of an online questionnaire) as adults who are aware of the hazard of residential fires. The context is narrowed to the corridor of the house. The main characteristics of the aerosol technology include no damaging residue, a shelf life of 15 years and the generation of much heat. A new product evaluation guideline (BRL) needs to be established by KIWA in order to bring a handheld aerosol fire extinguisher to the Dutch market. Statistics show that residential fires do not occur frequently. A residential fire extinguisher should therefore also focus on its secondary function: to provide the feeling of fire protection at home. This can be achieved by improving the product-user interaction of the fire extinguisher. The list of requirements is used as input for defining the macro product functionality. A creative session and morphological chart provided structure during the diverging concept development phase, which focussed on usage and interaction. The final design proposal consists of a round-shaped unobtrusive portable fire extinguisher which is connected by a two-sided bayonet mount into a fixed holder on the wall of the corridor of the house. A product-service system is introduced to improve the interaction to provide a feeling of fire safety during the product’s lifetime. The product sends status messages over existing home WLANs. The user gets updated and in case of fire, emergency messages will be send to whoever the user has set-up in the preferences. To evaluate the design proposal on different aspects multiple (interim) prototypes are created. A one-on-one foam model confirmed the ergonomic grip dimensions and provided insight into proportions and the related appearance. Two functional prototypes demonstrated the currently available Solid Bound Compound composition is only useful to fill a room with the aerosol extinguishing agent as quickly as possible. Competitors already created a slow burning SBC, so the advice is to first adjust the technology to the new use of a slowly discharging handheld aerosol extinguisher. This will probably takes months of development. As conclusion for this project a technology adjustment will be necessary in order to achieve the desired technical behaviour and safe results for a residential fire extinguisher with aerosol technology. However, the innovative design proposal is finished and ready to use whenever the FirePro SBC technology is ready.","fire extinguisher; aerosol; residential; home; houses; af-x fire solutions; FirePro; fire protection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-07-20","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2011","This thesis presents the design of a six degree of freedom micropositioning stage. It is a part of a research project on haptic tele?operation, applied to micromanipulation, at the TU Delft. The micropositioning stage will be used as the fine range positioning stage of a slave robot, in a haptic tele?operated control scheme. The technology used to build the stage is magnetic levitation. The stage has a movement range of 200 x 200 x 200 ?m and rotations of about ±1°. The stage MIM (Minimum Incremental Motion) is designed to be 40 – 100 nm. The focus of this thesis is mainly on the modelling and design of the system and its components, the design of actuator and sensor electronics, and the mechanical design of the stage. Control aspects have been taken into account since the stage is open?loop unstable, but do not constitute a main topic. The position sensors used in the micropositioning stage are infrared reflective sensors. These affordable sensors have previously been implemented in various projects at the TU Delft. Existing optical sensor readout electronics have been investigated; an improved version has been developed with lower noise levels. The achieved sensor noise is 14 – 28 nm, peak?to?peak over a measurement range of 200 ?m. A three?channel readout circuit board has been designed and tested. It can be used in other future applications as well as the current project. The actuators are a novel Lorentz type actuator. They consist of two fixed coils and a permanent magnet attached to the moving mass. One actuator can generate two independent force components, namely a vertical force and a horizontal force. The actuator characteristics have been extensively investigated using FEM modelling. These characteristics are position dependent, and exhibit crosstalk and parasitic forces. The overall system modelling and actuator FEM modelling has shown that these effects are manageable over the motion and force ranges of the stage. The actuator can generate an 80 mN vertical force and a 10 mN horizontal force, continuously. A threechannel current amplifier circuit board has been designed and tested. It is used to drive the Lorentz actuators, but can also be used in other future applications. Simulation diagrams have been developed of the mechanical system and its controller. The mechanical system is essentially a rigid free?floating mass that has 6 degrees of freedom. The eigenmodes of this mass have been investigated using FEM based modal analysis. Its eigenfrequencies lie far above the closed?loop system bandwidth, and are therefore not considered further. The control system is implemented as six independent SISO PD?controllers. The closed loop system bandwidth is 100 Hz. Using the system model in a Monte Carlo?type simulation, the effect of manufacturing and assembly tolerances on stage performance have been investigated. The results showed that the stage can be built with standard manufacturing technology, provided that extra care is taken during assembly of the actuators to reduce misalignment of the actuator components. An alignment tool has been developed for this purpose. A mechanical design has been made of the micropositioning stage. In this design the conclusions of the modelling phase and sensor and actuator characterisation have been taken into account. Fabrication drawings have been made, and all mechanical parts have been manufactured. The fine stage and its associated electronics have been fully assembled; the stage is currently in the test and characterisation phase.","6-DoF; Maglev Positioning Stage; Haptic Micromanipulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-07-29","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Saakes, D.P. (mentor); Luijben, S. (mentor)","2011","Vogel’s is market leader in Europe for the business of placement and mounts for audio and video equipment. Always looking for opportunities to expand their market, they have started developing accessories for the gaming industry. In order to become a serious player in the market for gaming accessories Vogel’s wants to gain knowledge of gaming and the gaming experience. This led to the assignment: ‘Design a product that enhances the gaming experience (of existing videogames)’. The first step to design a product that enhances the gaming experience is to make a clear definition of the word ‘gaming experience’. Experience is the reactional relationship between the subjective world of a person and the objective world around them. Applied to gaming, the experience can be defined as the relationship between the gamer and the physical, virtual and social environment he is involved in. There are many factors that influence this relationship, like player type, immersion, the physical environment, social interaction, game genre, platform and in-game perspective. Based on this definition, an overview is made of products that influence either one of these factors to get an overview and understanding of the current market for gaming accessories. 3 levels have been identified on which products can enhance the gaming experience. Level 1 products are independent gaming accessories which are not directly involved in gameplay or part of the direct interaction with the game. Level 2 products enhance the gaming experience by modifying the input or output from the game. Finally level 3 products combine technology creating a complete new type of game in- and output or platform. It requires the cooperation of game developers to create games for the new technology. Since Vogel’s has indicated they will not be developing a new technology, a level 3 product is not an option to develop in the near future, but it could inspire a long term vision for the company. Based on the basic conception of gaming experience questionnaires were sent out among a wide variety of gaming contacts to get a global impression of the gamer demographic. There was a wide variety in the gamer types, it was clear a categorization was needed. However as explained in the introduction stage, there is no clear categorization of gamers yet based on their experience of games. The hardcore and casual distinction is ambivalent and too simplistic. It became an important objective to find a categorization that showed the full spectrum of the gaming experiences and the most significant distinctions to allow for a user centered approach to the design of a gaming accessory aimed at improving the gaming experience. It was decided to focus on the console gaming market, because it fit well to Vogel’s’ current product portfolio. Based on the feedback from the first questionnaires a subsequent in-depth interview was done with a small group representative of the console gamer audience. Based on the finding of the in-depth research, the Gaming Experience Model was formulated as described in section 7.2. The most important finding was that apart from the factors as described earlier, commitment and identification are important factors that influence the gaming experience. Identification is a psychological process whereby the subject assimilates an aspect, property, or attribute of the other (in this case other ‘gamers’ or simply the activity of gaming) and is transformed, wholly or partially, after the model the other provides. Commitment is a component of identification; it is the relative strength of an individual’s identification with and involvement in a particular organization (or in this case the activity of gaming). The Gaming Experience Model identifies 4 types of commitment: immersion, skill, communion and knowledge With this holistic understanding of the gaming experience 2 brainstorm sessions were organized to create product ideas. The first brainstorm was organized with a mixed group of young creatives, who were not updated on the project and research findings. The purpose was to inspire and ‘break out of the box’ after analyzing the gaming experience so intensely for months. The result was a wide variety of bizarre ideas of which the direct application in a product was not immediately obvious, but the exercise explored the gaming experience spectrum in a playful matter and worked inspiring. The second brainstorm was done at Vogel’s with a team of colleagues from the R&D department. The brainstorm was more structured and the team was informed of the findings on gaming experience. The results were product ideas that were more concrete, but also less surprising. The most promising ideas were selected and further developed, until finally 2 concepts were left: the Guntroller and the Perivision. Prototypes were created in order to evaluate the concepts through user testing. The Guntroller concepts aims at enhancing the experience of First Person Shooter games, by improving the look and feel of the controller. The concept could be further developed in to a standalone product (a controller) or an accessory (a controller add-on). The Guntroller adds a bright flickering light to the shots fired in game and a translational recoil effect (instead of the rotational vibration that is standard on most console controller nowadays). The Perivision was inspired by the light design as applied on stage in music, TV or theater productions. It aims to improve the gaming experience, by applying visual effects to the physical environment in the user’s peripheral vision. The characteristics of the peripheral vision are directly related to the built of the human eye. There is no color perception in the peripheral vision for example. This understanding led to a set of guidelines to design light effects for the Perivision from a dramaturgical point of view. A research study was set up to evaluate both concepts. The same participants were used, but the products were tested and evaluated separately. The Guntroller was highly rated on all positive and ‘impressive’ aspects. Participants indicated that especially the light effect on the controller contributed to its intensity. The Perivision was rated a bit lower, on both the positive and negative aspects. Overall it was less noticeable.","videogames; gaming; experience; peripheral vision; recoil; first person shooter; accessory; games; gaming experience; dramaturgy; light design; perivision; guntroller; firearm; gun; kickback; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2011","Microcontroller based embedded systems have witnessed enormous growth in recent decades. Microcontrollers are the most versatile products found in most of the market segments and in several product families spanning from 4-bit to 64-bit processors. The application domain is such that for some applications only a little functionality is required; for instance, when used as a controller for a simple user interface. In other applications, the functionality demands are high, such as the demand for floating-point calculations and signal processing. Microcontrollers have to meet these demands, while being smaller in size and power efficient. Since memory occupies a large share of area in a microcontroller and contributes the most towards power consumption, the architecture has to be memory efficient. Particularly, for applications using a matrix of processors (as in multi-core architectures), each with its own program memory, the program memory and power efficiencies are a major design goal. The memory efficiency of the instruction set, which also implies power efficiency, is an important factor which needs to be taken into account in the design of microcontroller architectures. In this thesis, we propose a Memory and Power Efficient Architecture (MePoEfAr) for embedded microcontrollers. MePoEfAr is intended as an improvement of the class of architectures represented by the ATMEL AVR, Texas Instruments MSP430 and the ARM Cortex-M3 microcontrollers. These architectures were designed to be used as embedded controllers. They often have on-board SRAM for data storage and ROM/Flash for program storage. This property demands a memory-efficient architecture, because a small savings of the on-chip program memory area quickly offsets the gates required for extra processor functionality. In addition, due to power aspects, especially for hand-held devices, the clock frequencies used are not very high, so that the instruction decoding time is less critical. A source level profiler has been developed to get the statistics of various C language constructs for the representative programs used in embedded applications. These statistics were used in making various trade-offs to tune this architecture. An assembler and Interpretive simulator was developed to perform assembler level benchmarking for performance evaluation and comparison with three embedded architectures. Results show the improvement of MePoEfAr performance by 70% and 17% when compared to TIMSP430 and ARMCoretex-M3 microcontrollers, respectively. Furthermore, MePoEfAr outperforms Atmel AVR by a factor of 2.32. Efficiency of MePoEfAr comes from its more orthogonal architecture, its memory efficient and rich instruction set, efficient support for immediate values and displacements, efficient instruction encoding with variable length instructions of 1 to 4 bytes. Moreover, availability of large number of registers, and the possibility of large number of operations on these registers add to the efficiency of the architecture.","Embedded microcontroller; Memory Efficient Architecture; Profiler; Variable Length Instructions; Benchmark","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Engineering","","Computer Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2011","Semiconductor memories are an inherent part of many modern electronic systems. Due to the fast development of memory process technology and the escalating computing speeds, the on-chip share of memories is rapidly increasing. Additionally, the quality and reliability requirements are becoming more severe especially for critical applications such as automotive and aerospace. Zero defect per million level is now a reality. To satisfy the quality constraints, it is vital to investigate the failure mechanisms. Also, it is required to address the problem of continually decreasing memory yield. Low yield is one of the major threats of the miniaturized electronic systems. Desire for high yield along with the stress to decrease the time to market, has heightened the importance of memory fault diagnosis. The traditional ways of fault diagnosis are not adequate for covering the entire memory fault scope. They suffer from various drawbacks like high complexity, high cost, platform dependence and limited scope. There is a need to introduce changes to the fundamental principles of memory testing and diagnosis approaches. This thesis presents a novel memory fault diagnosis approach which accurately identifies the faulty memory block and determines the fault type. The proposed approach is platform independent, based on a hierarchical methodology and incorporates several innovative ideas and algorithms. It builds upon the concepts of Test Primitives, Test Classes and Design for Diagnosis. The strength of Hierarchical Memory Diagnosis approach lies in the fact that, unlike conventional approaches, there are no specific implementation requirements other than running a test and determining the pass/fail status of the applied diagnostic test. The scope of the target faults includes all static and dynamic faults occurring in all parts of the memory system. The new approach contributes to the acceleration of characterization of possible defect mechanisms responsible for yield loss in the emerging technologies.","diagnosis; DfD; March tests; memory; SRAM; SRAM simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-07-19","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","HWI Group heeft een websiteframework waar meerdere sites op draaien. Doordat er vele jaren door verschillende personen geschreven is aan de code is het lastig dit framework te onderhouden en verder uit te breiden. Ook is het niet rendabel om een nieuw framework uit het niets te ontwerpen. Daarom moet het huidige systeem geanalyseerd worden en aan de hand van deze analyse moet een nieuwe systeem ontworpen worden. Het feit dat de database vrijwel niet aangepast mag worden, dat het framework meerdere sites moet ondersteunen en dat het parallel met de legacy code gedraaid kan worden vormen restricties voor dit herontwerp. Het eerste onderzoek aan het systeem was een requirements analyse. Gedurende deze fase zijn de requirements van het gehele systeem op een rij gezet. Deze analyse leverde meer dan 300 requirements op. Deze werden teruggebracht tot 16 algemene use cases. Dezelfde abstrahering is ook in het prototype naar voren gekomen, waardoor de code eenvoudiger werd. Vervolgens is de architectuur ontworpen. Deze maakt gebruik van bestaande design patterns, dit om te voorkomen dat het wiel opnieuw uitgevonden wordt. Er zijn twee patterns waar de architectuur zwaar op leunt: dependency injection en het observer pattern. Het voordeel van de eerste is het verminderen van terugkerende code. De tweede pattern houdt in dat objecten zich inschrijven om geactiveerd te worden als een bepaald event plaatsvindt. Dit pattern wordt toegepast wegens de mogelijkheden om het systeem uit te kunnen breiden zonder dat er extra code afhankelijkheden voorkomen. Symfony2 en Doctrine2 vormen een zeer goede basis om een complex systeem, zoals het systeem van HWI Group, te implementeren. Meer over deze basis volgt in de sectie 'Implementatie'. Tijdens het verzamelen van de user requirements was er het vermoeden dat heel veel aspecten van het systeem hetzelfde waren. Gedurende de implementatie bleek dit vermoeden gegrond te zijn. Abstractie speelde een zeer grote rol om de grootte van de codebase naar beneden te trekken. In de meeste gevallen moet een item of een overzicht van items getoond worden. Om hierbij te helpen ontstonden de Item- en OverviewManager. Meer over de abstractie is te vinden in de sectie 'Implementatie'. Het was erg lastig om van tevoren een goede planning te maken. Een nieuw framework brengt namelijk altijd een leercurve met zich mee, en de tijdsduur van het begrijpen van het huidige systeem is ook erg lastig om van tevoren in te schatten. Daarom is er voor besloten om een soort van Agile werkwijze te hanteren. Dit houdt in dat er korte sprints waren en dat het systeem incrementeel werd uitgebreid. Er waren geen dagelijkse bijeenkomsten zoals gebruikelijk is voor een Agile werkwijze. Het voordeel van deze werkwijze is dat ongeacht hoe snel of traag de implementatie zou gaan, het prototype zou altijd werken. We geven HWI Group het advies om zich meer te richten op het documenteren van code. Een mooi moment om documentatie te typen is aan het eind van een sprint, we adviseren dus ook om dit altijd te doen. Verder adviseren we om code review uitgebreid toe te passen. Er moet dus altijd een tweede programmeur zijn die de code van een andere programmeur goedkeurt. In weinig tijd, met een goed team en goede documentatie voor de gebruikte tools is het gelukt om de afspraken aan het bedrijf na te leven. Het prototype biedt meertalige tekst, kan meerdere sites draaien en in parallel met de legacy code werken. Het prototype is dus geslaagd.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","Since the end of the last century, polders in the Netherlands have suffered from inundation due to heavy rainfall. Inundation occurrences in 1998 have led to large economic losses, especially in polders with a fast rainfall runoff process due to the high percentage of land occupied by greenhouses. This thesis focuses on water system assessments, conducted in greenhouse dominated polders. The water system assessment is divided in a technical analysis (using a hydrodynamic model) and an analysis on the cooperation between the different parties involved in water management. The inundation of 1998 had a large impact in the area managed by the water board of Delfland. As a reaction to the inundation, policies were created containing storage capacity standards for the open water of polders. Based on these standards the project ABCDelfland (Afvoer- en Bergings Capaciteit Delfland, in English: Drainage and Storage Capacity Delfland) was started, in which water systems of main canals and polders were assessed. The polder assessment was aimed at reviewing if the new standards were met. In the assessment the water board focused on the water system under its own control. The focus of that study was not on how to solve the inundation problem, but on how the open water system could comply with the standards. The solutions which were identified to make the water system meet the standards were financially not feasible. It was found that a better representation of the water system was needed to develop new solutions. Cooperation between the parties involved in water management would be needed to make this happen. This study was conducted to improve the assessment methods of rainfall fed inundation in greenhouse dominated polders. It uses the Oranjepolder (located in the management area of the water board of Delfland) as a case study, since inundation has occurred several times in this polder and is well documented and parties are engaged in finding new innovative solutions for the problem. In this assessment a form of participatory modeling was applied. Input for a new hydrodynamic model was given by all parties involved in the management of water in the Oranjepolder. The water board of Delfland is responsible for the management of the open water, the sewer systems are managed by the municipality of Westland and horticulturists influence the runoff to open water by the storage of water in basins. By sharing information and experiences during workshops, this research has been made possible. Through the cooperation of these parties, the important elements of the water system and the key to future solutions are identified. A hydrodynamic model of the Oranjepolder with a high level of detail is achieved. All important hydrologic processes are included. The hydrology of greenhouses is included on an individual level, resulting in a runoff to open water which represents the actual situation. Secondly, the channel flow model contains all channels and water structures located in the polder. This makes it possible to review inundation at every channel. Thirdly, the sewer system of the village Maasdijk is included in the model. Water flowing out of manholes and the interaction between the sewer and open water system are made visible. Finally, the aspect of overland flow is included. By taking all these hydrologic processes into account, predictions with a high level of precision can be made. The high level of detail and the high precision of the model lead to better insight in the factors that influence inundation. Testing the model with real rainfall data resulted in the identification of multiple inundation locations, which were also reported in reality. Due to this high predictive value it was possible to devise precise measures to prevent future inundation. These measures are not confined to the open water system but also concern the sewer system and the hydrology of greenhouses. It is expected that the total cost and amount of land needed, will be substantially lower than in previous assessments and that all stakeholders will support the implementation of measures.","greenhouses; polders; inundation; hydrodynamic model; participatory modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-07-21","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Watermanagement","","Water Resources","",""

(mentor)","2011","The electricity sector in Spain had been evolving steadily in an ascendant rate since the liberalization in late 90’s. Demand was expected to keep growing but it suddenly dropped in 2009 creating an unbalance in the system in terms of demand and capacity available. In addition the increasing share of renewable energy contribution has also imposed an additional pressure on the hydro and thermal technologies leaving less residual demand for such technologies. The current and expected scenario in the Spanish mainland power system seems to be harder for the ordinary regime technologies for the coming years. It has just been issued a Royal Decree to support the domestic coal mines, imposing quotas for coal units using such coal. This work has the purpose of gather all the regulatory and economical constraints and apply them to estimate the generation costs for the following ten years. The approach to do such extensive task is to apply a regulated cost structure based on fixed and variable costs already proved in a previous work as a reference model to contrast the system costs in the mainland power system in Spain. The generation dispatch is done using a traditional approach of unit commitment based on the least cost dispatch and taking into consideration the different constraints to reflect the most plausible behavior of market players. The results are consistent with the costs associated to the different technologies. Nuclear units are base load during the whole year and CCGT is the technology that balances the system because of demand-generation variations. The most stable technology in terms of cost and production is the Nuclear while the technology with the lowest costs is hydro. Coal and CCGT technologies appear to be the most expensive and become the marginal technologies. Regarding to the evolution of the generation mix, there are thermal units decommissioned because of aging and the new Industrial Emissions Directive issued by EU. In addition, an assumption was made of what in reality would happen when the existing thermal units are not being dispatched and the owners decide closure. It was also included new hydro power plants either under construction or planned to be commissioned and the necessary additional MW needed as CCGT units in order to keep security of supply in the system. The latter was done mainly to keep the Coverage Index in the minimum level required by the system operator.","regulated cost structure; optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-08-10","Technology, Policy and Management","Modelling","","MSc.

The project started when the graduating student contacted the company in October 2010 with the aim to offer himself to develop a graduation project for PSP. The company had at that time a project to be started, which was proposed to the graduating student. The project deals with the creation of a new line of kitchenware products under the name of a new brand, Ozelio, differentiated from Peugeot. The wish of PSP Peugeot is to continue in the path of business expansion that it has started since the re-foundation of the company in 1989. Being already present in the salt&pepper mill segment (core business), coffee mills and wine accessories became also part of Peugeot’s portfolio. Hence, a move towards kitchenware accessories seems a natural step of future development for PSP. However, the direction considered that the kitchenware line should be positioned in a medium-premium level (concerning selling price) and should not be marketed under Peugeot’s name. This is due to the leader image that Peugeot has in the salt&pepper image, which would not be the case in the kitchenware market. First of all the focus on kitchenware should be stressed. Even if nowadays there is a blurring line between kitchenware and tableware products, the interest of creating Ozelio lies in the development, production and marketing of cooking utensils and items around the kitchen environment. Therefore, items such as cutlery, plates, glasses and other tableware accessories have been left out of the competitors analysis. Following the same line, small electric kitchen appliances such as toasters, electrical juice press, coffee makers and others are also out of the scope of the project. Since there is no defined product to start with, it is still difficult to define the boundaries of the issues to research. Kitchenware is defined as “the utensils used in a kitchen” by the Oxford dictionary, however, we should exclude the cookware, “pots, pans, or dishes in which food can be cooked” from the scope of this project. The process described in this report deals with the creation of a base for the product range and future development of products. Additionally a product proposal is presented in order to embody the created guidelines for the product range.","kitchenware; range","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-07-15","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

This method assesses what the level of experienced inconvenience is, and what the frequency of application of the solution for the inconvenience would be. A full cutting board was the most major inconvenience revealed. When preparing food - fresh fruit, vegetables and meat – one cuts pieces of food and both good parts, the edibles, as well as bad parts, the discards pile up on the cutting board. Having these two piles on top of the cutting board decreases the amount of working surface to cut other remaining pieces of food. Furthermore these two piles will grow into each other at one point, creating an undesirable mix of edibles and discards. An analysis of existing cutting boards and their additional features revealed the many different types of boards.

(mentor); Khoshnevis Gargar, N. (mentor)","2011","In-situ combustion (ISC) is an enhanced oil recovery process during which air or oxygen-enriched air is injected into a reservoir. The oil in the reservoir reacts with the oxygen and the so-called combustion front is formed and propagates through the reservoir, generating heat and flue gases. During the process, numerous chemical reactions take place in different zones and temperature ranges. For the description of the process the oil is represented by pseudo components. The definition of the pseudo component defines the reaction schemes implemented in the numerical simulator. The reaction kinetics are described by relative simple order reactions for which the reaction rates are calculated using the Arrhenius-type equations. Estimating the input parameters of the Arrhenius equation is a giant obstacle in ISC modelling. Combustion tube experiments are performed to acquire oil, water and gas production data, the effluent composition and temperature profiles which depend on the oil and reservoir rock properties. Estimating the Arrhenius parameters can be done by history matching these experiments. Due to the quite large amount of parameters non-unique solutions are found. Unfortunately, so far the resulting adjusted parameters are not tested if they describe a chemical-physical sound and realistic behavior. In this research an ISC tube experiment with an Athabasca bitumen was simulated using a commercial thermal simulator (CMG STARS). The cumulative oil and gas production and the temperature profiles of the experiment were used for verification of the simulations. The first simulation was done with the input parameters as stated by Yang and Gates (2009). In this simulation the reaction rate parameters were chosen such that coke formation from asphaltene by cracking already commences at temperatures of around 343 K and coke formation from asphaltenes by oxidation at temperatures of around 650 K. Further, in the applied reaction schemes methane combustion is assumed to be up to a factor 1030 slower than hydrocarbon gas combustion. In this study, the reaction kinetics were changed to see the influence of the reaction kinetics parameters of asphaltene cracking and asphaltene oxidation at lower temperatures. Further, the reaction rates describing methane combustion was set equal to the kinetic parameters of hydrocarbon gas combustion. From these simulations it was found that the hydrocarbon gas combustion reaction does not significantly influence the ISC process. Changing the reaction kinetics of asphaltene cracking and oxidation does influence the ISC process significantly; asphaltene cracking occurs fasters and starts at lower temperature, more coke is formed and combusted in the simulation but less oil is produced than in the base case. Furthermore, the injection rate of the air was varied to identify the impact of the fuel/oxygen ratio on the production data. A higher air injection rate shows that the combustion front moves through the reservoir in a shorter amount of time; which indicates that it is possibly economically favorable to inject air at a higher rate into an oil reservoir in which ISC is conducted.","in-situ combustion; simulation; sensitivity analysis","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Applied Earth Sciences","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2011","In this thesis the impact of an earthquake on quay walls located at the Euromax terminal of the Port of Rotterdam is analyzed. A quay wall is a soil retaining structure where ships can moore and transfer goods. Seismic behaviour of two different types of quay walls are investigated and compared by performing a seismic analysis on the Euromax terminal. The first quay wall is the existing quay wall of the Euromax terminal which is a diaphragm quay wall with relieving structure and the second quay wall is a caisson quay wall. The seismic analysis is based on three steps which will include assessment of the regional seismicity, the geologic hazards and soil-structure interaction analysis. The first step is to define the earthquake motion and its magnitude for the Euromax terminal. This is done by making a seismic hazard analysis which is based on geologic, tectonic and historical seismicity data available for the Netherlands. The probability of occurrence of a high earthquake magnitude at the Euromax terminal is very low due to the fact that no major faults are located near the terminal. The second step is to define the dynamic soil response of the Euromax terminal. This is accomplished by making a liquefaction analysis to determine the liquefaction resistance of the near surface soils and the associated potential for ground failure. Loose soils are much more susceptible to liquefaction than dense soils. The soil deposit at the eastern side of the terminal consists of several layers of loose sand which made this the most sensitive section to liquefaction. Liquefaction at this location occurs at earthquake magnitude of ML = 6,2 which corresponds with a horizontal peak ground acceleration of aH = 3 m/s2 and a return period of 751000 years. The final step is to make a seismic analysis of the quay wall structure including seismic forces acting on the two different quay walls. A literature study shows that once an earthquake hits the Euromax terminal causing the ground to shake may result in three major disadvantageous consequences for a quay wall structure. First the driving forces acting on the quay wall will increase. Secondly, shear resistance may decrease due to excess pore water generation resulting in softening of the soil and resonance may develop when the earthquake frequency reaches the fundamental frequency of the structure. The three consequences may result in strength, stability and displacement failure of a quay wall structure. Over all it can be concluded that the probability of occurrence of high magnitude earthquakes are very low. When an earthquake does strike the Euromax terminal the diaphragm quay walls and a caisson quay walls fail in a different way. It appeared that the critical failure mechanism of the diaphragm quay wall is caused by the insufficient bending capacity of the diaphragm wall resulting in breaking of the diaphragm wall. For the caisson quay wall the critical situation relates to large deformations of the landside crane track causing the cranes not to function properly. Nevertheless, both failure mechanisms occur at the same order of earthquake magnitude ML ? 5,1 which corresponds to a return period of approximate 2500 years. This indicates that both quay walls have the same order of resistance against earthquake. However, the consequences of the diaphragm quay wall failure and probably also for the combined walls will be much higher compared to that of the caisson. For this reason, the caisson quay wall is a better solution against earthquakes compared to the diaphragm wall.","quay wall; earthquake; shaking; liquefaction; caisson; diaphragm wall","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2011","Decision-making for flood defense while facing a considerable change in driving forces demands other methods than the traditional approach of forecasting and optimal policy selection. Exploratory modeling can be a candidate for helping adaptive policymaking to deal with the uncertainties that confront decision-makers. In adaptive policymaking where changes , policies are considered that respond to changes over time. This thesis addresses the question whether exploratory modeling is appropriate to support the design of flood defense strategies and in particular to assess the value of flexibility in such designs. The literature review of this thesis explores the concept of flexibility and shows that exploratory modeling as a method for handling uncertainty can contribute to system control as well as system resilience, and to scientific analysis as well as process management. The case study of this thesis demonstrates the application of exploratory modeling to flood defense strategies. It shows (1) how alternative strategies can be compared and evaluated while considering seven uncertain system parameters, (2) how the relative performance of strategies can be expressed as a regret value, and (3) how these values can be visualized to let decision-makers see how changes in parameters impact on their regret of decision-maker. These 3 goals reached by an exercise of exploratory modeling. Interpretation of computer model of a pre-investment analysis leads to selection of most robust strategy. Beside the help of visualization technique to see and compare performance of different strategies, a tool developed that counts and compare performance of strategies based on their regret value. I call this tool “Regret Frequency Table”. After finding the robust strategy which in this case was “Dike relocation” there was a need to see is this strategy flexible in terms of design to let future developments or not. Therefore based on interviews and gathered information, a decision tree has been draw to see if selected strategy can let future developments. It emerged that it can support couple of available measures in project in future. This conclusion leads to an extension of practice of exploratory modeling to apply adaptive policymaking approach to see the performance of selected strategy after taking the next step. This extension of exploratory modeling included the selection of a signpost for taking the next step. Signpost selection depends on (1) risk tolerance of decision maker (2) and model structure. The main conclusion in this step is that the sign post should be a part model; either a component of model or a parameter of model. This outcome leads to selection of a component and a parameter in model with two different values corresponding to different risk attitudes of decision maker. The results again fitted into regret frequency table and the outcome has been compared based on regret value of strategy before taking the next step. This allows seeing the value of flexibility relatively in terms of how many percent it improves the no regret values of a flexible strategy after implementing future developments. This practice lets decision maker to make his final decision about next step based on his attitude toward risk. The final outcome of research is a new approach of practicing exploratory modeling tailored for adaptive approach of policy making. I call this method “Exploratory Modeling for Adaptive Policies”.

Since, many entities are left unchanged there is a need to properly aling corporate brand with sub-brand. A Thule Towing Systems brand strategy is developed that focuses on the connection with the consumers. This is an approach that is unique in the product and technology driven industry. Nowadays the product category is of fairly low interest and brand or product differences hardly exist. Therefore, to implement the brand strategy, an audience has to be generated first. This is done by providing a value proposition to the two consumer levels that directly targets their primary needs and desires. To illustrate this, a Thule fitting concept is developed. This concept provides a healthy business model for the fitter and a superior fitter experience for the end-consumer.","branding; brand acquisition; towing; Thule; brand strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-07-15","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

We consider systems where a homogeneous multiprocessor array lies on top of reconfigurable interconnects which allow the pipeline stages of the processors to be connected in all possible configurations. Considering the multiprocessor array partitioned in substitutable units at the granularity of pipeline stages, we employ a variety of heuristic-search methods and algorithms to isolate and replace defective units. The proposed heuristics are designed for off-line execution and aim at minimizing the performance overhead necessarily introduced to the array by the interconnects' latency. An empirical evaluation of the designed algorithms is then carried out, in order to assess the targeted problem and the efficacy of our approach. Our findings indicate this to be a NP-complete computational problem, however, our heuristic-search methods can achieve 100% accuracy in finding the optimal solution among 10^19 possible candidates within 2.5 seconds. Alternatively, they can provide near-optimal solutions at an accuracy which consistently exceeds 70% (compared to the optimal solution) in only 10^-4 seconds.","heuristic search; fault tolerance; multiprocessor array","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science and Engineering","","Computer Engineering","",""

(mentor); Lauche, K. (mentor)","2011","The main question in this study is: “How can the distributed collaborative work system as it exists in drilling operations be improved from the perspective of the people involved concerning their context of information, communication and location during monitoring? ” Well-presented and well-understood data can improve the resilience of the system, since people have a higher awareness of the ongoing process. A system view is used to get an overview and understanding of the different important elements in the collaborative work system. In the user research this is further narrowed down to a focus on the monitoring task. The first two chapters describes the project, the context of oil and gas, a short description of the most important work tasks for drilling and completions teams onshore: planning, monitoring and troubleshooting. Three relevant themes concerning the distributed work system are addressed: collaboration, technology and the different environments used. The different people involved in distributed drilling are spread over different locations: one group of people is based offshore and the other people onshore are dispersed over different companies and locations as the operators’ office, the service companies and the rig contractor. All managerial people involved have a video conference twice day for updates and plans. Literature study on the subjects of distributed and collaborative work indicates human factors to consider. Such as the quality of experience between the user and collaborative technology: social ergonomics and team factors that show effects on asymmetry within and between teams on the different levels of information and awareness. Subject of this study is data monitoring, thus the theory of ecological interface design describes a framework for designing interfaces in complex environments. Users can be supported in their monitoring task by a representation of data on different levels of abstraction. This evokes full understanding of the system. By presenting higher levels of abstraction of data, the cognitive workload is reduced. When necessary the user can still zoom in on the detailed level of the process. A user- and context study, context mapping (Sleeswijk Visser, 2005), is executed to get an understanding of the work system from different perspectives and all the interrelated parts. People on different levels and positions in the organisation participated. In this method participants are involved by mapping their own context by means of small explorative tasks and making pictures of their work environment. Research results are shaped into eight different personas to represent the different perspectives. The user research further showed different types of data and types of data users. In most situations more information is not necessarily better, it could lead to distraction or an overload. Attention should be paid to present the right information to the right people on the right moment. The presentation of the data is an important factor in the perceived quality. From the different user groups the design proposals aim on two types of users: the driller whose actions are directly related to the data, and on onshore engineers, which monitoring behavior is characterized as ‘glancing use’. In conjunction with improved data presentations consistency is a key factor in creating matching user expectations on the systems output. Both the visible and invisible structure of the system, are important for user acceptance. Based on the above results three design directions are defined: the drillers dashboard, onshore data presentation and the role of the collaborative environment as part of the system. In the drillers environment an increased amount of available data resulted in more information to fit in an unchanged environment ergo a misfit in required functionality and design on the level of positions of elements and inconsistency in handling and layout. The information, alarms and tools are not optimally positioned in respect with one another. An information and alarm strategy should be defined to apply on existing environments, on environments to be designed, to prepare them for the future. This system approach must assure that every new element added is considered part of the system. Established standard such as ISO 11064 can be used. Maybe say out of reach? Onshore engineers primary task is to plan new wells, during this planning offshore operations are ongoing. Part of the engineers work is to keep track of these rig processes during the day. For that they monitor real time data and there are morning meetings.The interfaces used for real time data monitoring present sensor and machine data as individual numbers, gauges and graphs. Users have to assimilate those to get full understanding. Designs for new data widgets are proposed: The first proposed widget: a dynamic image is developed to summarize all valuable rig data in one picture. Users now can recognise the pattern instead of having to assimilate all separate data feeds. The image is created during co-creation sessions with people from the actual user group. The second proposal handles with the fact that not all actions from offshore influencing the data (e.g. change in mud pit volume) are presented on the monitoring screens. As it is necessary to complete the picture a widget is proposed to represent offshore actions as small notifications, to make sure the information is complete and equally distributed over the people involved. This notification system is inspired by the formerly used Public Announcement system on the rig. Onshore engineers work five days a week whilst offshore processes go on 24/7. This difference in working times results in onshore engineers monitoring data at home as well. And during the five days in the office they spent only a small amount of their time behind a desk. For these reasons consideration should be given to the application of data on mobile devices. Mobile devices have the opportunity to integrate information and communication appliances: linked to a server (cloud) this information can be centrally coordinated. Mobile devices have small (touch) screens and therefore require a different approach to interfaces design. Dedicated applications have to be developed.","interaction design; data presentation; distributed work; user study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design for Interaction","","","",""

From a simple network constituted by just a PC and a modem, the home network has become a complex environment providing connectivity to several devices with different capabilities. Although service providers possess tools to manage their own core and access networks, they lack the tools to get information related to home network characteristics. Due to the impact of home network configurations on delivered services, operators are interested in diagnostic tools able to gather information about the topology of the home network, the link layer technologies that are used and which are the active devices requiring home network connectivity. The goal of this thesis is to study the currently available topology discovery protocols and evaluate their suitability for home networks. Our work focuses on two protocols that are believed by the service providers’ community to be appropriate for the home network scenario. These two protocols are the Link Layer Topology Discovery (LLTD) protocol and the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP), the latter also known as IEEE 802.1AB. Our study includes the definition of a set of performance indicators for topology discovery protocols and a performance analysis of LLTD and LLDP for different conditions and topologies. We designed several experiments representing the most common home network configurations, and carried out measurements that provide the data needed for our analysis. Based on the obtained results, we then proposed a novel topology discovery architecture, called Home Network Topology Discovery (HNTD) that fulfills most of operators’ requirements, in contrast to LLTD and LLDP.","HTIP; LLTD; LLDP; IEEE 802.1AB; TR-069","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-01-13","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Department of Telecommunications, Wireless and Mobile Communications (WMC) Group","","Master of Science in Electrical Engineering","",""

Code smells are considered to be symptoms of anti-patterns and occur at source code level. The lifespan of code smells in a software system can be determined by mining the software repository on which the system is stored. This provides insight into the behaviour of software developers with regard to resolving code smells and anti-patterns. This thesis presents a custom built application that computes the lifespans of certain types of code smells in a software repository. As a case study, this tool is applied on seven open source systems in order to answer research questions concerning the lifespan of code smells and the refactoring behaviour of developers. The results of this study reveal that engineers are aware of code smells, but not very concerned with their impact, given the low refactoring activity. Finally, several suggestions are given to further develop the application and to extend the work done in this thesis.","Software evolution; Code smells; Software repository mining","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-07-13","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Software Engineering","",""

Designing products with great quality, reliability and user-friendly design. Océ is serving the professional large format CAD printing market with the excellent PlotWave 300 product. Unfortunately, SME’s in emerging markets can not afford the printer. Océ also wants to reach this market, leading to this project: Reinventing the large format printer by means of the reverse innovation. Developed nations seem to be the most advanced nations in the world. Conventionally, innovations originate here, resulting in products made and sold horizontally. With reverse innovation however, products are designed and sold in the local emerging market, from where it can reach to the developed nations also. An extensive field research was done in India. Interviewing, observing and engaging with Indian SME’s revealed for this market in particular that product size (in volume), selfmaintenance and initial cost are the key product drivers. In addition, the market also demands the same functionality, productivity and reliability as in the developed market. To meet these challenging needs and requirements, a breakthrough design was developed: the Océ Ganesha. Named after the Hindu god Ganesha, the Remover of Obstacles. This innovation breakthrough relies on a staggered printing process with commercially off-the-shelf all-in-one cartridges from Canon. The Océ Ganesha reinvents large format printing. Delivering the smallest large format printer in the world, which can be sold for less than half the price of the PlotWave 300, that can be maintained locally and outperforms the competition. The design has been kept so simple to understand that consumables and maintenance parts are easily accessible, leading to higher productivity and low maintenance time, giving more power to the user. The Ganesha is an all-round printer, printing A4 up to 36” paper with very high quality and high printing speed without losing on other specs. The printer has been designed with upgradability in mind, adding an extra paper drawer for two to three extra rolls. This Ganesha was designed for India through reverse innovation and promises to be a breakthrough innovation for the worldlarge large-format printing market.","reverse innovation; innovation; maintenance; developed nation; emerging market; breakthrough; local design; invention; printing; printer; cartridge; canon; Océ; Oce; professional; large; CAD; architects; engineers; SME","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-07-11","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

How can this support be adjusted in real-time to the intention of the user? The given support should be intuitive, user-specific, compliant and robust to sensor noise. We suggest the use of an adaptive oscillator, which can detect the frequency and phase of the user's gait. The designed oscillator-based controller is capable to adjust the support in real time, based on reliable joint angle measurements. The adaptive oscillator determines the position and velocity reference trajectories, based on the measured joint angles. The controller uses these reference trajectories to attract the current angle respectively velocity. In simulations the control parameters for the oscillator-based controller are optimized: the phase shift, to determine the reference trajectories and the controller stiffness/damping trajectories, for the impedance control. All parameters are determined in a one-stage optimization minimizing the stiffness and the power to find a minimal disturbed gait. The applied phase shift is time variable. The stiffness and damping of the controller can vary in one gait cycle between two values The simulation results show that the hip and knee joint angle trajectories and the ankle joint torque in simulations are similar to recorded human data. The optimization algorithm finds the same reference angles over multiple optimization runs and retrieves a separation between swing and stance phase of the controller stiffness without explicit prior knowledge. The performance of the optimized oscillator-based controller is determined for the ankle joint using specially designed pneumatic ankle foot orthoses (PAFO). The PAFO actuate the plantar flexion movement with pneumatic muscles. The performance of the controller is analyzed measuring the activity of the Tibialis Anterior and Gastrocnemius Medialis with electromyography (EMG). The oscillator-based controller found the same reference joint angles and velocities in real time compared to the optimization. The desired exoskeleton torques are comparable to the simulations, but the amplitude is lower. The support decreased the EMG activity of the Gastrocnemius Medialis. The lack of transparency of the PAFO increased the EMG of the Tibialis Anterior. Overall the oscillator-based controller can give a user-specific support by detecting the gait frequency and learning the gait trajectory. The specially designed PAFO can be used to validate the performance of controllers on humans. The EMG of the Gastrocnemius Medialis decreases using the oscillator based controller. The EMG can even decrease more, when the transparency of the PAFO is increased.","exoskeleton; control; oscillator-based control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-06-30","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","Biomechatronics","",""

(mentor)","2011","The documentation process at Staatsolie refinery concerning the Test and Inspection turnaround (T&I), has many shortcomings. This fact has led to many problems during the T&I, a process that has a strict timeline and schedule that is very work intensive. During a T&I turnaround which takes place every 4 years, the plant at Staatsolie refinery is shut down. This costs money, because normal work is ceased. The fact that the documentation process has many shortcomings is therefore a crucial problem, because it has contributed to many documents not being created or documents gone missing. It has also contributed to the T&I getting behind schedule, which is a loss of money for Staatsolie. Furthermore it has hindered the creation of reports that need to be archived and accessible for at least 2 years. What the T&I turnaround requires is the ability to manage, store and share the documents acquired during the turnaround in a fast and reliable way. This can be achieved by using an information system, more specifically an Electronic Document Management System (EDMS). Such a system should allow users to store, access and modify information quickly and easily. The aim of this thesis is to select an EDMS for the T&I turnaround. This EDMS should allow users to store, access and modify information quickly and easily, and thus aid in keeping to the T&I schedule. It should also thoroughly remove the problem of missing documents or documents not being created. The start point of this thesis is an analysis of the T&I organization and the documents involved in the processes, to get a general idea of the working methodologies and deficiencies of the current system. These findings will then be used to set up a thorough requirements specification for a selection of an EDMS for the T&I turnaround. After the analysis has been made, this report will go on to evaluate and select the right tool for use at the refinery of Staatsolie. This evaluation and selection process is conducted using a basic information framework for EDM systems. For this evaluation, the output from the analysis is used to create an official Request for Proposal (RFP). This RFP is then sent out to multiple vendors. The vendors that reply are then tested against the selection criteria that were created by the project group at Staatsolie. Finally, a tool is selected and this vendor will then further design and implement this system for an effective Document Management System for the Test and Inspection turnaround.","Document Management; EDMS; Records Management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-07-21","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","Information Architecture","",""

With a user centered design approach the project started with a broad scope on the mobile market and potential new markets. During research in the analyzing phase fundamental problems with laptops in education have come to light. Further research revealed these problems are limiting the learning performance of students and are internationally universal. At schools a vision to overcome these problems is absent and despite large investments, currently there is a counter movement to be seen back to using traditional study books. By framing these problems from both the perspective of the students and teachers, it became clear how their needs are different and why these problems exist. After the analysis different concepts were evaluated with students with models and sketches to test which kind of form factor or device they thought could help them with their study and provide practical mobile use. During the concept development a solution was found for the integration of the flexible display and a flexible material, which simplifies the mechanical construction. Further elaboration focused on the shape, construction, look and feel, interaction and product proposition. The product aims to overcome the interaction limitations by offering barrier-free teaching in classrooms and stimulate learning beyond school times with its compactness and versatility. This results in more direct contact with students both inside as outside the classroom. The teacher is able to individually control the software functionalities of The Booc when located in the classroom to place him in control and distractions of the students can be reduced. A prototype of the final design was tested with both students and teachers, and the product proposition was evaluated with the school management. The tests showed that the product fits in the lives of the students and that the problems of working with laptops are solved. The results suggest that with the product the learning performance of students could be improved and the current counter movement in digital education can be overcome.","flexible display; polymer vision","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-07-08","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","IPD","",""

The purpose of this modeling effort was to test the ability of process-based modeling tools to successfully simulate typical delta-building processes and the resulting morphologic and stratigraphic characteristics of the delta. Recent developments in conceptual modeling of mouth bar formation and full delta development have confirmed the capability of process-based models to simulate the processes necessary for delta growth and the resulting long-term, geologic scale morphologic and stratigraphic features. In this attempt to model the actual development of a prototype delta using similar techniques to those employed in the conceptual delta models, the applicability of physics-based modeling to delta evolution simulation will be further validated. Morphology qualitatively reproduced typical river-dominant delta growth through the establishment of new depositional lobes while maintaining approximate radial symmetry. More specific stratigraphic features were also reproduced. The successive stacking of coarsening upwards sequences observed in Wax Lake Delta mouth bar deposits was evident in the stratigraphy of modeled incipient jet deposits, a result of the varying discharge regime. Though incipient jet deposits developed in the model at the distal ends of distributary channels, the prograding bars did not aggrade sufficiently to induce flow bifurcation and the development of a mature mouth bar depositional lobe. The overall coarsening-upwards, though sand dominant stratigraphic sequence of typical friction-dominant river mouth deposits is reproduced. Significant mud-dominant prodelta deposition is observed basinward of the original delta front location. In the prototype Wax Lake Delta, deposition of fine sediments in this area is hindered by waves and wind-induced transport, so the modeled mud depositional bodies do not reflect prototype development. Distributary channels are significantly incised and narrowed over the course of the simulation. The narrowing proceeds from significant sand-dominant subaqueous levee deposition on the channel banks. Though distributary channels in the real Wax Lake Delta do frequently incise through the full deltaic sedimentary sequence with channel extension, the modeled incision is persistent throughout the simulation. Upstream accretion of established delta lobes through sand-deposition, similar to the observed primary process of subaerial development in the neighboring Atchafalaya Delta, was also present in the modeled development. The Wax Lake Delta is clearly river-dominant according to traditional classification schemes; however, the deposition of fine sediments is influenced by basin processes that resuspend and export significant quantities from Atchafalaya Bay. The processes contributing to the coarse sediment depositional features that dominate the Wax Lake Delta are qualitatively simulated under purely riverine forcings, but the fine sediment dynamics cannot be accurately simulated in the present, process-limited model. Recommendations for improving morphological simulation include model redevelopment with an alternative, total load transport formulation and the inclusion of limited marine forcings that inhibit fine-sediment deposition.","Wax Lake Delta; morphodynamic modeling; Delft3D; deltaic processes; mouth bar stratigraphy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Section Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

It was recognized that the currently available braces all rely on fixing something tightly around the ankle region. Although it has been proven that the use of ankle braces can reduce the accident rate 2,3,140,104, these are often rejected by athletes due to their inconvenience. The similarity between the evolved principle of the foot’s ligaments and the preferred basic function of an ankle support was guiding the analysis and concept development process. A solution was found that restricts the relative motion between two rigid parts (the foot and the lower leg) by an external ligament means. This comprises a construction that is positioned around the users ankle and subsequently connected to an attachment feature on the shoe. An ankle sprain injury occurs when high impact forces make the foot rotate beyond its normal range of motion. This should be restricted by the external ankle support. The challenge to effectively transfer a force from the foot to the lower leg was solved by the development of a half open clip that allows to exert pressure onto the malleoli without the need for strapping something tightly around the ankle. The final result of the development process was the achievement of a technical proof of principal accompanied by a patent application describing the innovative principle of motion restriction. A range of prototypes were successfully tested by athletes.","ankle; brace; support; sprain prevention","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-07-08","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor); Uijttewaal, W.S.J. (mentor); Henriquez, M. (mentor); Walstra, D.J. (mentor)","2011","Mobile bed scaling (for scales smaller than 1:1) does not allow for ideal similarity between all nondimensional parameters. This leads to an exaggerated presence of one process over another or the development of scale effects. The complexity of the surf zone makes it especially difficult to separate and quantify the effect of sediment scaling on each individual process. As a result, the impact of sediment scaling on the holistic morphodynamic process is poorly understood. Profiles were obtained at TU Delft (scale 1:10) following the testing regime used during the SANDS project. This set made use of density and diameter scaled sediment (?s = 1200 kg/m3 and d50 = 0.52 mm); scaled according to the bed load model of Henriquez, Reniers et al. (2008). The set used for analysis here includes the Hannover (prototype scale 1:1) and Deltares (Froude scale 1:6) profiles obtained during SANDS. The present work looks to extend what is currently known about the impact of sediment scaling on nearshore transport processes. Three main objectives are identified: 1) Showing profile development and inferred transport rates, compare nondimensional parameters across the nearshore and surf zone; 2) Identify how spatial variance of dominate hydrodynamic and sediment transport regimes across the surf zone are influenced by the subsequent scaling; 3) Explain morphological differences due to scaling by observing the small scale transport process. Analysis of the profiles showed a marked degree of geometrical similarity between all three facilities. More specifically, the development of a bar-trough system and subsequent offshore migration. The transport rates were, however, divergent. Compared to Hannover, the transport rates at Deltares were low where conversely TU Delft was high. Using ideal scaling theories as a basis, the cross shore distribution of the nondimensional parameters at TU Delft suggested that both sediment mobility and near bed suspension were similar with prototype. However, due to a large fall velocity, the Dean number was underestimated. From the use of Froude scaling at Deltares, the nondimensional parameters suggested that neither near bed nor suspended load transport regimes were reproduced correctly. This can mostly be attributed to the rippled bed state and reduced Shields value. A simple depth and time averaged model was also used to decompose the sediment concentrations. These concentrations were used to check consistency of the nondimensional parameter agreement with the manifestation of the physical process. Inconsistent with the nondimensional results, TU Delft showed that near bed sediment mobility and suspension was high. It is believed this led to the exaggerated sediment fluxes. Concentrations at Deltares suggest the rippled bed introduced a thinned boundary layer which caused decreased sediment mobility and the decreased sediment fluxes.","mobile bed; physical modeling; bar migration; scaling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Section Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

In reaction global studies were done (Nicholls et al., 2008, Hanson et al., 2011) to assess the vulnerability of coastal regions. However, most of these publications did not address the development of climate adaptation designs to protect the coastline. In this study it is demonstrated how a localized coastal vulnerability assessment could guide the development of conceptual designs in an African context. The overall aim of this thesis is the appraisal of climate adaptation measures and coastal management strategies for Durban, South Africa. The main focus is on an illustrative case study, for a coastal section along Durban´s central beaches. The case study is an example of how the vulnerability to coastal hazards could be assessed, for different SLR scenarios, to provide guidance for developing conceptual coastal protection designs. The March 2007 storm event (estimated to have a one in 50 year return period) indicated that significant damage can be sustained from coastal hazards in Durban at the current conditions. A one in 100 year storm is shown to already affect the operations of critical infrastructure in current conditions such as the beach road in the vulnerability assessment. The vulnerability increases significantly for future SLR scenarios. Softer, sediment based protection solutions were preferred for the case study due to the environmental, recreational and touristic requirements of the beachfront. Protection solutions developed for the two SLR scenarios give an idea of the footprint of different options and how easily the can be adapted to higher water levels. The vulnerability assessment and proposed protection solutions could be used as a basic tool for budgeting and long term spatial planning as it gives indicative costs and an idea about the areas that could potentially be at risk to coastal hazards. Developing a generic vulnerability assessment methodology could be beneficial for local municipalities. Completing similar vulnerability assessment studies (or more detailed studies) at other vulnerable coastal locations is a recommended starting point for the climate adaptation process and to inform global vulnerability and adaptation studies. Local governments are recommended to gather local data, assess vulnerability, propose a strategy to deal with future SLR scenarios and develop protection solutions for critical areas.","Climate Adaptation; Coastal Protection; Sea level rise; Vulnerability; Africa","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-07-08","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Section Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

(mentor)","2011","Reef systems have been estimated to exist along approximately 80% of the world’s coastlines with living coral reefs, relic limestone platforms and submerged rock formations being the most common types observed. The processes of wave breaking on a reef crest, setup on a reef and flow over and within a lagoon, have been the primary focus of research to date, while wave transformation shoreward of the reef crest and surf zone have also been studied. The propagation of low frequency waves has been shown to have a large influence on flow, sediment transport and morphology. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that these waves may possess periods that, if closely correlated with the reef width and depth, may enter a standing wave type form and possibly resonate. Aim: The aim of this study was to determine the indicators of low frequency resonance in field, laboratory or numerical model data, and to identify the influence of different geometric parameters on the generation of low frequency wave resonance on a fringing reef. Methods: The indicators were tested by the use of the numerical model XBeach, which was demonstrated to consist of a numerical basis suitable for the analysis of reef systems. The model was calibrated with high-resolution field data obtained at the Ningaloo Reef (Western Australia). The tested indicators were then applied to the Ningaloo Reef field data to determine if a resonance signal could be identified at the site. Finally, a geometric parameter sensitivity analysis was conducted with an idealised reef profile based upon the Ningaloo Reef. The wave boundary of the model was forced with a JONSWAP-type spectrum that characterised the peak of a storm at the site. The influence of different geometric parameters (in both non-frictional and frictional cases) was investigated and compared to an analytical model. Results: For two time-series that are spatially lagged across a reef, three indicators need to be satisfied to demonstrate the presence of resonance. They are: the surface elevation variance across the basin must be coherent, a phase relationship associated with the mode of resonance considered must exist, and an amplification of the wave between two points considered at the frequency of resonance must occur. The results of the indicator tests showed strong agreement with a simple basin analytical model that was adapted to include the effect of a lagoon. Strong amplification (resonant) peaks were observed for the first two standing waveforms. The frequency of these peaks was affected by the setup on a reef while the amplitude was affected by the influence of friction. It was shown that for frictional values consistent with Ningaloo Reef, the amplification peaks ‘flatten’ to magnitudes similar to the progressive waves in the spectrum. The geometric sensitivity analysis indicated that the resonant frequency was more sensitive to the reef and lagoon length than the reef and lagoon depth. The amplification was greatest for the zero and first-mode of resonance. However this amplification was dampened with the introduction of friction. It was determined that resonance is not likely to occur on reef systems with the geometry, frictional characteristics and wave forcing similar to the studied section of Ningaloo Reef. Resonance may occur for reef systems with shorter reef and lagoon widths, lower frequency forcing and/or less frictional dissipation. The latter may occur for reefs that have a different roughness to Ningaloo Reef as well as for reef systems that are damaged or dying in which coral assemblages degrade into coral rubble.","resonance; fringing reef; low-frequency; XBeach; coral reef; standing wave; infragravity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

(mentor); Tromp, N. (mentor)","2011","Summary The outcome of this graduation project aims to change aggressive behavior and emotional well being for youngsters who are being treated at Fjord, an Ortho-psychiatric and Forensic youth psychiatry centre. Reactive visible aggression is a problem for society as it generates feelings of not being safe and costs the society money. Therapeutic centers as Fjord try to change aggression amongst other psychical disorders. Although aggressive behavior is difficult to change they do not use products yet to support behavioral change. Furthermore, youth who is diagnosed with a disruptive behavior disorder suffers from their disorder and often regrets their behavior. Other people, such as neighbors, family and friends also suffer from behavior from disordered patients. They, patients, Fjord and society will benefit if their aggressive behavior can be diminished through product use. Aggression is not an emotion but is a behavioral response on a negative emotion. What negative emotions does Fjord youth experience? How do they regulate those emotions so that they eventually behave aggressive? These questions needed to be answered to understand the problem and above all formulate an answer on the question: Where should a product intervene and what should the products function be? Through extensive literature and user research answers to those questions could be formulated. Design research led to a concept design Beat-it which was prototyped and evaluated through qualitative interviews and an effect test. Beat-it is a smart phone application that asks users to express their emotion through shaking with their phone. Based on the intensity of the shaking movement, Beat-it starts to play a song that matches the user’s arousal. The user has to reflect whether or not this song fits his emotion, if yes, he can start the game by moving his phone to his hart. He accepts the song and implicitly his emotion. The challenge of the game is to swing along with your phone on the beat. The game will distract and calm down the user. After the game, the user can save his score. As a reward for the game he now hears his favorite song. On top of his favorite song he hears himself sharing helping thoughts and insights concerning his emotion. Beat-it uses embodied emotion interaction, game play and music to emotionally and physically calm down users. Acceptance, distraction and reappraisal are emotion regulation strategies that Beat-it applies in order to regulate negative emotions and prevent aggressive outbursts. Beat-it regulates emotions generated by the knowledge system through reappraisal, generates positive emotions through the body by game play and physical interaction and diminishes emotions generated by the attention system by distraction. This graduation project comes to the conclusion that when needing to prevent aggression, Beat-it can be an addition for Fjord employees. Beat-it proved to calm down users and to positively influence the emotion of users. Furthermore, Fjord youth liked to use Beat-it.","Implication design; Emotion; Behavior; Social design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

The goal of our project is to develop an innovative algorithm to perform data prediction, and to apply this algorithm in a stock market forecasting application. The application should generate investment strategies which can be evaluated to output an optimal investment portfolio. We have achieved this goal by making use of a variant of Genetic Programming to create strategies which are represented internally by a tree containing ""modules"". Each module performs a specific function; examples include simple numerical parameters, statistical functions and technical indicators. The backbone of the application is written in Java, communicating with a web-based PHP front-end through a MySQL database. The front-end allows the user to create jobs for the back-end to process, as well as view the resulting strategies and related statistics. Test runs have shown a correlation between in-sample and out-of-sample performance. Further, we have determined with high certainty that there is a predictable relation between the complexity of a test run and the duration of the run. There are several features and changes we would like to see in future development of the product. Several program parameters can be optimized further, and there are more modules to implement that could boost the performance of the generated strategies. Further, the data provided to the modules can be improved by including qualitative data about the company, or industry aggregative data. Other improvements could come from implementing support for short selling and more accurate transaction costs. On the user side, we would like to give investors more control over the strategy building process by allowing them to create templates on which new strategies have to be based.","forecasting; stock market; investing; software; genetic programming","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","","",""

Then systematic static leak-off experiments were carried out using an innovative method where CT scans taken at time intervals were used to visualize and accurately quantify infiltration of fluids in a sandstone core. Different compositions of oil based drilling fluids were investigated, to examine the influence of various particles on the external filter cake and internal filtration. Scanning electron microscopy was used to characterize the external filter cake and internal filtration. The results give accurate measurements of the filtration volume of the drilling fluids. Depending on the composition of the drilling fluid, the formation of external filter cake could be visualized on CT images. The core flow experiments are matched to the theory for linear static filtration. The results lead to new insights concerning the build of external filter cake and internal filtration. The experiments use real sandstone cores giving more realistic data than using an API press test and filter paper.

The slot pole combinations that were chosen are a multiple of 9 coils around 9 teeth with 8 magnet poles and a multiple of 3 coils around 3 teeth with 2 magnet poles. There are two types of permanent magnet constructions in the rotor, which are the Surface Mounted Permanent Magnet (SMPM) and Inset Permanent Magnet (IPM). This thesis deals with further development of the range extender generator. Two topics will be further investigated by using 2D and 3D FEM model. The first topic is the investigation of eddy current losses in the permanent magnets and rotor back iron. The second topic is the investigation of the influence of the machine ends and end windings on the flux distribution and inductivity. The rotor eddy current losses in the prototypes machine are calculated using analytic model, 2D FEM and 3D FEM model. The 3D FEM model is used to investigate the finite length effect in 2D FEM magnet loss calculations. This investigation needs to be done since the prototype generators have a short axial length. The lamination effect on the magnet loss also will be investigated in 3D FEM model. From this investigation, a correction factor to the 2D FEM magnet loss calculation is introduced. 3D FEM models are built to investigate the influence of the machine ends and end windings. With these models, the flux leakages, end inductances and the eddy current losses in the stator end are calculated.","Eddy current losses; End effect; Finite element method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Power Engineering","","Electrical power processing","",""

(mentor); Van Heur, R.J.H.G. (mentor)","2011","The project described in this thesis is named “Investigate how in-car augmented reality can improve or influence the traffic flow and safety in the Dutch traffic”. It strives to research whether visual in-car augmented reality can be beneficial for the traffic flow and safety in the Dutch traffic, and thus Rijkswaterstaat. Visual augmented reality is the field of study that focuses upon adding computer generated images or information to real objects or environments. Instead of showing information on isolated displays, data will be projected in the field of vision of the user. Unlike virtual reality, augmented reality does not create a simulation of reality. Instead, it takes a real object or environment as the foundation and couples it with virtual data and objects. Augmented reality enriches a person’s view on reality by showing information about an object or environment that he/she would not see without augmented reality. Visual augmented reality is becoming an increasingly popular interface on commercial smart mobile devices like the smartphone and tablet. Many industrial companies believe in augmented reality to be the “next big thing”. Expectations are that augmented reality will become big on the smartphone platform, via more interesting applications. This break through of augmented reality on smart mobile devices will boost the development of in-car augmented reality applications. Since it is inevitable that this development will emerge in the automotive environment, it is interesting for Rijkswaterstaat to find out what the influence of this development will be upon the Dutch traffic. Rijkswaterstaat is interested in the opportunities or threats that will occur when a significant percentage of the road vehicles is equipped with augmented reality options. Knowledge in this area can be used to maintain or improve traffic flow and safety in the Dutch traffic. A broad exploratory field study, in which up front parties in the automotive industry have been consulted, showed that visual augmented reality will find its way to the car via 3 possible platforms. A accurate technology roadmap is designed to present a clear overview about these developments up to 2020. In this roadmap is presented that visual in-car augmented reality can be implemented via the display of the smart mobile devices, via commercial augmented reality eyewear or via next generation augmented reality head up displays (HUD). In-car augmented reality applications presented via the display of smart mobile devices will be seen first due to its easy implementation in the car. This platform will be utilized by commercial augmented reality application developers. In fact these applications already exist nowadays. However, the most evident platform for in-car augmented reality use, will be a next generation augmented reality HUD. Within 5 to 6 years from now, this augmented reality HUD will be introduced by the automotive industry to at first realize functions like navigation and night vision object detection. The conceptualization phase in this project concentrated on the development of in-car augmented reality applications. Goal of the conceptualization phase was to find out which in-car visual augmented reality applications might be beneficial for the safety and traffic flow on the Dutch roads. On the other hand it had the goal to find out what threats the in-car implementation of visual augmented reality might incorporate. All applications that have an influence on safety or traffic flow (either positive or negative) have been elaborated to a video impression. In collaboration with experts from different fields of study these impressions have been evaluated. This results in a vision that tells Rijkswaterstaat about the opportunities and threats of in-car visual augmented reality. The studies resulted in the conclusion that visual in-car augmented reality will result in more driver distraction in the form of in-car visual augmented reality infotainment. These infotainment applications will enter the car via the smart mobile devices, and can be of significant danger to the driver safety. However in-car visual augmented reality also offers chances to Rijkswaterstaat. While the development does not directly enhance safety and traffic flow, it will be an ideal communication channel between Rijkswaterstaat and road-user. Being able to explain rules and limitations to the road-user, enhances the user experience and results in more commitment from their side. This research opens and validates further exploration of the topic of in-car augmented reality in the Dutch traffic.

(mentor); Van den Dobbelsteen, J.J. (mentor)","2011","Epidural anaesthesia is a pain relief technique commonly performed on patients in labor. It requires insertion of a needle into patients back into the epidural space of the spine and inject anaesthetic. It is a blind procedure and anaesthesiologists rely only on the forces felt during needle insertion to determine the position of the needle tip. It is a complex procedure that requires training. However, in a majority of hospitals the residents are trained on patiets. In this thesis development and validation of a new epidural needle insertion simulator with haptic feedback is discussed. . The simulator has 1DOF for needle insertion and 1DOF for needle orientation. The simulator uses a cable-pulley mechanism to transmit forces to the needle. The simulator provides active force-feedback by means of a motor in the needle insertion direction and passive force-feedback by means of a brake in the needle orientation direction. The simulator simulates needle-tissue and needle-bone interaction forces. It also incorporates simulation of different virtual patients, which can be selected from the graphical user interface. The real-time position of the needle can be seen in the graphical user interface. The simulator is validated through experiments by expert anaesthesiologists and novices. The simulator is validated for face and constuct validity. The results were promising showing high acceptance rate with addition of some features. Moreover, difference in performance between experts and novices was found and thus evaluating similarity to a real scenario.","simulator; haptics; needle insertion; epidural","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-08-11","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Smelik, R. (mentor)","2011","The problem posed to the authors concerns SketchaWorld, a terrain modeling framework that allows users to easily construct virtual worlds by means of sketching. Until now, the developers of SketchaWorld have focused on procedural content generation and have left its visual presentation largely untouched. The authors have been tasked to develop a rendering system that improves the visual realism in SketchaWorld. SketchaWorld organizes its world content in a scene graph, using the graphics toolkit OpenSceneGraph. A scene graph is a data structure in the form of an acyclic directed graph, for organizing objects in the world. The scene graph is both traversed to update the logic of all objects, as well as to render these objects. The rendering system would have to be compatible with this form of data structuring. The authors had decided to implement a renderer that uses a deferred rendering approach. Contrary to forward rendering, which is the ‘classic’ approach, deferred rendering postpones many of the calculations that are required to determine the final output color for a pixel. Intermediate results are stored in texture buffers and combined in later phases. The deferred renderer is designed to make full use of the advantages of scene graphs; with the renderer itself is structured as a scene graph. Many advanced techniques are implemented in the renderer, all aimed at enhancing visual realism. These techniques are spread out over the different phases in the deferred rendering pipeline. During the world render phase, primitive data about the world geometry is rendered. During the light render phase, each light is processed once to determine its influence on only the visible geometry. Afterwards, the results of both phases are combined. The atmosphere is rendered on top of that based on the time of day. Transparency has always been an issue with deferred rendering. Transparency implies that the color value of one pixel depends on multiple objects, while most deferred renderers only store one set of data per pixel. This problem therefore needs to be solved by rendering transparent objects with forward rendering, adding it to the result of the deferred rendering steps. Afterwards, post processing effects are applied. The renderer supports an arbitrary number of post processing effects, which can be swapped in real time. The authors have studied SketchaWorld and OpenSceneGraph thoroughly, in anticipation of integration at an early stage. As a result, integrating the renderer into SketchaWorld only cost minor effort. SketchaWorld’s shaders have been converted to comply with deferred rendering requirements. All lighting calculations have been removed from the shader because the renderer performs these calculations in a later phase. Most of the requirements that were formulated in the requirement analysis document have been implemented successfully. Some requirements were implemented somewhat differently than originally decided in the orientation report. These deviations were the result of new insights while developing the rendering system.","Deferred Renderer; Open Scene Graph; Virtual Worlds; Realistic","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Mediamatics","","Computer Graphics","",""

And based on the investigation and the found opportunities: create an innovative LDMCR concept that enables the crew to have a more positive experience with the LDMCR. Setting up parameters As with most (if not all) research and design projects the first part of the project consisted of looking for possibilities and setting up parameters. To manage expectations and to have all parties involved row in the same direction, the beginning of the project was all about sketching outlines for the project. A preliminary session held in the beginning of the project, kickstarted the project; providing the first insights and setting up the parameters. Research Started with the search for existing knowledge about the found directions. The following methods were used: literature research, interviews with experts, and a visit to a LDMCR, to look for these themes: Crew-rest | Culture | Healing environment | resting theory After that, new insights were sought in order to fill the remaining knowledge gaps. The focus was on the “human side” of things, providing qualitative results using two research-paths. The first, designed to get a broader view of things and to find new insights, consisted of co-researchers doing research on location. The second was a session designed to deepen insights and to formulate statements used as inspiration in the design phase. The three themes that appeared to best describe the insights are: Control | Closing off | Care / Attention Design The insights gained in the research phase served as input for a creative session with Driessen and were used to create ideas. The most promising ideas were combined into a collage describing look & feel and three concepts: Flexibility | Closing off | Nurturing These concepts were rated and combined into “Safe haven”, the final concept proposal for this project. SolidWorks was used to create a viable CAD model to help combine and fine-tune all the components and turn the ideas into one product.","remote research; co-research; contextmapping; Driessen; crew-rest; OCR","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

The idea of using microwaves for process intensification is that the direct heating of the reactants with microwaves can lead to fast and homogeneous heating to reduces the energy consumption and give each molecule the same processing experience. Two poly-esterification reaction systems were studied: first was maleic- and phthalic anhydrides with propylene glycol, and second maleic anhydride with hexamethylene glycol. Experiments were conducted in different microwave applicators, as CEM Discover, CEM MARS and Sairem INTL, as well as with conventional heating (oil bath and with an electric heating mantle). The hypothesis was that microwaves can accelerate reaction rates, increase conversion, improve the end product quality and quantity and save energy. Conversion, reaction time, molecular weight and polymer structure, and the quantity of by-products (i.e. water) obtained from different microwave applicatorswere compared with conventional heating. Comparison of power consumption of microwave reactor systems with two different types of applicators, multimode cavity and internal transmission line technology, to conventionally heated reactor was made and presented. Different reaction vessel sizes (1 and 2 liters) were used to investigate whether this can improve the removal of the by-product. The reaction was performed under nitrogen atmosphere or under vacuum at the time when water is produced in order to increase water removal. Different catalysts were tested to discover which catalyst has the best influence on the reaction, and to see, specifically, the difference in performance between microwave heating and conventional heating. Forced cooling of the reactor vessel was used so higher power levels could be applied without increasing the bulk temperature in the reactor. Silicon carbide cylinders were used to increase locally the temperature and to use the mixture as a heat sink.","microwaves; polycondensation; anhydride; glycol; triflate catalyst","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-07-06","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","IRS","",""

Such hybrid possibilities can enable enterprises to benefit from cloud-based architectures, while honouring application performance requirements, but privacy issues and security considerations is always a problem during migration. This work highlights the need for security in the cloud; Different features offered by cloud providers are explored. Concepts like Virtual machine migration and a hardware chip that can be used as a basis for trust in the cloud are discussed. Pre-migration hints shows what needs to be done before the actual secure migration paths set-in. The migration path is based on a generalisation of the kind of threats these features are exposed to. There are arguments as to why such paths are the most secure. It is a fact that cloud computing infrastructures enable companies to cut costs by outsourcing computations on-demand, however, clients of cloud computing services currently have no well acknowledged means of verifying the confidentiality and integrity of their data and computation. To address this problem, it was part of the migration strategy in this work to design a system that enables a cloud provider to provide an execution environment that guarantees integrity in the execution of virtual machines for its clients, but the design works in hand with a trusted third party.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer science","","Computer science Infomation Architecuture","",""

This was done by using the Move© software-package, provided by Midland Valley. The work was performed in several stages: 1) Creating and modifying several geological sections, after which they are unfolded for physical viability. This was done by using geological maps, sections and field data. 2) Creating a 3-dimensional model out of these sections. 3) Unfolding this model, to check for physical, and geological viability. The result is a reasonably viable model of the area, although it is not entirely accurate, because of the presence of some gaps and overlaps in the unfolded model. The average shortening value for the sections (43,4%) closely resembles the surface reduction value for the entire model (39,2%). Furthermore, this project implies that a uniform formation thickness in the studied area is a possibility. The model includes two newly created faults to accommodate the observed data, which are the Le Collet reverse-fault, and the La Rocher strike-slip-fault. Finally, the geological history of the area proves that most structures in the area were created in the Iberian plate-collision, after which these structures were deformed by the collision of the Apulian and Eurasian plates.","geology; modeling; balancing; unfolding","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Section Applied Geology","","","",""

(mentor); Hendriks, R.C. (mentor); Van der Schaar, H.S.P. (mentor)","2011","To convey messages to the public, public address systems (PA) are installed in buildings and at venues. These messages generally contain important information for the listener. This information has to come across well, i.e. the message should be intelligible. Because the environment, and mainly the background noise, can change over time, it is important for a public address system to adapt accordingly, so that the intelligibility of the messages is maintained. To maintain the intelligibility automatic volume control algorithms are used. In current solutions these algorithms adapt the volume to maintain the signal to noise ratio at a constant level. Such approaches require acquiring information about the noise from a sensing microphone. The difficulty in this is that the sensing microphone not only captures the noise, but also the signal coming from the PA itself, including its echoes and reverberations. To avoid the signal separation problem, the proposed solution directly analyses the intelligibility of the message using the signal from the sensing microphone. For this an objective intelligibility method was used, that analyses correlations between the original clean message and the distorted message, from the microphone. Using the found intelligibility, the volume is controlled to maintain intelligibility. However, because maximum intelligibility occurs at the maximum volume of the PA system, before the signal starts deforming, maintaining intelligibility alone is not enough. Loud PA systems are perceived to be annoying especially if the background noise is low. That is why the proposed solution limits the loudness of the PA system in combination with maintaining the intelligibility.","Volume; Intelligibility; Public Address","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-07-08","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Mediamatics","","Embedded Systems","",""

As a master thesis project, the process was carried out at the Product Development department of NS [Dutch Railways] in Utrecht. » The department sets new train specifications based on customer research; » The results of this project contribute to the improved design of future train toilet. This project explored possibilities of introducing: Innovative train toilet features that optimally motivate and facilitate users, to keep the toilet tidy. The research addressed user-attitudes towards keeping the train toilet tidy, of any usage-dirt. » It was found users are particularly cautious in use, when they do not experience cleanliness. The current lack in tools results in considerable effort, required from the users willing to tidy. Both disturb the motivation of users to make an effort in tidying up; » Privacy was found to allow excuses of users: “not to tidy up, even when one notices the toilet is in need of tidying up”. It negatively affects the moral judgement (to self-justify) not-to-make an effort in tidying up. Users are optimally motivated and facilitated to tidy up, by introducing train toilet features that: trigger the user?s moral to tidy up; and enable users to maintain (at least) crucial issues of cleanliness, with ease. Particularly moral users with the anti-littering norm on their mind are now likely to make sure the toilet if left neat and tidy. » To prevent users from self-justifying not-to- tidy up, motivating features were designed to trigger the user?s moral through increased social awareness and an increased sense of –possible- social rejection (by toilet users and by train passengers). In this way, the demoralising? effect of privacy on users was counteracted, not privacy of the user itself; » In addition, experiencing less anonymity (from toilet users and from train passengers), by reducing the contrast in anonymity (in the toilet and in the train), was envisioned to encourage the user?s moral to tidy up. » To prevent disturbing the user?s motivation by either lack of tools or lack of cleanliness, facilitating features were designed to maintain cleanliness of crucial cleanliness elements, with minimal user effort to satisfactory results; » In addition, perceiving how these features –having been used- benefit the cleanliness of the toilet to the present user?s advantage, was envisioned to encourage use of the features. An experiential prototype study was set-up to test the concept, in a research setting. » Because the behavioural sciences of research into social pressures and motivations are outside the scope of this design project, the prototype study was intended as indicative-only in obtaining the design goals. » By using the prototype, it was determined whether the concept features were: not disturbing privacy or toileting; were noticed by the participants; and were used as designed. » In addition, indications of reduced anonymity were sought. » Key conclusions and recommendations to NS are listed here.","Train toilet; Persuasive design; NS; Motivation; User centered; Cleanliness; Toilet","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-07-05","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Koltunowicz, T.L. (mentor)","2011","This master’s thesis project is a part of the Sinergie project (sponsored by Agentschap NL, 2007-2012) which is dedicated to analyze the functionality of the grid of the future. The European Union has advanced plans to decarbonize the power sector onwards the year 2050 and therefore the use of renewable energy sources is expected to increase. The distributed energy generation from, for example, wind turbines and solar cells are not constant during a day as the wind speeds and incoming solar radiation vary. Therefore an increase in power transport between different regions throughout Europe is expected. During operation, transformers heat up or cool down depending on the varying loads. These variations in load depend mostly on the time of the day, as consumers require more power at specific times of the day. The high electric field strengths, which are a result of peaking power transport, combined with these thermal cycles have their impact on transformer insulation. The grid of the future will still be partly composed of today’s components and asset management strategies will be used to replace components, such as transformers, just before their end of life. The aforementioned renewable energy sources are often connected to the grid via power electronic converters. These convertors introduce transient spikes in the grid. Therefore the effect of both temperature cycling and transients on transformer insulation are investigated in this research. Chapter 2 includes a literature study on transformers. Transformers are essential parts of the electric grid. They can be found at the generation, transmission and distribution level. During operation, degradation factors influence the state of the transformer insulation. The insulation experiences environmental ageing factors such as pyrolysis, oxidation and hydrolysis. Chapter 3 shows the measurements which have been performed. Three series of experiments have been performed on transformer paper samples with a thickness of 0.060mm. These series consist of AC breakdown tests, time to breakdown tests and tangents delta measurements. The breakdown voltage increases from 3.11kV to 3.59kV (11V/?C) when the temperature is increased from 16.6?C to 60?C. Up to 80?C, the breakdown voltage decreases to 3.12kV (23.5V/?C) when temperature is increased to 80?C. The time to breakdown is determined at 2.91kV and the time 63.2% of the samples fail increases from 48.4 to 82.1 and 147 hours when temperature is increased from 40?C to 60?C and 80?C, respectively. In the third series, transient spikes of 1kV superimposed on a 2.22kV AC waveform and samples are stressed for 22 hours. The transients are applied in a range from 1kHz up to 10kHz and it can be observed that the tangents delta increases with 6.4% compared to stressing with 2.22kV AC only. The results of the main experiments are interpreted in Chapter 4. Based on this interpretation, a model is made that can be used to calculate the accelerated ageing factors of the insulation and to incorporate the interaction between oil and paper. Measurement data should be used to calculate the loss of life due to daily loading cycles. Two loading scenarios are compared and it is shown that when renewable energy sources increase transport and introduce transients in the grid, ageing of transformers is accelerated.","transformer insulation; repetitive transients; impregnated insulation; temperature; ageing; temperature cycling; future grid; renewable energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-07-07","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","High Voltage Management & Technology","","Electrical Engineering - Electrical Power Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2011","The installation of wind power generation in the Netherlands has been increased drastically over years and there are many going – on projects regarding harnessing wind energy by means of converting it into useful electrical power. One of the largest gas and electrical network operators, Stedin B.V. has decided to operate wind farm (s) in Goeree Overflakkee region, Zeeland in the south of the Netherlands. The idea is that residents living in that region suffer voltage instability problem for a long time since the current grid is not strong enough to meet the total load demand and does not reach at desired reliability level. Therefore, the company has a plan that due to the installation of wind farm(s) to the site, the direct advantage of using wind energy in order to get electrical power will be taken resulting in a more reliable supply of electricity for the people living in that island. In order to obtain desired results regarding system stability and reliability in case of the wind power injection into the existing grid, there are many important issues to be taken into account because of the fact that wind power shows stochastic behavior over time. Wind power penetration puts many serious problems on the table such as voltage and frequency stability of the conventional power grid due to uncertainty output power of wind during operation of wind farm(s). Several serious technical problems are faced during the system operation, such as over-voltages or under-voltages at the nodes at steady state, protection malfunctions, increase in short circuit levels and power quality problems. Throughout the thesis, the issue of voltage stability in steady – state operation of the system will be focused on as a main goal. One of the most essential tools to investigate the effect of wind power in the system once the operation holds in steady state is the probabilistic power flow analysis (PLF). By the help of the PLF tool, one can have a better understanding of total system behavior in terms of studying at variations of bus voltages, direction and value of active and reactive power flows as well as current and resistive losses according to different levels of wind power penetration in the system.","Wind Power; Probability; Power Flow Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Power Engineering","","Electical Power Systems","",""

(mentor); Van Heur, R.J.H.G. (mentor)","2011","The following MSc thesis describes a project done at Senta multisensory concepting, by a student from the Delft University of Technology. It was the student’s assignment to analyse which kind of problems occurs in the communication between Senta and its clients. This knowledge was then used to develop a design proposal for an instrument, with the potential to boost Senta’s business and serve as the core strategic instrument of Sense World: a centre of inspiration, where Senta wants to show the added value of multisensory integration in branding. Through analysing Senta’s activities, as a B2B company, and the needs and mind set of the clients, it came to front that there is a wide variety of clients, while Senta offers a wide range of activities. Since Senta is in a developing industry (Experience marketing), which is not seen as necessary for every client, it makes it more difficult for Senta to clearly explain the value of its activities. Out of the analysis a search area is created, Trust and Certainty, which could be the basis of Senta’s further business strategy and serve as a foundation of the instrument, to be designed. The focus in this search area was on the creation of an instrument that helps Senta to clarify their philosophy and corresponding offer to the client and that supports the creation of trust in order to shape the basis of a long-term B2B relationship. Subsequently interviews with the employees of Senta were conducted. A context mapping session on Trust in B2B gave deeper insight in the factors that influence the start of a trustworthy and long term B2B relationship. Then the design goal was formulted, based on the analysis and the researches. This was the basis for ideation and the creation of a concept. Two test runs with a paper prototype led to the design proposal: a facilitating instrument that supports the communication between Senta and its clients, which boosts Senta’s business by serving as an interactive, co-creative and supporting platform for all sales conversations and that has the potential to serve as a strategic key-building block inside Sense World. Finally the design proposal was tested by an operational prototype that included hardware, software and physical objects. These tests led to suggestions for further research and development.","B2B; communication; trust; co-creation; instrument; Senta","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-07-04","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2011","Many of the assets managed by TenneT TSO have been installed in the sixties and seventies of the previous century. Consequently, 50% of their assets will reach their designed lifetime within ten years. Due to financial and technical restrictions not all the asset can be replaced based on their age. Hence, TenneT TSO developed a Health index tool together with KEMA to translate measurements from inspection and maintenance to the health (technical condition) of an asset. In that way the maintenance and replacement planning can be adjusted for the health of all the assets. The outcome of the health index tool was a four-class scale. The asset could either be good, fair, moderate or poor. However, these four categories were not enough for the replacement planning and maintenance prioritization within the asset management department. The goal of this research is to determine the current technical state of an asset in more detail. Furthermore, the derived tool or model should be capable of determining the technical state of the asset after the planning period. In this research an asset performance estimation model has been derived. The model links inputs measured during inspection and maintenance to performance indicators. The model is based upon the failure modes of an asset and acknowledges various subpopulations of an asset with different failure rates and/or failure impacts. The more specific the subpopulations are, the more detailed the performance estimations become. A few possible performance indicator outputs of the model are failure rate, reliability and remaining lifetime. After the model was derived for assets in general, it has been implemented for circuit breakers.","asset; high voltage; failure rate; failure; reliability; remaining; lifetime; circuit breaker; breaker; FMEA; failure mode; Weibull; likelihood; health; failure risk; technical condition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-08-31","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Power Engineering","","High Voltage Technology & Management","",""

(mentor)","2011","Optimal design of support structure including foundation and turbine tower is among the most critical challenges for offshore wind turbine. With development of offshore wind industry heading for deeper ocean areas, new support structural concept such as a full lattice tower could be proven to be more advantageous than others when consideration of cost, safety and even environment aspects, etc are taken into. This thesis first gave introduction of present industrial applications of hybrid support structural concept combing a lattice foundation and monotower in relatively deep water areas before the presenting and introduction of challenges with the transition piece component. Conceptual model of transition piece design for a full lattice tower support structure proposal was discussed extensively which included consideration of structural form, functional requirement, mechanical condition, etc. A mechanical model of transition piece with regards to boundary condition and load conditions was also provided. Design and analysis of two different types of transition piece models under various load conditions were performed during preliminary design and with conclusion drawn, a refined final design of transition piece model for the full lattice tower support structural concept which has also included more practical aspects was assessed through investigation of its performance under varying load conditions and different load cases. This refined final design was found to be the most optimal design fulfilling all relevant requirements at a comparable structural cost. Conclusion and recommendation was therefore given in the last part. This thesis work is serving for a novel proposal of support structural concept for future offshore wind industry and relevant present experience is in fact nonexistent. The work applied present industrial information of hybrid support structure as basis along with consideration of offshore wind turbine structural and operational mechanism and their respective requirement. Structural analysis of transition piece design was conducted by means of finite element analysis technique and structural load conditions were simulated through up-to-date numerical modeling code for offshore wind turbine structure. Due to absence of relevant verification sources, advice and correction of the thesis content is much appreciated.","offshore wind turbine; wind turbine support structure; transition piece; lattice tower","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","section Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

Load management is expected to enable a higher grid capacity utilization, thereby deferring or eliminating the need for asset reinforcements and corresponding capital expenditures. However, estimation of the potential economic benefit is difficult, due to a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the electricity distribution grids. It is for instance uncertain what the future energy system will look like in terms of the penetration of new technologies and energy demand. Furthermore, it is unknown what the technical consequences of load management on the distribution grid assets are. A model was developed suitable for analysis of the economic consequences of smart grids on the medium voltage electricity distribution grids, in different environmental scenarios over the next three decades. The model takes capital expenditures as a result of grid reinforcement and costs of energy losses into account. Simulation shows that the economic benefit of smart grids with the goal of maximizing grid utilization is not guaranteed. Though smart grids induce significant capital expenditure savings resulting from peak shaving, they increase the costs of energy losses. The economic potential is highly dependent on the energy-transition scenario, more specifically on the degree of load flexibility of all consumers connected to the grid. The model can be improved in several areas, most notably by the technical implications of a ‘smart’ load profile on the distribution grid assets.","Smart grids; Electricity distribution grids; Economic benefit; Electricity grid planning; Load management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-06-29","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy & Indusry","","MSc Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis, and Management","",""

(mentor); Desmet, P.M.A. (mentor); Mason, J.D. (mentor); Aliakseyeu, D. (mentor)","2011","Emotionally durable design is a genre of sustainable design that aims at reducing consumption and waste by enhancing the durability of the relationship established between users and products. More durable relationships should lead to prolonged use of products. As a consequence, fewer products will be replaced which reduces environmental impact in all phases of the product life cycle, but the use phase. Several design strategies and theories have been published by researchers on emotionally durable design. Nevertheless, the topic is still underexposed in practice. Companies had no reasons to help customers to keep using their products for longer. This is likely to change due to the shift to a more service-centred economy that can be seen these days. Products are regularly being sold for low prices, and revenues are mainly being generated by the supported service. Prolonged use in these cases has a direct impact on the revenues of a company. Hence, it is interesting to start exploring emotionally durable design in practice. Based on literature, user studies and first design insights a new point of view on emotionally durable design was developed. This vision consists of five product qualities, namely involvement, adapt to self-identity, evoke memories, animacy and rewarding. The author endeavours this vision to be applicable and inspirational for designers. The second part of this report describes a first exploration through design of emotional durability. Based on the five product qualities ideas were generated for an emotionally durable kettle. This exploration in practice eventually led to products that show a behaviour when the user interacts with them. Therefore, it was explored how to design such behaviours for attachment. The result was a kettle with a sneaky behaviour. A fully functioning prototype was made of the sneaky kettle. The product qualities that were intended to be embedded in this product were involving and animacy. By means of a user study it was tested whether these qualities were actually part of the sneaky kettle. Both a regular kettle and the sneaky kettle were tested in a household for two periods of each twelve days. By comparing the experiences between the two kettles results were gathered. Unfortunately, the prototype only showed its behaviour for the first four days. That was not enough for the sneaky kettle to induce a sense of animacy. However, the sneaky was found to be more involving than the regular kettle. Products that show a behaviour when you interact with them are promising for increasing the emotional bond. However, it should be applied in a more subtle form. Moreover, the behaviour of the kettle should not only contribute to enhancing the emotional bond, but also improve the usability of the product. This will probably make it more likely for the behaviour to be accepted by the user.","Emotionally Durable Design; Design for Emotional Durability; Product Useful Life Extension; Research Through Design; Case Study; Design for Sustainability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-07-01","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Design for Sustainability","",""

Currently, few DHMs fit the specific requirements of industrial designers regarding a synthesis of the scope, affordability, validity, usability and compatibility. In this thesis, a prototype DHM is proposed with designer-oriented features. To identify the problems and needs of the designers, literature research, questionnaires, surveys and observational research were conducted to formulate the initial list of requirements for the proposed DHM. Besides conventional functionalities of DHMs, the list of requirements has an additional set of functions and requirements which are tailored towards the identified needs of the industrial designers. Based on SolidWorks®, a DHM prototype was developed and tested with a product evaluation experiment. The results and feedback led to an optimized model and a second product evaluation experiment was conducted on a larger scale within the bachelor course “Modeling” with 2nd year students. Results reveal that the prototype fills the basic needs of a DHM and has its unique designer-oriented features, especially in usability, affordability and compatibility. Limitations of the proposed DHM are also found regarding the robustness, the usability and the functionality. Those identified limitations contribute to the fine-tuning of the list of requirements for developing a more advanced designer-oriented DHM. A future outlook will include amongst other things: switching to another programming language, making the manipulating of limbs more intuitive, possibilities for custom data import and linking the project to 3D scanning.","Digital Human Model; anthropometry; requirements; industrial designer; usability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

Calendar42 is a web based smart, learning, mobile calendar service aimed at decreasing the cognitive load of the user. Decreasing cognitive load is important in today’s information overloaded society, but more so for a specific group of people: hearing impaired. In the Netherlands one in ten people have some degree of hearing loss. A lot of these hearing impaired people have difficulty in daily situations where they must miss out on information and communication. Hearing impaired people are supported by technology to assist them in their daily lives. They prefer mainstream technology because it does not have the stigma of disabled attached to it. New developments in smart information and communication systems are already greatly improving inclusion. The goal of this project is to design a new product, based on the smart technology of Calendar42 to improve the life of hearing impaired people. The target group focus was directed at hearing impaired students a group that has enormous under participation in regular higher education. Several studies were conducted with hearing impaired students and professionals to gain a frame of reference and find out what problems they face and solutions they desire. Most occurring problems include, interaction with peers, stress due to unadapted education and multitasking. Most occurring wishes include speech to text technology, better support during lectures, hidden “anti disability” tools and broader spread of sign language increasing awareness. Through interviews with experts it became evident that the philosophy of Design for All is desired. So the design of the product should not only be with hearing impaired students in mind but must also be beneficial for other students and possibly education institutions. With it the term situational deafness becomes relevant. Five great concepts were developed according to a main concept model which revolves around the technology platform of Calendar42. The concepts are: 1. Tactonic feedback for mobile phones, 2. Visual ambient information, 3. Matching through Calendar42, 4. A gesture campaign and 5. Crowd-sourced note taking. After evaluation with a set of criteria the best choice was found to be the concept of crowd-sourced note taking. This concept enables deaf and hard of hearing students to also have lecturenotes; something truly critical for every student. To quote a hearing impaired student: “Because of my impairment I am not capable to make notes fully independently, this is due to the fact I am constantly missing things. This concept is the ultimate solution for this problem because now I can make complete notes AND notice when I made the wrong interpretation.” Through a number of design cycles, literature research and testing the idea is elaborated into a final visualization. Behind the concept lie four working principles that are tested in an experimental study. The research model shows the four conditions tested: linear sequential entry individually and in a group and non linear entry individually and in a group. In this study a total of 34 students contributed, 25 of them answered a questionnaire which provided qualitative and quantitative data. The results show that the best mix of functions is a note taking tool which enables non linear editing and group/collaborative work. This concept was also evaluated with the target group who found it be useful and appealing. Based on the findings of the study and the evaluation a final design was made. This final product design is named “Ensemble”. This crowd sourced note taking web application features a spatial canvas, non-linear editing and a rich variety of formatting and input options.","Deaf; Hearing impaired; Inclusion; Notetaking; Crowdsourced","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-07-01","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

It is used for transporting immobile patients to the bathroom and supporting basic hygiene routines. A company that sells these medical devices is the Medsorg GmbH. Founded in 2003, it established itself stepwise as one-stop supplier for care institutions. The next step for the company is to start producing an own product line in Asia. In this context, the goal of this graduation project was the design of an ergonomic bath cart with improved comfort, reduced physical strain and efficient economy of time for the manual transfer procedure. The analysis of this graduation project consists of insights about prior research on workloads in the nursing profession, a market study, a product benchmark, legislations and requirements. Qualitative interviews of nursing personnel and residents investigate the context of use and the user-product interaction. The synthesis describes the process of the ideation, conceptualisation, embodiment and detailed design phase resulting in a product proposition of the final design. The developed concept called ‘Wee’ is a flexible ergonomic transfer chair, designed to support the hygiene routine of people with limited mobility. According to the credo: don’t lift but slide, it allows the user to slide the immobile resident comfortably from bed-to-chair in a lateral posture. Additionally, the ingenious folding mechanism of the chair supports the movement of the immobile person from a reclined to a sitting position and vice versa. No lifting makes the daily routine easier and more comfortable for both the care giver and the resident. The added value of the concept lies in less working steps, less physical strain, less awkward postures, less time consumption, resulting in less labour hours and much lower costs. The validation of the concept with a functional prototype showed that the conducted users are satisfied with the provided product proposal in terms of usability, functionality, efficiency and design. In conclusion, the participants stated that the concept would support the daily care routine and that they would make use of it.","bath cart; patient transfer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design (Medisign)","",""

The main cause of this being the tendency of polymers to deplete accumulated charge very slowly. Research into the dynamics of space charge trapping, injection and conduction in polymers can reveal important information from which new materials can be designed. Solutions can be found in polymers other than the well-known XLPE or introducing additives into XLPE based materials. This thesis investigates the space charge accumulation dynamics of mini cable models consisting of several different XLPE based insulation materials and PE based semiconductive layers. The main difference between the materials being the type and concentration of additives. The influence of the semiconductor-insulation interfaces on the space charge accumulation threshold is investigated with the help of polarization characteristics obtained from space charge measurements conducted with the PEA method for cable geometry objects. Furthermore the apparent trap-controlled mobility of the charge carriers and the depths of the charge traps in the materials are evaluated using depolarization characteristics which are also obtained with the same PEA method. Extra measurements on thin plaque samples of both the semiconductive layers and the insulation materials, such as conduction current measurements and frequency domain dielectric spectroscopy, are used to obtain more information on the space charge accumulation dynamics of the mini cable samples.","space charge; PEA; pulsed electroacoustic; trap controlled mobility; trap depth; mini cable; HVDC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-07-05","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","High Voltage Technology and Management","","","",""

(mentor); Jansen, M.H.P. (mentor); Labeur, R.J. (mentor); Van Prooijen, B.C. (mentor); Wang, Z.B. (mentor)","2011","In this thesis the position of tidal divides is studied by means of a simplified model and the Dutch Wadden Sea. To study the parameters influencing the location of the tidal divide, two basins are schematized to a rectangular channel with at each side an incoming tidal wave. These two incoming waves can differ in amplitude and have phase difference. The tidal divide is shifted towards the channel end with the largest wave amplitude or the end where the wave enters last. If the phase difference and/or wave amplitude ratio between the two incoming waves is too large, there is no tidal divide at all. It turned out that a distinction between two cases can be made: a linear case with very low wave amplitudes and flow velocities, in which the bottom friction is neglected; and a nonlinear case with higher wave amplitudes and velocities resulting in a dominant role of the bottom friction. The limit of the phase difference for the Wadden Sea means that the barrier islands should have a certain length and/or that the basin should be relatively shallow. In the linear case, the difference in amplitude between the two waves is most important in determining the location of the tidal divide. The contribution of the phase difference is minimal. When bottom friction becomes dominant, the phase difference is governing the position of the tidal divide and the influence of the amplitude ratio is very small. The depth of the channel is an important parameter, because it influences the importance of the bottom friction. In the Wadden Sea, both the phase difference and the difference in tidal range in the inlets is contributing to an eastward location of the tidal divides. In this thesis, a distinction is made between a hydraulic tidal divide and a morphological tidal divide. A hydraulic tidal divide is the line splitting the basins in terms of drainage and can be defined as the position where the standard deviation has a minimum. Engineers are looking for a clear line, because then the hydraulic tidal divide can be used as a basin boundary. In reality there is no line, which makes it difficult and arbitrarily to define a line. This has to be kept in mind when analyzing hydraulic tidal divides. In the Wadden Sea, the morphological tidal divide has the shape of a spine. The centre line of this spine does not necessarily coincide with the highest bed level. The morphological tidal divide is the footprint of the hydraulic tidal divide on the bed and indicates where the hydraulic tidal divide is or has been. The height of the morphological tidal divide can tell something about the equilibrium of the basins. The hydraulic and morphological tidal divide can move due to changing circumstances, like closure of a part of the basin. The hydraulic tidal divide can move instantaneously, but its shift is bounded by the morphological tidal divide. The morphological tidal divide first has to be lowered by increased flow velocities and then the hydraulic tidal divide can move more freely. The morphological tidal divide then heightens again at the new location of the hydraulic tidal divide. This behaviour is illustrated by the tidal divide between Marsdiep and Vlie and shows the importance of the initial bathymetry for the evolution of tidal divides. If the circumstances change more gradually, as happens in the eastern Wadden Sea, the morphological can keep up with the movement of the hydraulic tidal divide more easily.","tidal divides; tidal watersheds; wadden sea; tidal basins; phase difference; tidal range","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-07-05","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2011","Project background This master thesis is the result of a graduation project for the MSc programme in Strategic Product Design at the faculty of Industrial Design Engineering at the Delft University of Technology. It was executed for Unilever Benelux Out of Home. Unilever is founded in 1930, when Margarine Unie and Lever Brothers merged. Unilever is one of the world’s leading producer of food, home and personal care products. With the vision to create a better future every day, Unilever wants to help people feel good, look good and get more out of life with brands and services that are good for them and good for others. Unilever brands can be found all over the world, about 160 million times a day people in more than 170 countries choose a Unilever brand. Unilever Benelux is located in Rotterdam and Brussels, where Unilever is divided in an In Home and Out of Home structure. Unilever Benelux Out of Home (OOH) has four different distribution channels; Business and Institutions (Cup-a-Soup), On-the-Go (Bifi), Horeca & Leisure ice-cream (OLA and Ben&Jerry’s) and Horeca and Leisure ice-tea (Lipton). Every channel has its focus on a specific brand and has its own multidisciplinary channel team. The goal of this project is to develop a roadmap of new potential product-market combinations for Unilever Benelux OOH and to explore its potential, which is described in the following ambitious assignment: Formulate new product-market combinations for Unilever OOH in the Benelux market for the time span 2011-2016 to meet the growth objective of Unilever OOH. Research activities The Delft Innovation Model of Buijs and Valkenburg was used as guidance in this project; a five-stage innovation model that believes that developing new products and services is the response of a company to its changing competitive environment. The research as performed is divided into the following phases: 1.Internal analysis; the company’s internal resources capabilities and strategies, performed with a company documentation. 2.External analysis; executed by means of a trend analysis, indentifying potential search areas, exploring these search areas and an inspirational consumer journey. 3. As a side step in the process, the consumer buying impulse in the OOH channel was explored. First by a literature research, and further in the process by means of a contextmapping study. Based on the data analysis, a creative session with Unilever experts and IDE students was performed as a start of the idea generation process. Other input and with the help of the Ansoff matrix, the idea generation was expanded. Based on the ideas and an internal stakeholder meeting, five ideas were chosen. Criteria gained from the data research and consumer research led to the selection of most potential concepts for market and roadmap development. Results The concepts were evaluated in consumer research and the results are visualized in a final roadmap that consists of five potential concepts for Unilever Benelux OOH.","Unilever; OOH; Roadmap; Foodservice","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-07-01","Industrial Design Engineering","PIM","","SPD","",""

In order to fulfill this purpose, an airfoil optimization framework is established by resorting to the concepts of genetic and multi-objective optimization and adopting the Class-Shape-Transform parametrization method in a modern, original formulation amenable to shape constraints. The limits of existing models for the simulation of boundary layer suction in R/Xfoil are discussed and the necessity for enhancements to correctly simulate the effect of suction on turbulent boundary layers is made clear. New models are imple­mented, building on previous theoretical efforts to quantify the increase of skin fric­tion due to the existence of a normal convective velocity in the boundary layer. Novel theoretical efforts were conducted to model the effect of suction on entrainment and dissipation, leading to a modified shear-lag equation applied in R/Xfoil and applicable to dissipation based integral boundary layer methods in general.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics and Wind Energy","","","",""

(mentor); Berghauser Pont, M. (mentor)","2011","The accelerated growth that Caracas experienced during the twentieth century resulted in a superimposition of different urban patterns not always in proper dialogue between each other. The irregular political structure was supported by an increasingly powerful new economy which generated growth promoted by two opposite extremes. From above, the city was promoted by the public and private sector under the influence of ideological models claiming to have a sole and absolute response to the rapid urban development of the twentieth century. Real estate developments adopted the suburban “garden city” model for the elites, while state policies gave a touch of post-war modernity to this model, on the grounds of “social utopia”. The set of one-way urban policies instigated alternative responses by those who were excluded from the system, giving a final shape to urban needs in a spontaneous model of growth (also called informal) promoted from the bottom. This parallel growth never reached an effective dialogue and growth models became patterns of exclusion. As a result, the contemporary profile of Caracas lies on a fragmented urban structure, physically inaccessible, setting a segregated social configuration. This work proposes a strategy that promotes urban renewal from both directions. The “top-down” strategy seeks to respond to population growth through a proposal for densification of the existing city. In contrast to the model of territorial expansion of “Socialist Cities” promoted by the state, the strategy aims to increase urban density on top of the existing low densities caused by the suburban model, taking advantage of the existing transport infrastructure. In parallel, the “bottom-up” strategy pays attention to the specific location, giving importance to topics such as place identity, place diversity and place governance. The starting point is the “project of one street” with immediate impact on the local scale. However, the project responds to conditions that are common in different parts of the city giving rise to similar strategies that can be repeated to generate a combined impact with metropolitan relevance.","Caracas; accesibility; permeability; urban growth","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Urbanism","","European Postgraduate Masters in Urbanism","",""

(mentor); Walstra, D.J.R. (mentor)","2011","With the use of the process-based geological model Delft3D a base case model is set up to simulate the Brent delta using Gullfaks field conditions as appeared during the Aalenian and Bajocian periods in the Mid-Jurassic. The aim is to visualize and comprehend the morphology and stratigraphy of the base case upon changing both wave conditions and discharge conditions. Wave height and peak period are varied during a first scenario, where discharge and sediment concentration of the river are altered during a second scenario. Nine hydrodynamic and geologically realistic model set-ups were simulated. They represent an outbuilding wave dominated deltaic environment in three dimensions. Within these nine models either the wave height and wave peak period (wave models) or the fluvial discharge and sediment concentration (discharge models) were varied. The wave models with the largest energy, i.e. largest wave height and peak period, show the most assymetrical delta built out towards the wind direction. Sediment is fed to the delta front by distributary channels and further redistributed by longshore currents. Typical wave-dominated lobate structures and an elongated delta built-out are the morphological result. In the low wave energy models the distributaries are concentrated in two channels distributing sediment laterally towards the sides, whereas a more variable distributary channel pattern is encountered in the larger wave energy models. The discharge models feeding the largest amount of sand and clay into the basin show smallest wave influence and most stable formation of the delta front and intertidal-, and supratidal zones. A two way distributary channel system develops from the main fluvial river transporting sediment equally to the deltas sides. Morphologically the delta becomes more river dominated, building out symmetrically and the sedimentation from distributary channels being dominant over wave erosion. The discharge models, having a constant wave climate, show a typical erosional (wave) base with stability or progradation of the delta front and prodelta occurring below this erosional base and erosion of the intertidal-, and supratidal zone above the erosional base. All models typically have an initial mouth bar formation which very rapidly builds out to a sandy stable delta front. Fining upward sequences are the general appearance in abandoned channel fills with relatively more clay content in the lower wave energy models and lower sediment discharge models. Clay is also more abundant in the sediment stack laterally away from the centre delta where sediments are younger. The heterolithic upper part of the channel fill was found to be most susceptible for reworking by waves and (cutting) distributary channels. The cleanest sand stacks were found in the centre delta, in the intertidal zone and delta front. These sand stacks are largest in the larger wave energy models and higher discharge models. The facies description being dependent on three hydrodynamic parameters has partly succeeded. Incorporation of more hydrodynamic or geological parameters could potentially increase the accuracy of facies description.","modelling; Brent; process-based; Norway; Delft3D","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-09-02","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Applied Earth Sciences","","Applied Geology","",""

(mentor)","2011","In today’s cutting costs environment in the offshore wind industry, significant achievements can be made with a better assessment of dynamic soil-pile interaction. More knowledge regarding the contribution of the dynamic soil-pile interaction to damping of an offshore wind turbine structure (OWT) could perceptibly reduce the fabrication costs of an OWT. Currently, not much is known about the contribution of soil to the total damping of the vibration of an OWT which consists of five main damping mechanisms: aerodynamic-, hydrodynamic-, structural-, soil- and a passive sloshing damper in the nacelle. The values for this contribution applied in the industry today - mostly calculated analogously to a study performed in 1980 by M.F. Cook - can be expected to be on the low side (conservative), and it is acknowledged that it might be higher. More research on the topic is recommended. Increased damping of the vibrations of an OWT decreases the occurring stresses in the structure which in turn results in lower (often design driving) fatigue damage accumulation. Presence of more damping than currently assumed would justify either designing more light-weight structures using less construction steel, or allowing for longer (insured) OWT lifetimes than the currently applied 20 years. Both measures significantly reduce costs of offshore generated wind power. This research evaluates measured signals of twelve ’rotor stop’ - tests on an offshore wind turbine at the Dong Energy owned - Burbo Bank wind farm in the Irish Sea. The recorded data comprises the vibration decay of the structure, measured with an accelerometer and strain gauges along the tower. An analytical model has been developed enabling analyses of the origin of the measured signals. Two main frequencies were identified in the measurements and, using the different measurement locations and the model, the corresponding modal shapes were identified. A crucial distinction between the two modal shapes is the difference in motion of the lower part of the structure. The amplitudes of displacement and velocity at this location are much smaller for the second observed modal shape than for the first. A large difference in damping ratio between the two frequencies was identified. The difference in damping is attributed to the different effect the soil can have on the damping of these two frequencies. This can be explained by the varying amplitudes of their modes in the soil embedded part of the structure. The measured total damping (19 % logarithmic decrement which is 3 % ratio of critical) for the first natural bending frequency of the tower, and the possible order of magnitude of the found contribution of soil on this damping (~ 9.5 % log. decr. or 1.5 % ratio) of this particular OWT is significantly larger than the order of magnitude used in the industry today (respectively ~ 2.5 % log. decr. and ~0.44 %).","offshore wind support structures; monopile; damping; rotor stop","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Offshore Engineering/Offshore Wind","",""

(mentor); Boersema, T. (mentor)","2011","As part of my graduation project of the Master Design For Interaction at the TU Delft I accepted a design assignment for the Workplace automation (WPA) division at Priva in De Lier. WPA concerns the registration and management of all labour and production data in greenhouses. Priva recently started a project to refresh their software offerings for registering labour in horticulture and needed an interface design for a new feature in their software. Goal The new functionality that needed to be designed concerned the validation and correction of horticulture labour data. Each day hundreds and sometimes thousands of labour registrations are made with the current software. Greenhouse employees register data each time a certain activity is performed. The location, person, time, activity and objects involved are all registered. This data combined can show the manager what happened each day, where he should improve his process and what he can expect in the future. However, users make errors all the time, which is where validation and correction comes in. This process step is not defined very well in the current software. The goal of this project was to design a validation environment, which allows for fast and intuitive validation and correction of labour data. Approach The approach for this project was to use an iterative design method combined with multiple user tests to grow towards a solution. The analysis of the project focused on creating empathy with the user and his context through the means of storyboards and user profiles. This stands in contrast to lists of requirements and use-cases, which is what a more technical oriented approach would deem necessary. Design For the design of the interface a few key assumptions were made which were inspired by the user needs. First off al the interface should be informative and predictable. This is solved by splitting the screen in 2, a list of results on the left and the same data on a map on the right. The application should also be helpful by directly communicating any found errors to the user. The user should be able to recognize his context (left) in the application (right). Data should be very direct and organic. Users will get questions when they see strange records so it should be possible to make little side quests to investigate. Usability test results The results from the two user test with eight end users participating prove that users respond very well to the implementation of the design assumptions. People find the layout very clear and compact, while at the same time it gives them more information then the current software. It is expected that new users and people with internet experience will have less problems adjusting to the new interface then people who work very little with computers. Recommendations A number of improvements can be made in future design cycles to improve upon this interface proposal. For example, supporting sectors and adding more visual details can improve the map. The final stage of error recognition is most likely the ability of the user to define his own error rules. Notes assist should also be added to the current design, but is easy to implement using the current design patterns. Of the overall recommendations I want to stress the importance of the performance of the application. Within Priva the term ‘Speed and Easy’ is often coined, which is exactly what is required for this specific software solution. Validation requires a lot of small interactions, which can become very annoying to the user if he can’t find what he is looking for and has to wait between each click.","interaction; interface; horticulture; visualization; usability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design For Interaction","",""
