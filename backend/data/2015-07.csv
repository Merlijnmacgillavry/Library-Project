This project is a part of a three-group bachelor graduation project of six peoplein total. The three groups combined create a working game for visually impaired children, meant to be used to train the user’s ears and brain to visualize their surroundings using sound only. Using the mirror source method, a model for sound reflections in concave 3D rooms is obtained. Important parts of this model are the placement of the mirror sources, the calculation of a line of sight and a model for the energy absorption of a wall when sound is reflected off of it. The placement of mirror sources and a model for the wall absorption were successfully implemented. The calculation of a line of sight is only half finished.The implementation of the model in the game adds a sense of the location and the materials of the walls.The execution time of the model is however too low to run the model completely in real time.","sound; audio; reflections; visually impaired","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2015","This Bachelor Thesis is part of the Bachelor Computer Science and Engineering program at Delft University of Technology. During this project the team had to create an extension to an existing game framework. This extension consisted of improved artificial intelligence for the antagonist and a maze generator that could be re-used as a library. The original framework consisted of a game that was implemented in Unity. The game featured a bug that had to traverse several mazes that were interconnected by portals. These portals would allow it to travel between mazes. The mazes also featured an antagonist that will pursue the player and attempt to kill it. The intention of the game is to be challenging and difficult, and allow the framework to easily modify the difficulty settings. The game has an atmosphere that resembles a horror game and should be scary to a certain extent. The implementation of the artificial intelligence was done with Rain AI, a freely distributed library that is used in combination with Unity. This library allows for the creation and modification of the behaviour of the antagonist through use of a behaviour tree. This behaviour tree allows the antagonist to react differently depending on its state. The implementation of the maze generator was created separately from the main framework. This allows for it to be easily taken out as a whole, thus effectively acting as a library. It depends on various parameters to generate maze data, which the framework can provide. The framework can also specify a specific difficulty, making the maze generator use default parameters for that difficulty. The maze data is converted to actual Unity 3D objects in the framework. In order to provide the parameters for the antagonist AI and the maze generator, a player-observer was made. This observer tracks the decisions made by the player and utilises this to generate statistics regarding the player. These are then converted to parameters that are used by the antagonist and the maze generator. This conversion depends on the difficulty settings set for the player. In addition there have been improvements to the graphical design and gameplay. The gameplay now features more items that can be used by the player as well as improved graphics and the usage of sound.","Gaming; Machine Learning; PortalBug; Personalised; Divireo","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","Bachelor Eind Project","",""

(mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor); Kuiper, C. (mentor)","2015","The protection of breakwater structures is in this research considered. The design of rubble mound concrete armour layers for breakwaters can be divided in a single layer system and a double layer system. The single layer system is nowadays mostly applied because of the high interlocking, high stability of the structure, reduction of concrete use and a decrease of the construction period. There are several types of artificial units which can be placed in a single layer armour. At this moment the development of the new breakwater armour unit Crablock is going on. Small scale physical flume tests have been performed with focus on hydraulic stability. The influence of wave attack on the interlocking properties was determined by conducting some pull tests after wave exposure and in dry conditions. The performance of the Crablock armour layer is based on damage patterns for corresponding wave heights. Damage criteria are defined for displacement of units, individual movement and rocking. The results show that the placement pattern did not influence the hydraulic stability. For long waves, damage was observed in an earlier stage than short waves so there is a certain influence from the wave steepness. The higher crest level showed less displacements but larger settlements than the normal crest level. The lowest point where displacements were observed was for all tests applied with 0.66/Dn2 and 0.69/Dn2 around stability number 4.6. The design value of the stability number was in this stage assumed as 2.8, comparable to other units. This leads to a large safety factor of 1.6. The pull tests consisted of unit extractions from three different levels on the slope. The interlocking degree is defined as the ratio between the force needed to extract a single unit and the own weight. For the locations around and below SWL, the ratio between the interlocking degrees with and without wave exposure is in the order of 2 to 3. So for that locations the settlement caused a considerable higher interlocking degree. For the highest extraction above SWL, the difference is negligible. It seemed that the interlocking degree was dependent on packing density but also on the extraction level on the slope. An increase in packing density led to a higher interlocking degree. This increase was higher at the location below SWL because the additional weight of the units above became important.","Crablock; breakwater; single layer armour; stability number; interlocking degree; physical scale model; unit movement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

Research was done on PPG signals corrupted by motion with the help of an accelerometer. The fast Fourier transform of the signals showed that there is a relation between the frequency components of the PPG signal and motion signals.

(mentor)","2015","As a result of the increasing mass of rotor blades for large wind turbines, trailing edge buckling is recognized to become one of the critical design drivers. This research project was initiated to investigate a new trailing edge design concept, which is supposed to have a higher buckling capacity, while maintaining its structural performance, and without increasing the total mass. An investigation of a typical blade section from a reference blade revealed the most important parameters that drive the structural design of a blade section. These parameters were applied in analytical models to determine a range of blade sections according to the new technology with the same structural performance. Then linear eigenvalue buckling analysis is applied on finite element models (FEM) to identify the buckling capacity for a selected range of blade sections. Two prototype designs following the new technology are finally presented, one primarily using carbon fibre laminates in the new trailing edge, the other mostly using glass fibre laminates. These prototype designs both show a significant improvement in buckling capacity, and will no longer show trailing edge buckling under the extreme edgewise moments defined for the reference blade. A significant mass reduction is also obtained for both prototype blade sections: a reduction of 8% for the glass fibre concept and even 13.5% for the carbon fibre concept. Significant research is still required for further development of this trailing edge technology, but the current research already provides valuable information on the phenomenon of trailing edge buckling and presents an effective method to design against this buckling mode.","trailing edge; buckling; wind energy; rotor blades; wind turbine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-01-31","Aerospace Engineering","Wind Energy / Aerospace Structures & Materials","","","",""

(mentor)","2015","Delineating the well placement and trajectory of production or injection wells is an important step of any field development program. Drilling a well is an expensive process in terms of money, time and effort invested. Being an expensive item, wells must be carefully studied before being drilled. In order to make this process more efficient, this dissertation presents a computer-assisted approach of determining the optimal well trajectory using adjoint-based optimization technique. The algorithm is based on surrounding the injection or production wells with dummy wells; a technique proposed in earlier studies. These dummy wells have a minimal rate of injection or production so as to minimalize their influence on the simulated output. The sum of the gradients of the objective function with respect to the flowrate in each dummy well over the life-time of the reservoir is used to define an improved well trajectory. The whole process is repeated until the maximum net present value is achieved. In order to ensure that the newly optimized well trajectory is drillable, the algorithm restricts the curvature of the trajectory. The optimization algorithm was applied to synthetically generated homogeneous and heterogeneous reservoirs to improve a single well trajectory. The algorithm was also successfully tested to improve multiple well trajectories in the ‘Egg Model’, a three-dimensional heterogeneous channelized reservoir model. In addition to well trajectory optimization, the dissertation also presents an approach to optimize well numbers. This algorithm is based on drilling a dense quasi-well configuration to get an initial knowledge of the reservoir and utilizing this knowledge along with ‘dummy well’ gradients to reduce the well count. Depending on the reservoir, fluid and economic parameters, both the algorithms display the adeptness to predict optimized type, trajectory and number of wells. Although the optimization results showed a considerable improvement in the net present value of the project, the algorithm can get stuck in local optimum.","optimization; algorithm; gradient-based; well trajectory; well number","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Section for Petroleum Engineering","",""

(mentor); Jonkers, H.M. (mentor); Vardon, P.J. (mentor); Van Paassen, L.A. (mentor)","2015","CoRncrete is a corn starch based bio-material formed by mixing corn starch with water and sand, and heating the mix in a microwave or oven. This heating process results in the formation of a hardened material. A constant corn starch to sand proportion of 1:5 has been adopted in this study. The transformation of CoRncrete from a semi-solid to a hardened material is caused by modification of corn starch that occur through a ‘gelatinization’ process. Heating of corn starch in the presence of water results in the formation of a gel that binds with sand grains and hardens. The temperature at which gel formation or gelatinization in CoRncrete occurs, was studied by DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimetry). To understand the microstructure of CoRncrete, ESEM (Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope) tests were carried out. ESEM scans revealed the effect of water content, heating source and heating duration on the gelatinization process that affects the development of microstructure of CoRncrete. The physical properties of CoRncrete was studied by analysing consistency behaviour of fresh CoRncrete and compressive strength of hardened CoRncrete. It was found that the corn starch in fresh CoRncrete changes its phase from solid to plastic/liquid at a specific water content. This water content was determined by cone penetrometer and proctor tests. This change in phase of corn starch was observed at an optimum water content. At optimum water content, the maximum dry density of fresh CoRncrete and maximum density and strength of hardened CoRncrete is also achieved. The fresh CoRncrete was heated to form hardened CoRncrete with the compressive strength found to be comparable to that of red clay bricks. The factors influencing the strength of hardened CoRncrete such as water content, size of the sand particle and heating duration (in a microwave) has been studied and discussed. A strong positive correlation between density and strength of hardened CoRncrete has been observed. Degradation of CoRncrete was studied by immersing specimens in water. Specimens were degraded partially to fully within a day, raising durability issues. The sustainability of CoRncrete was studied by carrying out LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) and compared with LCA results of Portland cement concrete and fired clay brick. The analysis indicated that the CoRncrete has comparatively higher environmental impact. Finally, the limiting factors in application of a CoRncrete and their remedial measures have been discussed. This research work addresses CoRncrete as a potential precursor to a new class of construction materials which gain strength rapidly by heating at relatively low temperature (~100oC).","corn starch; construction material; gelatinization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-engineering, Materials and Environment","",""

(mentor)","2015","Ball-balancing robots, or Ballbots, are under-actuated omni-directional mobile robots that balance on top of a single ball. The under-actuated nature arises from the fact that both position and attitude of the robot are actuated by the same actuators. This thesis introduces a geometric approach to the control of ball-balancing robots. In this approach, a new full 3D model is derived using screw theory. Based on this model, a geometric observer and geometric controller are proposed. Two methodologies are implemented, a computed torque controller and a sliding mode controller, that can track the attitude of the robot on either the special orthogonal group SO(3) or the 2-sphere S^2. Position control is achieved through the use of the relation between the desired linear acceleration and the attitude of the robot. The resulting desired attitude is tracked by one of the geometric attitude controllers. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed controllers. The proposed sliding mode controller is shown to be more robust to model uncertainties. The position controller is shown to be able to control the position and follow trajectories, but overall global stability is not guaranteed. Recommendations are made to improve the performance. For the geometric observer, stability is shown under a set of assumptions. The work is concluded with a set of experiments on a real platform.","balancing robot; geometric control; under-actuated; sliding mode control; ball-balancing robot","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-10-13","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center of Systems and Control","","Systems and Control","",""

While methods have been developed for trapping both diagnostic and therapeutic amounts of radionuclides in these polymersomes, there is not much known about the loading process and the state of the radionuclide in the polymersomes. At this point perturbed angular correlation (PAC) spectroscopy becomes essential, as it is a useful method for gaining information about the chemical surroundings and physical structures of different gamma-emitting radioisotopes. PAC is a gamma ray spectroscopy technique which can be used for the investigation of hyperfine interactions. A hyperfine interaction is the interaction between a nucleus and its environment. Hyperfine interactions arise in the intermediate state of a decaying radionuclide. This decay is then perturbed with a time-dependent factor and can be measured from the angular correlation function. The angular correlation function is expressed as the number of coincidences per unit time as function of angle. The number of coincidences is measured using the PAC spectroscopy. The polymersomes are composed of poly(butadiene-b-ethylene oxide) block copolymers, and the labelling has been achieved by transportation of the radionuclide, complexed to a lipophilic ligand, through the hydrophobic bilayer into the aqueous cavity containing 0.5 M of KH2PO4. A sufficient amount of the radionuclides was encapsulated in the polymersomes (>90 % loading efficiency). Subsequent to the loading, the sample was immersed in liquid nitrogen, after it was counted on the PAC setup for 6 hours at 90 and 180 angles. To confirm a working PAC setup, measurements on directional correlation and a simple perturbed system are performed. Excellent agreement with literature has been observed for cobalt-60 directional correlation measurements (G22 of 0.1016 vs 0.1020 in [18]). The hafnium metal measurements, which only undergo a static interaction, are compared with literature [39]. The results give an indication of a reliable PAC setup. Final measurements are performed with indium-111. The results obtained for the loaded radionuclides in polymersomes indicate that differences could be distinguished. The results indicate that the radionuclides will move from the bilayer towards the core of the polymersome. There was no clear bonding observed between the chelator and the radionuclides. The used side of the polymersomes (100 nm, 800 nm) are expected not to influence the measurement.","perturbed angular correlation; polymersome","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-09-03","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","Medical Physics, RIH, RID","",""

(mentor); Kleinherenbrink, M. (mentor)","2015","In the processing of data acquired by conventional radar altimeters, algorithms designed to compute elevation of signal backscatterers assume that the point closest to the satellite antenna is the nadir point. While this is a valid assumption over the oceans, it is often not valid in non-oceanic surfaces. Radar altimetry data acquired over ice sheets, for instance, are dominated by multiple scatterers off-nadir to the satellite, which implies that more than one scattering surfaces in the radar footprint contribute to the received signal. A SAR/Interferometric Radar Altimeter, which is the primary payload of CryoSat, allows the geolocation of an off-nadir scatterer by recording the receiving signal in two distinct receiving antennae separated by a baseline of 1.2 m. In recent studies on ice sheet elevation changes based on CryoSat data, however, only one scatterer is ‘tracked’. Hence, the full potential of the backscattered signal is not exploited. In this study, we design an algorithm that enables elevation estimation and geolocation of multiple off-nadir scatterers within the radar footprint from CryoSat Level 1b waveforms. With the results obtained by our CryoSat level 2 data processor, we obtain elevation change measurements over a part of the Jakobshavn Isbræ (or the Jakobshavn drainage basin) at West-Greenland. Our algorithm provides about twice as much retracked elevations compared to the number of elevations from the CryoSat ESA level 2 products, and hence a better spatial sampling of the elevation change signal.","radar altimetry; ice sheets; CryoSat; retracking; elevation changes; climate change","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Remote Sensing","","Physical and Space Geodesy","",""

(mentor); Westerweel, J. (mentor); Pourquie, M.J.B.M. (mentor); Kalkman, J. (mentor)","2015","An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an excessive localized swelling of the abdominal aortic wall. AAAs are often lethal when they rupture and constitute a significant health risk in the developed countries. CFD simulations can help predict formation, progression, and rupture of AAAs by the use of hemodynamic parameters such as the Oscillatory Shear Index (OSI) that indicates the oscillatory behavior of the wall shear stress vector at the aneurysm wall. Ideally, it is envisioned that the risk of rupture of a particular aneurysm can be estimated by patient-specific parameters that are collected from a patient with minimal effort and to classify the aneurysm into different categories that do or do not pose a considerable risk of rupture. The main objective of this thesis then aims to focus on the underlying flow mechanisms in aneurysm flow and tries to take the first steps towards an abstract aneurysm model by means of a proof of principle regarding the prediction of formation, progression, and rupture locations within an aneurysm, based on simple patient-specific input parameters. To this end, CFD simulations of pulsatile blood flow in an abstract abdominal aortic aneurysm (4A) model are performed for the independent ranges of mean Reynolds number 300?Re m ?1200, Womersley number 15.1 ? ? ? 27.7, aneurysm length ratio 2.6 ? Le ? 5.3, and aneurysm diameter ratio 1.81 ? Di ? 2.55. The effect of the variation of the input parameters on the oscillatory shear index (OSI) is regarded and quantified by the 4A surface-averaged OSI. General trends show that the average OSI decreases 15 percent over the mean Reynolds number range of 300 ? Re ? 1200, increases 16 percent over the Womersley number range of 15.1 ?

Di ? 2.55, indicating that the mean Reynolds number and the Womersley number have the largest influence on the average OSI for the 4A. The fluctuating wall shear stress vector at the stagnation points of the vortices present in the aneurysm is pointed out as the origin of the high OSI valued axisymmetric rings found on the surface of the 4A. Additionally, there exists an inverse relation between the surface-averaged OSI and the turbulent to periodic kinetic energy ratio, demonstrating the importance of the periodic components. Pulsatile blood flow simulation is also performed on a patient-specific aneurysm geometry and compared with the 4A case with Le = 4.6. The dissimilar flow and OSI results imply that the input parameters alone do not permit to make statements about the OSI values in the patient-specific aneurysm based on the 4A.","CFD; abdominal aortic aneurysm; oscillatory shear index; pulsatile flow; womerlsey number","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","Fluid Mechanics","",""

A barrier for the market adaptation of electric vehicles is the availability of a charging infrastructure. In the Netherlands municipalities are responsible for the facilitation of charging places in public space. This thesis identifies strategies municipalities could take to facilitate and/or stimulate a charging infrastructure, using expectations about three different uncertainties: the future demand for a charging infrastructure, technological progress in charging infrastructure and the preferences of municipalities. A literature study identified fast charging and inductive charging as promising technologies. An analytical model based on an energy balance enabled predictions for the expected demand for charging places in 2020 and 2025, using multiple scenarios. A survey among municipalities identified their preferences towards facilitation and stimulation strategy alternatives. Municipalities are advised to cooperate on a regional level in for example a concession model. The future demand for a charging infrastructure differs between different types of neighbourhoods. A different facilitating role is needed from the municipality in these different types of neighbourhoods. In commercial and working neighbourhoods licenses to commercial companies could be enough. In high- and low-income residential neighbourhoods a more active facilitating role is needed. Rapid developments in charging capabilities and methods require a limited scope and active monitoring of developments. Changes imposed by mainly European policymakers require a similar monitoring. A framework to deal with these uncertainties is developed as part of this thesis.","electric vehicle; charging infrastructure; policies; neighbourhoods; municipalities; uncertainty; technological progress","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Economics of Technology and Innovation","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor)","2015","Lithium silicon (Li-Si) batteries offer more than ten times the theoretical specific capacity compared to current lithium ion battery technologies, by using a silicon anode. In practice however, the cycle life of Li-Si batteries is very limited. The large volume change of the silicon anode is known to be the main reason for this. Research on the volume changes during varying cell cycles and voltages is presented in this thesis and an experimental set up for a quasi in situ study of the SEI layer is suggested. Cycling tests with an amorphous silicon thin film of 220 nm deposited using magnetron sputtering on a copper foil current collector confirmed that the major cause of capacity loss is swelling of the silicon during lithiation, causing the silicon to detach from the current collector and resulting in significant capacity loss. Increasing the lower cut off voltage from 0 V to 0.2 V resulted in a slight improvement of cycle life. Silicon detachment also decreased as determined by SEM images. EFTEM and EDX mapping showed a clear split between a partially lithiated silicon layer on the surface and a pure silicon layer on the current collector side. It can be concluded that discharging Li-Si batteries to 0.2 V instead of 0 V is a promising method to reduce the swelling of silicon during lithiation.","batteries; energy storage; glovebox; microscopy; EDX; EELS; galvanostat","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Quantum Nanoscience","","HREM","",""

(mentor); Buijs, J.A. (mentor)","2015","Volans Rowing wants an entry-level rowing boat for beginners that could complete the company portfolio. Thus, FISA and Volans are set as the main stakeholders and established the goal of design a multipurpose rowing boat, , for all type of users, men and women, from 14 years old till adults, which a retail price of  1000. The project starts with a research about rowing field, naval architecture, in order to get a knowledge background. Later, a market research about entry level boats and recreational rowing products is performed. In parallel, manufacturing processes and materials used in similar products like kayaks are studied looking for cheaper alternatives to build the boat. It was concluded that rotomolded polyethylene is the best option to build the boat hull, mainly because of its low cost and its properties, that fit with the beginners learning curve. In the case of the sliding rigger, aluminum and stainless steel are considered as the most suitable materials. To sum up, a list of requirements is elaborated with all the key points to consider in the design. Several concepts for the boat hull and sliding rigger are proposed. The concepts are evaluated by comparing their performance according with the FISA expectations. The hull concept looks for a great stability and maneuverability that could support the inexperienced rower during the learning as well as leverage their confidence to take risks in the learning curve. The rigger chosen aims for a reduction of parts to make it cheaper to produce by using aluminum plates folded as well as the use of standard components that can be easy to repair or replace. The hull is modeled using Rhinoceros, the required cockpit dimensions are used as starting point to design the whole boat. On the other hand, the sliding rigger assembly is modeled using SolidWorks. The dimensions of the whole system are influenced for the cockpit size and the optimal rower position. The designs created are evaluated to check the requirements fulfillment. In the case of the hull, it is compared with the current boats at the Volans portfolio in terms of hydrostatic performance using MaxSurf. The results shows the Volans FISA hull is stable and maneuverable than other Volans boats, having a lower but decent speed and sacrificing course stability to increase the turning abilities. The hull has a multi-section shell composed by different sections to obtain stability and maneuverability that goes from a V sharp at the bow to a flat section at the stern. Besides of that, an integrated skeg is included to provide initial stability. The deck has reminiscences from previous Volans designs and rounded shapes to facilitate rotomolding. In the case of the sliding rigger, static simulations are run in Solidworks submitting the design proposed to the peak stresses exerted during rowing. Theoretically, the structure of folded aluminum designed can withstand the loads applied. However, it is recommended to go deeper in its design and put more engineering research on it, taking this proposal as a starting point. Moreover, a cost estimation is performed. Standard components and raw material suppliers, cost simulation software for parts manufacturing, machining and labor costs are consulted. The results obtained in the estimation are positive, reserving an adequate benefit margin. The rowing boat components evaluation is done at a theoretical level. Nonetheless, more simulations and real life testing will locate areas of improvement for further steps. Specially the rigger, which due to its complexity, it will need more engineering to refine it. Finally, another suggestions for further research are the comparison with competitors entry-level boats and the elaboration of a business plan for the introduction of this new product in market.","product design; sports; rowing; rotomolding; hull; sliding rigger","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Cankurtaran, P. (mentor); Zijtveld, P.H. (mentor)","2015","Moyee Coffee is a company that buys coffee berries in Ethiopia and sells coffee in the Netherlands. Currently they outsource the roasting (grinding) and packaging processes in between. The company aims at doing the roasting (grinding) and packaging in their own facilities in Ethiopia in the future. Thereby they pursue balance in the coffee industry. The first step Moyee Coffee is taking is investing in roasting and packaging equipment in the country of origin of the berries. With this equipment, the local population can process the beans. This results in an increase in value of the export of the coffee, which reduces the need for development aid. Moyee Coffee calls this FairChain. Moyee Coffee currently sells its products mainly via online sales channels. The only offline retail channel they use is Marqt. In the future Moyee Coffee wants to expand its sales channels with for example Albert Heijn. The current package is not suitable for the highly differentiated shelves in those retail shops and should therefore be changed. Another reason for a new package is that the package should be filled and closed in Ethiopia. This is not possible with the current package. The internal analysis shows Moyee Coffee is currently behaving in the first stage of the company life cycle. The brand is still investing in equipment in Ethiopia and is trying to gain brand recognition. They are also still exploring the right products and channels. The organization is not very structured yet and so are the projects that are performed. The external analysis shows that Moyee’s biggest competitors are Douwe Egberts, Illy and Lavazza (for the beans and ground coffee) and Nespresso (for the cups). Like-minded brands are not seen as competitors of Moyee as Moyee is a social enterprise that wants to share and collaborate to reach its goal. The raising awareness of sustainability, personalization and the increasing online sales volume are important trends that should have attention in the design of the new coffee package. After performing a SWOT analysis the following design goal is formulated: ‘For Moyee Coffee I will design a unique and simple coffee package that represents the brand Moyee Coffee and its benefits, that is sustainable, that creates a revolutionary coffee experience and that is optimized regarding production, distribution, stacking shelves and protection of the coffee aromas.’ The four design directions that are represented in this design goal are brand image, sustainability, coffee experience and efficiency. In the literature research, attention is paid to several new, sustainable, packaging materials. These materials are often bio based and/or biodegradable, or have a substitute layer for the aluminum. Not all these more sustainable materials are currently ready for production, some are still in development. Tests about e.g. performance and food contact have to be performed. The performance of a material is one aspect of the protection function of a package. Besides that, the package should be efficient in transport and should attract the attention of the consumers. Another important aspect is to inform the consumer about the brand and what is in the package (the ingredients etcetera). Ideas are generated during two creative sessions; one with five fellow students (e.g. industrial design and architecture) and one with employees of Moyee Coffee (e.g. logistics). Furthermore inspiration is found on the Empack packaging exhibition in ‘s-Hertogenbosch and the BIO!PAC Conference in Amsterdam. These ideas are categorized in the four design directions: brand image, sustainability, coffee experience and efficiency. With these ideas three different packages were designed. The 50/50 package in which the two flavors emphasize the aim at a balanced coffee industry. This package for beans is made of bio based materials via 2 shot injection molding and can be used as storage container or for urban farming after its function as package. The Pyramid package is a triangular shaped bag for beans and a similar shaped cardboard box for the cups. This package is enclosable due to its zip lock closure, it is made of (industrial) compostable materials and it creates a block on the shelf due to the story that is spread over several packaging facings. The Beangame package for beans is a bag with a craft appearance, on which a boardgame is printed. In this way the customers can experience the FairChain story themselves. Those three packaging designs are evaluated with twelve consumers in order to learn which aspects are most important for them and which packaging design had the most potential in their opinion. This evaluation test is also done in more informal conversations with Moyee Coffee employees. In the end the Pyramid package seemed to have the most potential to be further developed and to finally launch Moyee Coffee in in the larger retail channels. Consumers were very enthusiastic about the enclosability, the differentiating shape and the compostability. This design had some disadvantages which are improved in the last part of the report. Also a plan is made how Moyee Coffee can introduce this package in larger retail channels, which prices they should use and how it should use both online and offline touch points to reach consumers. Three future scenarios are created in order to find out which steps are interesting to make optimum use of the benifits of economies of scale and what the timing can be. In the end the Pyramid package is examined to what extend it fits with the design goal. It appears that it was quite hard to create the revolutionary coffee experience with only the package. Therefore, also several recommendations are given hoe Moyee can use other touch points for that. Also the brand image can become stronger when these touch points are optimally used.","Packaging; Strategy; Touch points; Customer journey; Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Song, Y. (mentor)","2015","Executive Summary This graduation project has initiated by Dr. Johan Molenbroek. There is a need for a better fitting Digital Human Model for the faculty of Industrial Design Engineering (IDE). This project has been carried out by an IPD student with an affection for modelling and ergonomics. Research Before the start of this project, explorative research has been done in order to get a better insight in the current state of development in the field of digital ergonomics aids. It was found that there are varying types of DHMs, used in various sectors. Furthermore many databases around the world provide insight in human dimensions, though there is no consistency or standard for this knowledge. This results in overall poor quality of the databases and the exchangeability of raw data for the DHMs. After the start of this project, quantitative user research has been performed. The method that was used was an ‘online questionnaire form’ to achieve high response rates from the target group; all students at the IDE faculty. Knowledge and experience in relation to known DHMs was reviewed in this research. The input of the participants helped to gather more insight in their needs. This helps to result in a better product-user fit. The original assignment for this project was further explored and different tracks within the assignment were defined. Ideation Two former DHMs were developed and evaluated by the Supervisory Team. The conclusion of this, combined with the research outcomes, led to the final goal definition for this project; “Develop a DHM for educational purpose which can be used at the IDE faculty, and by students. The usage should be as unobtrusive as possible; it should fit within the regular workflow of design students during their projects.” An extensive list of requirements (LOR) was generated in order to guide this project, and to be able to validate the functionalities and abilities of the end-result. The LOR was composed from of three contributing sources; - direct requirements from the client (the faculty of IDE, coming forth from the above goal definition) - needs and wishes from the users (derived from the first user research) - requirements adapted from a previous graduation project, being the forbear of this project. Together with the insights and knowledge of the author the LOR was finalized. Concept development had already begun and this list was a guiding tool securing the quality of the model.7 Product Development Various iterative cycles led to the final product that has to fulfill the needs of the stakeholders. The DHM that has been developed is a high fidelity digital version of the human body. An accompanying User Interface (UI) will contribute to the ease of use of this model. Different user tasks have been defined. Model configuration, model posing, target product interaction, target product testing and evaluation and rendering are tasks that will be performed by the user during their design process. The DHM is named AMIE(E), the name for a French (girl)friend. It stands for Anthropometric Model In Ergonomics Education It has a complete body poseability, a realistic and ready to render appearance. There are five varying percentile pre-sets, linked to a database derived from DINED. Testing The usage of the AMIE(E) DHM was tested with a selection of the target user group. In depth user research was set-up for this evaluation on the usability. The method that was used was ‘Use study research using video documentation’. This method aided in simulating the expected realistic usage of this model, as well as recording the activities in a non-obtrusive manner. Results from this user research were revealing several negative aspects. Crucial requirements relating to usability were not (fully) met, leading to a negative user experience. The cause of this outcome has been considered. Underestimation of the complexity of this task, combined with a shortage of experience in developing digital UI can be seen as contributors. Software problems in relation to the program of SolidWorks are also seen as a malefactor in this project. Recommendations Tough decisions had to be made about the continuation of this project. It was decided that main efforts had to be put in the transfer of knowledge regarding this project. The insights and achievements that have been made during this project should be transferred to successors. An extensive overview of recommendations and raw content has been provided, in order for a smooth continuation of the development of this DHM. The conclusion of this paper reflects the fierce confidence of the author. The start of a grand project has been made. The development of the AMIE(E) DHM was more complex than anticipated for. Nevertheless this project has been finalized with satisfaction. A first usable version of the DHM has been made available for the faculty. Great knowledge has been gathered in the discipline of digital ergonomic aids.. The ending of this graduation project will be the start of a new one; the next step that will be done by another great developer.","Anthropometrics; Digital Human Model; DHM; SolidWorks; Ergonomics; Human Factors","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2015","In industry, discrete models can be used to describe and analyze a class of event driven systems. These so called discrete event systems (DESs) contain a finite number of resources that are shared by different users called jobs. All of these resources and jobs contribute to the achievement of some common goal. Deciding on how to allocate a set of jobs to limited resources over time in an optimal way is called scheduling, where the basic types of control decisions are routing, ordering and synchronization. The scheduling of DESs is crucial in many applications, such as railway networks, production systems, baggage handling, legged locomotion, container handling and paper handling in printers. Most of the models that describe the behavior of DESs are nonlinear in the conventional algebra that uses addition and multiplication operators. There is however a class of DESs that can be described by a model that is linear in the max-plus algebra, which uses maximization and addition as its main operators. In such a max-plus linear (MPL) system the model structure is fixed, whereby changes in the structure of the system cannot be modeled. However, the model dynamics can be influenced by allowing switching between different modes. An MPL system where switching is allowed is called a switching max-plus linear (SMPL) system. By switching to another mode, the route, order and/or synchronization is changed. A general framework on how to model these SMPL systems is obtained, where the topology graph is used. A topology graph of a system describes all possible connections between resources but does not tell which route or order is chosen. The routes can all be constructed by assigning max-plus binary control variables to each arc. By looking at the number of incoming arcs specific ordering constraints for each node are obtained. A problem that remains are circuits where a job can re-enter multiple times. These circuits result in duplicated nodes whereby the ordering constraints change. The method on how to model such circuits is described. Once the model is obtained, the scheduling problem always results in finding the optimal max-plus binary variables related to routing and ordering. This control problem is solved by using a Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy, which is recast as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming problem. Using the general framework, a simple and more complex baggage handling system is modeled and controlled. Adding a due date reference for the complex baggage handling system shows that the bags arrive in time. Also the switching between different cycles can clearly be seen.","max-plus algebra","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","DCSC","","Control Engineering","",""

In this research cunifer alloy CuNi10Fe (with 10 percent nickel) was investigated. The weld filler was a cunifer alloy with 30 percent nickel (CuNi30Fe). While generally there should be little corrosion problems, some will occur. In this research more information was acquired about the corrosion properties of a copper-nickel alloy used by Damen Schelde Naval Shipbuilding in the case of welding. The corrosion properties were investigated in different zones over the weld, i.e. the weld zone, heat affected zone, and base material. The differences in terms of corrosion performance between welding with backing gas and without backing gas were studied. The alloy can be protected against corrosion by a self-assembling monolayer of sodium diethyldithiocarbamate. The influence on the corrosion properties of this layer was also investigated. Potentiodynamic measurements, surface analysis and Kelvin probe measurements were used. The unprotected weld zone of a weld welded without backing gas resulted in a significantly higher corrosion rate in the sulphide containing solution. Welding without backing gas caused a porous surface to form on the inside of the pipes. This is not beneficial for the corrosion properties on the long run. The protection with sodium diethyldithiocarbamate decreased the corrosion rate to levels also obtained in the solution without sulphides for the samples welded without backing gas.","cunifer; weld; CuNi10Fe; sodium diethyldithiocarbamate; copper nickel alloy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-06-20","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Materials Science & Engineering","","Materials Engineering and Applications","",""

(mentor); Tedeschi, E. (mentor)","2015","The development of far-offshore wind farms and other large-scale renewable energy sources, together with the increasing needs for long distance power transmission is resulting in more HVDC systems being integrated into the traditional AC power network. Due to the capability for operation in isolated AC grids, VSCs are becoming the preferred technology for HVDC systems. Additionally, VSC HVDC allows for more flexible power control within a network than the conventional LCC systems. Moreover, the need for flexible transmission capacity to balance fluctuating power generation from renewable sources over wide geographical areas combined with the corresponding potential benefits in a deregulated power market is expected to favour the concept of VSC based Multi-terminal HVDC system (MTDC). MTDC provides enhanced reliability and functionality and reduces the cost and conversion losses. However, most HVDC transmission schemes are currently constructed as point-to point connections, and there is not yet any clear standardization of voltage levels. Thus, DC/DC converters will become necessary if existing or emerging HVDC links operating with different voltages and different configurations. i.e. monopolar and bipolar should later be interconnected into MTDC configurations. DC/DC converters might also be needed for power flow control in meshed MTDC grids. The goal of this thesis is to summarize the requirements for DC/DC converters in HVDC applications and focus on the modelling and control of DC/DC converters for various applications. The modelling includes both switching and average models. Four types of DC/DC converters intended for different applications are modelled using MATLAB/ Simulink® platform. The functionality of the developed models are demonstrated by simulations in MTDC grid based on the CIGRÉ B4 DC grid test system.","HVDC; MTDC System; DC/DC Converters","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Engineering","","European Wind Energy Masters (EWEM)","",""

(mentor)","2015","The costs of wind energy have to be reduced in order to be competitive with conventional methods to generate electricity. The tower costs contribute significantly to the costs of a wind turbine. This thesis aimed to suggest improvements in wind turbine tower design in comparison with industry standards nowadays in order to reduce the costs of wind turbine towers. It has been investigated if modeling the mass, geometry and stiffness of the tower flanges into aeroelastic codes affects the simulation results. The effect of geometry and stiffness is not contributing as much as modeling the mass. Modeling flanges as point masses is sufficient to represent the flanges in the aeroelastic code. A constraint damping layer between the flange connections is proposed. Such a layer can be used to increase the damping of the tower. In this way, the fatigue loads on the tower can be reduced. An improved flange design optimization method is suggested. A cost performance function is created, reducing the flange costs of more than 2.5% in comparison with the optimization method used nowadays within Siemens Wind Power. Standardization of flange connections in wind turbine towers is also considered. This is beneficial for the costs of handling equipment and tower internals, as project specific design and certification of these components can be omitted. Other advantages of flange standardization are risk mitigation and supply chain benefits. Standardization of the flanges leads to a costs increase up to 7%. The tower sections can be designed less conservative if sector based fatigue loads will be considered. In combination with sector based SN-curves and stress concentration factors the tower can be directed in such a way that the fatigue loads are less severe. Up to 6% tower mass reduction can be realized for fatigue driven tower designs. The Effective Equivalent Stress Hypothesis and the Gough-Pollard algorithm, multiaxial fatigue life prediction models proposed by literature, are implemented to investigate the influence of combined loading on tower welds. According to the above multiaxial fatigue models, load safety factors between 1.16 and 1.40 are required when evaluating fatigue life in tower welds with the conventional uniaxial method. In this way the additional damage due to combined out-of-phase loading is incorporated in the fatigue life prediction. However, usage of correct multiaxial fatigue models instead of safety factors increases the accuracy of fatigue life predictions.","wind; energy; turbine; tower; fatigue; weld; flange","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-07-01","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Offshore Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2015","Recently, there has been a fast development and deployment of wind energy to meet the increasing electrical power demand and to limit the use of fossil fuels. More and more wind farms are planned far from shore because of good wind condition and less visual impact. This is so called offshore wind farm (OWF). In such a situation, high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission is a favorable option for integrating these OWFs to the onshore grid, because HVDC, compared with high voltage alternating current (HVAC), has lower losses and higher transmission efficiency. For HVDC transmission, voltage source converter (VSC) has some advantages over current source converter (CSC), e.g. independent control of active power and reactive power, bidirectional power transfer for fixed voltage polarity. When a fault occurs at the onshore ac grid which connects OWFs via VSC-HVDC, the active power cannot be fully transmitted to onshore grid, while OWFs still produce active power. The imbalanced power will increase the HVDC-link voltage. This increased dc voltage will lead to high electrical stress for the insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) modules, capacitors as well as cables, and even damage them. There have been different proposed methods to deal with this problem, e.g. chopper controlled resistor, wind turbine generator power setpoint adjustment, wind turbine grid side converter active current reduction, offshore voltage reduction. Chopper resistor method limits dc-link voltage by dissipating the imbalanced power . The second and third method reduce the power output from each wind turbine to limit the dc-link voltage increase. These two methods need communication between HVDC converter and each wind turbine. Offshore voltage reduction method initiates a controlled voltage drop by offshore converter to achieve a fast power reduction. All these four fault ride through (FRT) methods will be implemented in a test system and the effectiveness of these methods are evaluated with simulations made in PSCAD environment. Finally, based on the proposed methods, an enhanced FRT method is developed and its effectiveness is tested with the system. The advantages and disadvantages of different FRT methods are compared and summarized.","offshore wind farm; voltage source converter; fault-ride through; high voltage DC transmission","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","","",""

And while there have been studies on how projects use code reviews, current research has not investigated how developers configure the ASATs that they use and how these configurations evolve. In this thesis, we answer these questions by means of a large scale analysis of open source software. We found that both code reviews and ASATs are common, but not ubiquitous. Many projects do not perform code reviews for the changes of core developers and do not enforce a strict use of ASATs. Regarding the use of ASATs, developers both use and avoid maintainability defects to a greater extent than functional defects. Most configurations of developers deviate from the default and hardly contain custom rules. However, there are few default rules that are changed by a significant percentage of developers. Finally, most configuration files never change. And if they do, the changes are small, occur over the lifetime of the project, and are not triggered by ASAT version updates.","static analysis; code review; static analyzer; open source","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Engineering","","","",""

These applications do not require the reconstruction of the original analog signal. According to the Whittaker-Kotelnikov-Shannon-Nyquist theorem, the sampling rate must be at least twice the maximum frequency present in the signal if we want to recover the signal from its samples. If we estimate the power spectrum directly by using a high-rate analog-to-digital converter, we will find that such high-rate ADCs consume a large amount of power because of its high sampling rate. To reduce the burden on the ADCs, we investigate compressive power spectrum sensing. Since the power spectrum is calculated based on the autocorrelations of the signal, we do not need to recover the signals. This allows a reduction of the sampling rate compared with the Nyquist rate while maintaining perfect power spectrum reconstruction. In this thesis, we study power spectrum estimation of a wide-sense stationary signal. In general, the signal, whose power spectrum is to be estimated, is sampled by multi-coset sampling. The parametric method to estimate the power spectrum of the signal is also evaluated and the study of the performance of non-uniform sampling is explored as well.","compressive; parametric; sub-optimal sparse ruler","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","","",""

(mentor); Hendricks, M.A.N. (mentor); Qu, Y. (mentor)","2015","In recent times, the oil and gas business has moved into unconventional reservoirs, especially in deep-water. One high-potential prospect was found in the deep-water area of Myanmar. A subsea production system pilot project is planned for implementation in this area. One essential element of a subsea system is a “subsea jumper”. The main function is to interface between the subsea tree and subsea manifold. There are various subsea jumper configurations used in the market. This thesis focuses primarily on the U-inverse shape jumper as a fundamental shape which gives subsea jumper a flexible characteristic. A subsea jumper that is used in a deep-water area is difficult to access for maintenance or repair. As such, it is essential to determine the reliability of a jumper system, especially thru fatigue failure analysis. The dynamic behaviors of a subsea jumper at various load conditions need to be taken into account during the design phase. In general, a subsea jumper system experiences many loads both internal and external, but there are only two key external loads, the steady sea current and earthquakes at designed area. These interesting factors are considered in this thesis. In order to be better understand the dynamic behaviors of a subsea jumper under load conditions, it is important to first analyze the dynamic characteristics of the jumper itself. A U-inverse shape jumper can be modelled by connecting three “pipe conveying fluid model” (or Euler Bernoulli Beam + internal flow effect). This is called a “subsea jumper model” or “Triple beam model”. This model gives the dynamic characteristics of a jumper in terms of “mode shape” and “natural frequency” in two vibration planes: inline and crossflow. The dynamic behavior of a subsea jumper under a current load situation can be solved by using a wake oscillator model coupled with a subsea jumper model. The results show that a mild sea current is able to dramatically induce jumper oscillation. This phenomenon is called Vortex induced vibration (VIV). It can occur in both crossflow VIV and inline VIV; however, for both cases of VIV, a subsea jumper system is safe to operate under the designed current velocity (maximum current velocity is 0.832 m/s, based on a 100-year return value). In an earthquake load condition, the subsea jumper model is coupled with an inertia load model (mass times acceleration). Two types of acceleration are considered in this thesis thru a sinusoidal model and simulation model. The first, sinusoidal model assumes that an earthquake is a continuous process with ground acceleration in a sinusoidal shape. It is used to analyze the dynamic behavior of a subsea jumper in terms of “seismic response spectra”. The second, a simulation model defines an earthquake in more realistic way by considering an earthquake as a shock of high magnitude in a small period. This model is more suitable for fatigue analysis. It should be emphasized that a pure earthquake load is a rare occasion, as the current of the nearby seabed is always present. Thus, it is more helpful to investigate the fatigue lifetime of a jumper under a combination of earthquake effects and steady current. The analysis results show that a subsea jumper can withstand up to 13,000 number of a high magnitude earthquake shock, over 7.5 Richter. However, during the designed lifetime of a subsea jumper there are typically only 600 shocks. Thus, one can conclude that a subsea jumper is safe against earthquakes in the designed area. The designed subsea jumper may require changes if it is relocated to operate in another area with the presence of a stronger current velocity and/or earthquake conditions. Subsea jumper lifetime can be improved by designing dimensions and configurations to give natural frequencies out of the load range. This can be achieved by reducing the length of a jumper or increasing its diameter. Another method is to reduce the flow rate of the contained fluid. However, these methods may stimulate another problem if slug is present inside the jumper. Adjustments in flow rate or jumper dimension changes the impact period of slug at each bend of a jumper system. When slug impact load frequency is close to a natural frequency, there will be a dramatic response. Thus, considerations of slug should be taken into account for subsea jumper design, especially with any changes in dimension, configuration and flow rate. Lastly, other mitigation methods include a more robust material, controlling surface conditions and welding method.","fatigue; subsea jumper","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Offshore engineering","",""

To evaluate and aid in the design of future air traffic management systems, complexity metrics would help to speed up the development of advanced safe air traffic management systems. Although an airspace sector may look 'complex' with many aircraft, this does not equate to it actually being complex with the right tool. The complexity of a sector or traffic scenarios depends on a large number of factors, irrelevant of the tool. Previous studies with well developed state-based complexity metrics focused on air traffic controllers safely controlling traffic of today, with a 'hands-on' approach. One recent metric based on trajectory-based management could prove to help predict controller workload. The goal of this study has been to empirically investigate if a complexity metric can predict human controller workload in future 4D trajectory management environments. For this purpose a previously developed 4D management tool had been used to support a controller in an envisioned future large airspace sector with varying traffic structures and perturbation levels. A well developed state-based complexity metric was compared against a recent trajectory-based complexity metric by the results of the reported workload experienced. Results of a human-in-the-loop experiment indicate that the trajectory-based complexity metric looks promising to workload predictions in 4D trajectory management environments.","workload; inherent complexity; 4D trajectories; air traffic management; human-machine interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Control and Operations","","Control and Simulation","",""

(mentor); Rijneveld, P. (mentor); Hoving, J. (mentor); Van Dalen, K. (mentor)","2015","Submarine pipeline is an important part of offshore oil and gas projects for fluid transmission purpose. Installation of pipelines, especially in deep water, can induce rather severe loads to the structure and this can lead to the unforeseeable risks and challenges. During pipe laying by vessel and reel ship, the pipe bend in the vertical plan at the bottom of pipe laying profile, so called sag bend, this sag bend region has to withstand combined tension, bending and external ambient pressure. Under these combined loads, the pipe will first be subjected to global deformation until it reaches limit point. If the curvature is increased further to plastic region, material or geometrical imperfections will initiate onset of local buckling or onset buckling. If the curvature is continually increased to reaches the maximum bending of the pipe, we call this point as limit point. Once the onset buckling occurs, as long as they are small, for all practical use not influence the limit moment capacity. After the onset buckling occurs, the deepwater pipelines are vulnerable to local bucking, which will in turn have potential of initiating a propagate buckle which the pipeline will suffer from catastrophic flattening. This results in in failure of whole structure as well as huge economic loss. The local buckling check as per DNV-OS-F101 is currently valid for D/t rations up to 45. Section 13 E900 does specify what one should do in case of higher D/t (up to 60): perform FE analyses. The study has been being performed within Allseas in order to provide assistance to DNV for expanding the applicability of the local buckling checks in DNV-OS-F101 for higher D/t ratios (up to 60). In the beginning, DNV provided the Abaqus model, ‘Case-6’ as guidance, boundary conditions and possibly old models. As a response by Allseas, the ‘base case’ model was developed and the miss-alignment at the girth weld was introduced by matching an oval pipe with a round pipe. There are 2 cases of miss-alignment, including ‘symmetry base case with 12 o’clock miss-alignment’ which has the maximum outer diameter is in vertical axis and minimum outer is in horizontal axis and ‘symmetry base case with 9 o’clock miss-alignment’ which has the maximum outer diameter is in horizontal axis and minimum outer is in vertical axis. The models are created into half pipe-cross section symmetrically to vertical axis along the longitudinal axis of the pipe model. Applied loads are combined external pressure, tension force and bending as the loads on sag bend during pipe laying. Analysis results show as expected that when the long axis of the oval pipe cross-section is taken along the vertical axis in ‘symmetry base case with 12 o’clock miss-alignment’ while bending is applied in the vertical plane along the pipe centreline the onset buckling occurs closed to the girth weld area on the round pipe section. If the pipe is rolled 90 degrees in ‘symmetry base case with 9 o’clock miss-alignment’ and the bending in the same plane, onset buckling occurs closed to the girth weld area on the miss-alignment pipe section. The maximum bending moment result in ‘symmetry base case with 12 o’clock miss-alignment’ is higher than the maximum bending moment result ‘symmetry base case with 9 o’clock miss-alignment’ as expected.","buckling behaviour; miss-alignment pipe; finite element analysis; local buckling; buckling failure; ABAQUS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-07-20","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","","MSc. in Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

The initiation of this thesis is Allseas engineering project. As a major contractor in the oil and gas industry, Allseas group is seeking a transformation and tries to redefine herself in the platform decommissioning business. With the new built platform installation / decommissioning and pipe-lay vessel Pioneering Spirit, Allseas group is well prepared to execute her first decommissioning project, the decommissioning of the Yme MOPUstor platform. The Yme MOPUstor is a production jack up platform, located in the North Sea. It was built and installed in 2010. However, due to its obvious dynamic defects, this platform is abandoned and will be decommissioned in 2015. After the abandon of the platform, several institutions were invited to investigate the dynamic behavior of the Yme MOPUstor. However, different conclusions are given by using different dynamic analysis methods. For the purpose of the decommissioning, it is inevitable to judge those existing studies and carry out a new dynamic analysis. Therefore, this thesis is motivated by this important and interesting challenge. This comparative study is carried out in four aspects: the linear versus non-linear, the quasi-static versus dynamic, the stochastic versus deterministic and the efficiency. The comparative study is first demonstrated on some sample models to illustrate the fundamental differences. Then, the dynamic analyses of the Yme MOPUstor for the given sea states by using different methods are analyzed and compared. In addition of the comparative study, a new dynamic analysis method, the higher order frequency domain method (HFD), is developed and verified. This new method is believed to significantly improve both the accuracy and the efficiency of the traditional methods. Besides, the HFD method also provides an approach to better understanding the fundamental differences between the traditional quasi-static, frequency domain and time-domain methods.","dynamic; offshore; non-linear","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-07-19","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Offshore Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2015","A model has been developed to demonstrate the value of a decentralized approach to formation flight routing. In the considered scenario, formation flight is an in-flight option. While centralized approaches are well covered in the literature, anticipating the use of formation flight before take-off, decentralized approaches have received less attention. Several examples do exist, noting that only one completely decentralized method was encountered. A completely decentralized approach is herein defined as one that does not use any kind of pre-flight formation flight planning or routing restrictions. While flying, each aircraft may communicate with others when they breach each other's communication range. During these communications, a formation flight strategy is formulated and the flights have to choose directly if they wish to commit to it. This method of obtaining fuel savings characterizes this work. Its compactness allowed for a broad evaluation of the potential of a decentralized approach within the project time frame. The sub-optimality of this greedy method enhances the value of any positive findings from this research, since it is likely that a global optimum has not yet been found. The decentralized approach that was developed during this project shows promising results when considering the efficiency with which large scenarios can be evaluated. A typical simulation in the performed transatlantic case study, containing 347 flights, took less than 6 minutes on a standard PC. Additionally, the capability of the model to sustain obtained savings when flights are delayed has been shown. The ability of flights to perform multiple consecutive formation flight segments is new to the research area. The latter significantly increases the usage rate of formation flight in the considered scenarios. It is noted that, in any current publication on formation flight implementation, the estimation of overall fuel savings strongly depends on assumptions. As such, the added value of this research is of a more relative nature. Based on the conservative assumption that any formation member other than the formation leader experiences a fuel flow reduction of 10%, the resulting routes and used formations were studied. The maximum obtained overall fuel savings estimation is 4.3% in a case study on 347 transatlantic flights. These savings were found when a combined objective was used, taking into account both fuel consumption and additional flight time. More significantly, formation sizes ranging from 2 to 6 aircraft were commonly used. A formation flight usage rate of 73%, with respect to total flight time, was recorded during the same simulation.","formation flight; decentralized approach; implementation; routing; greedy algorithm; fuel savings","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Air Transport Operations","","Control and Operations","",""

(mentor)","2015","Considering the fact that all large commercial aircraft have not changed significantly in their tube–and–wing shape during the past few decades, one would suggest that a completely different configuration is necessary to facilitate a new leap forward in aircraft performance. The blended–wing–body is potentially such an alternative configuration. Existing conceptual design methodologies do not always apply to these configurations since they are often based on empirical relations for, or intensively tailored towards, tube–and–wing configurations. Developing new conceptual design methodologies for the interior and exterior design and analysis of these blended–wing–body configurations forms the main objective of this study. An automatic, fast–turnaround, non–empirical aircraft cabin sizing method, hereafter called Cabin Configurator, has been developed that places all the required elements within aircraft cabins. The dimensions in which the elements are fitted can be sized automatically by the method itself (inside–out approach) but can also be pre–defined by the designer (outside–in approach). Other key differences with existing design methods are the ability to cope with arbitrary cabin shapes such as the trapezium–like blended–wing–body cabin and to exchange seats for galleys and lavatories. The Cabin Configurator has been extensively validated against a large amount of existing tube–and–wing cabins. The average underestimation of the cabin length and cabin width for widebody configurations is found to be 7.8% and 4.4% respectively. For narrowbody configurations, the overestimation of the cabin length is found to be 5.2% where the cabin width is underestimated by 1.9%. No conclusions could be derived about the feasibility of Cabin Configurator results for blended–wing–body cabins due to the lack of well–documented cabin designs in the research field. A fast–turnaround aerodynamic analysis method, hereafter called BWB–Q3D, has also been developed that analyses the wing and fuselage exterior of a blended–wing–body configuration from an aerodynamic perspective. The three–dimensional lift and drag coefficients are estimated by the combination of a vortex lattice method with a two–dimensional airfoil analysis method. An important consideration in the BWB–Q3D methodology is setting the sectional sweep angles of the fuselage to zero, leading to conservative estimations of the drag coefficients. BWB–Q3D has been validated with high–fidelity computational fluid dynamics based on the Reynolds–averaged Navier–Stokes equations. Firm conclusions on the magnitude of the results could not be given. However, a good correlation in global design trends of lift–over–drag ratios has been observed between the results of BWB–Q3D and the high–fidelity computational fluid dynamics. Computations were performed in cruise conditions (Mach 0.7, Mach 0.75 and Mach 0.8) on two different geometries. An extensive analysis of blended–wing–body cabin–sizing approaches has been performed in order to determine the differences in accuracy in a worst-case scenario. The inside–out approach of the Cabin Configurator has been compared with the tube–and–wing–tailored outside–in approach, often pursued in the research field. In analyzing several thousands of cabins, it has been shown that an average overestimation between 7% and 22% in cabin capacity results from following the outside–in design approach. Finally, a new aircraft cabin sizing method has been outlined, the hybrid approach, based on combining cabin width dimensioning with pre–defined cabin length determination. An average decrease of more than 50% in cabin area sizing error is obtained when following this method instead of outside-in. No dedicated interior–sizing tool such as the Cabin Configurator is required, making this method easily applicable within the blended–wing–body research field.","blended wing body; cabin sizing; BWB; conceptual aircraft design; aerodynamic analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Performance and Propulsion","","","",""

However, due to various reasons almost none of them made it along the two year development process. Lantor approached Delft University of Technology with the request to “look for opportunities to translate the heating veil technology into innovative applications for markets outside of the composites industry”. The assignment was meant to focus on market research, executed under the wings of Lantor’s fourth business unit: Custom. Exploratory research into external markets and in- depth understanding of Lantor’s current strategic position was undertaken to understand which market would be interesting and have ‘company fit’. Along the process it became clear that finding a market wasn’t as straightforward as it seemed; nor was understanding what suited Lantor both in terms of working processes and strategic vision. This internal and external research resulted into ten insights; each supported by an observation, consequence of said observation for Lantor and an advice on how to proceed. The advices range from research and user- oriented topics to innovation management and strategic advices on a corporate level: 1. PowerSHEAT® is not differentiating enough in any researched market. 2. An idea is not the same as an opportunity. 3. Exploratory research focusses on discovery. 4.

Flight vehicles with relatively flexible structures exhibit more prominent coupling of aeroelasticity and flight dynamics, and may suffer from degraded aerodynamic efficiency and decrease of control surface effectiveness. In order to address this issue, a multi-disciplinary approach to control effectiveness and aerodynamic efficiency of flexible aircraft is required. The purpose is not only to neutralize negative aeroelastic effects, but also to employ deliberate reshaping of the elastic wing to improve efficiency and handling of the aircraft. To this end, NASA is researching a novel type of control effector, the Variable Camber Continuous Trailing Edge Flap (VCCTEF). Using the multi-segment flaps of the VCCTEF, it is possible to adapt the camber of the wing in order to achieve an optimum lift distribution. In the context of aircraft with flexible airframes, a representation of flight characteristics based on a rigid-body 6DOF flight dynamic model is inadequate. The prominent coupling of flight dynamics, structural dynamics, and high-bandwidth control surfaces calls for coupled flight dynamic and aeroservoelastic modeling of flexible vehicles. The purpose of this thesis project was to develop such a coupled model for application during the conceptual design phase of adaptive aeroelastic wing technologies. A comprehensive flight dynamic and aeroservoelastic modeling approach for a flexible wing aircraft with VCCTEF in turbulent air was developed. Unsteady aerodynamics of the flexible wing and flap system were found using modified aerodynamic strip theory based on steady-flow vortex-lattice results and 2D unsteady aerodynamics models. Compressibility effects on the unsteady aerodynamics, based on the work by Beddoes and Leishman et al., were taken into account throughout the modeling effort and a comparison was made with unsteady aerodynamics for incompressible flow. In order to demonstrate the model and the effectiveness of the VCCTEF, a multi-objective flight controller for flight dynamic maneuvering, flutter suppression, and drag reduction was designed. Simulation results underline the potential of the VCCTEF as an enabling technology for adaptive aeroelastic wing shaping.","flight dynamics; aeroelasticity; aeroservoelasticity; unsteady aerodynamics; flight control; vcctef","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-07-22","Aerospace Engineering","Control and Operations","","Control and Simulation","",""

(mentor); Metrikine, A. (mentor)","2015","Floating structures as spar, semi-submersibles and TLP have been proposed for offshore wind turbines for deep waters (>60m) according to the report of Arapogianni, Moccia, Williams, & Phillips (2011), where bottom fixed sub-structures are technically and economically not feasible. Several floating concepts have been designed and just some of them were deployed as Hywind (Statoil, 2015) and WindFloat (Roddier, Cermelli, Aubault, & Weinstein, 2010), but still they are prototypes that require further improvements in order to achieve it techno-economic feasibility. At the Centre for Ships and Ocean Structures (CeSOS) NTNU a braceless concept was developed for deep waters called CSC. This floater consists on one central column supporting the wind turbine and three side columns connected each of them at the bottom to the central one through pontoons. These cantilever columns might induce large dynamic stress at the connection section on the pontoon as well on the cross section closer the central column. The project objective is to propose a structural connection between the central and outer columns at the top avoiding wave loads and check its stress reduction on the pontoon. The design methodology involves a stability analysis using numerical tool from Det Norske Veritas (DNV) Genie and HydroD. The wind turbine from the National Renewable Laboratories (NREL) in E.E.U.U. of 5MW was employed to estimate the loads and workability of the floater. The hydrodynamics analysis is going to be done in frequency domain based just in wave loads. Through the hydrodynamic loads the stresses are estimated assuming rigid body behavior. It estimation are done by Euler-Bernoulli theory and via Finite Element Method using beams and shell elements. The results show that the upper beams reduce significantly the dynamic axial stress on the pontoon, increasing the floater strength. The FEM using beam elements is a simple and reliable numeric approach to obtain global loads and the stress distribution on the structure. The FEM shell mode could predict the stress for the simplest case but it requires more computational effort in order to set up the mesh model and achieve satisfactory results. The Euler-Bernoulli method under predict the stress on the pontoons as the whole structure of pontoon-brace does not fulfill the beam theory assumptions.","FOWT; wind energy; RAO; FEM; offshore structure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-07-17","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor); Keviczky, T. (mentor); Noordstrand, A.M. (mentor); De Vet, C.P.M. (mentor)","2015","Positioning and localization are key topics associated with the control and operation of robotic vehicles. This holds in particular for robots functioning in a challenging environment, such as the ship’s hull maintenance robot developed by Fleet Cleaner. As the industry standard techniques are limited due to constraints imposed by the harbor and ship’s hull as operating area, solving this positioning problem is not trivial. Therefore, the main objective of this thesis is: “design a position determination system for a ship’s hull maintenance robot”. The objective is accomplished by completing three phases: conceptual design, embodiment design, and proof of concept. The conceptual design approach focuses on the selection of optimal measuring principles, based on the characteristic constraints and requirements of the system. The solution is found to be a combination of both absolute and relative positioning methods, using the principles of: underwater acoustics, depth sensing, inertial sensing, and wheel encoding. For the embodiment design the implementation parameters for customizing the inertial, depth, and acoustic subsystem to the application are considered. This leads to the proposed set of design choices: a local reference system of acoustic beacons attached to the ship’s hull, where acoustic one-way communication between the robot and beacons provide information of the robot’s absolute position in intervals; using inertial velocity and orientation to compute the relative displacement between intervals; a pressure-based sensor for determining depth. A proof of concept is obtained by combining the sensors into a test platform. The setup, built with some assumptions and concessions, contains the basics of essential methodologies for position estimation. Evaluation is based on measurements obtained from two settings (i.e., a water crate and the 3mE towing tank), both aimed at simulating harbor environment. The basic principles are verified and the design proven to work in a laboratory setting. Based on findings throughout the project, suggestions are formulated for improvement by scaling and integrating components, while adding robustness to the estimation methods. Also further testing in a more controlled and structured way (i.e., using the towing tank cart) is required to quantify the performance. Following up on these recommendations will lead to the realization of the complete full scale positioning system for the ship’s hull maintenance robot.","positioning; robot; underwater; ship's hull; harbor; acoustic transducers; inertial sensor; data integration; fusion; estimation; system design; conceptual design; embodiment; proof of concept","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-07-08","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC)","","Signals & Systems","",""

In an attempt to find a market for new products in an early stage, one of the company’s latest technologies was developed using input from (potential) buyers and partners in a variety of new industries and markets. However, due to various reasons almost none of them made it along the two year development process. Lantor approached Delft University of Technology with the request to “look for opportunities to translate the heating veil technology into innovative applications for markets outside of the composites industry”. The assignment was meant to focus on market research, executed under the wings of Lantor’s fourth business unit: Custom. Exploratory research into external markets and in- depth understanding of Lantor’s current strategic position was undertaken to understand which market would be interesting and have ‘company fit’. Along the process it became clear that finding a market wasn’t as straightforward as it seemed; nor was understanding what suited Lantor both in terms of working processes and strategic vision. This internal and external research resulted into ten insights; each supported by an observation, consequence of said observation for Lantor and an advice on how to proceed. The advices range from research and user- oriented topics to innovation management and strategic advices on a corporate level: 1. PowerSHEAT® is not differentiating enough in any researched market. 2. An idea is not the same as an opportunity. 3. Exploratory research focusses on discovery. 4. A value proposition is based on the understanding of user needs. 5. Stakeholders can be involved through co-creation 6. Structured input from the outside through Open Innovation 7. Different types of innovation require different approaches 8. Expectations between departments need to be aligned. 9. Failures can be learned from. 10. Innovation requires strategic direction The advices resulting from the ten insights were gathered and common identifiers were found on which the innovation approach was build: a collaborative innovation approach for Lantor Custom; to develop new product- and market opportunities based on their technological strengths and in close collaboration with potential buyers. This shift requires a shift in strategy; shared within the organisational culture, and supported by the necessary processes, tools, structure and people. For each of these building blocks the necessary steps are determined and an implementation plan was developed.","innovation approach; collaboration; strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design Engineering","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2015","Direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation of acoustic sources is of great interest in a number of applications. Acoustic vector sensors (AVSs) provide an edge over traditional scalar sensors since they measure the acoustic velocity field in addition to the acoustic pressure. It is known that a uniform linear array (ULA) of M conventional scalar sensors can identify up to M-1 DOAs. However, using second-order statistics, the class of sparse scalar sensor arrays have been shown to identify more source DOAs than the number of sensors. In this thesis, we extend these results using sparse AVS arrays. We first assume that the sources are quasi-stationary and use the Khatri-Rao subspace approach to estimate the source DOAs. In addition, a spatial-velocity smoothing technique is proposed to estimate the DOAs of stationary sources. For both scenarios, we show that the number of source DOAs that can be identified is significantly greater than the number of physical vector sensors. The second problem considered in this thesis is sensor selection for non-linear models. It is often necessary to guarantee a certain estimation accuracy by choosing the best subset of the available set of sensors. A non-linear measurement model in additive Gaussian noise is considered. To solve the sensor selection problem, which is inherently combinatorial, a greedy algorithm based on submodular cost functions is developed. The proposed low-complexity greedy algorithm is computationally attractive as compared to existing sensor selection solvers for non-linear models. The submodular cost ensures optimality of the greedy algorithm.","Direction-of-Arrival (DOA) estimation; Sensing design; Non-uniform arrays","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Circuits and Systems","","Telecommunications","",""

(mentor)","2015","In a world of improving health care, some diseases are still very hard to diagnose. The most common reasons for this problem is the fact that those diseases are non-symptomatic. To gain better diagnoses of such illnesses long term ExG by using bio-medical implants is a good option. These implants have to be powered by a wireless power link. This thesis analyses the possibilities for the development of a wireless transfer system that can transfer at least 360 µWh of energy within six hours through the air and into tissue tissue. After analysis of the influence of the environment on the wave efficiency it is proven that resonant magnetic transfer is the best option for the given scenario. 13.56 MHz is chosen as operating frequency. Energy for the implant is needed at DC level, therefore a rectifier layout is analysed, designed and built out of discrete parts. With the use of discrete components and hand-made inductors, the final operating frequency became 17.50 MHz. The laboratory equipment used restricted the maximum input voltage amplitude to 4.56 V. The final result of this thesis is a prototype wireless energy transfer system that generates a maximum of 75.9 µW of power continuously at a power efficiency of 10.1 percent at a distance of 15 mm.At a distance of 75 mm, the maximum output power was still equal to 2 µW. The power efficiency at 75 mm distance is equal to 0.29 percent, which means that to generate 360 µWh within six hours the input power must be at least 25.9 mW, a value that can easily be reached without causing flicting damage to human tissue or the system itself. This proves that magnetically coupled inductor systems can be used for the future development of autonomous ExG implants.","wireless energy transfer; magnetic field; ExG implants; RFID","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Bioelektronics","",""

The problem of intoxications with children however still exists. The problem lies in the fact that the real reasons of intoxications are not being tackled. Almost every CRC on the market today is a force-based design. Meaning that the force required to open the caps is high, a force so high a child is not able to open the caps. This statement is true, but only for the caps that are sold in the stores. After the first use, the caps are often not placed back with the same amount of force at which the cap was released from the bottle. Then, the child still only needs little force to open the cap and take a sip of the liquid inside the bottle. In other cases, intoxication occurs while the cap is separated from the bottle. In an unguarded moment, the child simply grabs the bottle and the inevitable occurs. Next to the problems of intoxications is the fact that any adults seems to have a bad experience and therefore trouble with opening any CRC. It takes too much force for any healthy adult, let alone people with physical limitations in hand force and dexterity such as people with rheumatism and elderly. The aim for this project has been to create a cap design which could be opened by people with physical limitations, next to still being child-resistant. The new cap design aims to no longer try to solve the problem of intoxications with children by creating a force-based child-resistant packaging, but looking at the problem differently.","child-resistant; caps; rheumatism; elderly; children; intoxications","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

We do this based on a set of photographs of the statue that were taken over the years. We use the SIFT feature detector to find keypoints in the photographs. By matching these keypoints between images we establish image correspondences. An incremental structure from motion approach is then used to create a projective reconstruction of the statue. The projective reconstruction is updated to a metric one by means of auto-calibration. We test our algorithm on three datasets. The first dataset contains several photographs of Prometheus. The second dataset contains the same photographs of Prometheus but with the background removed. The third dataset contains photographs from the preliminary study of the statue, these photographs are taken from around the statue, in the same lighting conditions and have guaranteed overlap. We will show that removing the background from the photographs before running our algorithm improves the reconstruction results. However, a full reconstruction of the statue seems impossible due to the lack of images and different conditions the photographs were taken in. If the conditions in which the photographs were taken in are similar and we have enough photographs, then our algorithm works well as we prove with the reconstruction results from the third dataset.","structure from motion; computer vision; 3d reconstruction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Pattern Recognition and Bioinformatics","","Media and Knowledge Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2015","With the demand for cleaner energy rising in the future, petrochemical companies such as Shell need to stay innovative and competitive in supplying energy resources such as natural gas. Highly sour gas fields, which contain carbon dioxide (CO2) and a large amount of hydrogen sulphide (H2S) alongside the natural gas (CH4), are considered to be highly toxic and corrosive and processing these fields is relatively new for the oil and gas industry. In certain conditions, with sufficient H2S available, elemental sulphur might react from the gaseous H2S and significantly increase the corrosiveness of the solution. These fields are however relatively well available. The pipelines which transport the gas from the wells to a central processing facility are mostly produced from corrosion resistant alloys (CRA’s). Current qualification methods for these pipelines show if the alloy shows localized (i.e. pitting or crevice) corrosion or stress corrosion cracking in the highly sour environment in its lifetime. In order to better understand the corrosion mechanisms of CRA’s in highly sour gas fields with elemental sulphur being present, electrochemical measurements were used to investigate localized corrosion and stress corrosion cracking in the Bab gas field (Abu Dhabi) environment. Several CRA’s were compared to investigate the effect of lower and higher grade CRA’s and electrochemical measurements were combined with SCC testing to investigate a relation between electrochemical measurements and elastic and plastic strain. This work showed the corrosion resistance, as determined by electrochemical measurements, for a range of CRA’s in (highly) sour gas conditions with and without elemental sulphur. It also showed that a form of pitting corrosion was the dominant corrosion mechanism without the influence of stress. Finally, no relation was found between electrochemical measurements and strain; however only before macroscopic cracking was observed.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2025-07-15","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Materials Science and Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Garci?a Gonza?lez, J. (mentor)","2015","This master thesis aims at understanding the impact of wind on day-ahead-market (DAM) electricity prices using an integrated engineering-economic model. A realistic case study has been implemented, which is Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) in Texas, U.S. in the month of August, 2014. To address the main research question of wind ?s influence on the level of DAM prices and its volatility, three main sub-questions to be answered are the followings: What is the connection between the theoretical marginal cost and the real electricity prices? How does changing wind load profiles influence electricity prices estimated in this study? And is there a better way of predicting the electricity prices to handle potential future changes more efficiently? The methodology used for solving these research questions consists of two main parts. First, DAM electricity price forecasting weekday-models are designed through two stages: building a unit commitment (UC) model to find the theoretical marginal cost and constructing an econometric analysis to derive the relationship between this value and the real price. It should be noted that the UC model is built upon the most state-of-art formulation, which does not only overcome several drawbacks of the conventional energy-block UC scheduling but also includes a more realistic modeling of thermal generators, i.e., startups and shutdowns, different types of operating reserves. All models are tested under different time frames, which are created by swapping the order of different weeks in the studied month. Amongst all, the most robust one is selected. After completing task one, the first and third research sub-question could be answered. In the second task of the methodology, different wind loads are fed into the best obtained model from the first task and their impacts on predicted prices are examined to respond to the second research sub- question. Finally, upon completion of the thesis, the main research question will be fully answered. i ? The main conclusions of this master thesis are the followings. First, the hybrid model combining an engineering UC approach and an econometric regression model has been proved to outperform both pure engineering and time series models. Importantly, this hybrid model could be used to predict the future electricity price one day in advance with high accuracy, thus, it could provide a significant contribution to the current electricity price forecasting tools. Second, wind generation generally has a negative impact on both electricity prices level and its deviation, i.e., increased wind generation drops the level and deviation of electricity prices and vice versa. The increased or decreased cost is coming from the changes in operating cost of thermal units, e.g., startups and shutdowns and fuel costs, and thus depends on the generation mix of the system. For instance, the average price deduction in the system with threefold increase of wind generation varies from around 3% to nearly 9% in the system with a fourfold increase of wind output. And the changes in price deviation are explained by an increase or decrease in price gaps between the off-peak and peak periods. The thesis starts with a brief introduction and literature review about impact of wind on electricity prices and price predicting techniques. The mathematical formulation and input data are presented afterwards. Finally, numerical results along with discussions and comparisons are shown at the last chapter of the thesis, followed with the appendix with detailed calculation and model ?s numerical outputs as evidential support.","renewable; wind; econometric; unit commitment; electricity; forecasting; day ahead market; prices","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Economic and Management of Industrial Network","","","",""

(mentor)","2015","Agent based modelling is a relatively new paradigm allowing to model the various components of the complex socio-technical air transportation system as well as the interactions between these components. Because situation awareness plays a key role in agent-based modelling, researchers at NLR had developed approaches in modelling Multi-Agent Situation Awareness (MASA) and MASA differences, including methods for their use in prospective safety risk analysis, i.e. to predict safety risk well ahead of an accident. The aim of the current research was to investigate how the combination of MASA and agent-based modelling can be used for retrospective safety analysis, i.e. to conduct an in-hindsight analysis of an accident occurrence. More specifically, the objective of this research was: To create a structured approach for retrospective modelling and analysis of an air transportation accident through a combined use of Multi-Agent Situation Awareness and agent-based modelling. The research showed that contributing factors to an accident can often be specified as MASA differences. This finding formed the basis for the development of a formal agent based approach to retrospective accident analysis. The working of this formal agent-based retrospective analysis approach has subsequently been demonstrated for three specific accidents from aviation history. Though information gathered from the occurrence database Skybrary, all relevant agents have been identified and their states and perceived states have been modelled at points where MASA differences are likely to occur. Finally the causation and propagation of MASA differences in the agent-based model are analysed. Based on the insights obtained from these analyses, it is concluded that a MASA and agent-based retrospective analysis of accidents yields new insights that are not obtained using a classical retrospective safety analysis.","agent based modelling; situation awareness; accident analysis; aviation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","ATO","","","",""

(mentor); Costa, P. (mentor); Poelma, C. (mentor)","2015","Interaction of particles in a viscous fluid with a wall and with other particles is often observed in phenomena like sedimentation, erosion and filtration processes. With the increasing computational power there is now the possibility of simulating such particle-laden flows from a micro-scale perspective by direct application of no-slip/no-penetration boundary conditions at the particles’ surface. To model the collisions in a particle-laden flow in an realistic manner it is required to understand the dynamics of individual collisions. To investigate the relevant parameters describing particle-wall interactions, experiments of a spherical particle colliding with an oblique wall have been performed in both air and in water. The measurements were carried out with spherical steel and delrin particles with a radius of 4 and 5 millimeter. The particle dynamics has been investigated by video-capturing the particle’s motion (translation and rotation) and the collision with an inclined plate. Upon collision with a wall energy is dissipated due to the inelastic nature of the contact. Furthermore the particle may stick or slip at the surface depending on the tangential force during impact. Three parameters are used to describe the macroscopic behavior of the collision. The normal coefficient of restitution e_n quantifies the dissipated energy. The tangential coefficient of restitution e_t quantifies the change in the tangential velocity at the point of the particle that collides with the wall. Finally the Coulomb coefficient of sliding friction ?_f is a measure how easily the particle sticks to or slips over the collision plate. These three parameters are sufficient to describe the dynamics of a particle-wall collision in air (dry collision). In a viscous fluid (wet collisions) these parameters are subject to change due to lubrication, piezo-viscous and history-forces. Whether the particle bounces in the fluid depends on the impact Stokes number (St = 2/9 *?_s*R*U/? ), the ratio between particle inertia and viscous forces. The three parameters will be determined using Walton’s collision model [Walton, 1993] and are compared to the results found in literature [Gondret et al., 2002; Joseph and Hunt, 2004]. Furthermore, the difference between normal collisions and the normal component of oblique collisions is investigated. The particle’s impact Stokes number, has been plotted against the ratio of the normal wet and normal dry coefficient of restitution and compared to the results found by Joseph et al. [2001] and the empirical fit of Legendre et al. [2006]. In agreement with the results from literature we found that the normal component of oblique collisions equals the the results of normal collisions under similar conditions. The results for oblique particle wall collisions in a viscous fluid presented in this thesis, add to the few data present in literature, by using a different setup. Since the results for both dry and wet collisions are in agreement with the data from literature, this work may be used as validation for the modeling of particle laden flows.","oblique collisions; bouncing; particle-wall interaction; viscous fluid; fluid mechanics; experiments","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","Fluid Mechanics","",""

The proposed methods include the use of supercritical airfoils and the cross sectional area distribution of the aircraft as port of the wave drag estimation. The proposed methods are compared to experimental drag data, available in the literature, of four high-subsonic conventional transport aircraft. An accuracy analysis is performed evaluating how well each method predicts the drag divergence Mach number, the wave drag at Mach number 0.8, and how well the predicted curve fitted with the experimental data. The analysis led to the conclusion that the results of the Delta method shows better agreement with the experimental data than the proposed methods.

(mentor)","2015","Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) is a promising renewable energy technology that has vast potential in the tropics. The technology uses the temperature difference between different ocean layers to run a power cycle. The effects of temperature variations for a fixed design of the thermodynamic cycle is one of the questions that has to be answered for this technology. These effects are here analysed for three different working fluids, pure ammonia, ammonia - water mixture and R32 - R134a mixture. An off design model is implemented in MATLAB to analyse the effects. Experiments were performed with pure ammonia in an OTEC experimental set up to validate the model. The heat exchangers in the thermodynamic cycle are one of the most important components since they are large and costly in comparison to other components because of the small temperature difference in the system. Based on the experiments performed, suitable heat transfer correlations were selected. It is still a question if these correlations are suitable for other working fluids especially mixtures. This has to be confirmed with further experiments. The results of the model suggest that in all cases the net power output and the thermal efficiency are proportional to the temperature difference of the ocean layers. Fluctuations in the warm and cold seawater temperature seem to have similar effect on the outcome. Fluctuation of one degree for a 25 MW plant will result in approximately 10 % fluctuation in the net power output. This is considerable and has to be taken into account in economical evaluations for each suitable location. To minimize negative effects the mass flow of the working fluid can be varied however that will only improve the performance to a small degree.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-07-14","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Mechanical Engineering","","Sustainable Process and Energy Technologies","",""

Taking an existing forecasting model, the present Master’s Thesis is focused on modeling pumped hydroelectricity storage (PHES) resources to the highest possible degree of detail, and their incorporation to the forecasts, allowing to evaluate their capability of providing secondary band to the Spanish electricity system. A number of algorithms have been developed for validation and disaggregation of the provisional program obtained from the previous markets in the Spanish daily sequence, for calculating turbining-pumping cycles, for incorporating additional (forced) PHES resources to Endesa’s supply curve, and for adjusting the offered band among those resources that have been accepted after the market clearing to participate in the secondary reserve provision. Additionally, this Master’s Thesis is committed to the documentation of the model so that future developments may be made taking this work as a reference document. The obtained results were satisfactory, as the main objectives of the thesis have been fulfilled. The results show an increase in the participation of PHES resources compared to the reference model, and very accurate forecasts of the secondary regulation reserves market are reached, as concluded by a thorough validation processes.","Electricity Markets; Secondary regulation; Load-frequency control; Pumped storage; Spanish Electricity System; Endesa; EMIN","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","ICAI School of Engineering (Spain)","","EMIN - Erasmus Mundus Joint Master in Economics and Management of Network Industries","",""

Second, the thesis investigates the properties, geometry and distribution of animal burrows, in order to draw networks for the analyses. Finally, the literature review focuses on possible failure mechanisms caused by animal burrowing and historical cases. The assumed method evaluates first the influence of animal burrows on the water pressures in the embankment during rainfall and a high water tide. The influence of the burrowing is assessed through a transient FEM flow analysis. Starting from the documented entrances situated in the vadose zone, different scenarios for the internal distribution of tunnels and chambers are proposed. The analysis is carried out with the software PLAXIS 2D and 3D. Finally, the most likely failure mechanism and representative network for the stability of the dike is assessed. Indications around the influence of animal burrowing for the safety of a levee are stated and recommendations on their analysis in future cases are presented.","dike failure; Secchia river; animal burrowing; groundwater flow; macro-stability; internal erosion; badger setts; unsaturated zone","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-07-13","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-Engineering","",""

However, most of the proposed solutions do not consider the need for fast (real-time) seizure detection or their energy overheads, resulting in systems not suitable for wearable or implantable applications. This thesis describes the design and implementation of a novel closed-loop system that is capable of real-time seizure detection and suppression, while requiring minimal power and energy consumption. The proposed system utilizes a complex Morlet wavelet in combination with a thresholding mechanism to detect the presence of ictal-activity in ECoG signals. We evaluate our system in terms of detection performance (sensitivity, specificity and delay) considering various filter parameters, such as the filter order and various (static) detection thresholds. Additionally, we consider the system’s suitability for implantable applications by evaluating its computational overheads (execution time, energy consumption) when executed on the SiMS low-power processor. We show that decreasing the filter order results in less accurate detection (sensitivity, specificity), a faster detection (delay), and less overheads. In addition, we show that we may further improve the detection accuracy and delay with minimal overheads by considering an input-dependent (adaptive) threshold mechanism. Furthermore, we show that we can effectively trade-off detection accuracy and energy consumption: For example, shrinking filter order by 70% results in a decrease in detection accuracy of only 1%, while allowing us to obtain an improvement in delay by 190 ms (from 710 ms to 520 ms) and in energy consumption by 70% (from 5.04?J to 1.51?J). Compared to related work, we show that we can detect seizures significantly faster (492 ms, compared to 970 ms) with the same sensitivity (94%) and at a minimal decrease in specificity of 4.6% (93.60% compared to 98.2%). A prototype implementation of the closed-loop system has successfully been applied in in-vivo experiments, demonstrating its potential for epilepsy treatment.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Bioelectronics","","Computer Engineering","",""

ICT, productivity, and capital: Lessons from economic theories and perspectives","Djong, J.","Naastepad, C.W.M. (mentor)","2015","With the advent of smart machines, ICT revolution is moving towards a relatively unknown territory. Economic theories play important role in shaping the direction and effect of this technological change to the lives of everyone. The acceleration of unemployment and dualism which the ICT revolution is expected to create has raised concerns regarding the social benefit of technological progress, and raises the question whether existing theoretical frameworks are adequate to deal with the societal consequences of technological revolution. The objective of this thesis is therefore to explore how and under what conditions technological revolution would create overall societal benefit. This study explores and analyzes five economic perspectives: neoclassical, (Neo)-Schumpeterian, Marxian, (Post)-Keynesian, and Aristotelian economics to understand the impact of technological revolution to productivity growth its economic consequences. Empirical study is also conducted to estimate the impact of ICT revolution from 1970 to 2007 in seven advanced economies: Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Germany, The Netherlands, The U.K., and The U.S. The various economic perspectives explored in this thesis seem to agree that technological revolution could give rise to savings (neoclassical), profits (Schumpeter), or surplus value (Marx). The empirical observation examines the impact of ICT to productivity growth in the seven advanced economies. This gain in productivity gives rise to productivity dividend, either in the form of more goods produced or reduced working hours. The econometric analysis of panel data from EU KLEMS database from 1990 to 2007 suggests that this productivity dividend, if expressed in money terms, is estimated to contribute U.S.$ 5.4 trillion (in 2007 value) as profit before taxes. The empirical result, however, does not satisfactorily answer whether the use of this productivity dividend has led to societal benefit, prompting further theoretical work. The result of further theoretical work on capital allocation suggests that standard economic framework found in the neoclassical theory prescribed capital allocation to maximize financial returns due to its tendency to focus social benefit solely on the basis of material gains. Schumpeterian perspective which encourages entrepreneurship also tends to emphasize on the accumulation of material wealth by the entrepreneurs. On the other hand, perspectives from Marx, Keynes, and Aristotelian economics adduce to the notion of social benefit by incorporating people’s immaterial needs. Importantly, the assertion that human’s material needs are limited makes possible the existence of freed capital – the capital arising from that is no longer needed to finance human beings’ material needs. This thesis argues that freed capital has its very origin in the human capacity, following Wilken (1992). The counterpart of this freed capital is proposed to be the immaterial needs of human beings, which include the need to develop human capacity. For the next step, it is recommended to dissect further the ethical foundations of these economic theories to strengthen the case for capital allocation that they prescribe.","ICT; productivity; economics theory; capital; growth; technological revolution; social benefit","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Economics of innovation","","","",""

The other limitation is caused by the colliding of instrument shafts when multiple shafts are inserted in the surgical corridor, reducing the instrument maneuverability. A Multi-Branched instrument could overcome these problems i.e. an instrument with a single steerable shaft that is inserted through the surgical corridor that at the distal end divides into multiple tool branches that are all steerable. In this research a first step was made to develop a suitable control strategy to operate such an instrument, using a new method for performance testing. Methods: Two interfaces were proposed: A sequential interface that allows the control of a single instrument at a time for each hand, and a simultaneous interface that allows the control of two instruments in parallel for each hand. The simultaneous interface was expected to result in quicker performance. To evaluate their performance, the interfaces were prototyped and connected to a simulation environment containing a virtual Multi-Branched instrument. Results: The sequential interface resulted in around 10% quicker performance than the simultaneous interface. The used methodology to test the control strategies has proven to be successful and enabled further research with relatively low effort to experiment with other instrument configurations and control concepts.","Robotic Surgery Endonasal Neurosurgery Keyhole Laprascopic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-07-13","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","Bioinspired Technology","",""

(mentor)","2015","Panel codes are used by the Maritime Reseach Institute Natherlands (MARIN) to compute flows around ships and propellers. These codes are based on Boundary Element Methods (BEM). A known drawback of BEM is that it forms dense linear system of equations that have to be solved. By improving the efficiency of the dense linear solver, the computational time required by panel codes can be significantly reduced. Since applications of panel codes in MARIN include automatic optimization, where a large number of hull forms or propeller geometries have to be evaluated, the reduction of computational time is important. Four strategies were explored to improve the performance of the dense linear solver. First, to replace the current GMRES solver with IDR(s). Second, the updating of a fixed size block Jacobi preconditioner into a variable size block Jacobi preconditioner. Third, to use a hierarchical matrix-vector multiplication in the solver instead of dense matrix-vector multiplication. Lastly, to replace the block Jacobi preconditioner with a hierarchical-LU preconditioner. Out of the four strategies, the use of hierarchical-LU preconditioner was found to speed up the dense linear solver substantially, especially for large systems. The use of IDR(s) instead of GMRES is also recommended as it removes the problems introduced by the need to restart.

(mentor); Hoogenboom, P.C.J. (mentor); Kolstein, M.H. (mentor)","2015","Bascule bridges can be designed with two operating mechanisms in order to open and close the bridge. Due to certain effects a difference in force per mechanism can occur. Therefore the Dutch standard for movable bridge, the VOBB, states to use a force distribution of 1/3 - 2/3 between the mechanisms. This means that both the mechanisms are designed on 2/3 of the total operating force. This force distribution is questioned for a new bridge to be constructed in The Netherlands. But also for other bridges this distribution has more often raised questions. An analysis should show if the force distribution holds ground of how it is currently stated in the Dutch standard. There are several effects that might have an influence on the force distribution, e.g. temperature, offsets, wind etc. These effects are analysed in this thesis to examine the influence on the force distribution. However, these effects can barely be controlled, but aspects of the structural design also have an influence. These are analysed to see the impact on the force distribution and how these aspects can be taken into account to optimise design in the future.","bascule; bridge; operating; mechanism; movable; force distribution; VOBB; panama crank mechanism; panamawheel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural Mechanics","",""

(mentor); Schorsch, J.F. (mentor)","2015","Robotic lifting aids aim to reduce the forces on the operator, but may thereby also change the experienced dynamics of the lifted object. In the case of weight compensation, the experienced ratio between object's weight and inertia is altered, exposing the operator to dynamics different from those experienced in daily life. This may affect execution of fast goal-directed movements, especially during first exposure to the altered dynamics. We hypothesize that the inertia, used in the internal model in the open-loop phase of the movement, must be estimated before movement onset and can be based on the object's weight. In an experimental study, subjects (n=18) performed fast vertical lifting movements of virtual objects of different inertia and weight in normal gravity (baseline experiment) and under weight compensation. In the catch trial experiment, the weight was kept constant and in catch trials weight compensation was applied, resulting in an unexpectedly increased inertia. We then fitted a simple open-loop model, based on minimum jerk trajectories, to best match the generated forces for the first $75ms$ of each trial, by varying one parameter: the modelled inertia, i.e. the inertia estimated a priori by the subject. The trajectories in the baseline experiment are minimum jerk like and are independent of inertia, which can only be due to properly applied force profiles. The minimum jerk related force profiles increased with increasing inertia and contained a static force equal to weight. In the catch trial experiment, the force profiles for the weight compensation condition were similar to those in the normal gravity condition up to approximately 80ms. After that, the force profiles of the catch trials deviated from the normal force profile and the movement in the catch trials was characterised by skewed velocity profiles and consistent overshoots. The Variance Accounted For, a measure for goodness of fit, for all conditions in both experiments were high (with the median around 95%), implying the model fitting procedure captured the essential open-loop movement behaviour. Weight and modelled inertia were linearly related in the baseline experiment, as was hypothesized, yet a positive offset was found for small inertias. In the catch trials, the modelled inertias were higher than expected purely based on weight information, but remained closely related to inertia as in normal gravity. We conclude that a priori inertia estimation, used in the open-loop phase of fast lifting movements, strongly depends on weight information and the known weight/inertia ratio. This insight can help in designing the control for lifting aids to support the operator more naturally.","inertia estimation; open-loop control; weight compensation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomechanical design","","Haptic interfaces","",""

Although (clothing) consumption plays an essential role in society and therefore could not be eliminated, an improvement could be made by: Preventing people from buying items they will not wear. Preventing the industry from producing clothes their consumers will not buy. THE CONCEPT ‘Hooked’ is a product-service system existing of a keychain and an app. The keychain is linked to the app, and automatically imports new purchases into its wardrobe section. Through the app, the service enables online wardrobe organization; optimized through exercises that help the user to define her personal style and organize her wardrobe. Besides, these exercises provide the user with styling advice and offers new tools for wardrobe organization TWO MAIN GOALS Refective purchase behaviour (1) Through the exercises ‘Hooked’ triggers the consumer to reflect on her (future) wardrobe, her personal style and inspires for new strategies of clothes selection. The consumer is motivated to think beyond short-lived, trend-based clothing. A more sustainable fashion industry (2) 30% of the clothes that are produced are never sold, nor worn (Matevosyan, 2014). This is caused by the industry not knowing her consumers and their preferences. As the keychain links the consumer’s identity to the system, the participating retailers get to know who buys what. The styling exercises gather data regarding personal style preferences, the consumers’ body types and the way they compose their outfits. Therefore, participating retailers receive an extensive set of consumer insights enabling them to optimize their production in order to (1) save money and (2) environmental and human resources.","consumption behaviour; sustainability; circular economy; fashion consumption; fast fashion industry; ViP; dilemma-driven design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design for Interaction","","","",""

The evolutionary history of species can be represented in a phylogenetic tree. For a given set of smaller phylogenetic trees a bigger supertree can be constructed. There are several algorithms that try to find a solution to construct a supertree that represents the given set of trees the best. However, in some cases there are non-treelike evolutionary histories. These evolutionary histories have to be presented in a phylogenetic network. Constructing a supernetwork from smaller phylogenetic networks is a new field of research. Up to now most research has focused on tree-like networks, but recently a new algorithm was proposed to decide if there exists a supernetwork that contains all given binets (a type off small networks), and construct the supernetwork if so. In this thesis this algorithm will be analyzed. Subsequently a new algorithm will be presented to construct a supernetwork from a given set of binets even if there exists no supernetwork that contains all given binets. To get some ideas and inspiration about constructing supernetworks, algorithms to construct supertrees are analyzed first. In addition it will be proved that there always exists a supernetwork that contains at least one third of the given binets.","Supernetwork; Supertree; Binet; MinCutSupertree; ModifiedMinCut; Build; BuildNW; phylogenetic network; Max Cut triplets","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied mathematics","","Optimalisatie","",""

(mentor); Verbeek, R.J.D. (mentor)","2015","Transatlantic flight operations are, due to the absence of radar-based surveillance, the influence of the polar jet stream and the highly directional traffic peaks, significantly different compared to continental flight operations. To safely accommodate all transatlantic traffic in the North Atlantic oceanic airspace the Organized Track System (OTS) has been established, existing of a number of pre-determined flight routes. Currently, about half of all transatlantic traffic uses the OTS which is created twice a day, once to accommodate the westbound traffic and once to accommodate the eastbound traffic flow. All aircraft requesting to use the OTS send an oceanic clearance request to the oceanic planning controller, containing the estimated time of arrival at the track entry boundary, the preferred OTS track, flight level and Mach number. The aircraft are cleared onto the OTS using a first-come, first-served (FCFS) approach, taking the separation requirements with already cleared aircraft into account. If an oceanic clearance request cannot be granted due to a potential loss of separation, the requesting aircraft will receive an alternative clearance. The research objectives of this thesis assignment are to: “Reduce the total direct operating cost of transatlantic air traffic by optimizing the OTS track allocation procedure using a real-time meta-heuristic scheduling algorithm” “Create a model capable of optimizing the OTS track allocation procedure for different cost-index values” This research aims at improving the current OTS track allocation procedure by changing the first-come, first-served approach, currently used, to a scheduling concept in which the total direct operating cost (DOC) is minimized for a large number of aircraft in a single optimization window. The use of a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm is proposed in this thesis project and the potential of using stochastic optimization for large scheduling problems is researched. The direct operating cost penalties for the possible alternative clearances is determined using fuel consumption models in combination with time cost models. The created population algorithm is tested for multiple cost-index values, using real life problems, and the results are compared to the existing OTS track allocation procedure. The generated results show a potential direct operating cost reduction as well as the possibility to use the created track allocation algorithm as a real-time decision support tool for the oceanic planning controller.","Transatlantic Flight Operations; genetic algorithm; aircraft scheduling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-07-10","Aerospace Engineering","Control and Simulation","","Air Tranport and Operations","",""

(mentor); Van Oel, C.J. (mentor)","2015","Because of the lack of research about the social aspects that affect the performance in the construction industry (CI) and given the importance of these processes to team collaboration and outcomes, this Master thesis aims to contribute to the body of knowledge about the social aspects in these processes. This gave rise to the following research question: What is the perceived influence of social aspects on team performance in housing association renovation projects (HARPs) and how can those aspects be explored? The perceived influence of social aspects on team performance has been explored by means of a literature review and three interviews with experts. To explore those concepts in teams a survey has been developed. The steps taken to make conclusions and produce the survey are as follows. First an extensive literature study was conducted to get an understanding of the social aspects that affect performance, from which a long list of concepts was produced. This literature study has been used to identify concepts for integration in the questionnaire. Where possible, existing scales or questionnaires were considered for translation and inclusion after which a shortlist has been developed of selected concepts. The identified concepts have been evaluated using results from expert interviews. Three interviews have been held with project managers from the field two senior project managers of housing associations and one senior project manager of a construction company. All three have experience in traditional construction projects and have recently undertaken projects which employ strategic partnering. Each manager was asked to extensively describe the last project he has worked on. Subsequently there were open questions concerning: a) Characteristics of strategic partnering and characteristics of traditional construction. b) The psychological concepts identified in the literature study. c) Any behavior or tool that might influence performance. d) What influences creativity in a project team. e) Their thoughts on performance in HARPs. The steps undertaken during the reseach are illustrated in figure 1. A survey has been developed based on the social aspects that seemed to be important according to the project managers along with the results from the literature study. The survey was spread among two project teams of finalized projects for feedback about the content of the survey and whether or not the questions were understandable. ? From the literature study and the interviews it can be concluded that social aspects influences project performance both directly and indirectly. These results are confirmed by three senior project managers of HARPs who have employed the techniques of strategic partnerships successfully. They state that a higher level of psychological safety, a larger empowerment of employees and more trust between and within organizations leads to a continuous team learning process and higher performance of HARPs. However, until now there is not a tool that allow teams to analyze which behaviors, team compositions and decisions lead to a team where innovation is stimulated, common goals are pursued, and the will to make processes and products better time and time again. The social aspects can be further explored by means of a survey. This survey contains the concepts that are seen as most influential on team performance by literature and three project managers from the field. It can be used to analyses for training purposes by consultancy companies like Noorderberg & Partners (N&P), or for academicals purposes by testing several hypotheses. Underneath you can find three recommended hypotheses to explore in further research based upon themes, which the senior project managers intuitively act upon based on experience or themes they disagree on. i. Hypothesis 1: Team member’s autonomy (the level of empowerment) is positively associated with performance in HARPs with project complexity as a mediator. ii. Hypothesis 2: Team psychological safety is positively associated with team learning behavior in HARPs. iii. Hypothesis 3: The size of a team matters less for the performance than the completeness of the team disciplines versus the amount of work to be done. ?","psychological features; psychological safety; team learning behavior; supply chain collaboration; housing associations; renovation projects; survey; multidisciplinary teams; construction industry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Real Estate & Housing","","Design and construction management","",""

(mentor)","2015","Next to the innovation of products, the innovation of production processes requires attention in order to enhance the competitiveness in shipbuilding. Production improvements are currently of great importance for increasing the efficiency of shipbuilding, which can result in lower cost and reduced lead times. Wei (2012) suggests that the outfitting work can be done more efficiently by completing outfitting earlier and that strict milestones of the production are constraints for pre-outfitting. Several studies that tried to calculate cost factors at different outfitting stages suggest that outfitting at later stage involves more cost (e.g. Fafandjel, Rubesa, & Mrakovcic, 2008). As modular outfitting is considered as an optimization of the outfitting process, increasing the portion of modular outfitting can be used to increase efficiency and reduce overall cost according to Fafandjel et al. Modularization decreases the number of items on a Bill of Materials (BOM) by making pre-assembled items. Less items on a BOM can result in fewer suppliers, which lowers the transaction risk and costs while increases responsiveness (Meysen et al, 2009). There are prior studies about modularization in shipbuilding but there is no emphasis on the Lean Manufacturing aspect of modularization. Lean Manufacturing is a method to reduce waste in manufacturing with a systematic approach. Furthermore, there is no general guideline for the shipbuilding industry to estimate the possible labour savings by making modules for outfitting. A possible guideline can provide a strategic approach when choosing a system to outsource as a module for outfitting. This case study analyses several Lean Manufacturing effects of reducing the items on the BOM for outfitting using data of Royal IHC, a Dutch shipbuilding company. These effects give an insight on the benefits of modularization with a Lean Manufacturing perspective. The goal is to increase the pre-outfitting percentage by identifying (possible) wastes and to facilitate modularization in shipbuilding using relevant literature. The Theory of Constraints (TOC) is used to generate possible modules effectively. The movement time, movement distance, storage area, storage time and the transactions for the generated seven cases are analysed. The current situation and the modularized situation are compared to show the result in three parts of the outfitting BOM: foundation, equipment and piping. The seven cases save around 130 hours of labour and 13 km. of movement distance of the items on the BOM. This is a reduction of 0.24% labour hours at the pre-outfitting and 0.64% at the outfitting on board. This is a minor improvement, because small systems are analysed to have sufficient amount of cases taking the validity of the generated guideline into account. No significant change in storage area on the shipyard is found, but modularization increases ground storage and decreases shelve storage. Floor space of 26 m2 is saved inside the ship. Assuming a safety margin of three days for the modules, the average storage time reduction is 40 days. To express the concern of the storage time, the value of the items are also taken into account. Two cases have relatively long storage time and/or high value compared to the assumed three day storage situation. The amount of items on the outfitting BOM is reduced on average 78%. The supplier transactions are reduced from six to one for two cases and four to one for the other five cases, assuming that the piping subcontractor is the module supplier. A correlation between the saved times for foundation, equipment and piping is determined. It is found that early finish of section erections do not have the same impact on an early start of the following section erection. The effect of modularization with respect to transaction cost, supply risk, supplier responsiveness and supplier innovation are discussed to show the implementation and implications. It can be concluded that the reduction of movements leads to less confrontation and interruption of employees working on the shipyard and increases the overall pre-outfitting percentage compared to all outfitting activities. Accessibility inside the ship is increased by making modules. The necessity of applying Just in Time principle to reduce waste in form of Work In Progress inventory becomes more perceptible when taking the storage time and the value of the items into account. Less items on the outfitting BOM reduces the complexity in dependencies and resources and can decrease the probability of waste especially towards the end of outfitting where delays are found. A guideline for a strategic approach to generate modules in the future is generated by finding a correlation between the saved labour times. However, more case analyses can increase the reliability and make different correlations for various classifications. More aggressive estimations using lower bounds rather than averages of task durations at the start of outfitting can compensate the increasing delays to the end. Better work distribution and agreements with the customer can be made at the design phase by identifying possible additional delays. These delays can also be mitigated by lowering the utilization of resources to create a bigger capacity buffer to handle variation and unplanned usage. Not only the external suppliers, but also the internal suppliers on the shipyard is reduced allowing a better manageable Just in Time principle. Defect possibility is mitigated by testing before supply if possible. These effects of modularization in this case study show the waste reduction that directly or indirectly facilitates a higher pre-outfitting percentage. Implications and implementation aspects due to supplier reduction are presented using relevant literatures. So, reducing supply base by modularization can lead to significant advantages unless the complexity and the behaviour of the current situation for Royal IHC is understood well. The design-manufacturing integration and the information technology-concurrent engineering interaction are the key factors for an efficient implementation of modularization. Royal IHC is already implementing modularization, but these aspects can make the current situation more effective. Even though there are significant improvements in this case study, modularization in shipbuilding is not yet institutionalized (Doerry N. H., 2014). Efforts and more research to modularization possibilities in the shipbuilding like this case study will contribute to the institutionalizing. This research contributes theoretical and practical to the valuing of modularity with a Lean Manufacturing perspective by conducting a case study at one of the leading shipbuilding companies. The cost impact of the analysed cases is worth a further research to contribute to the valuing.","Lean Manufacturing; Outfitting; Royal IHC; Supply base; Modularization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-06-28","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine & Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

(mentor); Jongstra, J. (mentor); Curran, R. (mentor)","2015","The primary objective of a defense aviation operator or air force, is to maximize its continued readiness to successfully perform military flight operations, whenever and wherever the home state or international community calls for it. In order to maintain a satisfactory level of operational readiness, air forces need to ensure that sufficient aircraft are mission capable and continue in this state for an adequate period of time. Furthermore, a specified amount of training hours need to be produced to keep all aircrew in mission capable condition. These requirements must be fulfilled at all time, which requires an involved planning process. Since aircraft are subject to stringent safety requirements, preventive maintenance must be performed at prescribed flight time intervals, which causes downtime and affects operational readiness. As a result, all preventive maintenance efforts as well as the flight assignments should be planned and scheduled adequately for the entire aircraft fleet. This process called ‘flight and maintenance planning’ (FMP) is highly complex and time consuming due to numerous constraints. Furthermore, deviations from the schedule are inevitable due to various uncertainties. Hence, the scheduling process should be responsive, flexible and fast. However, in practice, aircraft utilization tends to be managed manually and on a day-to-day basis, leading to a reactive and overly time-consuming approach, in which problems with respect to operational readiness and controllability can easily develop. Besides, long-term utilization of (preventive maintenance governed) aircraft components is uncontrolled, which results in fluctuating demand for resources and may affect readiness on the aircraft level. To solve these shortcomings, this research introduces two interconnected novel mathematical optimization methods for flight and maintenance planning on both aircraft and component level. The developed methods take into account all relevant requirements and constraints from industry practice and address all aspects of operational readiness, aiming for a pro-active, efficient and more robust scheduling effort. Both models are implemented for real historical problem instances drawn from the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) CH-47D Chinook transport helicopter fleet. Subsequently, the generated outputs are compared with the actual output of the RNLAF for the exact same problem instances as a means of validation and demonstration of the model’s performance. The aircraft FMP model results demonstrate that fleet operational readiness can be increased by up to 22% for the subject years, while using the same organizational resources, and fulfilling the same operational requirements. Furthermore, the model supports in rapid generation of feasible long-term flight and maintenance plans, which strongly improves flexibility, anticipation and control. The results of the component FMP model demonstrate that proactive scheduling of substitutions between aircraft and spare inventory, can be utilized towards increased overall component serviceability. This reduces the variability on demand for preventive maintenance, which leads to budgetary and logistical benefits. The developed methods provide a comprehensive and versatile FMP solution for defense aviation operators and provide a strong foundation for development of more complex or comprehensive FMP models.","defense; scheduling; readiness; optimization; linear programming; aircraft; component; fleet; sustainability; serviceability; availability; military; air force; Royal Netherlands Air Force; aviation; maintenance; phase maintenance; preventive maintenance; planning; operations research","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2035-07-10","Aerospace Engineering","Control and Operations","","Air Transport and Aerospace Operations (ATO)","",""

In the linear economy, or a ‘take-make-dispose’ consumption pattern there is no attention for the rest value of products. The circular economy and bio-based economy introduce that loop-back for materials at the end of their lifetime. This research is about the application of bio-based building materials in railway canopies. Problem definition Bio-based building materials are competing with the fossil- and mineral-based building materials. With the growing consumption of materials and the fact of limited availability of some materials the demand for bio-based materials is growing. But which materials (bio-based materials domain) are available and how do regulations allow the use of this materials (design domain)? Research In this research is investigated what bio-based materials are and how they could be applicated in the railway sector. In the case study is focused is on the design of a railway canopy for railway station Ede-Wageningen. The three main steps taken in the process are: (1) In the literature study the boundary conditions of the bio-based materials, bio-based economy and design rules of ProRail (Dutch railinfrastructure management organisation) are taken to define the domains. A material selection strategy is described to use these boundary condition in material selection. (2) The case is analysed and three railway canopy concepts are designed. One concept is worked out in a parametric model to make also the material selection a parameter in the design. (3) Materials are selected with the material selection strategy and the design is optimized. The consequences of the chosen materials for this design are worked out and a compared with other structural materials. Conclusions (1) Bio-based are these materials that have a renewable origin, that are not faster consumed then produced and that are taken from properly managed agriculture or forests. (2) Design rules of ProRail are currently limiting the use of bio-based materials in railway canopies. (3) The application of bio-based materials in railway canopies is possible. (4) Timber is the only bio-based materials that can be applied without strange safety factors. (5) Conservation of almost all bio-based materials is necessary but depends on climate conditions. (6) To achieve a life time of more than 20 years thorough life prolonging maintenance can be necessary. (7) Because of the CO2 consumption of crops and wood, the relative CO2 consumption of a building can be reduced by using bio-based materials.

Social innovations come in various forms such as (1) doing something good in/for society; (2) changing social practices and/or structure, (3) contribute to urban and community development and (4) re-organize work processes. In an aging world where life expectancy is steadily increasing and there is decline in the number of children and in total fertility the consequences for the healthcare system and the elder population are significant; therefore, social innovations are needed (in the form of changed social practices) aiming to reduce healthcare costs and improve the life quality of those aging. Smart Homes / Smart Living serve goals of wellbeing of the residents of the home and eldercare among others. Thus, the realization of these goals could be considered as a potential social innovation for eldercare in specific. However, these products and services in this domain are generally unknown by the general public – so potential consumers lack of awareness of the potential benefits that smart home products can help them realize. Thus, a social innovation is proposed in the context of health and wellbeing through the design of a smart living multi-sided digital platform. This platform is a mean to improve the lives of citizens in the context of health and wellbeing, especially for those aging through information access, information exchange around Smart Living products/services, interaction with the relatives/community/neighborhood as well as with caretakers. The focus of a solution in this work is on the group of end-users of elders and voluntary caretakers. From previous research foundational requirements were identified for the platform: 1) an online community for contact, solutions, social wellbeing, interaction with the neighborhood and a digital marketplace for applications; 2) an information exchange platform, between providers and end-users (business to consumer), 3) a portal for bundled, services and solutions (business to consumer) and 4) an intervention instrument for the municipality (government to consumer). Through two workshops and considerable work within the project team 9 requirements and 3 critical issues were identified. The requirements derived were built into a prototype (mockup) which was also built into a clickable model for its evaluation through usability testing with potential end-users. 100% of the participants agreed that they would use or recommend the platform if available and 4 out of 6 participants rated 4 or 5 in a scale of 1 to 5 the user experience of the artifact. Some issues regarding the navigation in two functionalities were pointed for improvement. There was learning of few important points in this design stage: (1) to collect requirements for the artifact and prioritize the critical design issues is key. (2) involve the end-user in the design process to validate and evaluate the artifact from the very beginning is a critical for acceptance (of the prototype), which is pre-condition for acceptance of the final artifact and (3) using familiar patterns when designing a prototype help potential users to feel more acquainted with the artifact. Building on the main outcomes of the design of the artifact section, a survey was prepared to further evaluate the design made- it was sent to 401 voluntary caretakers in the South-Holland province of the Netherlands with a response rate of 38% with an average age of 71 years – thus being a key target group of end users. A total of 7 questions were analyzed trying to understand the potential impact of the platform as well as to see who could potentially benefit among several stakeholders. In terms of who would benefit with the platform, the results suggest that Voluntary caretakers, Volunteers, People with physical disabilities and the Municipality would strongly benefit from the platform. Whereas Product providers, General Citizens, Service providers, People with mental disabilities, Young elderly (55 - 75 years old) and Elderly (75+) would somehow benefit from the platform. Two questions in the survey were asked to explore a set of features that could help validate certain design options that were considered to be important by the design team. With the new requirements derived and results of the usability test the following mockup was constructed as an updated version that emerged from the previous one. In the survey the first mockup was shown to the voluntary caretakers and then they were asked the question ‘the platform would help me with?’. A total of 14 potential benefits (capabilities) were presented to the respondents to be scored from 1 to 7 in terms of much the platform could help. After a dimension reduction using a statistical method (Principal Components Analysis), according to the caretakers’ answers, the artifact’s main impact is on two capabilities namely (1) socially inclusive active aging and (2) independent and comfortable aging in place. Based on the findings and the knowledge drawn from the entire process the suggested main outcome is the following set of principles/steps for starting –up the design of digital platforms for social innovation: Stating the problem in terms of a capabilities gap Tapping on / setting-up a living lab Involve the end user at every single stage of the process Elicit requirements and prioritize critical design issues throughout Use familiar patterns in the design of the artifact's interface Evaluate the artifact through usability testing Evaluate the artifact through its capabilities","smart living; healthcare; wellbeing; action design research","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering Systems and Services","","ICT","",""

The costs for fixing errors increase exponentially in each subsequent phase of product development. About 40% of the errors found, come from design requirements. Therefore it is essential to establish the main design requirements right at the start of product development. EDS-castings is a company that (re)designs castings for industrial manufacturers.

The main benefit of the PAD is that it is able to both elicit and store design requirements needed for the redesign of cast parts. Instead of being a specialized tool that elicits specific design requirements, it is able to elicit the full range of possible design requirements. This is needed because EDS-projects are diverse and contain a multitude of vital design requirements. The PAD not only provides a complete analysis phase for the (re)design of parts but is also able to generate plausible cast products through it.

The creation and exploration of virtual worlds can be very helpful for this purpose. However, current techniques are not able to generate sound complex natural environments from ecological data for the use of interactive web-based visualizations. In this thesis, we approach the challenge of developing and interactively visualizing in real time ecologically accurate and visually convincing models of complex natural environments over the web. For this, we propose a framework that (i) is able to combine landscape maps and ecological statistical data, translating them to an ecologically sound plant distribution, and (ii) creates a detailed 3D representation of the natural environment and provides for its fully interactive visualization in real-time over the web. The main contributions of this research are a procedural method to generate complete and sound natural environments and a web-based renderer that is able to real-time visualize complex natural environments with their high density and variability of individual organisms. The vegetation model combines and improves techniques from procedural ecosystem generation and neutral landscape modeling. It is able to generate diverse ecological sound plant distribution directly from landscape maps with statistics about coverage and patchiness of plant species. The visualization model uses several existing level-of-detail and illumination techniques to achieve interactive frame rates and improve realism. Validation of the results with ecology experts led us to conclude that our framework provides convincing interactive visualizations of large virtual natural environments.","procedural generation; WebGL; natural environments; interactive visualizations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Graphics and Visualization","","Computer Science","",""

The project is in collaboration with e-Traction, an electric vehicle systems designer. A 3D numerical model of the machine is designed using the Finite Element Method (FEM) with heat transfer coefficients obtained from a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. A closer look at the secondary flow with vortices in curved tubes is also presented as part of the pursuit to estimate boundary conditions required for the FEM model. The equivalent thermal conductivity of the slot region was estimated by a 2D FEM model and the external heat transfer coefficients were represented using empirical relations. The model was validated with experimental tests performed at the e-Traction's test bench facility and was found to be sufficiently accurate to predict the influence of material and mechanical design changes on the heat transfer. Results show that by using certain potting materials and making slight changes in the cooling region, hotspot temperatures can be significantly reduced.","PMSM; FEM; CFD; Heat Transfer machines; Dean Vortices; Potting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","DC Systems , Energy Conversions and Storage","","","",""

(mentor)","2015","Crane companies face difficulties when installing blades of wind turbines: the tall cranes required for installation have large sail areas and are unable to lift 80% of the time due to too high wind speeds. Also load control by men from the ground is limited in high winds. To design a new installation method, enabling more lifting days per year without sacrificing safety, wind research is executed. Height and gust correction factors as well as wind distribution functions are analyzed to compare the existing with the newly developed method. After a concept phase, a multi-criteria analysis shows that a fixed blade manipulator is the most favorable concept installation method. A manipulator connected to the tip of the crane grabs the blade around its center of gravity. By erecting the crane, the blade is lifted to the hub from a 6 o’clock direction. This manipulator needs to be designed. After a degrees of freedom analysis, the program of requirements shows that the manipulator requires 4 degrees of freedom: three rotations and one translation. Because each degree influences the next, the optimal order of degrees is derived. For each degree, the best combination of mechanism and drive system is selected. The largest surface of the blade is pointed towards the crane to optimize the crane’s strength. The functional design of the manipulator is transferred into a structural design by dimensioning the components and a 3D CAD model is created. Calculation shows that the bending moment around the crane base by wind from the side is 33% less when the manipulator is used; resulting in 43% more lifting days with equal bending moments.","wind turbine; crane; blade installation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

(mentor)","2015","“[Strain-hardening cementitious composites (SHCC)] are a new class of [fiber reinforced cementitious] composites characterized by a strain-hardening behavior in tension after first cracking accompanied by multiple cracking up to relatively high strain levels.” In order to contribute to the transition of common relatively thin SHCC elements for lab experiments into applications of large SHCC elements in practice, knowledge and understanding of the mechanical performance of SHCC when upscaling the element size is needed. When varying the element size for materials a differentiation in the nominal strength may be observed. This phenomena is called the size-effect. For concrete many sources of size-effect have been identified and investigated. These include the Wall effect, diffusion processes, hydration heat, statistical inhomogeneities, linear elastic fracture mechanics, and fractal nature of the crack surface. Even though SHCC shares many similarities with ordinary concrete it also has key differences which could lead to other behavior during upscaling of the element size. No inclusion of coarse aggregates, possible dependency on fiber properties, dispersion and orientation, and a ductile nature of failure. In this thesis first it was investigated whether there is a general size-effect for SHCC. The adjective ‘general’ is used because it includes multiple sources of size-effect. Aside of size-effect the strain capacity was also considered, since this is one of the main advantages of using SHCC. To do this a specimen of 120*30*10 mm3 was compared with a specimen of 360*90*30 mm3 in a 4-point bending test (4-PBT). The nominal strength and fictitious strain capacity dropped from respectively 13.3±1.5 MPa to 8.4±0.4 MPa and 8.9±1.6 , to 4.9±2.1  due to the upscaling. The fictitious strain is a strain calculated based on the deflection of the specimen and linear elasticity. There are many sources of size-effect and it has been decided to investigate the effect of fiber effectivity and fracture mechanics based size-effect. Since fibers play an important role of the behavior of SHCC and fracture based size-effect is a main contributor of size-effect in ordinary concrete. Aside from the findings above there are strong suggestions that increase of the loading (displacement) rate will decrease the nominal strength and strain capacity significantly. Comparison of these two parameters found in literature with different loading rates is not advised. Furthermore a protocol has been developed to characterize the crack width distribution of the cracked SHCC specimen in future research. Fiber effectivity introduced size-effect concerns the dispersion and orientation of the fibers which play a pivotal role in the behavior of SHCC. It is suspected that the commonly used relatively thin SHCC elements for lab experiments might alter the fiber orientation favorably and overestimates the nominal strength and strain capacity compared to thicker elements. To investigate this a SHCC cube of 150*150*150 mm3 was produced where after three differently orientated specimens of 120*30*10 mm3 were sawn out. The nominal strength and strain capacity of these specimen were obtained with a 4-PBT and compared to the values of thin casted specimen of 120*30*10 mm3. To verify whether there is a alterations in fiber orientation by the specimen preparation and to investigate fiber effectivity sections with a thickness of approximately 40 microns were analyzed. It has been verified that fiber orientation has been altered for the specimen sawn from the cube, and that the nominal strength and strain capacity decreased compared with the thin casted elements. Within the three differently orientated specimen one type showed brittle failure opposed to strain-hardening. This type of specimen was vertically orientated in the cube, and surprisingly had comparable fiber effectivity with the other two types of orientated specimen. It was concluded that margin of error in the parameters that describe fiber effectivity is the most important. When a high margin of error is found a higher probability of weak planes in the specimen is present. If a crack initiates at such a plane then brittle failure will occur since the specimens were primarily reinforced with fibers. It is recommended to use steel bars as primarily reinforcement for safety and the fibers for the multiple fine cracks, and to develop a placement method that reduces the margin of error of the fiber effectivity parameters. Fracture mechanics based size-effect is explained by the science of fracture mechanics. For quasi-brittle materials like concrete, increasing the specimen size will shift the material in the linear elastic fracture mechanics zone in the generalized size-effect law, where the nominal strength drops significantly. One study revealed that there is no size-effect in SHCC if there is adequate strain-hardening. However size-effect concerns only the nominal strength, but in SHCC the strain capacity is an more important parameter. Therefor in this thesis, aside from the size-effect, also the effect of upscaling the element size on strain capacity was investigated. This was done by investigating differently sized specimen with , fixed thickness and a fixed specimen height and span ratio. Specimen with spans of 175, 350, 700, and 2100 mm were investigated. It has been found that only the specimen with a span of 2100 mm had a significant drop in nominal strength. This could be explained by an inadequate strain-hardening ability of the used mix design. Furthermore the strain capacity did gradually decrease for each size. This raises major concern since strain capacity is a main advantage of SHCC. A theoretical model has been developed to explain these findings. This model is based on the strength of the material along the crack. Where the strength in the crack tip decreases when it approaches the crack opening where the strain is higher. It was assumed that the crack width increases with element size. With digital image correlation (DIC) technique the crack width has been determined along the height of the localized macro cracks for limited one specimen per span length. The results were corresponding to the assumption with the exception of the specimen with span 700 mm. This might be due to the acquisition of the data, where the cracked side surface was investigated. There is indication that at this specimen of 700 mm a relatively stronger variance in the distribution of the crack width along the specimen thickness was present.","SHCC; size-effect; upscaling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-07-09","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Materials & Environment","",""

Because of limited battery capacity, low-power design is required for smart sensors. Low-voltage operation is a key leverage to reduce power consumption in smart sensors. However, uncertainties due to process, voltage and temperature variations or random fluctuations gain in relevance when operating in the near-threshold range. Hence, monitoring of the actual silicon behavior is crucial to lowering supply voltage while preserving reliable operation. An interrupt-based in-situ monitoring approach is proposed in this thesis. This approach uses an interrupt service routine to stimulate the critical paths on the chip. By monitoring the timing of the exercised paths, a warning signal is generated to steer the control of reliable supply voltage levels. This approach is developed, validated and applied on an ARM-based processor. Finally, a 10 mV supply voltage margin is achieved based on measurements in the near-threshold range. In addition, reliable operation is verified by running different self-checking codes over multiple dies while varying the environmental conditions.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-10-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Electrical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Van Gijzen, M.B. (mentor); Van der Heul, D.R. (mentor)","2015","The TU Delft Solar Boat is a very efficient boat that sails on solar power. To reduce drag the boat lifts out of the water with the hull and ""flies"" on two hydrofoils. As a result the boat is likely to fall over and seems to be unstable. To analyse the stability we first made a mathematical model that describes the motion of the boat. Based on this model we calculate numerically whether the boat is stable under the given conditions. The stability analysis for our model indicates that the boat is not stable, as expected. Next we investigate how to improve the stability of the boat. To derive the model, the equations of motion of the Solar Boat have been derived using a force and torque balance. Most forces depend on drag and lift coefficients of parts of the boat. Those coefficients depend on the incident angle and have been approximated by polynomials as function of the angle. For rotational motion the inertia moments are important and those have also been approximated. The result is six non-linear differential equations of second order, which have been reduced to twelve first order differential equations, still non-linear. Euler forward time integration has been used to calculate how the boat moves in time for different initial conditions. We used the symmetry of the boat and the Newton Raphson method to calculate quasi-linear solutions of the system for all realistic velocities. The problem has been linearized around these points and the eigenvalues of the matrix have been determined. The real positive eigenvalues found indicate that the boat is not stable. A parametric study has been done to determine what possible changes on the boat have positive influence on the stability. This parametric study shows that, in order of priority, the following have this possible influence: -bring the struts closer together -make the front hydrofoil narrower -move the driver more to the front of the boat The largest eigenvalues does not drop below zero using any of those variations. Therefore, according to our model, it does not seem possible to make the boat stable by varying those parameters.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Numerical Analysis","","Dubbele Bachelor: Technische Wiskunde en Technische Natuurkunde","",""

(mentor)","2015","DelFFi is a CubeSat mission with the objective to demonstrate formation flying and explore the composition of the upper atmosphere. The research performed in this master thesis focusses on the development of the system architecture of the Command and Data Handling Subsystem of the two identical satellites. Specifically three questions are answered: What is the current status and what work is remaining? How can system modes and states be defined for the system architecture of a CubeSat? Finally, what are the possibilities to include error detection and handling on a nanosatellite. The Command and Data Handling Subsystem consists of two general components: Hardware and Software. Analysis shows that the hardware components are close to a mature \ac{TRL} between four and nine. Conversely, the development of the on-board software is at an early stage of development with a \ac{TRL} for most items equal to, or below, three. As a consequence of the second research question, this work attempts to determine what the system is performing at certain moments in time by defining system phases, modes and states. On the basis of academic and industry literature, a 6-step system engineering methodology has been developed in this thesis for the application to CubeSat missions. Beginning from the mission objectives, the operational stakeholders and their uses cases, a top-down flow allows the definition of the system modes and corresponding states. Implemented for DelFFi, a total 10 modes and 33 states have been defined. One special mode is the safe mode, which assures the survival of the satellite in non-nominal conditions. The spacecraft transition into this mode by ground command or autonomously due to Failure, Detection, Isolation and Recovery procedures(FDIR). On the basis of analysis into the different CDHS configuration items FDIR procedures have been implemented successfully into the DelFFi software architecture. To summarize the research performed within this thesis successfully furthered the system architecture of the DelFFi CDHS by defining the System Modes and Phases and implementing FDIR procedures.","CubeSats; CDHS; System Engineering; FDIR; System Modes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-07-09","Aerospace Engineering","Space Flight","","Space System Engineering","",""

(mentor); Annema, J.A. (mentor)","2015","Waste is present in all projects. Failed projects represent the most waste, but even the most successful projects are burdened with lots of waste as well (Oppenheim, 2011). This suggests that (work) processes aren’t designed properly. This research will search for practical tools that could help reduce or eliminate this waste. The Systems Engineering approach and the Lean approach are the starting point of this research. Systems Engineering (in the Civil Engineering sector) has its own school of thought, which consists of five principles. In Lean Thinking Womack and Jones (1996) described the five principles of Lean (thinking). Combining the two approaches yields in Lean Systems Engineering. The Lean in Lean Systems Engineering should be viewed as an approach to enhance the traditional Systems Engineering process with the wisdom gained from Lean Thinking by Womack and Jones (1996), instead of replacing Systems Engineering with a new approach. According to Oppenheim (2011, p.4) the fundamental feature of Lean Systems Engineering is “to perform all preparations and planning of the people, processes, tools, and individual tasks well enough so that the tasks can be executed right the first time, creating customer value while minimizing waste.” In short, Lean Systems Engineering could be considered as the best of both worlds. This report focusses on the Customer Requirement Specification (process), which is a part of the Systems Engineering approach. Waste was identified through analysing the current Customer Requirement Specification process as applied by Witteveen+Bos. The five most problematic forms of waste that are impressionable are: 1. The process of granting requirements; 2. Including irrelevant requirements; 3. Continuous inflow of requirements; 4. CRS-process in underestimated; 5. Aiming for SMART requirements. Countermeasures have been developed in order to prevent or reduce these wastes. Despite all proposed measures to prevent or reduce waste, it may happen that waste still sneaks into the Customer Requirement Specification process. In order to identify this waste in an early stage of a project, the Requirement Monitor (RM) has been developed. The RM monitors all requirements real-time and it can be seen as a diagnostic tool. During a case study the proposed measures were tested and the Requirement Monitor was used to monitor the requirements and possible waste. The Requirement Monitor and additional interviews confirmed that four types of waste from the waste top 5 were present during the case study. However, the case study showed a tremendous reduction of wasted effort and time when a project startup is organized; costs have gone down almost seven times and time has been reduced ten times. Even in the worst-case scenario costs have gone down and less time was wasted. Thus, investing in activities upfront results in great savings in the end (of the process) and organizing a project startup reduces waste in practice. This conclusion has implications for Witteveen+Bos as well as for all other Civil Engineering design firms, and the scientific community. This study could be a real eye-opener and a step towards organizing a project startup for (all) projects. Secondly, the results of this research may also trigger other Civil Engineering design firms (in the Netherlands) to apply project start-ups. Moreover, if other Civil Engineering design firms reduce waste as well, then it could yield in significant savings throughout the whole chain. Finally, this research is also innovating since it identifies practical tools that enhance the Customer Requirement Specification process of infrastructure projects by reducing waste. Before, there were no practical tools to be found in literature that could achieve more efficiency, regarding the Systems Engineering application and dealing with the CRS-process in a Lean-way. This study provides a first start in solving this knowledge gap in literature.","Systems Engineering; Lean; Customer Requirement Specification; Waste; Case study; Requirement Monitor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Policy Analysis","","","",""

(mentor); Van Boeijen, A.G.C. (mentor); Van Beek, J. (mentor); Dirven, J. (mentor)","2015","While travelling with their RV, campers want to have the same comfort as their home. That includes the use of toilets. European RVs use a system where the human-wastes are contained in a waste-holding tank until those wastes are dumped. The dumping needs to be done manually, the RV user has to remove the tank from the RV, bring the tank to a dumping area, drain the tank and put the tank back into the RV. After interviewing a few RV owners and exploring different sources of information, the consensus is the same: “the waste-holding tank is a part of the camping experience, but not a pleasant one”. The overall experience is unpleasant due to three main issues: the disgust, the awkwardness and the physical strain. The experience is disgusting due to the odours of poop and pee mixed in with chemicals. The awkwardness comes from the fact that the subject of poop and pee has a taboo. And the tank can become quite heavy and therefore strenuous to handle. The usual campers that are found on a camping ground are a couple and both over 50 years old. The campers have different rituals and routine concerning the waste-holding tank but they have a few habits in common. The use of the RV’s toilet is avoided and it is better to use the sanitary building. The man in the couple is the one that empties the tank, and when he does, he tries to avoid encountering other people, by going to the dumping area in the morning or late in the afternoon. The dumping area is the most unpleasant part of the overall experience. While eliminating bodily products, people need to feel safe. Public toilets manage to give a certain amount of safety to its users, unlike the dumping spot (see Picture 1). At the worst moment, when the sludge inside the tank is drained, a really strong and overwhelming smell spreads in the area. Those dumping areas are often next to the sanitary building, so the person draining the tank as well as the people brushing their teeth or doing the dishes get to smell those odours. People feel uncomfortable, the person draining his tank feels exposed and like a bother for the others, while the others try to avoid looking and to ignore the offensive smell. Finally, the dumping area often is a simple metal sink at about waist height, which makes holding the tank upside-down over the sink quite difficult. The user lacks control and support at that point. To resolve these issues, the design needs to give the user more control over the draining of the tank, reduce the smells and reduce his presence when other people are doing their daily routine. The different concepts have a different focus, their strong point vary. One of them is better suited for the user because it puts distance between him and the tank, thus reducing the odours that break free. Another concept encloses the whole system, giving the odours less time to spread and bother the user or other campers. Thirdly, the last one hides the tank which makes it less embarrassing for the user because he is not directly seen with the tank in his hands. After combining two concepts and building a prototype, a few test sessions were performed. The sessions proved that the design is easy and simple to understand. The test subjects were all enthusiastic and gave positive feedback about the prototype. Finally, the final product (Picture 2 and 3) is a dumping station, shown on the right hand side, that resolves these issues. The tank is hidden within the dumping station and the user does not need to hold the tank while it is draining itself, making it easier to put some distance between the user and the tank. The system is enclosed, therefore the odours are more contained, making it the experience less unpleasant for the user as well as the people in the neighbourhood.","Human Waste; Dumping; Camping; Disgust; Privacy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Omrani, P.S. (mentor)","2015","Natural gas wells produce small amount of liquids along with the gas. During the initial part of the reservoir life, the gas velocity in the well tubing is large enough to drag the liquid upwards. As the well matures, the reservoir pressure starts to decline leading to a decline in the gas velocity in the tubing; here the gas momentum is not enough to carry the liquid to the top and the liquid starts to accumulate at the bottom of the well. One of the ways to remove the liquid is the use of foam assisted lift technique where surfactant is injected downhole and turbulent mixing between the gas and the liquid generates foam which can easily be transported by the gas to the surface. However, the liquid produced in a gas well may differ from well to well. Depending on the fluid composition (gas, condensate, water) and the physical conditions of the well, a surfactant may or may not be able to remove the liquid from the bottom of the well. Hence it is imperative to evaluate the surfactant before its use. There are various methods available to evaluate a surfactant; one of the prominent methods is a small scale sparger test, where gas is injected into a surfactant solution to generate foam. We attempt to understand the foam behaviour in the small scale setup and we will use the insights to possibly standardize surfactant evaluation. The present work focuses on understanding the effect of three parameters on the foam generated in a small scale sparger setup, namely: gas velocity, surfactant concentration and pressure. We conduct three tests for each variation of the above three parameters, namely: build-up test, collapse test and carryover test. Two commercial surfactants: Foamatron and Trifoam Block 820 have been studied in the present work. In addition to these measurements, the characteristics of the dynamic surface tension of the surfactants are measured by using the maximum bubble pressure method. Increasing the pressure (in the range of our measurement) is found to have a stabilizing effect on the foam but it does not seem to directly affect the ability of the surfactant to unload liquid. The amount of foam formed in the small scale test strongly correlates with the gas velocity but is found to have a weak correlation with the surfactant concentration. Even though the hydrodynamics of the flow differ between the test scale and the flow loop scale, the small scale tests can still give important information which can help in evaluating surfactants. To be more specific, the carryover test is found to have similar trends as with data from intermediate scale tests (i.e. flow loop test) in context of ability of surfactant in unloading liquid. However the results from the flow loop scale suggest that the small scale sparger setup is not a good predictor in terms of pressure drop. We find that for an increasing velocity in the small scale setup, we operate within two flow regimes: bubble flow and slug flow. We recommend conducting the test in the slug flow regime which is closer to the actual hydrodynamics in the gas wells during liquid loading (churn flow). However, there are certain limitations to conducting the test in the slug flow: since the gas velocities are high the limit of carryover could affect the interpretation of results.","deliquification; gas-well; surfactant","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Mechanical Engineering","","Solid and Fluid Mechanics","",""

(mentor); Struiwigh, P. (mentor)","2015","Transport Tender is a consultancy company advising clients how to plan their logistic activities. Its focus is on road freight transport within Europe. In processes called tenders, the actual prices of new potential carriers are calculated for the shipments of the client of e.g. the last one or two years. Based on these prices, different sets of carriers are evaluated to cover all shipments for the client. Shipments are spread over multiple countries and because the potential carriers are mostly profitable in a small set of countries, this analysis is necessary and helpful. By choosing more carriers, chances increase a collectively lower price for the client’s transport could be established. However, the client wants to work with as few as possible third parties. This contradiction makes planning hard. Tenders help making this choice easier by making differences between options insightful. In this project, software is created to automate tenders. During a two week research phase, the client’s domain is explored and an understanding of the available data, its formats and the required analysis is developed. Requirements are formulated using the MoSCoW principle. A standardised input format for shipments and rates is designed and a web application is developed that can input these data and return the results of analysing them automatically. The application is developed using the Play Framework and Scala. Using a continuous delivery approach, an up-to-date version of the software was deployed on Heroku. Testing the software is mainly done by using automated unit, integration and functional tests. Code coverage reports are used to be able to focus testing activities. Quality of the software is maintained by analysing the source code regularly with Sonarqube. The final product is an innovative web application that is both user friendly and that is able to perform analysis quickly. Its innovation is not in a particular algorithm or idea, but in combining multiple sources of data and extracting valuable information. It automates the complete proces of tenders which reduces a lot of manual work for the client. No other similar services are known on the market. The price of transport is not completely decisive in the choice of carriers. Besides quantitive data like prices, qualitative data could be used in analysis. This could include carrier’s reputations or transit times. Besides that, the application’s scope could be expended to outside Europe and other types of transport, e.g. transport by ship, train or airplane.","logistics; web development; Scala; Play Framework","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2018-07-09","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","Bachelor Project","",""

It is important to ensure a smooth operation of transmission lines to deliver a minimally interrupted power supply making necessary for reliable operation of electrical power lines. This need has given rise to Fault Location detection techniques so that the economic impact of the fault situations can be mitigated and their correction can be rendered simpler and precise. This thesis report presents a comparison between two different approaches towards fault location detection with and without applying transmission line parameters. Firstly, an impedance based parameter dependent algorithm, derived by using the Modal Transformation theory and Discrete Fourier Transform is presented.The second algorithm is an improved parameter-independent fault location method where fault location will be determined from voltage and current phasors, measured at both line end terminals. This approach of fault detection does not require line parameters. The thesis report presents the results of the algorithms tested through the use of EMTP/ATPDraw, RTDS/RSCAD v2.025 and MATLAB. The results of the line parameter-independent algorithm will be compared with those provided by the parameter-dependent algorithm. Both algorithms are tested for the most common to occur asymmetrical faults with varying fault resistances. The results of the tests are then related to gauge the effectiveness and accuracy of these algorithms.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Electrical Power Grids","","Electrical Sustainable Energy","",""

It is approached with the objective of optimizing the geometry of the airfoil for the best trade-off between aero-acoustics and aerodynamic requirements. Using the wind turbine noise prediction tool SILANT it is established that trailing edge noise is the most dominant noise source. Reduction of airfoil self-noise should therefore focus on this noise mechanism. A modified version of the semi-empirical aero-acoustic prediction code by Brooks, Pope and Marcolini is used to compute this trailing edge noise. The panel code RFOIL is used for the boundary layer computations as well as the generation of the aerodynamic polars. A quality assessment of both codes is performed based on aerodynamic and acoustic wind tunnel measurements acquired by the Institut für Aerodynamik und Gasdynamik on the NACA 643-418 airfoil. The multi-objective optimization is executed using the genetic algorithm NSGA-II. The airfoil parameterization that is used is the Class Shape Transformation (CST) method by Kulfan. The results of the optimization are captured in the Pareto front and six individuals are assessed thoroughly. It is found that airfoils can be designed that fulfill all the aerodynamic requirements.

(mentor); Jonker, P.P. (mentor)","2015","Conventionally programmed systems (e.g. robots) are not able to adapt to unforeseen changes in their task or environment. Reinforcement learning (RL), a machine learning approach, could grant this flexibility. Many fields of work could greatly benefit from this, be it in terms of cost, time or some other parameter. With RL, a learning agent tries to maximize its obtained reward during its interaction with a (maybe partially) observable environment. When the environment or even the task changes, the agent notices this and will change its behavior in order to keep its reward maximized. However, in most practical cases with large, if not continuous state and action spaces, converging towards a decent behavioral policy takes too much time to be of real use. Parallelizing RL algorithms might solve this problem. Whereas a modern multi-core central processing unit (CPU) has only a handful of cores, a graphics processing unit (GPU) has hundreds. The goal of this report is to show that fitted Q iteration (FQI), a tree-based RL method, can achieve significant speedups by parallelizing it on a GPU. The GPU was invented to speed up the generation of images, as this is a process requiring raw computational power rather than flexibility granted by the large memory caches as found on a CPU. A large part of the CPU’s caches was therefore replaced by computing cores. As a consequence, memory communications on a GPU are relatively slow and can greatly limit program performance. Speedups with respect to (multi-core) CPU applications can only be achieved if the application applies repetitive computations to many independent data elements. There should be far more computational instructions than memory transfers. To reduce memory latency, the data can simply be distributed over the on-chip memory (distribution), in tiles if necessary (tiling), or it can be streamed through it in a pre-determined way (streaming). Furthermore, multiple cores should be able to use the data of one global memory transaction. Sequential and parallel implementations of FQI’s KD-Trees and Extra-Trees tree-building methods were made using OpenCL and tested using the Puddle World task on an NVIDIA C2075 GPU. KD-Trees has excellent parallelization potential and adequate learning performance, whereas Extra-Trees has excellent learning performance but is more difficult to parallelize. Correspondingly, KD-Trees achieved speedups exceeding 100 times, while Extra-Trees achieved speedups of around 20 times. KD-Trees could furthermore solve much larger problems, achieved greater speedups at small problems and was less memory intensive. Despite this and the fact that learning times with KD-Trees were hundreds of times smaller than those of Extra-Trees, KD-Trees needed many more samples to find optimal solutions. The choice between KD-Trees and Extra-Trees thus comes down to the nature of the problem: if few samples are available Extra-Trees is the better choice, but with more samples and a more time-critical task KD-Trees would be preferred. Future research could further optimize the parallel implementations (e.g. by combining multiple parallelization strategies). Applications of the implementations in the real world could be researched. Also, the parallelization potential of other RL algorithms could be investigated.","reinforcement learning; graphics processing unit; GPU; OpenCL","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

(mentor); Hoogenboom, P.C.J. (mentor)","2015","People are already living on water for centuries in some places around the world. However, the concept of building on water has been reintroduced with a new idea in the last two decades. The new idea is to realise a very large floating structure which is as big as a city. Instead of multiple independent floating houses forming a floating community or residential district, this new idea is to realise a complete city state which floats on the water, a so-called ‘floating city’. The main objective of this report is to give a general design of a floating city to determine the structural feasibility of such a concept. The challenge in this concept lies in the environment the floating community is in. The environment of the floating community determines which and what kind of forces are acting on the platforms. Strength and stability are heavily dependent on which forces are working on the platforms and the magnitude of these forces is also of great importance. It is common sense that such a floating city would survive better in a calm bay then in the open sea with huge waves and frequent storms. That is why this thesis will focus on the latter situation: a floating city in the open sea with a rough environment. The main question in this thesis to be answered is defined as ‘Is it possible and realistic to create floating cities from a structural perspective’. To come to an answer for the main research question, several sub questions can be formulated: - What kind of floating platforms are needed? - How can platforms be connected to each other to form a floating city? - How is the floating city to be moored to stay at one location? - What is the behaviour of the platforms, connections and moorings when the floating community is loaded by (large) waves? The answer is that it is theoretically possible to realise floating cities with modular floating platforms rigidly connected to each other. The platforms are inhabitable under severe wave circumstances and they experience very small displacements as long as the connections between the platforms are very rigid constructed. However, to make sure rigid connections in a multiple mass-spring system are indeed experiencing lower connection forces due to smaller displacements, it is best to find this out with a small scale experiment/modelling program. From the results and calculations in this thesis, it is reliable to connect up to 4 platforms in a linear formation for the chosen design of the hexagonal platform with sides of 60 m and a construction height of 14 m. This means that a floating community of 16 platforms (in a configuration of 4 by 4 platforms) can be realised and house approximately 4000 inhabitants.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2015","To limit global warming, greenhouse gases need to substantially be reduced in all sectors of the economy (IPCC, 2014). The Netherlands has translated this to ambitious goals towards a more sustainable environment. It aims to reach a 40% CO2 emission reduction compared to 1990 and have 27% of the total generated energy be produced through renewable energy by 2030. The large required adoption of renewable energy sources – like wind energy – evoke concerns by stakeholders of the Dutch electricity systems. The influence of a large capacity of renewable electricity production on the electricity system and on the electricity prices towards 2030, is uncertain. Besides it is unclear whether these targets are even within reach as these unknowns negatively influence the investment environment. How will the changing energy production mix interplay with the future electricity price of 2030 in the Netherlands? Answers to this research question can help energy utility companies and external financiers by providing insights in the future Dutch electricity system and in the future electricity prices, and thereby supporting them in making investment decisions. The results of this research might be of interest for policymakers, as the insights of the future Dutch electricity system can support them in the design of future policies. Using literature on the Dutch electricity system design, a translation is made to implement the system in a System Dynamics model – using Vensim software. Following a System Dynamics validation process and by comparing the model output with historical data, a foundation has been created to execute simulations. A Monte Carlo Analysis has been performed in order to deal with uncertainties of external forces and megatrends that influence the electricity system towards 2030. To explore the strengths and weaknesses of the designed System Dynamics model, it is compared with existing electricity system simulation models. The simulation model shows that the energy production mix will become more sustainable with more wind electricity production capacity and a decline of carbon intensive electricity production capacity. Due to the large adoption of wind energy capacity, the electricity prices will become more volatile towards 2030 – as the unpredictable wind speed will have more effect on the total available electricity supply when the installed capacity of wind becomes larger. The increased volatility negatively influences the stability of the electricity system and therefore more import and export capacity is needed to maintain stability. The interpretation of the results has led to several recommendations to various stakeholders of the Dutch electricity system. The Transmission System Operator might need to extend the interconnector capacity to neighbor countries to increase its import and export capabilities when the electricity system is subjected to a shortage or surplus of electricity supply. Policymakers should closely monitor the development of the CO2-price, this factor determines to a large extent the adoption of wind energy capacity. Every study is subjected to limitations. The limitations of this study and System Dynamics model consist of the absence of significant literature supporting the expected development of external forces towards 2030, the model consists of a simplified investment process, no simulations are performed on electricity (prices) of neighbor countries and wind energy capacity is the only renewable energy source that has been taken into account. This research contributes to science by designing the Dutch electricity system in a System Dynamics model. For different stakeholders it provides insights in the development of the Dutch electricity system towards 2030. To KPMG the System Dynamics process shows to be an interesting analytics tool.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Multi-Actor Systems","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management","",""

(mentor); Navalkar, S.T. (mentor)","2015","Flutter-induced vibrations can easily cause large structures like airplanes and bridges to fail, which even today makes flutter prediction an important topic of research. To predict flutter, recursive system identification can be used to capture the time-varying behavior using time-invariant techniques combined with the forgetting of old data. However, forgetting older data takes time, which introduces a delay in the predictions. In order to circumvent this prediction delay the use of Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) model identification from pre-flutter data is proposed, as this directly identifies a time-varying model. This thesis will compare recently published global, local, and glocal LPV identification algorithms and assess their flutter prediction capabilities both in simulation and using experiments. The simulation results show that using LPV model identification the flutter speed could be predicted to within 10 % even in the presence of significant noise. Furthermore, guidelines are given on how these methods can be used and what their limitations are. Regarding the experiments, flutter-induced vibrations could not be reproduced due to fundamental problems in the experimental setup for which recommendations are made.","linear parameter varying; system identification; flutter prediction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","Control Engineering","",""

This report explores one possible strategy: inter-municipal cooperation on residential planning. Through cooperation, municipalities should be able to control the oversupply of new housing. By means of an institutional analysis and case studies, the following question has been answered: what factors have previously determined inter-municipal decision-making concerning residential planning, and how can inter-municipal cooperation be used as a mean to manage regional supply of new housing? The institutional analysis introduces four types of institutional regimes that vary in the capacity to facilitate inter-municipal cooperation. The regime of inter-governmental covenants, which was in force during the 1990s is considered most facilitative. Policy network theory (Van Bueren, Klijn and Koppenjan 2003) argues that institutional, process and substantive factors explain the course and outcomes of inter-municipal decision-making. Case studies of regions Haaglanden and Rijnmond during the VINEX-era confirm the usefulness of these factors. This study further specifies the explanatory factors with respect to inter-municipal residential planning.

The application of distributed generation will have an impact on the present protection scheme. This because the distributed generation units will, besides the external grid, contribute current as well to a faulty component initiated inside the distribution system. Hence the energy flow during a fault will change from radially to meshed perspective. This will ultimately have an impact on the reliability of the protection scheme which will be studied during this research. Currently one of the main reasons the topology of the distribution system is mostly set radially is due to the implications the present protection scheme will encounter, regarding protective coordination, during a fault inside a meshed operated system. In this research a proposal will be given on how this protection scheme can be enhanced with the help of Smart Grid technologies to still provide the appropriate protective coordination inside a meshed operated distribution system.

Within the Inclusive Enterprise research line they aim to investigate and map the factors that influence employee well-being. Among these factors, we may find environmental factors that can be coupled to measurable quantities such as temperature, light intensity or humidity. IBM CAS approached the TU Delft to create a demonstrator for a system that can measure these quantities by using IoT devices, and collect the data that is produced by such measurements. Based on the wishes of IBM CAS, requirements at both a system- and a data-level have been composed. Existing solutions were found to be too specific for the fulfillment of a single goal, still in a prototypical state, licensed commercially nonviable, or targeted at a single platform. Based upon a literature study, investigation of previously mentioned existing solutions and thorough analysis of requirements, a client-server architecture was designed. The system architecture consists out of four components: (1) the sensor nodes, responsible for measuring, (2) the hub nodes, responsible for channeling data between the sensor node and the server, (3) the server, responsible for system configuration and data collection, and (4) the database, responsible for storing and providing access to this data. The constructed architecture is not limited to a single context, and can function as a framework for measurement systems. The strength of the design lies in its platform-independent nature, and its traceable data model. The system has been implemented on the Arduino and Android platform for the sensor node, Java for the hub node, and IBM Bluemix for the server. It has been thoroughly tested using platform-specific frameworks (e.g. JUnit with EclEmma, Mocha with Istanbul) and analyzed using static code analysis (e.g. Sonarqube, SIG evaluation), making it a product of high quality code. The system has been developed with the explicit intention of being continued upon in the future, to grow from a demonstrator into a commercial product.","measurement; inclusive enterprise; sensor network; demonstrator; IBM","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software and Computer Technology","","Web Information Systems","",""

(mentor)","2015","The drive for ever more safety and fuel efficiency in the automotive industry led the industry to search for steels with enhanced strength and ductility. Promising candidates to satisfy these demands are steels with a microstructure consisting of martensite and significant fractions of retained austenite. One class of steels with such a microstructure are Quenching & Partitioning (Q&P) steels. The enhanced strength and ductility of Quenching & Partitioning steels is largely due to the presence of retained austenite. At elevated temperatures encountered during processes such as welding, hot dip galvanizing and paint baking, the possibility of retained austenite decomposition into thermodynamically more stable ferrite and carbides exists. Decomposition of retained austenite would have detrimental effects on the mechanical properties of Quenching & Partitioning steels. A requirement for practically applicable Quenching & Partitioning steels is therefore knowledge of the thermal stability of retained austenite against decomposition. In this work, multiple microstructures have been created in one particular steel alloy using Quenching & Partitioning processing. These microstructures have been characterized using X-Ray Diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Optical Microscopy and Electron Backscatter Diffraction. Special attention was paid to the morphology and carbon content of retained austenite. The response of retained austenite to isothermal and isochronal annealing has been investigated using dilatometry and thermomagnetic methods. The main finding of this work is that retained austenite in essence behaves as austenite which is higher in carbon content compared to the base alloy. Furthermore, the decomposition mechanisms of retained austenite have been successfully related to existing theory about austenite decomposition and mapped to a TTT-like diagram. Low-carbon retained austenite decomposes significantly quicker than high-carbon retained austenite.","Retained austenite; Thermal stability; Quenching; Partitioning; steels; martensite","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Materials Science & Engineering","","Mechanical Engineering: Materials Engineering and Applications","",""

(mentor); Van der Toorn, A. (mentor); Braam, C.R. (mentor); Van der Ziel, F. (mentor)","2015","The worst flood of the 20th century happened at the night of January 31, 1953. After this disastrous flood the Dutch government came up with The Deltaworks, a large scale plan to protect the hinterland against future threats of high water. As part of the Deltaworks the Eastern Scheldt area was compartmentalized with the Eastern Scheldt storm surge barrier as imposing capstone of the compartmentalization. The barrier has greatly (and is still) contributed to the safety of the Netherlands, but it has also had a large impact on the Eastern Scheldt area. The Eastern Scheldt area is facing future (unanticipated) challenges like the sea level rise, the sand demand of the Eastern Scheldt, the scour holes near the shores of Schouwen-Duiveland and new safety standard for flood defenses. These challenges can be influenced by the barrier. Analyses of the challenges revealed that adjustments to the storm surge barrier, which are respond to the sand demand, are the most promising to effectuate. As a consequence of the compartmentalization of the Eastern Scheldt, the flow velocity in the tidal basin decreased with approximately 50 %. As a result, the net buildup of tidal flats stopped while the waves remained stable or even increased in height. The waves crumble the edges of the tidal flats causing the tidal flats to decrease in height. This phenomenon is called the ’sand demand’ of the Eastern Scheldt. To outweigh the Sand demand some adjustments to the moveable part of the Eastern Scheldt storm surge barrier are examined. A lowered sill beam alternative is developed to influence the tide during normal tidal conditions. In this alternative the effective cross sectional area of the Eastern Scheldt storm surge barrier will increase with approximately 6,200 m^2 (from 17,900 to 24,100 m^2). The measures in this alternative include the following adjustments: 1.) Lowering of 50 sill beams, 2.) Extension of 50 gates, 3.) Adjusting the sill construction. By enlarging the cross sectional area of the barrier the tidal volume through the barrier and the tidal flow velocity in the Eastern Scheldt enlarges. The governing force in shoal build up is the tidal flow velocity, therefore the enlargement of the tidal velocity in the Eastern Scheldt should result in an improvement of the sand demand problem. Instead of removing the whole sill beam it is chosen to lower the sill beams. From a safety point of view it is chosen to not lower the outer sill beams to reduce the possible negative effects on the shores of Schouwen and Noord-Beveland. The lowered sill beam alternative must outweigh the current situation. The current situation holds the maintaining of the current barrier and planned investment in preservation of the tidal flat by sand suppletion. The estimated cost for maintaining the current barrier in its original state is approximately 650 million euro (within a range of +/- 20 %). The further research into the alternative has shown that the cost of adjusting the sill beam of the barrier cost more than maintaining the barrier in its current state. Because of the higher costs and the uncertainty in the actual effect of the measures, it seems more effective and safer to maintain the barrier in its current state. In this regard a critical note should be placed at designing with a lifetime of 200 years. Because of the robustness of the design it is almost impossible to make, economically attractive, modifications to improve the functionality of the barrier. If designing with a lifetime of 200 year is still desirable, the structure should be designed in such a way that it is adaptive to future changes.","Eastern Scheldt storm surge barrier; Oosterscheldekering; Zandhonger","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-07-07","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Hydraulic Structures","","51.624837, 3.701019"

Technical advancement and rapid cost-down in LED technology bring entirely new possibilities in lighting applications and stimulate a significant transition from conventional lighting in the global lighting market. Considering huge amount of conventional lighting fixtures in current use, a complete modification for LED lighting at system level can be costly, complex and time-consuming. Efforts are therefore made to develop retrofit LED lamps that can directly fit into the existing lighting systems with electrical compatibility. However, a typical multi-lamp luminaire for 2ft linear fluorescent lamps usually contains one or several branches where two lamps are connected in series to a common electro-magnetic ballast of that branch. The unique wiring scheme forms an input-series system and inevitably causes stability problems with conventional LED drivers, which are usually based on closed-loop switched-mode power supplies. Besides, operation conditions are flexible for 2ft retrofit LED tubes: they are randomly installed in either the two-lamp or one-lamp branch in the luminaire and can be connected with or without electro-magnetic ballast, which accordingly addresses additional design requirements. This thesis work aims at developing an electro-magnetic ballast compatible LED driver for 2ft LED retrofit tube applications. A modulated peak current controlled self-oscillating buck-boost converter is proposed to achieve a positive dynamic input resistance, thereby realizing stable series operation. The validation can be generalized to other input-series systems. On the basis of proposed approach, a complete designing process of the LED driver, which is electrically compatible with the existing fluorescent lighting fixture, is presented. Key points of designing to fulfill all application requirements (include automatic mode selection) are discussed in detail. Two prototypes provide experimental results to verify the effectiveness of the proposed design.","LED driver; input-series operation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-07-05","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Power Engineering","","Msc.

The energy benefit is defined as the ratio of the minimum energy consumption in network when a symbol is communicated successfully for every session when the network is in traditional routing mode, and the minimum energy consumption in network when a symbol is communicated successfully for every session when the network is in compute-and-forward mode. The upper bound of the energy benefit is derived by proving the upper bound of the minimum energy consumption when applying traditional routing scheme, and the lower bound of the minimum energy consumption when applying compute-and-forward. We give theorems and proofs about the energy benefit on general wireless networks and on some special wireless networks. Before that we give the model set-up for wireless networks. In general networks, we get the conclusion that for the benefit of energy consumption when applying compute-and-forward is upper bounded by the average distance of all sessions in the network. It is also upper bounded by the larger one of the maximum distance between each source node to the destination set, and the maximum distance between the source set and each destination node. For some special networks, we start by giving definitions of them, then we give upper bounds of the energy benefit on these special networks. We present the idea that applying compute-and-forward in a network does not make any benefit if the network is a single source network where the source node needs to transmit independent information to each destination node, or it is a single destination network where the destination node needs to receive independent information from each source node. In networks with non-collated source nodes and destination nods, the energy benefit is upper bounded by $2K$, where $K$ is the number of sessions in the network. Upper bounds of energy benefit on other special networks, e.g. line networks, 2D/3D rectangular lattice networks are studied in this thesis.

Airborne Oil & Gas’ (AOG) novel Thermoplastic Composite Pipe (TCP) promises to relieve many of these problems. A light-weight GFRP pipe with excellent corrosion resistance, spooling capability and outstanding mechanical performance figures, it promises to become the go-to technology for many, if not all, of the offshore exploration and production (E&P) majors. Offshore, downlines and risers experience heavy loads due to moving vessels/topsides. Such loads induce fatigue in these risers, and TCP must be subjected to careful analysis of the nature of these loads. This is the main topic of this thesis. Developing methods (and a simulation tool to apply them) to (conservatively) predict fatigue loads on TCP risers for various wave climate conditions. A method based on the concepts of Response Amplitude Operators (RAO’s) is developed to simulate vessel motions for simple (unidirectional) wave climates, as well as for complex combinations of spatially distributed components making up ‘confused’ wave climates, which may consist of any combination of wind- and/or swell-induced wave components. These vessel motions are consequently used as input for a dynamic analysis in Abaqus, a well-known finite-element package available at AOG. Stresses within the TCP as simulated by Abaqus are used in a simplified fatigue model, yielding qualitative results regarding fatigue performance of TCP in offshore service under varying circumstances. Rainflow counting is used to determine the number, and magnitude, of fatigue cycles experienced, while fatigue life is evaluated by assuming a homogeneous material for the TCP. The homogeneous assumption does not hold for actual TCP, which is highly non-linear in material behaviour, but serves as a proof of concept of the tool developed and invites for further development of the methods presented to account for such non-linearities. Findings include good agreement between the proposed model and theoretical results for vessel motions. An important effect of currents on the dynamics and stability of the system is discussed. Furthermore, the derogatory effect of increasing wave heights and failure to correctly ‘weathervane’ the vessel (i.e., failure to meet incoming waves head-on) on the proposed fatigue life is discussed. Increasing wave height by 150% seems to more than half fatigue life, while changing the direction of wave-impact upon the vessel by 45 degrees seems to have similarly serious impact, although a more extensive analysis programme is required to confirm such statements.","Risers; Downlines; Fatigue; Flexibles; Bonded","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-07-05","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Maritime and Transport Technology","","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","",""

Therefore, a systems analysis from three perspectives is performed into the performance of the field. The technological and economical perspectives do not negatively affect the field’s development; the institutional design perspective for which the IAD framework is used, shows that interactions do not lead to collaboration. A Q-methodology study is performed to find the main drivers for collaboration. The results from this Q-methodology show that four perspectives in the field can be seen as main drivers for collaboration behaviour: the Early Adopters-, the Policy Sceptics-, the Quid pro quo- and the Second Movers-perspective. These perspectives are not all institutionalized in Dutch (in-)formal institutions and hence, partly burden collaboration in the Dutch heat and cold energy storage field. This study can be improved by looking at other institutional market designs for the development of the field.

DC cable short circuit faults, or cable pole-to-pole faults, though less common than DC cable ground faults, can cause the most severe damage to the VSC as well as the whole system. In this thesis work, firstly a simple 3-terminal MTDC system is built and validated in PSCAD/EMTDC. Afterwards, based on the self-built MTDC system, DC cable short circuit faults with different locations are studied and analyzed in both theory and numerical simulation. Finally, a comprehensive protection scheme is proposed against such DC cable short circuit faults in the target MTDC system, combining the sub-schemes in fault detecting/locating principles, fault isolating tools and fault current limiting technologies. The coordination among the three parts is also taken into consideration. The scheme is later proven to be fast, selective, reliable, sensitive and robust in general. Moreover, the specific design procedure is further extended into a general design philosophy for DC cable short circuit fault protection in VSC-MTDC systems.","voltage source converter; multi-terminal HVDC; protection; cable short circuit","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Engineering","","Intelligent Electrical Power Grids","",""

Tubular LED lamps are widely adopted to replace conventional linear fluorescent lamps, like T8 and T12. Compared with rewiring of fixtures (remove or bypass the ballast) retrofit LED Tubes (TLED), which can be directly powered by the existing ballast, are preferred by installers. Today, T12 fluorescent tubes are still widely used in the US. A T12 electromagnetic (EM) ballast compatible retrofit TLED has great energy saving potential and commercial value. This work proposes a T12 EM ballast model and a compatible TLED driver. In this project, T12 EM ballast structure and classification were introduced. For compatible driver design, firstly a T12 EM ballast model was built in LTspice and its corresponding modeling approach was developed and verified. Different ballast measurement results were included in this report. The proposed TLED driver uses a buck-boost topology and self-oscillation control to achieve constant output power. By using emitter switch and proportional drive techniques, the proposed driver is compatible with various T12 EM ballasts, including single-lamp, dual-lamp and three-lamp ballasts. Experimental results from the prototypes demonstrated driver compatibility with the ballasts. The driver has a power efficiency above 85%. System measurements shown that power consumption of the retrofit TLED lighting fixture is 55% lower than its fluorescence counterpart.","ballast; retrofit; LED Tube; fluorescent lamp","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-06-27","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Electrical Engineering (microelectronics track)","",""

(mentor); Van der Toorn, A. (mentor); Braam, C.R. (mentor); Sebastian, A. (mentor)","2015","The frequency of hurricanes along any 80 km segment of the Coast of Texas is about 1 in 6 years (Roth,2009). On average, 4 major hurricanes (category 3 or higher) occur every century in the Houston-Galveston Region (Needham and Keim, 2011). In addition, the region is very vulnerable: Houston is the fourth biggest city in the US, over 6 million residents live in the region; the Houston Ship Channel (HSC) accommodates the largest petrochemical complex in the US; and Galveston Bay provides large environmental value. Together, the population, industry and the environment make this region a very flood prone area. Action is required in the near future to protect Society, Economy and Environment. A number of solutions has already been proposed, by local parties and academic organizations, to protect both inside and outside Galveston Bay. Recent studies by the SSPEED Center (Sebastian et al. (2014), Bedient (2014) and Penland (2014)), however, conclude that with a closure of Galveston Bay, a significant residual surge can occur at the HSC entrance as a result of local wind set-up. This indicates the need of a structure inside the Bay, protecting the most valuable areas. The protection system is designed for a lifetime of 100 years. To elaborate on future growth of the infrastructure the barrier is designed for an increased traffic intensity, using a 2-lane traffic of Suezmax tankers and a 1 lane traffic of Very Large Crude Carriers. As a result of local design trends and the determination of the Net Present Value (NPV) for several protection levels, a 1/1,000 years storm event is used as feasible design storm. This storm is associated with a ‘Shifted Ike+30%’ event, which is an often used term in literature, using heavier design conditions than the last major flood of Hurricane Ike (2008). This storm holds wind speeds up to 65 m/s, a design wave height of 6 m and a surge level of MSL+8 m at the HSC entrance. In addition to the Navigational Barrier, the designed protection system consists of three levee sections and an environmental section which has the function of maintaining the natural character of the area by allowing tidal movement and coastal dynamics. The levee system is designed for the complete alignment, for the environmental section is a caisson barrier proposed which is surrounded by dunes. A Multi Criteria Analysis (MCA) has shown that a horizontally sliding gate is the most suitable option for the navigational barrier, resulting from a list of 10 proposed barrier types. A first technical design of the horizontally sliding gate is based on the proposed concept of Penland and Cibor (2013), consisting of a rectangular concrete gate. The gate cross-section is optimized, a movement mechanism is proposed and a foundation is designed, consisting of a sill structure on top of a pile foundation, to deal with the weak soil layers present in the area. Measures have been taken to meet all stability and strength requirements. Although the main objective is met by the concrete design, an alternative design is proposed which provides a better performance on aspects related to gate movement, aesthetics and structural requirements. This alternative design contains a steel triangular ‘truss’, on which a concrete water retaining wall is installed. The abutments and dry dock are integrated in the alignment of the levees resulting in a design that integrates with the landscape. Additionally, by the construction of a park, an exhibition and a restaurant, this barrier is also a “lifestyle attraction”, adding recreational and spatial value. It is concluded that it is beneficial to construct a barrier at the HSC entrance. The proposed designs provide feasible solutions for flood risk mitigation in the region.","barrier; stormvloedkering; hurricane; Houston; Galveston; HSC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Structures","","29.678870, -94.980378"

(mentor); Schroen, R. (mentor); Van der Zaag, E.J. (mentor)","2015","In 2012 an earthquake measuring 3.6 on the scale of Richter struck the village of Huizinge; this quake was the heaviest so far recorded in the region. This shocked the community: earthquakes, a serious threat in the Netherlands? The earthquakes are acknowledged to be caused by the production of natural gas of the Groningen gas field. A predominant part of the building stock is built with unreinforced masonry, which performs poorly during earthquakes due to its brittle behavior and lack of ductility. Besides the large scale upgrading task which lays ahead, the building community is challenged to develop a shock-proof approach for new buildings. Earthquake engineering might seem to be a very technical subject, concerning mainly structural aspects. However, seismic principles and techniques have a large impact and pose serious limitations on the design. How to develop an optimal design strategy dealing with the constraints posed by seismic principles on aspects such as architectural and functional quality? First, the performance of existing buildings was researched. What are their weaknesses? What are their strengths? Then the main strategies and principles were researched to combat earthquake loads. I made an overview of objectives for the building: what is it supposed to do, in what sort of environment does it stand, what are the architectural ambitions and so on. Then I constructed a matrix, matching these building objectives and criteria on the one hand with different reinforcement techniques and strategies on the other hand. By learning from the weaknesses of the existing building stock, the research provided guidelines and inspiration for the design of a new building in Loppersum: the public interface for the Governmental Department for earthquakes (Rijksdienst voor Aardbevingen) towards the public. This building will be a representative information point in the region, housing office spaces for consults and the handling of damage claims. An integral performance objective was set up for the building. Besides a showcase for earthquake proof building, is should be inviting, architecturally pleasing and sustainable. Its design will be showcase of how one can build for earthquakes in an innovative way, moving from heavy and stiff structures towards light and flexible methods. The building is designed to have an inviting entrance, followed up by communal entrance platforms for information services and presentation spaces. It also houses a pleasant office area and a generous public space covered by a spectacular angled roof, with translucent panels flooding the building with natural light. A structural technique was applied (pre-stressed laminated timber technology), in conformity with all the earthquake principles stated in the research: placing resisting elements at the perimeter of the building, using light and ductile materials, providing adequate connections, stiff floors, regular plans and making use of energy dissipation. The structure exists of timber elements, with tensioned cables running through which are clamped in the foundation. This approach allows the building to rock back and forth on its foundation. The tensioned cables will pull the building back upright (self-centering). The connections are designed to allow for this movement. The rest of the building is made with light and flexible alternatives for conventional building solutions, such as plastic cushion windows and timber composite concrete floors. The design has resulted in an exciting building, made shockproof by all kinds of innovative earthquake principles.","earthquake engineering; preslam; architectural design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architectural Engineering","","","",""

Regularization methods replaces the ill-posed problem with a ""nearby"" well-posed problem whose solution is a good approximation of the true solution. The main goal of this report is to understand two regularization methods, Tikhonov and another regularization which we will call the Saunders regularization, and to investigate when these regularization methods are equivalent and which regularization matrices can be used for Saunders regularization. Saunders and Tikhonov regularisation are equivalent when the identity matrix is used. But when an arbitrary matrix is used, the regularization methods are not equivalent. We also examined choices for the regularization matrix for both methods. It was not very clear which matrix one should use for the Saunders regularization, but for Tikhonov regularization method we used a smoothing operator for the solution in both horizontal en vertical direction. For Saunders regularization we also used a smoothing operator but instead for the solution, a smoothing operator for the residuals as regularization matrix.","Regularization Methods; Tikhonov","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Numerical Analysis","","","",""

Historically earthquakes have never been an issue in the Netherlands, and the built environment is not prepared for this phenomenon. The purpose of this research was to find suitable solutions for retrofitting houses in order to protect them against earthquakes. The focus was on Amsterdam School style houses. This pre-war architecture has been very popular in the Groningen region, and there are plenty of these unique heritage houses. The earthquakes, and the strengthening measures, both are a threat for the monumental houses. The aesthetics of the reinforcing measures, for the purpose of preservation of this distinctive architecture, formed the starting point for the research. This study has resulted in innovative designs for reinforcement measures that suit the style of the Amsterdam School architecture. Designs have been made for earthquake resistant chimneys, embellishments and covers for reinforcing anchor plates, stiff floors and reinforcements for masonry parapets. Extra attention has been paid to the social context. Contact with local residents, encounter their experiences and listening to their wishes regarding the earthquake problems has been of great influence. The designs are the result of a human approach within a technical framework. All designs are projected on four existing Amsterdam School style houses in Loppersum. In contact with the residents of the case study houses and stakeholders the designs have been evaluated, and drawn into a wider context. The process towards the design and subsequent analysis, are as important as the design itself, and may provide a basis for wider future application.","earthquakes; Groningen; retrofit; Amsterdam School","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Building Technology","","Master Building Technology","",""

(mentor); Veer, F.A. (mentor); Çopuro?lu, O. (mentor)","2015","Over the years, glass has been increasingly used as a structural building material. Structural calculations on glass are conservative because the strength is quite uncertain. Weibull plots of the strength of glass can range from 20 MPa to 150 MPa. This is caused by flaws, which are not visibile to the human eye and therefore it is difficult to predict glass strength. Because of this uncertainty, in practice, 20 MPa is assumed and a high safety factor is applied. Therefore, more research on glass' strength is important. This thesis focusses on gaining a better understanding of the biaxial strength of glass. This was achieved by performing a literature study and conducting strength tests and microscopic observations. A ring on ring test was chosen for the tensile biaxial strength testing. 53 cruciform plates were tested of which 5 with a rosette strain gauge. It was found that the ring on ring formula, that gives the biaxial tensile stress within the inner loading ring, deviates around $20\%$ from the strain measurements. This can be attributed to assumptions that were made to derive the formula. Therefore, the formula should be further explored with more strain measurements and, if necessary, finite element modelling . Additionally, there was a variability in the strain measurements, which might have been caused by friction. Moreover, 30 out of the 53 tested plates showed circumferential cracking at the support ring, which is not mentioned in literature. For these tests, recommended ratios from biaxial testing on ceramics were applied. 10 tests of glass plates with different ratios resulted in no circumferential cracking at the support ring. It was concluded that the recommended ratios should be changed for the application on glass. A traditional fractographic analysis of glass consists of a fracture pattern analysis by eye and a fracture surface analysis by eye and by microscope. In this research, it was suggested to also study the fracture pattern by microscope. By using a transmitted light microscope with Z axis builder software a multifcous image was obtained representing all flaws and fracture marks throughout the thickness of the glass plates. This turned out to be a valuable addition, because this image revealed fracture marks that would otherwise have been overlooked. These can be used as a quick guide to find the fracture origin and give new insights on the crack propagation. In future research, it is recommended to optimise the ring on ring test so that certainty is acquired about the strength results. With a fractographic analysis, different flaw types can be characterised. It is expected that when these flaw types are related to the strength data, more sensible Weibull plots can be made. This information can then be used as an input for a better glass strength assessment and improvement.","glass; fracture mechanics; fractography; biaxial strength; strength; ring on ring test; microscopy; failure; stress; safety factor; building material; flaw; transmitted light microscope; fracture pattern","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Material Science","",""

(mentor); Bardoel, J.W.S. (mentor); Kruse, H.M.G. (mentor); Vrouwenvelder, A.C.W.M. (mentor); Vardon, P.J. (mentor)","2015","In the province of Groningen in recent years strong induced earthquakes are observed, during which a lot of energy is released in the form of seismic waves. These ultimately lead to horizontal ground accelerations at the ground surface, which affect amongst other things the stability of embankments. The main question to be answered in this report is whether the presence of a pipeline imposes an additional risk to the embankment stability, as a pipeline may fail before the embankment does. For this purpose use is made of various empirical and semi-analytical methods and the outcomes of these methods are compared with the outcomes found in the finite element software PLAXIS 2D. In this report a method is proposed in which first the stability of the embankment is checked before the earthquake begins. Ground accelerations may cause loosely packed sandy soils to rearrange to a compacter state. This is only possible if the water in between the soil particles can dissipate. As the shaking of the subsoil during an earthquake is so rapid, this is not the case and the pressure of the water increases during the earthquake. This causes the effective stresses between the soil particles to decrease, thus reducing the soil’s shear strength. When the shear strength reductions are highest at the end of an earthquake, the reduced embankment stability is checked again. The gradual reduction of the embankment stability during the earthquake is determined by coupling this to the intensity of accelerations during the earthquake. By using the accelerations higher than the acceleration at which stability is no longer guaranteed, the sliding plane displacement of the embankment is calculated. By applying this method to a case study soil profile consisting of sandy soil layers it is found that the calculated displacement increases exponentially with increasing values of the peak ground acceleration. When a soil profile of clayey soil layers is considered, the calculated deformations increase linearly with increasing values of the peak ground accelerations. The response of a continuous pipeline is determined by imposing the sliding plane displacement on a spring-supported elastic beam that represents the pipeline. The springs represent the interface stiffness of a pipeline that moves relative to the soil in four-directions: axial, lateral, upward and downward. Plasticity of the pipeline is accounted for by looking at the pipeline cross-section at the intersection between the sliding plane and the pipeline and by using an iterative procedure between this cross-section and the spring-supported beam analysis. It is found that a continuous pipeline can indeed fail before the embankment does, but for failure to occur the displacements have to be rather higher, the soil surrounding the pipeline rather strong and the limit state to indicate failure rather strict. The response of a segmented pipeline is determined by stating that the sliding plane displacement is accommodated by a maximum of two pipeline segments, of which the displacements depend on the relative stiffness of the upward and downward soil-pipeline interfaces. It is found that the segmented pipelines can fail on the criteria of axial pull-out and joint rotation before the embankment fails. As the axial pull-out magnitude does not depend on the soil stiffness, it is expected that the probability of failure is higher than for the continuous pipeline at the same sliding plane displacement magnitudes. The attempt to model the pipeline in PLAXIS 2D did not succeed as there are yet limitations to how the structural element can be applied. The ground deformations for the clayey soil profile are found to be in good agreement with the hand calculations. The ground deformations of the sandy soil profile are not. Depicting what causes the differences is very difficult, but it appears that the model used to determine the soil behaviour is very sensitive to sloped ground conditions. Insight can be given in mechanisms that are neglected in the hand calculations, but properly interpreting the results requires a lot of experience.","earthquakes; macro-instability; pipelines","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

Het doel hiervan is de kindersterfte in derdewereldlanden terug te dringen. Tijdens de zwangerschap, de geboorte en daarna is er namelijk veel onwetendheid bij moeders in derdewereldlanden over wat er met hen en hun kind gebeurt. Deze onwetendheid is in veel gevallen te verhelpen met een eenvoudig advies aan de moeder. Dit advies kan worden verkregen door een reeks gerichte vragen te doorlopen, waarmee een diagnose gesteld wordt. Het apparaat heeft een relatief lage aanschafprijs zodat het ook voor minder kapitaalkrachtige inkomens aan te schaffen is: de maximumprijs van Babyshell is zes Amerikaanse dollar. Om de moeder tijdens en na de zwangerschap te informeren, zijn berichten ingeprogrammeerd die om de week getoond kunnen worden. Babyshell geeft dan een alarm zodat het advies ook gelezen wordt. Deze berichten adviseren bijvoorbeeld om een bezoek aan de dokter te brengen of om een belangrijke vaccinatie uit te laten voeren. Deze adviezen zijn onder andere afkomstig van de World Health Organization, net als de IMCI-stroomdiagrammen met gerichte vragen, die in Babyshell opgeslagen zijn. Hiermee kan de gebruiker de veelvoorkomende ziektes oorontsteking, longontsteking en diarree zelf diagnosticeren. Ook heeft Babyshell een thermometer die de temperatuur onder de oksel kan meten. De gemeten temperatuur kan gebruikt worden bij de diagnose. Al deze zaken kunnen door Babyshell gedurende een periode van minimaal vijf jaar uitgevoerd worden. Om dat te kunnen doen, zijn alle componenten en software op elkaar afgestemd om zo min mogelijk energie te gebruiken.

(mentor); Welling, M. (mentor); Romate, J. (mentor); Bruining, H. (mentor)","2015","Polymer flooding is the most widely used chemical EOR method. Despite being widely used, the apparent shear-thickening behaviour of the polymer solutions in porous flow at high flow rates is poorly understood. One of the supposed mechanisms is the strain-thickening behaviour of polymer solutions. This fluid property will alter the flow dynamics during porous flow compared to Newtonian and purely shear-thinning flow. In this research, the objective is to improve our understanding of polymer flow through a simple single slit geometry (e-VROC) and more complex geometries (porous flow characterised by pore network models) in order to allow oil recovery optimisation for polymer flooding. The intrinsic viscosity of HPAM3630S is investigated experimentally using the Extensional Viscometer/ Rheometer On a Chip (e-VROC). The e-VROC has a microfluidic hyperbolically-shaped contraction-expansion geometry. The water salinity is used as a control parameter to reduce the fluid viscosity. Initial calibration of the device with Newtonian fluids and analytical analysis of the e-VROC geometry indicate that the shear component of the flow is large in the converging section – contrary to the claimed advantages of the hyperbolic geometry. Newtonian flow can therefore not be regarded as extension dominated. Consequently, the provided analysis of the e-VROC pressure data is currently unable to determine the true extensional viscosity of a Newtonian fluid. Therefore the analysis should be regarded as an extensional viscosity indexer in comparing different fluids. For polymer flowthe pressure gradient over the contraction-expansion area increases more than linearlywith increasing flow rate. This indicates strain-thickening behaviour. The salinity highly impacts the amount of strain-thickening; the higher the brine salinity the lower the pressure gradient over the contraction-expansion area. Furthermore, a high noise content in the time-pressure signal is observed together with reproducibility problems regarding polymer flow. Differences upto 30% in pressure gradients between measurements are reported for the same fluid. Both can probably be attributed to elasticity due to the short residence time of the polymer solutions in the contraction-expansion geometry compared to their relaxation times. The fluid flow process is modelled using finite element modelling (GeoDict&COMSOL) and pore network modelling using MATLAB to study the (changed) fluid flow behaviour. It was shown that Newtonian flow through the e-VROC can be modelled using both COMSOL and GeoDict. Furthermore, it was shown that the pressure drop due to pure shear losses in the e-VROC can be significant during polymer flow. The developed Matlab code enables modelling the steady state response of pore network systems. The systems contains more than 10000 non-linear throat equations. This captures both extension-thickening and shear-thinning pressure losses. This successfully demonstrates proof of concept set out at the beginning of this study. Using the pore network model, it is studied how a macroscopic pressure over a rock sample is redistributed in microscopic pressure drops between individual pores. It is shown that the microscopic pressure drop distribution forNewtonian flowpredicted by the pore network model is in good agreementwith the microscopic pressure drop distribution inside the porous medium predicted by GeoDict. However, the corresponding permeability predicted by the pore network modelling is one order of magnitude too low. From this it can be concluded that the resistance to flow between the pores is overestimated by the used transport equations. Nevertheless, a qualitative interpretation of the (changed) microscopic redistribution of pressure for non-Newtonian flow can still be made. Secondly, the microscopic pressure drop distribution within the sample for purely shear-thinning flow is compared to Newtonian flow. The variance and kurtosis of the distribution decrease compared to Newtonian flow. This implies better conformance control during using purely shear-thinning flow. Above a critical flow rate, strain-thickening behaviour reverses this process. The variance and kurtosis of the pressure drop distribution increase. This has a negative impact on conformance control.","Extensional viscosity; HPAM; e-VROC; Polymer; Extensional rheology; Pore Networks; Pore Network Modelling; in-situ rheology; Pore scale","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

The design of the arm should be modular and be able to perform the tasks of the ERC. An arm was designed with five degrees of freedom. The motors chosen to drive the joints are of the brushless DC type. The control system to control the joints is implemented using a fuzzy P controller and the driver electronics are built on a PCB. The internal communication in the arm is done using the I2C protocol. Two master devices were defined in the base and in the end effector, the individual joints and temperature sensors are connected as slaves. The method of reduction of degrees of freedom is chosen as a way to solve the inverse kinematics problem. The constraints in order to implement trajectory planning is based on the stability of the Zebro during operation. A test plan is written and most tests are performed. It is found that the PCB did not function properly due to design errors. The motor control does function as expected.","robotic arm; zebro; motor driver","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2015-10-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Elektronica","","Elektronica","",""

Before going into the actual programming it is important to understand how the Hamiltonian works, and how the quantum spin chain is modeled. The first case studied is a static spin-12 system, for this system we want to know the lowest eigenvalues this will be done using the Lanczos algorithm. Once the static case is solved it is possible to extend the system with a variable magnetic field. The goal is to optimize this program, therefore we take a look at possible improvements. Another topic is the seemingly critical behavior of the system, for this the critical exponents are determined.

(mentor); De Weerdt, M.M. (mentor)","2015","PageRank, a method to rank web pages objectively and mechanically, models a random web surfer. The PageRank problem is most easily solved iteratively, using the power method. In this paper the reordered PageRank algorithms are discussed. These algorithms (proposed by A. N. Langville and C. D. Meyer in ""A reordering for the PageRank problem"") see the PageRank problem as a linear system of equations and begin by reordering the input Graph/matrix. This way only a smaller problem has to be solved. A disadvantage is that it does take a few extra steps to gain the PageRank values from the solution to this smaller problem. We've developed a suitable stopping condition for these algorithms. However, numerical experiments indicate that this stopping condition is much stricter than the stopping condition for the power method. The reordered PageRank algorithms and the power method have been implemented in Giraph, an open source version of Pregel. Pregel and Giraph are frameworks for solving large graph problems distributively in a vertex centred manner. Because of some of the bugs and features in Giraph (and the inherent complexity of the reordered PageRank algorithms), implementing the reordered PageRank algorithms is much more complicated than implementing the power method. The reordered PageRank algorithms are not faster than the power method in Giraph. Even when accounting for the difference in stopping condition the power method is much faster than the reordered PageRank algorithms.","PageRank; Reordering; Power Method; Power Iteration; Giraph","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied mathematics","","","",""

(mentor); Klein, T. (mentor)","2015","This report tries to answer the question: Can a hybrid system, combining the good air quality and low costs of a natural system with the useradjustability, energy efficiency and small size of a decentralised mechanical system, offers a feasable, sustainable alternative to current ventilation concepts? In an attempt to do so, the Climat Cavity facade concept has been developed, a facade that uses the glass cavity to either pre-heat supply air with thermal energy leaving the building through the facade and solar radiation, or uses the cavity to extract solar heat gain and room air by using the solar chimney effect. The climate cavity facade concept aims to invest the same money that would otherwise be spend on a (central) ventilation system, into the facade which provides the ventilation, but simultaneously offers the advantages of a second skin facade, being reduced energy consumption in terms of heating and cooling and improving thermal comfort. Apart from that, the concept offers a low maintenance and low fan-energy ventilation system, that always provides fresh air without the interruption of filters, heat exchangers or ducts. Also, the concept allows users to influence their climate and make decisions in terms of pre-heating and conditioning air, opening a window and solar heat/light entry. Where the second-skin facade and climate facade concepts rely on mechanical ventilation for the interior, the climate cavity facade aims to be a natural alternative, providing air directly from the outside and using buoyancy and solar radiation to help provide ventilation. The Climate cavity, a ‘natural ventilation - decentralised mechanical ventilation’ hybrid system, can offer improvement in terms of maintenance, fan energy, solar heat gain, user/room adjustability, space consumption and air quality. On the other hand, points of critique are the relatively low heat recovery at this moment, investment costs that could be higher, the uncertainty of cleaning frequency and acoustic comfort. These points will require further research and development before the concept can be applied to an acutal building.","ventilation; natural ventilation; decentralised ventilation; second-skin facade; climate facade; heat recovery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Building Technology","","Sustainable Design Graduation Studio","",""

(mentor)","2015","Currently the building construction industry is still using its traditional way to make buildings and leads to several issues, high energy consumption, more waste than needed, less profit, not optimized and high failure cost. This is because each and every building is unique and the wheel is reinvented for every designed building. The reason of traditional building is rooted in the process of thinking in the building construction industry, because the client wants to have a building designed according to his wishes. However the client lacks knowledge to make a building. This knowledge has to be giving by advisors who will give advice each of them in the flow of the process. This will lead to an accumulation of knowledge instead of an integration of it. This design is then delivered to the contractor who tries to build the design in the cheapest way possible. Whereas the subcontractor needs to deliver the best price for his services. So the manufacturer need to focus on marketing to make profit and their main focus is on selling their own product. When we are looking at the different kind of production industries like car, computer, airplane industry. They keep improving their products while keeping the structure of their products the same. This process need to be introduced to give the building industry more standardization, flexibility and integration while keeping each building unique. The building are kept up to date whereas the buildings that are built now, are already older than the current technical level. The next problem is the energy consumption of the current building stock and the future created buildings. The building sector is using 40% of the energy generated and can be potentially reduced by combining the different expertise’s together in one product. That is why the following window product is developed to answer the needs of these occurring problems. A usual building construction process follows the following scheme: A problem needs to be solved -> solutions are developed -> a product is designed and produced. However looking at different other industries e.g. the mobile phone. An idea is created by doing a research on what the market wants. With this information the demands are made to specify the scope of the design and through an elimination of concepts, a design is created that will satisfy the need of the market. Currently the architect search for all these different product and combine these together. This makes every product unique and the change of failure is higher than when an integrated product can be used. When it does fail, the different product manufactures start blaming each other about who caused the problems instead finding the solution. This change of process is introduced in the modular window product whereas the architect has the freedom to design, form, specify his own preferences while the product is tested and the chance of failing will be limited. By introducing this product, the building construction industry will be able to improve the building while reducing the amount of waste and impact to the environment. Through this integrated approach, there will be more user satisfaction, flexibility in the façade and more profit for all the stakeholders involved in the process. The modular window concept integrates sun shading and ventilation as modular elements in the window. This is done by creating a functional gap on top of the standard window. So the window stays free for the architect to play with in an aesthetic way, while the functions can be attached directly or on a later stage of the life cycles. The advantages lies that sun shading will not interfere with the ventilation system when placed later and the product is adaptable.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-07-03","Architecture and The Built Environment","Building Technology","","","",""

An edge integrated metal section, which is used to reach safe failure behavior, seems to provide an opportunity for a more transparent connection. By coupling of the metal section, the tensile force can be transferred in quite a transparent way.

Smartphone microphones are designed to have a distinct directivty gain pattern. In this research, the MVDR algorithm is extended to compensate for these directivity responses. In simulated scenarios, without the directivities of the microphones, the average improvement in segmental signal to noise ratio is 5.3 dB for DSB and 11.9 dB for MVDR. In all the simulated scenarios, the MVDR beamforming algorithm outperforms the DSB algorithm. Results from measurements in an office room scenario only showed an improvement when applying the DSB algorithm. The results from measurements in the anechoic chamber at the TU Delft show 1.9 dB improvement for DSB and 2.8 dB for MVDR.

Electrowetting is an advanced display technique that is going to take a part in the display competition against LCD screens and LED displays. Display techniques are becoming very important for the building envelope. The desire to have a responsive or adaptive building skin has never been as serious as the coming decade. In 2020 the new policy with only energy neutral buildings will take effect. The consequence is a growing interest in building skins that are capable of fulfilling multiple comfort levels. The degree of complexity is desired to not be too much increased that it is almost too difficult to build. Next to that, its energy performance and durability are of key essence and co-review the qualities of the building skin. Electrowetting could be such new technique as an answer for the responsive building envelope, but its feasibility has to be evaluated first. The paper will start with the research question and a brief history of the development of the smart building skins, where after the electrowetting techniques and its properties are amplified. Chapter three evaluates the responsive building skin and the role of display techniques in this. Chapter four shows the potential applications of electrowetting with a preference for usage in the building skin, as was reviewed in the previous chapters. A performance simulation gives inside in the energy usage of one of the potential solutions for electrowetting. This is set out in chapter five. At last some design questions are still unanswered, i.e. the architectural benefits versus the increased comfort levels; this can be viewed in the last chapter before the conclusions. The conclusions finally discuss if electrowetting is feasible for the building envelope. The thesis is also providing some fundamental theories and basic formulas from different research fields, to not let this distract from the main story, those texts are cursive and always on the left page.","electrowetting; smart; glazing; transparent; display; adaptive; responsive; building; envelope; electrofluidic; wetting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Building Technology","","Master Building Technology","",""

With a numerical study insight in the sedimentation rate is obtained. Wind is one of the most important aspects for the circulation in the Caspian Sea. The salinity changes near the harbour are relatively small and therefore not taken into account. Near the harbour the current is always directed along the coastline, either to the north with an eastern wind or to the south with a northern wind. Northern and eastern winds are dominant in the wind data and these two representative directions are used to get insight into the sedimentation. For these two wind directions each 3 stationary situations with daily conditions and 3 situations with storm conditions are compared with each other. A northern wind result in sediment transport to the south and inflow into the harbour through the harbour entrance. Near Hazar Port both non-cohesive and cohesive sediment is found and implemented in the Delft3D model. Non-cohesive sediment almost directly settles in the entrance channel near the harbour entrance despite of the wind speed. Cohesive sediment is spread over the harbour. With higher wind speeds, cohesive sediment is deposited further into the harbour. An eastern wind result in sediment transport to the north and inflow into the harbour through the opening at the south. Non-cohesive sediment only settles near the coastline. Cohesive sediment spreads out over the harbour, however the highest sedimentation rate is in the south of the harbour. Therefore, the influence of the sedimentation of this situation is limited, since the sedimentation in the entrance channel with this wind direction is limited. Both daily and storm conditions are taken into account. Storm conditions result in more sedimentation, but are less frequently occurring. If the results are combined with the occurrence of the wind speed and the direction, the 5% exceedance wind speed is dominant for the sedimentation. The sedimentation rate over the year is dominated by cohesive sediment. During the summer period, the highest sedimentation rate is expected. The Caspian Sea has shown large variations in the water level. Variations are possible due to long term changes, seasonal influences, wind forces and the tide. Tidal variations are limited and not taken into account. The other water level variations can result in overflow over the northern breakwater of the harbour. This results in an increase in the rate of sedimentation.","Sedimentation; Harbour; Caspian Sea","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","39.4, 53.1"

Increasing temperatures have massive impact on cities. High amounts of paved- and built-up surfaces store heat during the day, making cities warmer than their rural environment. In order to keep our living environments healthy and save; many cities all over the world are developing climate adaptation strategies. In this scope The Hague is falling behind; the city lacks policy to effectively adapt to the changing climate conditions. This is alarming since The Hague suffers from a severe heat island. In order to effectively mitigate heat in The Hague; this thesis develops an integrated approach towards climate adaptation. Therefore spatial policies get assessed on their climate goals and combined with necessary measures to mitigate heat. The integrated strategy is developed by performing three strategy design studies on The Hague. The proposed actions are in accordance to the city’s spatial ambitions and focus on the city’s green structure, spatial planning and demographic trends especially of the elderly. The synthesis of these three studies results in an integrated strategy, The Hague 2040+, that offers the municipality a set of key-actions the city can execute under existing policy to effectively mitigate urban heat.","urban heat island; spatial planning; policy; vulnerability; climate adaptation; integrated strategies; resilient cities","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-07-03","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","Urban Metabolism","","52.0705, 4.3007"

De DISQ is een bestaand product, dat bestaat uit twee katrollen die op een heupband zijn gemonteerd. Door middel van wrijving wordt mechanische weerstand gecreëerd, voelbaar als het koord wordt uitgetrokken. Doordat er gebruik wordt gemaakt van wrijving is de weerstand moeilijk instelbaar en is het mechanisme sterk aan slijtage onderhevig. Ook is er geen feedback voor de gebruiker met informatie over zijn prestaties. Tijdens dit afstudeerproject wordt een prototype van een elektrische wrijvingsloze versie van de DISQ ontworpen en gebouwd. Dit verslag zal zich toespitsen op het ontwerp van de elektromechanische omzetting voor dit prototype. Eerst worden verschillende weerstandsimplementaties onderzocht. Op basis van onderzoek wordt gekozen om gebruik te maken van regeneratief remmen waarbij de energie gedeeltelijk wordt opgeslagen. Het overgrote deel van de opgewekte energie wordt in weerstanden gedissipeerd. Er wordt een vergelijking van de voor- en nadelen van verschillende generatorfamilies gemaakt. Hieruit blijkt dat een synchrone machine met permanente magneten de meest geschikte generator is. Vervolgens worden verschillende gelijkrichtertopologiën onderzocht en er wordt een passieve gelijkrichter ontworpen. Dit vanwege de lage prijs en snelle manier van implementeren. Afsluitend wordt een werkend prototype opgeleverd, waaraan metingen worden verricht. Uit de meetresultaten blijkt dat meeste eisen zijn gehaald.

This paper presents research that was performed to investigate the effects of explicitly visualizing the means-ends relationships on sensor failure detection performance. The set-up and findings of a human-in-the-loop experiment with sixteen subjects controlling aircraft in a predefined airspace show promising results. An analysis of the experimental data indicate that the ecological interface with explicit representation of the means-ends relations enables improved failure detection performance. Advisory response times turned out to be longer, indicating the usage of this extra functionality in order to check the advisories. Specifically in high complexity scenarios subjected to sensor failure, this extra feature has a positive impact on performance.","EID","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operations","","ATM & Airports and Safety","",""

(mentor); Van Gijzen, M.B. (mentor)","2015","In this research, a stochastic model for attenuation in Computer Tomography is developed. This model gives rise to the idea of using path dependent variance of the measurements (instead of constant variance) to improve image reconstruction. The distribution of the measurements in this model is determined and a difference with the current literature is found, which leads to a refinement of the noise or measurement errors in the model. To use the information about the variance of the measurements in the image reconstruction, a numerical model is considered in which a discretization is made of the tomographic image that has to be reconstructed, i.e., the unknown attenuation coefficients. Incorporating weights to reflect the relation between the area that is traversed by an X-ray beam and the entire area of a pixel in the grid results in a linear system of equations. Because the measurements are not exact, noise is added to this linear system of equations, which leads to a perturbed problem. A transformation of the measurements is needed to obtain the desired linear system of equations. The Delta Method is used for this purpose. Another method used for the transformation of stochastic models, variance stabilization, is briefly considered. The log-likelihood of the unknown attenuation coefficients is determined under different assumptions for the mean and variance of the measurements. A connection is made between the log-likelihood and the (weighted) Least-Squares Estimation, leading to different ideas for the adjustment of the current reconstruction algorithm. Several new reconstruction algorithms are developed to improve the image reconstruction by using the path dependent variance of the noise. Most of these new algorithms result in a better reconstruction than the current algorithm, but a problem is found when the convergence of the iterative algorithms is considered. In addition to the relative error, the log-likelihood function and the weighted sum of squared errors are used to investigate the convergence of the iterative reconstruction algorithms. Relaxation is incorporated into the iterative reconstruction algorithm to improve the convergence. A slightly better convergence is obtained, but progress could be made if a convergent iterative algorithm is found.","tomography; CT; noise","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied mathematics","","","",""

Three modes of interaction have been observed: (1) intermittent crushing, (2) frequency locking, (3) continuous crushing. This master thesis has been conducted to develop a model which predicts these interaction modes, in terms of deflection of the structure and the ice forces that act on the structure. Ice structure interaction is a non-linear phenomenon. Non-linear systems can have coexisting solutions. These solutions are sought for. Their dependency on input parameters is made visible through a bifurcation diagram. The developed models are based on earlier work with friction based self-sustained oscillations, with additional modifications to describe the inhomogeneity of the ice, the unidirectionality of the ice force and the possible arise of a gap between the ice and the structure. Such a gap occurs when the structure moves faster than the ice rim. Results calculated with the models that have been developed are then compared with data from laboratory experiments. The sticktion friction model with the above described modifications shows good results for the intermittent crushing regime and continuous crushing regime. However, it fails to describe the response of the structure satisfactorily in the frequency locking regime. These differences between calculated results and experimental results are caused by the fact that the ice force cannot be characterized properly by only two parameters as is the case in the sticktion friction model. Using ice characteristics as a function of both the relative velocity between the structure and the ice, as well as the absolute acceleration of the structure, resolves this short-coming. It is expected that the velocity dependent and acceleration dependent ice forces are ice type specific. Therefor further tests are recommended in order to determine these dependencies.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine & Transport Technology","","Ship and Offshore Structures","",""

(mentor)","2015","LED lighting, as the fourth-generation lighting technology, is developing rapidly over the past years due to its high energy efficiency, longer life span and sustainability compared to incandescent light bulbs and CFLs. Today’s stand-alone LED drivers for professional lighting systems contain two cascaded power converters: an input and an output power stage. The output power stage drives the LED load with constant average current to achieve a uniform light output without visible light flicker and stroboscopic effects. The input power stage is a boost converter which acts as a power factor corrector (PFC), providing to the mains a power factor (PF) of at least 0.9 and a constant average supply voltage to the output power stage. In high-end LED drivers, both the boost PFC converter as well as the converter in the output power stage are digitally controlled by a PI controller. The PFC controller currently being used has a low bandwidth as to not interfere with the power factor correction function. Because of this low bandwidth, disturbance from mains and load will be transferred to the boost PFC output capacitor, which, on its turn, can lead to undesired visible light effects if these disturbances are too large. The thesis aims at improving the dynamic response of the boost PFC converter without sacrificing PF/THD performance. Three solutions: 1. Digital notch/comb filter 2. Input voltage feedforward 3. Variable gain are proposed and investigated in detail. Simulation result for each solution shows improved dynamic response to both mains and load disturbances. Four criteria are applied to evaluate the 3 proposed methods. Finally system with notch filter is implemented to verify the performance of the proposed design. The experimental result shows improved dynamic response to both mains and load disturbances, as well as improved THD performance.","boost PFC; Controller design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-07-03","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Power Engineering","","Master of Science","",""

An algorithm was developed to allow real-time audio playback and manipulation, using overlapping audio blocks multiplied by a window function. The audio signal was played through headphones. Multiple sound localization cues are evaluated. Based on these cues, two basic sound localization algorithms are implemented. The first uses only binaural cues. The second expands this with spectral cues by using the head-related impulse response (HRIR). The HRIR was taken from a database, interpolated to obtain optimal resolution and truncated to minimize memory usage. Both localization algorithms work well for lateral localization, but front-back confusions using the HRIR are still common. The signal received from a sound source changes with the distance to the sound source. Both the distance attenuation and propagation delay are implemented. As an alternative means of resolving front-back ambiguities, the use of a head tracker was investigated. Experiments with a webcam based head tracker show that a head tracker is a powerful tool to resolve front- back confusions. However, the latency of webcam based head trackers is too high to be of practical use.","bachelor thesis; visual impairment; visually impaired; sound localisation; sound localization; game; audio-based","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2015","In this project, a USB DAC was designed. This was done according to a proposal from Flexible Optical B.V. which is located in Rijswijk. This device is used to correct for atmospheric interference in optical measurement systems. The existing DAC is ten years old and needs to be updated to requirements of today. The 'next generation' DAC has been researched in-depth to see if the demanded requirements could be met. The design is divided into four subsystems: USB, controller, DAC, and power regulation and components have been chosen accordingly. Research showed that it was impossible to achieve the requested refresh rate with USB 2.0. The requirements were therefore altered to accommodate this shortcoming of USB 2.0, since a working prototype was more desirable than a faster product. The decision was then made to use a combo-unit that handles both the USB and the controller subsystem. For the DAC subsystem a single 40-channel DAC chip with a resolution of 16 bits was chosen. According to the needs of the other subsystems, a power regulation subsystem was designed. The entire system was first tested on a breadboard. This was used for prototyping and initial measurements. These measurement results did not fully comply with the requirements and adjustments had to be made. With these adjustments eventually all of the requirements have been fulfilled. To finalize the design and create a more stable and consistent design, a printed circuit board was designed and manufactured by Eurocircuits. However, it was not manufactured in time, and therefore no results regarding the printed circuit board are presented in this thesis. There are still some measurements that need to be done to ensure that all requirements are met. The printed circuit board design can still be improved upon to reduce distortion and increase its compactness. Furthermore, pick and place files should be made to make the manufacturing more efficient and other accommodating documents and files should still be finished for a final, market-ready product.","dac; adaptive optics; usb; high speed; digital-to-analog","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Engineering","","Electrical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Van Der Heul, D.R. (mentor)","2015","The error behavior of finite difference discretization schemes has been researched. Starting from the onedimensional case, where two particles of a fluidized bed were taken, the diffusion equation was numerically solved on a single grid as reference. Then the diffusion equation, a model equation for the real problem, was solved on a separated grids setup, where the grid spacing of the grid adjacent to the particles is relatively fine and the other grid relatively coarse. The main problem is the communication/coupling between these two grids. The research question of this report is: Is it possible to couple the two grids in a way that the numerical solution on the coupled grids has the same order of error behavior as the numerical solution on a single grid? If this is possible what are the minimal conditions for the coupling strategy? Different strategies of this coupling are proposed. The order of the error of the numerical solution was first estimated by Richarson error estimation and then computed by the means of the L2-norm, where the numerical solution is compared with the analytical solution. Coupling by using an interpolation polynomial of at least second order in both directions resulted in an error behavior of second order of the numerical solution, which is the same error behavior as the numerical solution on a single grid. Hereafter the problem is extended to two dimensions where also a convective term is taken into account. The results of the coupling from the one-dimensional problem were used for the two dimensional problem. For the two-dimensional problem the L2-error could also be determined. The conclusion is the same as for the one dimensional case: At least a second order interpolation polynomial is required to get second order error behavior.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Transport Phenomena","","Applied Physics, Applied Mathematics","",""

(mentor); Daamen, W. (mentor); Van Gelder, P.H.A.J.M. (mentor)","2015","Mass events are becoming more popular worldwide, with rising visitor numbers as an effect. The accommodation of larger crowds in the public urban space is not met with the available road capacity. The question is how to maintain crowd safety while continuing to organize massive festivities in the public urban space. Therefore, research has been conducted on providing a framework for mitigating risk of crowd disasters for planning safe mass events in the public urban space. The main aim of the framework is to let crowd management authorities acknowledge crowd disaster development, let them be able to assess risks of crowd disasters at event areas and provide them with advice on effective measures for risk mitigation. The framework (1) combines state-of-the-art crowd management from literature and practice with a newly designed (2) macroscopic flow model in System Dynamics to (3) identify the areas with a higher risk of crowd disasters in order to (4) provide the user with a set of crowd management measures for mitigating crowd disaster risks and (5) show their relative effectiveness on the performance criteria for crowd management to support decision-making. For designing this framework methods have been combined from two science fields: Traffic Flow Theory & System Dynamics. The methodology involves an iterative evaluation of the design of the framework by studying archetypes of mass events. These archetypes have been derived from the nautical mass event SAIL 2015 to be held in the city centre of Amsterdam. The framework concepts are proven by application. To assess risks of crowd disasters, research is conducted on defining risks and crowd disasters in line with Traffic Flow Theory. Phenomena leading towards a crowd disaster could be distinguished together with risk stages for crowd disasters in the fundamental diagram of pedestrian traffic of Weidmann (1993). This analysis is used in the framework to assign state-of-the-art solutions to scenarios of crowd disaster development. These measures are implemented in the newly designed macroscopic flow models derived for both unidirectional and bidirectional flowing or queuing situations. For application of the framework the client can choose between general and specific advice. For general advice the framework is qualitatively applied, for specific advice quantitatively. In the latter application the macroscopic flow models designed for archetypes of mass events should be applied. They can easily be adapted to new event situations. By simulation the measures can be assessed on their effectiveness on travel times, risk development, breakdown occurrence and throughput for a specific case. With this framework the state-of-the-art risk mitigation is made available for a wider public who do not have to be familiar with it. With the framework, improving mobility in the public urban space is made easier and better available for non-engineers because of the simulation environment provided in the quantitative part of the framework. On top of that, in the qualitative part of this framework the mass event organiser can improve its mitigation strategy without data available in a limited amount of time.","Crowd Management; Risk of Crowd Disasters; Mass Events; Macroscopic Flow Modelling; System Dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","Transport, Infrastructure & Logistics","",""

Tata Steel is now part of Tata Steel Group, Indias largest industrial group producing in excess of 20 million tons of crude steel annually. Tata Steel produces seven million tons of high quality coated steel per annum. In chapter 1 the Tata Steel factory layout for the Oxygen Steel Factory 2 (OSF2) and process steps are illustrated. The key issue for this research is the logistical friction between (planned) maintenance and production continuity. This logistical challenge is projected on Tata Steels focal points. The chapter concludes with both the goal of this research - to create a scientifically underpinned decision support tool - and the outline of the report. In order to design the outline for a decision support tool, aiming to investigate the relationship between maintenance and production continuity, the study of the relevant literature is reported in chapter 2. It is evident that varying scientific approaches have been carried out to study steel production factories specifically, and maintenance versus production continuity in general. Roughly three different approaches are distinguished: (1) Integral production process improvement methods, represented by amongst others lean manufacturing, theory of constraints, quick response manufacturing and six sigma, (2) specific production process analysis and improvements methods varying from model- and simulation based approaches to more descriptive research approaches, (3) project management approaches geared towards operational effectiveness...","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-07-03","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

The increasing demand to predict wave hydrodynamics with aquatic vegetation asks for insight in the mechanisms and improved model methods. Striving to a more fundamental approach of the interaction between wave hydrodynamics and flexible vegetation by determination and description of phenomena and processes is the main objective of this research. The interaction is divided into two one-way couplings: the wave hydrodynamics affected by a canopy of rigid vegetation and the wave-induced motion of single stem vegetation. The interaction is studied with two unique wave flume experiments and with the development of the 1DV-Dynveg model for simulating the motion of flexible vegetation in periodic wave conditions. Measurements and model results of wave hydrodynamics in and over rigid vegetation reveal reduced in-canopy velocities with phase leads compared to the surface elevation. A mixing layer is generated, moving in and out the canopy, with strong velocity gradients and vertical motion of horizontal momentum. The height and motion of the mixing layer varies with canopy characteristics and wave conditions. Period averaged streaming in the mixing layer is observed in the wave propagation direction with a redistribution of the Stokes' drift. The wave-induced motion and the base forces on and of single flexible stems are measured and modeled. Forces on rigid cylinders are in general proportional to the squared flow velocities. Due to lower relative velocities between the stem and the flow, lower base forces are observed with flexible vegetation. Streamlined positions are observed with larger orbital velocities, reducing the base forces, even with relative stiff stems.","waves; aquatic; vegetation; hydrodynamics; stokes; drift; canopy; zostera; flexible","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-07-02","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Environmental Fluid Dynamics","",""

(mentor); Remøy, H. (mentor)","2015","This thesis studies the determinants of capitalization (cap) rate, a rate of return on real estate investment, which reflects the risk associated with the property investment. Capitalization rate is a real estate valuation measure used in the most common valuation method in the Netherlands, namely the direct capitalization method. Due to limitations associated with the commercial real estate market (lack of transparency, information asymmetry, infrequency of transactions, etc.), investment decision making procedures and investment risk assessing procedures (to ultimately determine the property value), are prone to some uncertainty. These procedures are mostly combined with a qualitative assessment, due to difficulties in identifying the risk sources in real estate investment and the complexity of measuring it, which resulted in uncertainty and inaccuracy. To define the risk sources more specifically, this thesis aims at determining the cap rate components and quantifying the qualitative aspects of investment decision making and property valuation, by decompounding the determinants of capitalization rate. Because the risk is decompounded, the resulting cap rate model is more structured and flexible, which reduces the uncertainty and qualitative aspects of risk assessment procedures and helps to solve the problems associated with assessing the real estate investment risks. As a result, a new model is created which enhances the accuracy and consistency in real estate valuation, as it creates a dynamic and flexible method to measure the cap rates which can be used by many market parties (investors, appraisers, developer, etc.) to more precisely identify the risk inherited in the property investment which ultimately leads to determining the property value more accurately.","Valuation accuracy; Capitalization rate; Amsterdam office market","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Real Estate and Housing","","Real Estate Management","",""

(mentor); Dingemans, T.J. (mentor); Janssen, M. (mentor); Wever, R. (mentor)","2015","Background: The growth of the global population in combination with technological development results in the need to improve the living conditions. This led to a significant and unsustainable increase in production of products. The unstable increase is especially the case for plastics, which have an annual worldwide production of over 288 million tons, that grows exponentially. Sustainable solutions and a circular economy are required to limit the unsustainable increased demand on natural resources. Solutions to this unsustainable situation include: the use of bio-based polymers, increased use of flexible packaging or improved recycling; either chemical or mechanical. Objective: This study focuses on the possibility to create a circular economy of plastics by applying mechanical recycling. Mechanical recycling is a promising solution, especially with the new separation technology that is currently in development. The current separation technology of mechanical recycling separates plastic by type, but does not take any further separation criteria into account. This results in a mixed waste stream of many different grades, which cannot be used in a circular economy. However, the separation technology currently being developed can separate plastic on flake level. In addition to accurate density separation on flake level, the technology is able to separate flakes based on wall thickness and color. Separation based on wall thickness enables the possibility to separate based on manufacturing type. This study investigates whether this new separation technology can realize a circular economy for mechanical recycled post-consumer plastic. Methods: The study is performed on post-consumer polypropylene (PP) from the packaging industry, as this industry counts for majority of plastics production. PP is one of the key plastic types used in packaging and its popularity is expected to increase, as transparent PP already replaces poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) in many applications. PP is a thermoplastic semi-crystalline polymer which properties are strongly correlated to its molecular parameters. Tacticity, crystallinity, molecular weight and copolymerization impact the properties of PP. The optical, mechanical and rheological properties of further categorized pure post-consumer PP (based on manufacturing type and color) are studied, as these properties give insight in their possibility to address the market needs. Results: A first separation based on blow mold, thermoformed and injection mold leads to recycled material streams with well defined rheological and mechanical properties. The melt flow indices (MFI) of the categorized mechanical recycled waste streams address the needs of plastic manufacturers. Additionally, the thermoformed and blow mold waste streams show a ductile fracture behavior. However, the injection mold grade shows a brittle fracture mechanism. Categorization based on manufacturing type is correlated with a slight color separation. Further categorization of injection mold into a white and transparent grade leads to mechanical recycled materials streams with even better defined optical, rheological and mechanical properties. However, the injection mold white grade has become brittle, probably related to its low molecular weight. Modifications, such as the addition of virgin grade, might be required to meet the needs of the manufacturing industry. Conclusion: Both results show that more defined categorization of recycled post-consumer can realize a circular economy of post-consumer PP. However, regulations for standardization are required to enable the appropriate use of PP in the food packaging industry and to prevent change in product characteristics over time (e.g. yellowing) things like yellowing. By regulating standards to create a circular economy for mechanical recycled post-consumer plastics, manufacturers have to take their responsibility in recyclability, rather than minimizing the mass of packaging waste.","Plastics recycling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","MSE","","Advanced Functional Polymers","",""

(mentor); Franzen, A. (mentor)","2015","This thesis aimed to research the public values of real estate in general and how these values can be taken into account in the disposal of government assets. Correspondingly with former research in this subject, this thesis also recognises the fact that by selling around 700 properties not only financial return can be taken into account. By selling public assets properties have to be part of a public process and the challenge is to find a new public value for the property in its environment. This by increasingly providing cross-departmental coordination and direction, collaboration with provinces and local governments but as well with private developers. Important notion is that the Central Government Real Estate Agency (CGREA), the agency in charge of the government real estate, is a political steered organisation thus public values are a political decision. In order to execute and operate a process by selling public properties there is need for a policy in where choices are validated, where a property can be sold for the highest bid and where a stimulation is needed to adapt the property for the future. This thesis only provides a vision of the possible, a starting point to validate choices regarding public values and the definition of these values. It will help to open the debate, challenge the status quo, and ensure that the trade-off between public values and financial return is possible. Ultimately, the goal is to sell 700 real estate objects. This will require process strategies closely linked to the organisation’s capabilities and aligned to regional and local demand. Property is not special but it is a unique resource with particular attributes. Understanding the drivers, and leveraging the opportunities created, is what public real estate management is about. The limitation of this research is that the framework is not made practical. It only provides an approach to indicate public values and how these can be taken into account during the process of disposal. Public values emerge from activity in the building and surroundings. It is about the involvement of the context, defining the opportunities for the property or area on market, location and building/area level. Public value is clarified and authorised by the public, but it is made, increased and created by public service organisations through their decisions about what services to provide. It is for these organisations that politicians and public managers must justify the allocation of resources and develop policies and strategies regarding disposal that are consistent with the generation of public values.","Public real estate management; Disposal vacant real estate; Public values","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-07-10","Architecture and The Built Environment","Real Estate & Housing","","Real Estate Management","",""

Technology is ever developing and also in the current architectural practice new developments have to be implemented in buildings. In order to keep grip as an architect, of all the technology in buildings, like HVAC system, building construction and facades, having a considerable level of knowledge about these technologies is essential. This personal view on the architectural practice is strengthened by the current desperately needed developments towards sustainable buildings. This is also acknowledged by the Dutch government and forced in the form legislations, which state that in 2020 every new building should be a (near) zero-energy building. In order to get to this sustainable future, technology will have an even greater impact on the building practice. The question for me is, how, and to what extent, these (new) technologies should have its role in the design process and should influence the actual built architectural form. In my opinion, the AE department acknowledges the importance of technology in architecture. I hope that within this studio, I can explore the relationship between architecture and technology while gaining the badly needed technical knowledge.","urban farming; energy producing greenhouse; rooftop; greenhouse; building transformation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architectural Engineering and Technology","","","",""

In the wind conditions with the highest wind speeds the wind turbine has to cope with the most extreme loads. In these most extreme cases the wind turbine is parked, the blades do not rotate, and the blades deform elastically under these wind loads. An increase in the flexibility of the blades results in higher elastic blade deformations. The main objective of this project is to design blades in a way that the extreme loading on the blades reduces with more than 10 % without compromising the energy yield by making use of flexible materials and the corresponding increased deformations. The reason to focus on load reduction is that a wind turbine can be made cheaper if these loads are reduced. The research methodology is a three-step approach: Firstly a modelling tool is created to design and evaluate blades with new flexible materials at different locations in the blade. Secondly a verification procedure is performed to check the accuracy of the modelling tool. Thirdly this tool is used to design blades with highly flexible materials and to perform an iteration procedure to design the best flexible blade design. The modelling tool is based on the cross sectional software BECAS to design new flexible blades and on the aeroelastic software HAWC2 to analyse the behaviour. This BECAS-HAWC2 modelling tool is based on the existing XANT M-21 wind turbine of which only the blade materials are variable parameters, the rest of the wind turbine remains as it is. A verification procedure compares the modelling tool with two other models of the same blade. The minor differences between several modelled parameters increase the confidence in the BECASHAWC2 model. A material with unidirectional fibres and a highly flexible matrix material is stacked in different orientations to design different blade materials. These flexible materials are introduced in specific locations of the blade. The design exploration approach makes it possible to design and evaluate many different blades using different flexible materials at different locations. The current results show that the best option is to use the flexible material with fibres only in longitudinal and transverse direction in the skin of the blade. Not replacing the full skin but only the part of the root up to the middle of the blade results in the best flexible design. This best design has a reduction in maximum thrust force and maximum root bending moment of respectively 23 % and 26 % compared with the original blade, easily exceeding the predefined goal of 10 %. This significant load reduction is due to a significant blade twist rotation thereby reducing the area exposed to the wind. The annual energy yield is not compromised, it even shows a considerable 11 % increase due to a stall delay effect in the higher wind regimes which is also caused by an increase in blade twist. The best flexible design is a preliminary design that shows promising results. These results show that by using flexible materials in the blade skin a significant load reduction is combined with an increase in energy. This indicates an untapped potential for future wind energy which makes further research on this topic recommended.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-07-02","","","","","",""

(mentor); Dam, B. (mentor); Savenij, T.J. (mentor)","2015","Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is an elegant method to generate renewable hydrogen fuel from water by utilizing the abundant solar energy. Silicon (Si) as a semiconducting photoanode for PEC water splitting has received a growing interest due to the natural abundance of Si, its light absorbing ability, its excellent electronic properties and its low-cost processing. Although Si is a promising photoanode, its sensitivity towards corrosion in aqueous electrolytes hinders its use in PEC applications. To protect Si photoanodes against corrosion, thin layers (1-10 nm) of TiO2 were deposited onto FTO and Si by atomic layer deposition (ALD). Unannealed TiO2 was tested as well as TiO2 that was post-annealed in either air or vacuum environment. The properties that determine the photoelectrochemical activity as well as the stability were studied. The thickness and bandgap were determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry. X-ray diffraction crystallography (XRD) was used to analyse the crystal structure. Other physical, electronic and optical properties were characterized by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The electrochemical properties were tested by electrochemical measurements, i.e. cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry. It was found that the addition of very thin layers (<2 nm) of TiO2 on Si photoanodes that were post-annealed at 400°C in vacuum showed a high performance in PEC activity as well as stability. Moreover, the use of a Ni catalyst on the Si/TiO2 photoanodes showed an increase in reaction kinetics with photocurrent density reaching up to 25 mA/cm2. It was found that the stability of Si photoanodes is improved by a thin layer of TiO2 for 8 hours compared to 2 hours without TiO2 protection layer. To understand the charge transfer mechanism through the TiO2 layer, TiO2 layers were fabricated with different thicknesses of TiO2 and annealed in different annealing environments. These different TiO2 were evaluated regarding their PEC activity by cyclic voltammetry. As smaller thicknesses (<2 nm) of TiO2 enhance the PEC activity of Si photoanodes, compared to thicker layers of TiO2, it is implied that the mechanism of charge transport through TiO2 is tunneling. It was also shown that vacuum annealed TiO2 demonstrated a higher PEC activity compared to unannealed TiO2 in Si/TiO2/Ni photoanodes. The fact that annealing increases the PEC activity and removes defects, demonstrates that transport is not by defect states.","PEC; silicon; photoanodes; titanium dioxide; TiO2; passivation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Chemical Engineering","","Materials for Energy Conversion and Storage","",""

(mentor); Tao, H. (mentor)","2015","Fluorescent lamp has been a very successful source of light. Installed base of TL(Tube Linear) is huge; more than 60 percent of artificial light is being generated today by fluorescent tube. However in the past few years LED lighting technology has been rapidly developed. LED (Light emitting diode) is a new technology that has become more energy efficient compared to fluorescent tube giving more light- Lumens/watt. As LED technology is rapidly increasing, LED TL retrofit (TLED) is emerging as an attractive business to Philips from past years. This master thesis project is based on LED replacement tube called TLED-instant fit retrofit tube. This TLED product developed is a fast and easy way of upgrading old fluorescent tubes to LED tubes -just plug and play type and no rewiring of fixture required. This new lamp, enables fastest and easiest way to upgrade HF (High Frequency) TL luminaires and instantly provides about 40% energy saving. Normal TL tube lamps are safe due to the fact that the gas inside the tube first has to be ignited (combination of starter and ballast or HF generated high voltage) before there is a conductive path between the two connections on the end of the tube. This safety is necessary when the tube is being installed into a fixture while the voltage is not disconnected from the mains. But in case of using this newly designed TLED based (retrofit) lamps there is a conductive path between the two ends (the electronics) of the tube and safety is not guaranteed. Electronics are not considered as a proper isolation for safety. Hence the solution for solving this issue of safety is to use two electro mechanical relay combination in series with each other and HF ballast. Even though the two relay solution is solving present safety problems for customer, because of the internal built in architecture of these relays there is energy loss associated with them due to relay bouncing and arcing effect. The use of these two electromechanical relay solutions for TLED presently is a very costly solution for solving the pin safety issue .Hence the main motivation for writing this thesis is to evaluate the possibility of designing a new hybrid safety relay system, consisting of one electromechanical relay and other high voltage semiconductor switch to reduce the cost associated with use of two electro mechanical relay system and also to eliminate bouncing and arching effect involved by using just one electromechanical relay instead of two. In this thesis, first a brief literature survey is made on different solid state relays and high voltage semiconductor switches to choose the optimum switch for this project. A Hybrid relay system with one electromechanical relay and semiconductor switch was designed in simulation and hardware prototype is built and analyzed for its intended functionality. Next, the designed hybrid relay system was integrated to present TLED relay board by analyzing the present TLED internal electronic architecture in simulation and later integrating hardware model to TLED. The implemented hybrid relay system was tested and analyzed for its functionality considering few design trades off.","TLED; HF ballast; electromechanical relays","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-07-02","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","Electrical Power Processing","",""

We analyze the game on directed graphs and we investigate the finiteness of the game. We introduce some properties of the chip firing game by associating it with a left-hereditary, permutable and locally free language. We use these properties to calculate, given an initial position and a final position, how many times we have to fire each node to finish the game or we can draw the conclusion that the game will never terminate. We introduce a linear system in terms of the Laplacian to decide finiteness of the game. In order to set up this system we use some linear algebra to calculate the Hermite normal form of the linear system. With this Hermite form we can find an integer solution for the number of steps needed to finish the game.

Their impacts can be calamitous devastating entire countries overnight and making millions of people suffer. Due to the above disasters, bridges are damaged resulting the isolation of residential communities and the inability of delivery emergency relief supplies. In order to provide quick help to disaster areas, an easy-transported, rapid-installed, adaptable to different configurations and cost-efficient temporary bridge becomes critical for transportation of people, food and medical supplies.

The instant connection could be used all over the world reconnecting communities and supporting disaster relief. DeMoLi is a Warren Pony Truss Bridge, consists of identical prefabricated aluminum elements relying on term of modularity, creating a lightweight structure. The modular segments also facilitate adaptation of the bridge to different spans ranging from 5m to 20m length with load capacity up to 40tons. The construction process and the final assembly realize off-site (in the factory) and the completed bridge is transported on-site in a compacted form thanks to its deployable capability. Then, it is installed in a limited time and without any special equipment for short term, servicing the emergency needs.

There is no doubt the city visitors have difficulties in finding ways during evacuation, due to lack of knowledge and unfamiliarity of the environment. To start with, an explicit literature study is performed. It introduces Dynamic Disaster Model and illustrates the evacuation responses of city visitors in respect of travel choices. Further, it identifies six categories of wayfinding factors, including personal profile, spatial abilities, wayfinding strategy, psychological condition, spatial layout and navigational aids. Based on the literature study, a theoretical framework of evacuation wayfinding process is proposed and hypotheses of city visitors’ evacuation wayfinding behaviour are assumed, with respect to six types of wayfinding factors. To examine the hypotheses, an evacuation experiment based on driving simulator is conducted. It is found that the gender, spatial abilities, wayfinding strategies and psychological condition have significant impact on evacuation wayfinding in this experiment. The gender and spatial abilities are major determinants of evacuation wayfinding performance. Finally, on the basis of literature study and experiment result, a conceptual evacuation wayfinding model is constructed, which explains how city visitors find ways in a vehicular-based urban evacuation.","wayfinding; vehicular evacuation; driving simulator","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

(mentor); Metrikine, A.V. (mentor); De Gijt, J.G. (mentor); Peters, D.J. (mentor)","2015","Ports are civil works which have a major societal and economic importance. Quay structures are infrastructural elements of primary significance for the functioning of a port system. The ability to economically design quay structures with sufficient seismic resistance is therefore of great importance when situated in areas that are prone to earthquakes. Conventional seismic design is force-based i.e. that structures are designed to have sufficient capacity to withstand a pseudo-static seismic design force. This methodology is associated with no insight in the performance of the structure when exceeding the pseudo-static limit equilibrium state and uneconomic design due to the demand that the structure can resist a very high seismic design force without deforming. A more advanced alternative is Performance-Based Design (PBD) methodology. In this methodology the key design parameters for the seismic performance of structures are stress states and deformations of soil and structure, rather than just a seismic design force. Furthermore it recognizes that varying amounts of permanent deformations associated with different degrees of (repairable) damage are allowable. The present study is embedded in the topic of performance-based seismic design of quay structures. Typical quay types are gravity-based quay walls, sheet pile quay walls and pile-deck structures. The observed trend in seismic quay design is that gravity and sheet pile type structures (i.e. retaining walls) are associated with areas with zero to low seismicity while pile-deck structures are generally the preferred solution in areas with higher seismicity. This can be explained by more favourable seismic performance (i.e. more deformation capacity) of pile-deck structures compared to retaining walls. In line with this trend it is found that PBD methodology is developed to significant lesser extent for retaining walls (especially anchored sheet pile walls) than for pile-deck structures. Therefore the present study focuses on performance-based seismic design of anchored sheet pile quay walls. In the seismic design methodology there are generally three levels of seismic analysis available, i.e. simplified analysis (pseudo-static), simplified dynamic analysis and dynamic analysis. Simplified analysis of anchored sheet pile quay walls is associated with conventional design methodology. Simplified dynamic analysis can be used to obtain a first estimate of permanent-displacement of a structure after exceeding limit equilibrium, based on an assumed failure mode. This type of analysis has to be made more suitable for anchored sheet pile quay walls. In dynamic analysis the seismic behaviour of a structure can be simulated by means of finite element software. Experience has shown that it is desirable to consider sheet pile quay walls in a less conservative way in (preliminary) seismic design for which pseudo-static methodology is commonly applied. Therefore the general objective of the present study is to propose improvements on (simplified) seismic design methodologies for anchored sheet pile quay walls by considering deformation behaviour. For this purpose a research methodology is developed in which pseudo-static, permanent-displacement and FE analysis are employed, calibrated with an experimental reference case that considers a typical anchored sheet pile quay wall. The reference case is taken from a conference paper. It reports on a shake table test under centrifugal gravity which is performed on a scale model of an existing sheet pile quay wall with a batter pile anchor. The quay is situated in homogeneous soil that consists of coarse densified sand. Due to the soil condition liquefaction effects are prevented. Sequential seismic loading of increasing severity is applied during the shake table testing. Measurement results that are reported in the reference case paper comprise bending moments in the sheet pile wall, normal forces in the anchor rod and horizontal displacements of the sheet pile wall. For simplified analysis a calibrated D-SHEET PILING model of the reference case anchored sheet pile quay wall is created. Through an iterative pseudo-static calculation procedure in which D-SHEET PILING and reference case dynamic bending moment results are fitted, it is attempted to find a deformation-based seismic load reduction for structural forces in the sheet pile wall that can be applied in pseudo-static design methodology. For simplified dynamic analysis an analytical limit equilibrium model is developed, based on the failure behaviour of the reference case. The goal of this model is that it can compute the critical acceleration of the anchored quay structure and estimate the sheet pile forces at this critical state. These abilities are validated with PLAXIS 2D and checked with the reference case measurements respectively. Six accelerograms in the reference case soil column, obtained with equivalent linear site-response analysis (with SHAKE2000), are combined with the computed critical acceleration for permanent-displacement (sliding-block) analysis. For dynamic analysis a calibrated PLAXIS 2D model of the reference case anchored sheet pile quay wall is created. Dynamic performance of the PLAXIS 2D model is validated with SHAKE2000 by comparing site-response analysis results of both models. Pseudo-static and pseudo-dynamic calculations are applied to obtain the critical acceleration. Dynamic calculations with six bedrock motions are carried out to simulate the reference case experiment. PLAXIS 2D calculation results are used to validate simplified and simplified dynamic analysis results and to gain insight in the seismic failure behaviour of the anchored sheet pile quay wall. Approaches for (simplified) performance-based seismic analysis of a typical anchored sheet pile quay wall are proposed as a result of the research. For pseudo-static methodology a deformation-based seismic load reduction for structural forces in the sheet pile wall is proposed. For the present reference case it is concluded that a reduction in the range of 45% to 50% is allowable. For simplified dynamic analysis a limit equilibrium model is proposed to compute the critical acceleration of the present quay structure and to estimate sheet pile forces at this critical state. It is concluded that the ability of the limit equilibrium model is satisfactory. Although subjected to uncertainty, permanent-displacement analysis results indicate that the sliding-block analysis, originally developed for embankments, is possibly not suitable for anchored sheet pile quay walls. For dynamic analysis it is concluded that PLAXIS 2D is able to compute the reference case failure behaviour reasonably well, despite some computational setbacks. Complementary is the conclusion that PLAXIS 2D pseudo-static approach proves to be suitable to determine the critical acceleration of an anchored sheet pile structure in contrast to pseudo-dynamic approach which appears less suitable for that matter. In addition the performance-based design principle is linked to the present study so that an idea about the seismic performance limits of anchored sheet pile quay walls in quantitative terms can be provided. As a result of the present study findings it is recommended to perform more extensive research on the ability of permanent-displacement analysis to evaluate the amount of sliding displacement of an anchored sheet pile quay wall. In line with this recommendation it is found that further research on site-response analysis is desirable in the application of simplified dynamic and dynamic analysis. In general it is recommended to create more seismic test cases with different setups for a broader validity of the present results, to develop a seismic test case for the Groningen earthquake situation, to add measurement instrumentation to new and existing structures for verification of research results and to make such (raw) measurement data available to the public.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Structures & Flood Risk","",""

(mentor); De Kreuk, M.K. (mentor); Van Lier, J.B. (mentor); Ng, H.Y. (mentor)","2015","The wastewater infrastructure in Singapore is undergoing a major revamp, which includes the construction of a new water reclamation plant (WRP) in Tuas. This plant aims to maximise the energy recovered from wastewater, with the ultimate aim of achieving energy self-sufficiency. The Integrated Validation Plant (IVP) is a 1000 m3/day pilot plant equipped with an AB configuration. The A-stage biosorption process increases the amount of COD recovered in the primary sludge to increase biogas production, whereas the B-stage membrane bioreactor (MBR) treats the wastewater using activated sludge. The effluent then undergoes reverse osmosis (RO) to produce potable water. This report investigates the biological treatment process in the IVP and aims to answer the following question: Given that most WRP in Singapore uses the Modified Ludzack-Ettinger configuration (MLE; also known as the pre-denitrification configuration) for the B-stage, will a change in configuration reduce net energy consumption while achieving good effluent quality? The research is divided into three main parts with the following objectives: 1. To create and calibrate a Biowin model to simulate the biological treatment process in the IVP 2. To optimise the MBR B-stage by finding the configuration and operating conditions that requires the least influent COD to achieve acceptable effluent quality (in terms of COD, nitrogen and phosphorus), and to determine the appropriate changes in the A-stage (if any) that is required to achieve this effluent quality 3. To explore issues facing the IVP and future developments of wastewater treatment in Singapore – effect of an unaerated deoxygenation tank, feasibility of mainstream Anammox, and modification of the treatment process to reduce chemical dosage in the downstream RO process The Biowin model for the MBR was first calibrated using jar tests and oxygen uptake tests, then validated with profile studies that are being carried out in the MBR regularly. It was found that Biowin is able to model the biological treatment process relatively well, with the major discrepancy being that Biowin is not able to model ammonia adsorption onto activated sludge in the anoxic zone. With the calibrated model, various configurations and operating conditions were simulated to optimise the MBR. It was found that the optimal configuration is the Anoxic-Oxic-Anoxic-Oxic (AOAO) configuration with a step feed of 50% of the influent entering the first anoxic zone and 50% entering the second anoxic zone. The return activated sludge (RAS) flow should be 73% of the influent flow and the DO in the aerated tanks should be maintained at 1 mg/l. As the biosorption tank at the IVP is not functioning well, data was obtained from another biosorption pilot plant in Singapore to calibrate the A-stage. Using this calibrated biosorption model, the optimal MBR configuration, and the typical raw influent characteristics for the IVP, it was determined that a functioning biosorption stage will result in insufficient COD entering the MBR for sufficient phosphorus removal. To achieve the required effluent quality, the best option during steady state operations would be to reduce the sludge retention time (SRT) of the biosorption process from 0.5 days to 0.32 days by increasing sludge wastage as this leads to the highest overall COD recovery. On the other hand, the best method to cope with sudden increases in the nitrogen and phosphorus load in the raw influent would be to partially bypass the biosorption tank and divert some of the raw influent to the primary clarifier as this option results in the fastest response in the effluent quality. As the membrane tanks in the MBR are aerated to scour the membranes and minimise fouling, the mixed liquor in the tanks have a high concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO). A small deoxygenation tank is installed after the membrane tanks to allow DO to deplete before the mixed liquor is recycled back to the anoxic zone at the start of the MBR. However, the deoxygenation tank is not functioning well due to the presence of a cascade overflow from the membrane tanks. Simulations show that the presence of residual DO in the recycle stream leads to a large deterioration the biological phosphorus removal performance of the MBR, mainly due to reduced COD availability for the polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAOs). Modifications to reduce the impact of the cascade include the installation of baffle walls, slopes, or overflow pipes. One of the technologies for B-stage that can allow even higher COD recovery is mainstream Anammox for nitrogen removal, which consumes less COD than conventional nitrogen-removal processes. As it works best at temperatures of about 30oC, it may be suitable for implementation in Singapore where the average wastewater temperature is about 31oC. Biowin simulations revealed that mainstream Anammox can occur under the local conditions, with CANON and DEMON configurations being more suitable than the SHARON-Anammox configuration. However, a very high solids removal efficiency in the primary clarifier is required to remove sufficient COD in the A-stage for Anammox to develop in the B-stage. Further studies would be required to determine if this is achievable under local conditions. Lastly, the MBR effluent is sent to a RO process to be reclaimed as potable water. Ammonia and sodium hypochlorite is first added to produce chloramine to prevent biofouling and provide the necessary residual disinfection. it was found that the ammonia concentration in the MBR effluent can be increased sufficiently to remove the need for ammonia dosage. However, the reduced nitrification also resulted in a higher nitrite concentration in the effluent, increasing the amount of sodium hypochlorite needed to produce the required chloramine as sodium hypochlorite also oxidises nitrite into nitrate. In addition, the dosage of anti-scalants can be reduced with better phosphorus removal as the lower effluent phosphorus leads to less scaling potential in the RO process by calcium phosphate.","Biowin; wastewater treatment; Singapore","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Sanitary Engineering","","1.3, 103.8"

(mentor)","2015","Due to fierce competition on the electricity market, many wind energy related research projects are currently aimed at cost reduction. In order to establish cost reduction, more and more wind turbines are being clustered in (offshore) wind farms. Major drawback of wind farms however, is the energy production loss due to aerodynamic wake interaction between wind turbines. Optimizing wind turbine rotor designs on wind farm scale instead of focussing on wind turbine level, can increase the energy production of a wind farm. In the current project, optimization problems have been investigated that manipulate wind turbine thrust and power curves. The thrust and power curves were manipulated by Matlab's optimization toolbox, using built-in optimization algorithms. The optimization algorithm aims to reduce wake losses, which results in the maximum annual energy production of a wind farm. ECN's wind farm-wake simulation tool “FarmFlow-fast” was used to calculate the annual energy production of a wind farm, for each evaluated set of optimization parameter values. The current project involved two main objectives. First, the FarmFlow-fast model was validated for optimization purposes. This was done by comparing simulation data with power measurement data from the Horns Rev and Lillgrund wind farms. Secondly, the potential of wind turbine performance curve optimization was investigated. This was done by investigating multiple scenarios, in which the increase in annual energy production of a wind farm was calculated as function of the wind turbine thrust and power curves. It is found that FarmFlow-fast is capable to be used for optimization purposes. The most suitable optimization algorithm, concerning time consumption and objective function value decrement, was the “pattern search” algorithm. Unique optimum performance curves were found, depending on the wind farm layout, accounted wind speed and direction ranges and the parametrization and optimization method. Although the potential increase in annual energy production was rather small, the thrust reduction on wind turbine rotors around rated wind speed might as well be an important outcome of the optimization runs. The thrust reduction can result in cheaper wind turbine designs, which might even be a more promising result in terms of cost of energy reduction than the increase in annual energy production. The results of this project contribute to choosing new design parameters for future wind turbine rotor designs, in order to minimize the costs of energy.","Windenergy; Wind farm; Wind turbine; Optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics & Wind Energy","","Wind Energy","","52.78028, 4.67763"

(mentor); Makinwa, K.A.A. (mentor)","2015","In speed skating, the frontal area of the athlete is one of the major factors that influences the aerody- namic drag he/she experiences [1]. The athlete can minimise the frontal area by going lower, and thus bending more his/her knees. O’Sports would like to manufacture the GonioTrainer, a device that will measure the knee of the skater and provide a stimulus to remind the skater to stay low. In order to make this possible, sensors to measure the knee angle and an Inertial Measurement Unit are used to record the athlete gestures. Data storage needs to be implemented to analyse the data afterwards on a dedicated computer. The system must be designed as efficient as possible with scalability in mind, resulting in a system ready for production. This is the motivation behind the BSc thesis work presented in this document. This thesis project focuses on the development of the GonioTrainer’s measurement module, or go- niometer: a microcontroller connecting the peripherals and controlling the signals. Measuring the knee angle and an Inetrial Measuremet Unit was done through I?C at a sample rate of 100Hz. Storing the raw data on a flash memory was possible through SPI and as well as transferring the contents to a smart- phone though Bluetooth. Once the information is on a smartphone, it can be uploaded to an internet server for easy access. Also, a special peak detection algorithm for speed skating was developed and explained in appendix A of this document. Transferring the sensors measurements in real time to the smartphone was not possible due to software/hardware conflicts. Note that the GonioTrainer emerged from the idea to improve the performance of ice-skaters, but the end product is ready to be used within different sport disciplines, once the conflicts are solved.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2018-12-31","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electronic Instrumentation","","","",""

This office building was built in 1991 for the Ministry of VROM (Housing, Spatial planning and Environment) and has to be transformed to house the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment. This assignment has to be seen in light of the recent changes in government policy. As a result of large budget cuts the dutch government has implemented a number of measures to reduce its size and save costs. This new policy, that strives for a smaller governmental institution, is based on a flexible and multifunctional office that can facilitate any government institution at any time. The offices are developed without a user in mind: independent of individuals or organizations that will use them in the future. With my graduation project I have tried to provide an alternative to this method where the design of the office building does not start with quantifying but with characters of the various types of spaces you could provide to work in. An office building that is conceived as a collection of various different spaces and ways of working with different characters. My perception is that the government office building should take a stand in this debate and open up to the public by providing a place of work for both civil servants and the public and in this way represent the transparency of their institution. The former VROM-building will work as the perfect example as it already combines two ministries in one building – thus in need for common ground – and is located in the center of The Hague along its primary pedestrian route.","office; The Hague; interiors; public interior; Jan Hoogstad; VROM; ministry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-07-05","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Architecture of the Interior","",""

During this project a software system for this new gateway has been developed, which allows several third-party ZigBee-enabled devices to connect to the gateway. The software system allows for remotely retrieving real-time device data and modifying the configurations of devices connected to the IoT gateway. Measurement data of the devices connected to the gateway is automatically stored by the developed software solution and regularly pushed to the DSP cloud servers via a secure connection. The historical data in the DSP cloud servers can be used by the already existing SWYCS software solutions to provide their customers with insights of their energy usage and automatically assisting them in achieving energy savings in their company.

However, the effectiveness of foam is hard to predict due to its complex behavior. Therefore accurate modeling is important to effectively predict field performance. This requires correct foam parameters in reservoir simulation. These parameters can be fit to laboratory data where gas is injected into surfactant-saturated rock samples. Foam simulation models can be used to translate experimental laboratory data to the field scale. Unfortunately, the widely used local equilibrium model assumes instant local equilibrium everywhere, while the lab data shows dynamic behavior. Distortion in late-time simulation results of the model could occur as consequence of not having a good fit in the dynamic period, where the chosen foam modeling parameters are incorrect. The aim of this paper is to research how much influence this mismatch has on the fit of the model to the laboratory data, which is taken from literature. Testing will be performed with the use of a one-dimensional dynamic foam model. The findings in this work do not indicate clear evidence that fitting long-time behavior is distorted by disregarding a good fit in dynamic short-time behavior. This means that the researched modeling parameters could be correct in predicting local equilibrium behavior.

In this bachelor thesis we focus on performing quantum gates on multiple qubits simultaneously, when transition frequencies of different qubits are close to each other. The existing solution is designed to perform a quantum gate on one qubit, while eliminating all the effects on the other one. We develop a procedure to create new analytic pulse shapes which produce low-error gates for single qubits and we generalize this approach to multi-qubit systems to apply multiple quantum gates at the same time. For both single- and two-qubit gates these new pulses reduce errors by several orders of magnitude compared to simple driving pulses. In addition we combine these optimal analytical pulse shapes with multi-parameter pulses. The parameters of this additional pulse are optimized numerically, to produce even lower gate errors.","transmon qubit; qubit gates; pulse optimization","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Kavli Institute of Nanoscience Delft","","Theory","",""

(mentor); Slinger, J.H. (mentor); Van den Bos, J.P. (mentor); Hermans, A. (mentor); Brocklehurst, J. (mentor)","2015","The offshore wind industry is a growing market in Europe due to the sustainable energy targets of European Union. In the coming years the Dutch government will invest in offshore wind farms at the North Sea. For a contractor like Boskalis the inclusion of favorable ecological conditions in designs is a unique selling point and can help to win tenders to build offshore wind farms and acquire projects. This was the starting point of this thesis. The thesis is split up in two parts. The first part is an extensive literature study and searches for opportunities and influencing parameters to provide favorable ecological conditions for marine life. The second part of the thesis will explore one opportunity in detail, which can be included in bed protection design of offshore wind farms. The research question is formulated as follows: ""How can technical aspects of bed protection designs of offshore wind turbines be altered to provide favorable ecological conditions for marine life?"" Part I: Literature review and parameter study In the first part of the thesis interviews with ecologists are conducted to gain knowledge about ecological systems, and to explore the social acceptability besides the motivation to win tenders. The ecologists don’t support installations of offshore wind farms, because it is not natural and anthropogenic interferences are in principal not good. However, in the past a significant part of the North Sea floor consisted of hard substrate, but due to trawling activities by humans this hard substrate is removed. Nowadays the North Sea floor consists of sand. By placing stones for the bed protection of offshore wind farms, hard substrate will be added which was present in the past. So, the hard substrate balance will more or less be restored. Furthermore, offshore wind turbines will be built, so then it is better to build them properly and in consultation with the environment. In the extensive literature study a technical analysis and an ecological analysis are conducted. During this literature study the context and scope of this research are defined. The scope is set to the bed protection of one offshore wind turbine. The technical analysis resulted in the structure, failure mechanisms, and design calculations of the bed protection. The ecological analysis focuses on the two key species, and biodiversity in general. The key species are the European lobsters and the European cod. The outcome of the literature study is a list of controllable parameters for functional requirements. This is a list with potential parameters in combining favorable ecological conditions and technical requirements. From this list the pore-size distribution is chosen to investigate in further detail. The pore-size distribution includes the cavity sizes and openings in which species can find shelter. The parameter study and selection of the parameter pore-size distribution is the outcome of the first part of this thesis. ? Part II: Model and interpretation The second part of the thesis focuses on the pore-size distribution and the pore openings, derived from a stone-size distribution. Furthermore, it focuses on the ecological interpretation of the derived distributions. First of all models are designed and evaluated to crack this problem. The chosen models are an analytical model of spheres and an experimental model. The analytical model of spheres is based on geometry and is derived to give indications and to validate the results of experimental model. The analytical model provides results to describe the pore size and the pore openings of uniform spheres. The pore-size distribution of multi-sized spheres could not be derived. However, the pore-opening distribution of multi-sized spheres is derived. The results of this distribution are approximated with a curve fit of a normal distribution. The experimental model is executed with a medical CT scanner and imaging software. First, a test scan is made to identify the possibilities and limits of this method. Secondly, a validation scan is made of glass balls to explore the errors and the accuracy of the medical CT scanner and the imaging software. The results of the validation scan are compared with the analytical results. Both models showed the same result. Therefore, an experimental program is designed and 8 scans are performed on stones (quarry material). The sieve curve of the stones is in advance specified and manufactured. The formula that describes the pore-size distribution, after analyzing the scans with the imaging program and post-processing of the data, is derived. Also a formula that describes the number of pores is found. The pore openings are also investigated during the same experiment. However, the constriction-size distribution is not derived using the experimental model. Most of the constrictions are connected using this model. Therefore, a few constrictions are manually investigated and the results could not falsify the analytical results. The derived formulas for the pore-size distribution and the pore opening distribution are applied on a brief case study of a bed protection of an offshore wind turbine. In this calculation example, the pore sizes are compared with the preferred pore sizes for the lobster. Targeted pore sizes can be created by applying another grading width, other stone sizes, or changing the porosity. In this way the bed protection could be adapted to the preferences of the lobster. The research question is answered within the scope of this research: the pore-size distribution is one of the technical aspects found, which can be included and altered in bed protection designs to provide favorable ecological conditions for marine life. The pore-size distribution has until now not been included in bed protection designs, while, in fact, it is always installed. This distribution can be derived, and future bed protections can be designed based on favorable cavity sizes for species, as well as technical stability. This holds for the constriction-size distribution. The main recommendation for the industry is: The pore-size distribution can be included in future designs to estimate the impact of the structure on the species. Moreover, designs of civil rock works can be based on the preferred pore sizes for native species. This fits perfectly in the philosophy of Building with Nature. The four main recommendation for further research are: * Testing this principle with an ecological pilot. * Scanning and analyzing more samples to make the formula statistical more reliable. * Further development of the experimental model. Extra properties of the pores, such as the shape, can be derived and included in the model. * Adding more species by describing the limiting conditions of these species in a matrix.","offshore wind turbine; ecology; lobsters; pore-size; pore-openings; spheres; CT scanner; Avizo Fire","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-06-25","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

To compare treatments we have developed a new method to look at other optimal solutions on the Pareto front around a given solution. This is done by quickly using of the reference point method.

The service works like a priority inbox for pull requests, recommending the top pull requests the project owner should focus on. It keeps the pull request list up-to-date when pull requests are merged or closed. In addition, the service provides functionality that GitHub is currently lacking. We implemented pairwise pull request conflict detection and several new filter and sorting options e.g. the pull request’s size.

Two implementations are discussed: an RGB (Red, Green and Blue) sensor and a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR). The former setup identifies colour variations while the latter detects intensity changes in the whole spectrum. The data acquisition is realised by means of an Arduino as Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC), which sends the information to a computer via a continuous data link. The processing of the received data is then performed inMATLAB. This document reports the progress and achieved results of the project. At first, the theory behind the measured parameters will be discussed. A concept is designed to proof the principle of measuring colour variations by an RGB sensor and LDR. The next step is constructing a setup that is able to detect skin discolouration, caused by the pulsating blood flow. This periodically changing skin colour can be characterised by amplitude differences. To distinguish the heart rate from noise artefacts, a peak detection algorithm and a Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) are used. The results of all techniques are subsequently discussed. A conclusion is drawn about these results, after which future recommendations are discussed. Both the RGB and LDR concept were able to detect colour variations. Although the results of the simulated RGB setup showed promising results, actual skin discolouration measurements did not have consistent results. The LDR configuration did however identify colour intensity changes, resulting in a measurable heartbeat.","heart rate; heartbeat; colour","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Bachelor Electrical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Lourens, E. (mentor); Sanchez Gomez, S. (mentor); Houben, J.M. (mentor)","2015","The resistance of buildings to static loads is very well defined and regulated in codes compared with the resistance to dynamic loads. However in particular for high-rise buildings the resistance to dynamic loading is of great importance for the design and much less defined. The magnitude of vibrations depends on mass, stiffness and damping properties of the building and on the loading frequency. Damping is the most important factor to reduce the amplitude of vibration at resonance. Whereas stiffness and mass can be determined quite accurately during the design phase of a building for damping it is not yet possible to give an accurate prediction in the design phase. The empirical fomula's developed by Jeary (1986), Tamura (2003, 2012), Lagomarisono (1993) and Davenport and Hill-Carol (1986) based on full-scale measurements in Japan, United States, Italy and Great Brittain show large deviations in the predicted damping values. Damping in buildings can be assigned to structural damping, aerodynamic damping, intrinsic material damping, radiation damping, damping in non-structural elements and to additional dampers. Damping in floors both comprises intrinsic material damping and structural damping. The Eurocode prescribes damping ratio's of 1% to 2% for buildings categorized in steel buildings, concrete buildings or a combination of both. Full scale measurements in the Netherlands showed a scatter in damping ratio's between 1% and 3.5% and no clear distinction between material types could be made. Damping is not only dependent on structural properties of all individual components, but also on loading and on response characteristics. Understanding the influence of individual components to damping is key to predict damping in a building accurately. In this research project the focus will be on the contribution of damping in floors to the damping ratio of sender dutch high-rise buildings under wind loading. Here both damping in structural parts, in the connections between the floor and the main structure, and damping in floor-materials are studied. The goal of this thesis is to describe the damping mechanisms present in floors when buildings are excited by wind load using an simple analytical model. A one-dimensional model is designed, representing the expected behavior of floors in buildings based on the structural lay-out of dutch high-rise buildings. This model consists of an Euler-Bernoulli beam element including material damping following Kelvin-Voight's model and at both boundaries a rational spring, viscous damper and coulomb friction damper representing the structural damping. A solution for the model response is calculated using the Galerkin Approximation Method, where the product of linear modes shapes based on linear boundary conditions and generalized time dependent coordinates approximate the solution, combined with numerical integration following Runge-Kutta. These methods provided accurate solutions. The model was validated with an experiment. The set-up enclosed two steel columns, hinged connected to the floor, and a concrete bar, clamped between the two steel profiles. Some adjustments on the joint lay-out were made during the experiments. Measured accelerations showed a highly damped system and the decrease of amplitude of vibration was accompanied by a decrease in damping ratio's. Odd modes of the beam coincided with the natural frequencies of the system, with a clear first natural frequency. Strong coupling of higher modes was present at high amplitudes of vibration at the small beginning of the response, but these faded out quickly. Small changes in the natural frequencies of the system with time were detected, but for a founded conclusion further studies are recommended on this subject. A comparison of the experimental outcome with the analytical one-dimensional model was made and a good fit for the computed response was found. In further studies extension of the model to include a second lateral dimension and torsional modes can be made, or a calibration algorithm can be developed to determine an optimal fit for the damping parameters. Also experiments to study the non-linear material properties of concrete during high amplitude vibrations can be performed in future research to obtain more understanding the damping mechanisms in floors.","dynamics; buildings; vibrations; galerkin; damping","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Mechanics","","Structural Engineering","",""

Even if improvements are attempted on either of them, significant problems occur such as the accuracy of input data for the simulation or the large duration of sufficient measurements. According to the latest research, a significant uncertainty is stemming from the calculation of the space heating requirements. The goal of this study is to increase the input data accuracy for some of the most influential parameters for this calculation, focusing on those depending on the characteristics of the building envelope. These include the U-values of building elements, infiltration factors and the solar gain factors of the windows. To achieve this goal, an automated process is developed, where by calibrating an energy simulation model (BPS) of a house with a sample of actual measured data, an estimation of its real parameters can be produced. This is then used to verify its design, assess the efficiency of its building envelope and create the basis for estimating its yearly energy consumption. The measured data is originating from monitoring the Prêt-à-Loger house, a prototype refurbishment system designed with the intention to render the terraced houses of the Netherlands energy neutral. A sensitivity analysis is first conducted to estimate the relative importance of each parameter in terms of simulation error and energy. The process then succeeds on indicating some difference between live measurements and the simulation produced by the parameter values documented in the design. By treating these parameters as unknown, a model calibration process is set to find them, as in the case of an old house where material properties are lost or undocumented. The process is finally resulting on an adequate range of as-built parameters, validated against further measurements with an acceptable error.","building performance simulation; actual performance; model calibration; pret-a-loger; dutch residential sector","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural and Building Engineering","",""

In particular, an algorithm was given to determine whether a binary network is tree-based or not. Here we give a simple graph-theoretic classification of all tree-based and non-tree-based binary phylogenetic networks. In addition, we give an upper bound on how many leaves need to be added to make any binary network tree-based. We also give an upper bound for the number of base trees that a tree-based binary phylogenetic network contains. Finally, since there has not been done any previous research on the tree-basedness of non-binary phylogenetic networks, some theorems of the binary case are studied and checked whether they also apply in the non-binary case. We show that some of these theorems apply in the non-binary case and some do not.

(mentor); Borgart, A. (mentor); Smits, J.E.P. (mentor)","2015","Ever since the idea of truss structures was conceived and later were expanded into three dimensional structures forming space frames, jointing has been a challenge. The evolution of jointing systems includes three main methods: connection with a node, connection with a prefabricated unit and connection without a node (e.g. welding). Delving more into the jointing methods with the use of a node, it comes out that most of the in-market available nodes for free form structures are quite complicated, multi-component, requiring time- and money-costing assembling. Moreover, being mass produced, they often use more material than would probably be needed so that they can be applicable to a variety of cases. On the hand, the development of computational design tools has led to architectural forms of extremely high complexity, which require equally complicated structural systems. However, why should these complicated, in terms of design, structural systems demand complicated jointing systems as well? And once simplicity and one-component design is ensured how can such a node be fabricated? This research aims to explore the feasibility of simplifying the jointing systems of large span spatial free form structures by additively manufactured algorithmically form generated nodes with pin-joint connections. The simple pin joint connection of MERO systems has been adopted and proposed as the jointing system of the attached bars with equally simple one-component nodes, form generated by an algorithm. Additive manufacturing’s capability of fabricating forms of high complexity can be a solution for such highly individualized nodes, optimized to bear the loads applied to their location, optimizing material usage, minimizing the total weight and cost of the structure - since they are responsible for a substantial ratio of the structure’s weight - and reducing the cost of additive manufacturing and overall construction. The first part of the research, focuses on finding the optimum additive manufacturing technique in combination with some candidate materials complying with the required mechanical and material properties of nodes. The second part where the form generating algorithm is developed, explains the generic rules related to mechanics and the constraints of additive manufacturing processes. A proposed free form double layer free form structure is used as a test case to prove the concept.","space frame structure; node; form generation; algorithmic; structural optimization; additive manufacturing; carbon fibre reinforced plastics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-01-01","Architecture and The Built Environment","Building Technology","","Design Informatics & Structural Mechanics","",""

(mentor); Veer, F. (mentor); Bokel, R. (mentor); Oikonomopoulou, P. (mentor)","2015","There are already lot of glass structures, using big size elements that prove that glass is a strong material that can compete the other more conventional building materials. However, the use of solid cast glass bricks glued with a transparent UV cured adhesive is not common and it is first utilized in the façade of the Crystal House in Amsterdam, designed by MVRDV and Gietermans & Van Dijk (the project is under construction by the time that this report is written). The structure is exclusively constructed by monolithic glass blocks, bonded with a colorless, UV-curing adhesive, obtaining thus a maximum transparency. In contrast with other structural systems that used solid glass bricks in the past, the desired structural performance is achieved solely through the masonry system, without any opaque substructure. In the present design, there is an attempt of exploring the structural and thermal potentials of this new technology, by studying them in a 4 times bigger scale than the one in P.C. Hooftsraat. It provides an elaborated research of the integrated architectural, structural and thermal design and discusses the choice of materials, structural solutions, passive and active measures. The structural verification of the system is enhanced by experimental tests about the structural and thermal integrity of the glass brock system. More specifically, compression and four point bending experiments demonstrate the required monolithic structural performance of the glass block-adhesive assembly. All specimens failed in the glass; no delamination occurred. At the same time, an elaborated architectural and structural design in the interior of the building with the use of only structural glass elements is illustrated in the research. Apart from the bigger scale of the glass brick façade compared to the one in Amsterdam, a challenge in the research is the innovative approach of the construction of the column. There are two slender columns in the design that are made by glass bricks glued with the transparent adhesive as in the façade. The results show that the adhesively bonded glass block structure has the required self-structural behavior, but only if strict tolerances are met in the geometry of the glass blocks. The connections between the two materials (glass and concrete) as well as between the cast and float glass have been structurally calculated accompanying by 3d impressions. Finally, several thermal simulations of different scenarios in the design of the building in three different climate zones (Amsterdam, Valencia, Tampere) are given, showing the importance of the application of passive measures in order to improve the thermal performance and increase the sustainability value of the design. At the end of this report, alternatives in the design are given in order to stimulate future research on this new, lot of promising technology. Undoubtedly, there are still lot of potentials to be explored.

In this report we study Markov processes with two time scales where the difference between the time speed of the scales is asymptotically large. In such a situation the behaviour of the process can be estimated by substituting the ""faster"" process by its limiting process. We will introduce Markov processes and study in particular Markov processes with two time scales in the limit where one of the time scales is much faster than the other. Later we will prove statements about the behaviour for a general situation. Finally, two interesting applications of this scenario will be discussed.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics","","","",""

The abundant wind resource has pushed the wind farms into deep water sites. The floating VAWT concept is emerges as the times require. This research is part of Deepwind concept development. The project focuses on verifying the feasibility of using flap control to increase the power conversion of a VAWT through the numerical investigation. As a preliminary implementation, only a 2-D section is taken out from the Darrieus rotor as the modeled object. The report concentrates on the purely aerodynamic modeling of a VAWT. All the blades are assumed to be fully rigid in order to exempt the structural response. VAWTs present a distinct aerodynamic pattern from HAWT. To start up, a historical review on the aerodynamic models of VAWTs is performed to recap the critical issues in the aerodynamic modeling. The study mainly emphasizes on the momentum models, covers SST, MST, DMST and Actuator Cylinder (AC) models. AC mainly advantages on including the lateral inductions, and the wake interaction. Its precise prediction was confirmed in the simulation results of the aerodynamic model comparison study [10]. Hence, AC has been chosen as the numerical tool for VAWT modeling, both for the self-developed routine and HAWC2. A promising solution to determine the load-form for optimal power is constructing a uniform distribution so that the power coefficient could reach Betz limit. The normal load distribution on the blade path is the link between the power conversion and the blade force. At the moment of the determination of the load distribution that leads to the optimal power, the required blade force at the different azimuth positions are also settled. The simulations are performed with TSR=2, 3, 4, and 5 to verify the possibility on achieving the ideal power production in order to draw up an optimized control option. The result of the study is presented as a form of different flap angles at discretized azimuth positions. Even though the load-form is universal, the resultant flap variation only works for the specific rotor because of the introduction of airfoil data in the computation. An H-rotor VAWT with aps is set up in HAWC2 to validate the control strategy. As the supplement to AC model, a dynamic stall model called ATEFlap is integrated in HAWC2 to calculate the dynamic stall impact, and the influences from flap detection for the given airfoil. The model is supposed to return the aerodynamic loading of the blades under the dynamic stall. Hence, the deviations between the target load distribution obtained from the quasi-steady environment and the semi-dynamic one is observed as expected. In the end, the aps running with the given function could almost give the desired loading, but the deviations are observed in downwind part. It is mainly the hysteresis of the lift coefficient causes the difference. It is proven to be partly made up by increasing the flap deflections in the downwind side.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""
