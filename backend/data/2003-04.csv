(mentor); Van Mazijk, A. (mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor); Van de Kreeke, J. (mentor)","2003","Tidal inlets are connections between small, shallow bays and the sea. In a tide-dominated environment, the status of this inlet is a balance between local given conditions such as channel geometry, and the hydraulic environment. According to Escoffier, we already know when the equilibrium is disrupted, it should generally return to its original state. In tidal lagoon systems with more inlets, it is more uncertain to predict a stable condition for each inlet. There are cases where some channels will close and others stay open, while other systems remain overall stable, i.e. each inlet has an equilibrium state. An analytical method to determine this stability is yet no available. Therefore, the focus attends to research a model bay system with two ocean inlets, where there could be an unconditionally stable environment. Next, a double inlet lagoon system is modelled: this consists of a bay area with no significant shape, two channels with relevant friction and inertia parameters and an idealized ocean tide, with a tidal range and phase at each inlet. Also, a second model is created where the bay area is (virtually) split up. On each model, a series of tests has been done with calculation and graphic software. Every inlet has an equilibrium flow curve, i.e. a cross-sectional area where the maximum currents are just enough to flush sediment and keeping the channel open. If this is the case for both cross-sections, the whole lagoon system is referred to as stable (E-type flow condition). In the graphic image, this is shown by four intersections of the equilibrium flow curves, where the stable intersection is the black dot. The normal model bay system showed that a stable condition exists when the tidal range at the seaside is different at each inlet, provided that this is not too large. In addition, the channels should be sufficiently short, with friction not too high. This is also valid for higher tidal ranges, where this critical difference is even smaller. The bay system with the partition had the same stability conditions. Higher tide levels at both inlets could also ensure stability, as the inlet in the partition becomes relatively small. Next, the E-type flow condition is more likely if this third inlet is smaller or longer. Further, the ratio in bay area on either side of the partition channel has some negative influence on this, but in combination with tide difference, a balanced system can remain. The models are further implemented on a present-day situation, a lagoon inlet system located in the Hue province in Vietnam. Here, there are two inlets, located far apart, letting the system be relatively stable. In this particular case, repeated flooding and breaching of the sand barrier resulted into another inlet next to the main inlet in the northern part of the lagoon. The appearance of this third channel has raised the question whether the two close inlets could be stable, although the authorities would rather have this channel closed. The partition model indicated that this could be the case. Although the lagoon is also largely influenced by frequent storm surges and river runoff, the tidal inlet model is a useful tool in order to understand the basic behaviour of this lagoon better.","","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor); Wang, Z.B. (mentor); Van der Valk, L. (mentor); Huisman, P. (mentor)","2003","This study is a part of the EU-funded project DINAS-COAST intended to predict the global impact of climate change on the coastal zone for the next 100 years. The objective of this project is the development of a tool which can assess the effects of different climate scenarios. As a part of this tool an algorithm is developed which predicts the influences of relative sealevel rise on coasts interrupted by tidal basins, in terms of loss of land and loss of sand which would be required to restore the present situation. As base of the algorithm the ASMITA-model is used (Stive et al. 1998). The model predicts the adaptation-capability of a tidal inlet to increasing sea-level rise, based on the ratio between transport rate into the system and the rate of sea-level rise. Previous studies studying the Wadden Sea inlets (Van Goor et al, 2001) showed that there exists a critical rate of sea-level rise, above which the system is no longer capable to follow sea-level rise and the tidal basin will drown. A major problem in predicting the adaptation-capability in the present study is the applicability on world wide scale. As the model is applied to all tidal lagoons in the world for several climate scenarios, the even relatively simple ASMITA model needs to be simplified furthermore. Second, the availability of data on global scale is restricted. Based on the ETOPO2 data-set the general characteristics (size, tidal range etc.) of about 200 tidal lagoons have been collected. Empirical relations are used to estimate the missing geometric parameters and the coefficients in the algorithm are determined by the Wadden Sea derived values (the default setting). But the user of the DIVA-tool will be allowed to replace the default setting by more detailed information for more accurate predictions. The analysis of the tidal inlets in the world showed that the socalled 'micro-tidal' areas (like Baltic Sea and Mediterranean Sea) will drown before 2100 with a sea-level rise of 6 mm/y, this is due a small tidal prism resulting in a low sediment-import rate. As sea-level rise is still increasing till 2100, the remainder of the tidal areas will not have reached their dynamic equilibrium state. In 2500 the tidal inlets are closer to their dynamic equilibrium state and more tidal areas will have been drowned. These areas have a critical sea-level rise that is lower than the 6 mm/y and this is mainly influenced by the size of the area. Large areas need more sediment to compensate the lose of volume due to sea-level rise, and therefore they have a lower critical sea-level rise.","","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor)","2003","Het zoeken naar een geschikte locatie voor een nieuw aan te leggen vliegveld heeft in Nederland al tot vele studies geleid. Een van de altrnatieve locaties voor het huidige Schiphol is een nog aan te leggen eiland in de Noordzee en wordt 'Schiphol in zee' genoemd. Bij grootschalige landaanwinning in open zee worden twee verschillende types zeewering vaak toegepast. Deze twee types zijn een harde en een zachte wering. Een harde wering wordt gevormd door een ringdijk. Een zachte wering wordt volledig opgespoten, waarbij een natuurlijk dwarsprofiel ontstaat van zand. Een zeewering, die nog niet vaak is toegepast, is het hangende strand concept. Het hangende strand concept bestaat uit twee strekdammen aan de randen van de kust met een onderwaterdam tussen de uiteinden. Tussen de strekdammen en de onderwaterdam wordt een zandprofiel aangebracht. Een zachte wering is op de geplande locatie van het eiland niet gewenst, vanwege erosie van het eiland en de ligging tussen twee vaargeulen. Het doel van deze studie is te onderzoeken of een hangend strand concept technisch mogelijk is als zeewering voor de westelijke kust van Schiphol in zee, waarbij het ook economisch een aantrekkelijk altematief biedt voor een harde wering. Het hangende strand concept is technisch mogelijk, als dit in langs- en in dwarsrichting in evenwicht is. Het hangende strand concept is financieel een aantrekkelijk alternatief als het goedkoper is dan een harde wering. Een harde wering moet meters boven het gemiddelde zeeniveau uitsteken om de maatgevende omstandigheden te kunnen weerstaan en het zand aan de landzijde te kunnen keren. Een globaal ontwerp van een harde wering is gemaakt en de kosten hiervan zijn berekend. Een schatting van de kosten van een harde wering voor de westelijke kust is 1,672 miljard euro. Het hangende strand concept is in langsrichting in evenwicht, als er over een lange periode netto geen langstransport is. Dit kan worden bewerkstelligd door de kust zo te oriënteren op de golven, dat deze per saldo geen langstransport veroorzaken. Deze oriëntatie is onderzocht voor drie ontwerpen. Het voornaamste verschil tussen de ontwerpen is de hoogte van de onderwaterdam. De lengte van het dwarsprofiel is afhankelijk van de hoogte van de onderwaterdam. De drie onderzochte hoogtes van de onderwaterdammen zijn NAP -5,0 m, NAP -2,0 m en NAP-niveau. Voor de berekeningen is gebruik gemaakt van de gegevens van Meetpost Noordwijk. De orientatie, die evenwicht geeft, vertoont grote verschillen over de jaren heen voor alle ontwerpen. Voor de ontwerpen met een onderwaterdam tot NAP -5,0 m en NAP -2,0 m is een orientatie gekozen van 279 graden (de kust met een noord- zuid orientatie is 9 graden gedraaid met de klok mee). Het ontwerp met de onderwaterdam tot NAP-niveau krijgt een orientatie van 283 graden. De gekozen orientaties zijn de uitkomst van de meeste simulaties en zijn de mediaan van de berekende orientaties van de laatste tien gesimuleerde jaren. Daarnaast liggen de gekozen orientaties in het midden tussen de extreme waardes (255 graden en 305 graden). Het langstransport is onderzocht met de gevonden orientatie. Het langstransport neemt duidelijk af, als de onderwaterdam hoger is. De grootte van het langstransport binnen het hangende strand concept is bij een onderwaterdam tot NAP ongeveer 23% van het langstransport bij een hangend strand met een onderwaterdam tot NAP -5,0 m. Voor het hangende strand concept met een onderwaterdam tot NAP -5,0 m en tot NAP -2,0 m blijkt het nodig te zijn aanvullende maatregelen te treffen om plaatselijke achteruitgang van meer dan 50 m van de kustlijn te voorkomen. Het langstransport is bij deze ontwerpen dusdanig groot, dat een verandering van de orientatie van de kust binnen enkele jaren bereikt kan worden. Bij een verandering van de orientatie van meer dan 0,57 graden wordt de kustlijn plaatselijk meer dan 50 m verschoven. Aanvullende maatregelen om voor- en achteruitgang van de kust te voorkomen blijken bij het hangende strand concept met een onderwaterdam tot NAP niet noodzakelijk te zijn. Het langtransport is hier niet groot genoeg om binnen de onderzochte periode een verschuiving van de kustlijn van meer dan 50 m te veroorzaken. Een volledige inrichting van de kust van het hangende strand concept inclusief strandhoofden is voor geen van de drie ontwerpen gemaakt.","perched beach; beach nourishment","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

If this structural erosion would not be counteracted a considerable part of the coastal region will be lost in time. The Dutch have been counteracting this erosion for hundred of years. Since the nineties of the last century by means of sand nourishments. At first these nourishments were applied as beach nourishments. Since the execution of a large scale shoreface nourishments at the Dutch Wadden island of Terschelling in 1993 and the unexpected positive effect of this type of nourishment shoreface nourishments are the primary tool to counteract structural erosion. Along the southern part of the Dutch coast several shoreface nourishments have been applied within a coastal stretch of some thirty kilometre relatively short after each other. Since completion of these nourishments their morphological development has been monitored and evaluated. From this evaluation it appeared that these nourishments show mutually different morphological behaviour. In the present study three shoreface nourishments are further evaluated; the Scheveningen nourishment applied in 1999, the Katwijk nourishment applied in 1998/1999 and the Noordwijk nourishment applied in 1998 Using survey data collected since completion of the nourishments the morphological development per site is investigated. The morphological development of the entire nourishment area and the profile development of several cross-shore transect along each nourishment are investigated. During this investigation several possible causes for the mutually different morphological development are identified, resulting in the following research questions: * What is the effect of the presence of breakwaters and the possible shelter for waves provided by these breakwaters on the morphological development. * What is the effect of the encountered wave climate as experienced by the different nourishments. * What is the effect of the presence of groynes on the morphological development. To increase the insight into these possible causes hindcast simulations are performed using the morfodynamic model UNIBEST-TC. The UNIBEST-TC model computes cross-shore transport rates and resulting profile development under the combined action of waves, wind and tidal currents. From the outcomes of the simulations performed with UNIBEST-TC the following conclusions can be drawn. * The Scheveningen harbour breakwaters proved some kind of shelter for waves originating from south westerly directions. This shelter is partly responsible for the small morphological changes seen for the Scheveningen shoreface nourishment. * No clear effect of the presence of groynes and the assumed offshore shift of the longshore tidal velocity due to the presence of these groynes on the cross-shore profile development of the Scheveningen nourishments site can be observed. * The differences in encountered wave climate due to the different times of application of the nourishments is not responsible for the observed differences in morphological development between the different nourishment sites.","","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Massie, W.W. (mentor); Vrijling, J.K. (mentor); Meek, J. (mentor)","2003","A contracting consortium, comprising the Turkish contractor Asim-Alarko and the Dutch contractor Van Oord ACZ, has submitted to the Turkish Water Authority a new concept for an offshore fresh water pipeline between Turkey and Cyprus. Where conventional offshore pipelines are laid on the seabed and are made from steel, this new pipeline concept incorporates a submerged floating pipeline made from High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) which is anchored to the seabed by vertical anchor lines. This new concept could simplify the installation procedure of pipelines since the submerged floating pipeline will be anchored at a relatively limited depth below the sea level. This avoids the high forces resulting from installing a pipeline at great water depths and buckling due to external pressures. After previous feasibility studies the consortium requested Aker Kvaerner to perform detailed engineering for above-mentioned new pipeline concept. As a result of this the present study has been initiated to start with the global design of the concept, which has finally resulted in an extensive study of the following aspects:  Study of the design parameters.  Study of the hydraulics in the pipeline  Study of the static behaviour of the proposed structure In the study of the design parameters it appears that especially some environmental data are difficult to quantify without doing an offshore survey; they are of great importance for the design. This concerns the marine growth at the relevant water depth, the magnitude and the direction of the deep-sea currents, the possible existence of internal waves and the soil properties. The properties of HDPE are also important for the design and therefore need accurate investigation, especially the stress-strain characteristics related to time and the creep behaviour of HDPE. Present material specifications appear to be not sufficient for final structural design. The pipeline must have the capacity to transport 75 million m3 (2.38 m3/s) of freshwater per year based on gravity flow. The hydraulic study showed that a pipeline with an internal diameter of 1.48 [m] is needed. Wall-friction is the dominant cause of hydraulic losses in the pipeline. Friction losses owing to bends, valves, contractions and enlargements appear to be almost negligible. For further hydraulic design there are two aspects that need special attention. The first aspect is the possible occurrence of under-pressures near the coast of Cyprus during steady state flow in the pipeline. It is preferred to avoid these under-pressures; consequently, an adequate pressure control system will have to be designed. The second aspect, which needs extra attention, is surge. Closing operations of valves will initiate pressure waves. These pressure waves will have an important influence on the structural behaviour of the system. Investigation will be necessary to establish whether HDPE is able to withstand the related short-term loads or if a pressure release system is necessary. From the static analysis it appears that the configuration, as proposed by the contracting consortium, with a distance of 500 [m] between the vertical anchor lines should be technically feasible. However, local stress problems, which arise near the connection points of the vertical anchor lines, still have to be solved. It could even be necessary that in order to solve these problems small improvements in the original concept will have to be made.","floating pipeline; watersupply; Cyprus; submerged pipeline","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""
