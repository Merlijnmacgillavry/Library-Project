(mentor); Pel, A.J. (mentor); Verhoef, E.T. (mentor)","2013","Charging drivers for the congestion they cause is a well-known concept among economists, traffic engineers and transport professionals. Many studies have been performed to explore and better address this issue during the history of transport economics and in recent years the first congestion pricing schemes have been finally implemented in some cities (Singapore, London, Stockholm). Nonetheless, several theoretical and practical problems still restrain this measure from being widely adopted. The lack of consistency with the traffic engineering perspective and limited degree of realism represent the main theoretical limitations of traditional congestion pricing models. The public resistance and fair distribution of gains and losses are the major practical barriers to the implementation of congestion pricing schemes. In this thesis, we discuss congestion pricing models controlled by the gMFD within agent-based simulation (MATSim). With this approach we seek efficient tolling schemes from an economic and traffic perspective. Furthermore, by means of investigations of the distributional effects of the proposed schemes we look for the strategy that maximizes the social welfare and with the highest potential acceptability. In the first phase of this study, through a review of theoretical studies and real experiences we identify the main reasons behind and factors influencing public resistance to the introduction of congestion pricing measures. Particularly, the question of equity is discussed in order to derive the necessary background for the evaluation of distributional effects. A thorough review of the major congestion pricing models proposed to date is made to construct our model. The survey goes from the traditional approaches like Marginal Cost Pricing and the bottleneck model to the most recent approaches based on macroscopic traffic models. During the review we discuss the main advantages and drawbacks of each approach. In the end, we describe the concept of Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) and introduce important issues like the distribution of traffic and the phenomenon of hysteresis. The experiment is set up with MATSim to study the metropolitan area of Zurich. First, we test the consistency of simulation outputs with the traffic flow theory by playing with different parameters of the traffic model in order to obtain the most reliable result. Then, we derive and explore the main macroscopic traffic relations of the network defined by the cordon. This analysis shows the influence of distribution of traffic, expressed by the spatial spread of density, on the performance of the network. Furthermore, this property can be associated to the phenomenon of hysteresis loops. In order to account for this additional complexity, a generalized macroscopic fundamental diagram (gMFD) is experimentally derived to express the relationship between accumulation, production and spread of density. Finally, three tolling schemes differently controlled by the gMFD are designed: a uniform toll (Flat Toll) that allows the system working below the critical accumulation threshold; a time-varying toll (Step Toll) that charges drivers according to the total delay inside the cordon estimated through the gMFD; the Spread Toll that explicitly considers the question of spatial distribution of traffic inside the cordon. In particular, the Step Toll applies a charge in order to completely eliminate delay, whereas the Spread Toll penalizes users only for actual delays due to the overall increase of demand rather than clustering of congestion. By integrating different aspects like the traffic performance improvements, travel behavior responses and economic impacts we carry out a comprehensive evaluation of the schemes. In this broad appraisal framework the typical traffic enhancement measurements (heaviness of congestion, delays etc.) are combined with economic indicators such as the variation of agents’ utility. An analysis of travel behavior responses is carried out to identify the major trends associated with the tolling schemes and possible relationships with the traffic and economic impacts. Different socio-demographic groups are defined in order to evaluate the distributional impacts on inhabitants of different neighborhoods and areas, and on different trip purposes (work, home, education, shopping and leisure). Finally, considerations on the potential levels of public acceptance of the schemes are made on the basis of some indicators such as the share of winners, the average gain and loss, and the benefit-cost ratio. The proposed schemes have shown to perform differently from each other. While the Step Toll and the Flat Toll determine comparable traffic enhancements, the first one outperforms the second one in terms of economic impacts and distributional effects. The smoother adaptation of demand determined by the Step Toll is probably its strong point. The Spread Toll, which was conceived as the fairest scheme, does not produce any considerable traffic improvement and it is even detrimental from the economic perspective. As to the question of public acceptance, although the slightly lower share of winners, the Step Toll determines higher gains than the other two schemes. Hence, from a social welfare perspective (combination of efficiency and distributional impacts), the Step Toll is the best performing scheme, followed by the Flat Toll and Spread Toll. Besides these results, the investigations of macroscopic traffic properties of networks have shed light on important aspects of the traffic flow theory. First, the distribution of congestion expressed as spatial spread of density has considerable influence on the network performance. This property could be modeled in heterogeneous networks by introducing the spread as additional variable in the gMFD. Second, hysteresis loops in the MFD plane occur in presence of congestion and their pattern can be identified with the spread. Furthermore, the decrease of performance seems to be related to the frequency of loading-unloading cycles.","congestion pricing; MFD; public acceptance; equity; agent-based models","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-11-29","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","Transport and Planning","",""

(mentor); Silvester, S. (mentor); Pothoven, A. (mentor)","2013","This design project has been done in order to give an outlook to the fourth generation smart fortwo, regarding its overall package and exterior design. The project investigates the core qualities of smart and shows how they can be translated into a concept for 2020 and beyond. The concept that was created – the smart 45XS – is based on four ‘pillars’ that formed the backbone of the project: SMART The original smart thanks a great deal of its success to its unique compactness and 2.5m length, making it ‘unschlagbar parkbar’ (unequalled parking ability). However, over time the smart gained volume and has grown in length to over 2.7m, mainly due to safety regulations and limiting the costs. Within the context of continuous urbanization and increasing mobility density, an easy-to-park urban micro car will become increasingly practical. Therefore the smart 45XS concept brings the length back to <2.6m and regains its small volume, without compromising safety and performance. SAFE The small smart faces a mayor challenge when it comes to safety, especially regarding pedestrian protection. The fourth generation will have to deal with world-wide regulations and standards. Therefore the smart 45XS integrates the best solutions for occupant protection (the best structure smart can make and a crash-optimized front-end package), unique pedestrian protection design (3PS) and supports active safety assist systems. STRATEGY In order to stay competitive on the market, smart needs to maximize the market occupation of the fortwo. Therefore smart needs to offer their three main customer groups (private, commercial and car2go) more specific and appropriate products. The 45XS concept suggests that smart amplifies the flexibility of the car in order to easily create derivatives based on one basis. Therewith smart provides its customers with a variation of products, all containing the core qualities of smart. STYLE smart is also about individual and stylish mobility. The customizable plastic body-panels allowed the user to change its colour every once in a while, but this is currently hardly used and is no business for smart anymore. However, expressing individuality will increase in the future, especially through digital and interconnected devices. The 45XS concept suggests that the exterior of the smart car plays along with the behaviour of its customers and supports individualization via digital and interactive elements. Merging these four pillars resulted in the 45XS concept vision. Rather than providing one concept car, the 45XS concept suggests that smart can create more customer-specific and individual products – all based on identical technology, safety and design characteristics – by using the following 4-STEP build-up plan: STEP 1: TECHNICAL BASIS The basis of the 45XS concept is a fixed platform, which is on its own a drivable, ‘naked’ car. It includes a rigid construction, the full electric powertrain, the passenger compartment and a crash- and pedestrian safety optimized front-end design. STEP 2: DERIVATIVE MODULE The second step is to create various architectures by mounting different modules to the basis. With a simple roll-over bar, a beach buggy is almost instantly created. Different modules allow to build up e.g. a roadster, a coupé or a micro van architecture. STEP 3: EXTERIOR CHARACTER Thirdly, the derived bases are cladded with exterior panels; partly identical, partly unique. Each archetype can be cladded with various exterior modules, e.g. a full translucent roof, a removable hard-top roof or customized storage system. Each derivative shows the characteristic metal Tridion, a ‘greenhouse’, a layer of resilient plastic body panels with an identical leitmotif, and something new: ‘i-zone’ areas. STEP 4: i-ZONE CONFIGURATION The last step is the configuration of the i-zones. The i-zones include everything that has to do with individuality, intelligence, interaction and innovation. With the i-zones, the smart adapts to the user’s varying and changing needs and preferences. Besides, the i-zones can be updated with new features and technologies during its lifecycle; therewith responding to the rapidly changing technologies use of digital devices. This project shows that with these four steps the 45XS concept enables smart to offer immense flexibility and adaptation to various customer needs while preserving the smart core qualities, using standardized safety- and performance elements and playing along with new ways people use to individualize and express personality.","automotive; smart; design; engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-11-29","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Desmet, P.M.A. (mentor); Huzen, G. (mentor)","2013","This Masters graduation report presents how design methodology founded on theories of positive psychology can be used to design for happiness in an office setting. Office workers spend a substantial portion of their time in an office environment. This environment should be designed to be safe, efficient and comfortable. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the workplace is “a priority setting for health promotion”. Recently, this definition has broadened its scope by including aspects of subjective well-being in organisations, which represents a mayor opportunity for positive design in the context of office environments. In the first part of the report the concept of office environment is explored and defined, dominant theories and frameworks of positive psychology are presented, and an introduction on positive design is given, including some frameworks developed during the last years. The work pattern model is presented as being relevant for the design of products in the context of office environments, and used in the conceptualization phase of the project. The insights gathered during the literature research laid the basis for the user study reported in the second part of the report. The main objective of the user study was to find out what made people happy at work. For this purpose, the participants collected anecdotes during their time at work when they felt good; moments that put a smile on their face. The main motivations for the study were important findings of positive psychology applied in some frameworks of positive design. It seems that one way to increase our level of happiness is in engaging on meaningful activities. Accordingly, activities and experiences are put to the fore as a means to design for happiness. The anecdotes collected in the study were turned into patterns by finding important time points, phases, and significant elements that made them meaningful. Next, they were given a theme and used as design inspiration for the conceptualization phase of the project. Hence, the main focus was placed on experiences as a means to design for happiness. The third part of the report, conceptualization, presents the complete process of ideation and embodiment design of the final concept: gibbous chair. The concept was inspired by one of the experiences named ‘dissolving in the moment’. In this experience the person takes a step away from her desk, and goes to a beautiful and sensorial place in which she spends a moment enjoying a cup of coffee. In this space the person can ‘let her mind wander’. The concept is an elevated piece of furniture, which has the facilities for the user to have a drink and enjoy a moment of self-indulgence. Elements like the height of the chair, the asymmetry of the shapes, the coffee spot, and the context, are intended to recreate the experience distilled from the pattern. The concept is further elaborated and prototyped for user testing. Furthermore, a marketing plan is proposed to BMA ergonomics. In this marketing plan, it was decided to consider the experiential side of the design instead of solely offering its physical attributes. ‘It’s not so much the chair, but how it changes your perspective at work’ was proposed as a starting point of their marketing vision. The last part of the report, evaluation, presents the set-up and results of the user testing with the 1:1 prototype. The results of the testing were mostly positive and inspiring for the design process. People described the product and the experience of sitting on it in rich and varied ways. Of relevance is the placing of the product inside the office environment. This showed to have important effects on how people perceive it, and if they are prone to use it. Besides, recommendations for further development of the concept are presented. Finally, some recommendations for positive design in the context of office environments are proposed to BMA Ergonomics as a final outcome of this thesis.","positive design; design for well-being; office environments","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor); Wisse, M. (mentor)","2013","The number of amputees is expected to grow drastically in the coming years as a result of dysvascular disease, trauma and cancer. Therefore the need for foot prostheses will increase and currently a new generation of prostheses with improved physiological characteristics is under development. However, testing of new prostheses is costly and time-consuming, and test users are scarce. Computer simulations of prosthetic gait have a large potential to fulfil this task, because parameters can be varied and tested without the need to construct prototypes and perform experiments. In this study it is shown that a muscle-reflex walking model can reproduce unilateral transtibial prosthetic gait to a reasonable extent. The model showed human-like overall kinematics and characteristics of unilateral transtibial prosthetic gait that were also found experimentally and in literature. Furthermore, the walking model combined with the prosthesis model could mimic characteristics of different passive carbon fibre foot prostheses by reproducing prosthesis kinematics. Lastly, some effects of different prostheses on walking behaviour were predicted. These effects include altered knee flexion during the swing phase on the sound side, a change in knee flexion during early stance on the prosthetic side, and differences in energy storage and return by the prosthesis and in total energy consumption. Concluding, these outcomes suggest that a muscle-reflex walking model could be a valid tool for the testing of new prostheses in the future. This would make it possible to test new prostheses in an easier, faster and cheaper way compared to the current methods.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-11-29","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

(mentor)","2013","This thesis tests the influence of the under layer profile on the stability of the armour layer of concrete interlocking armour units. The analysis is aimed to offer insight into the influence of different under layer profiles on the stability of the armour layer. Furthermore the thesis includes a test of the design guideline of the under layer for Xbloc armour units, which is developed by Delta Marine Consultants (DMC). DMC prescribes that the maximum vertical difference between the constructed and designed profile, i.e. the tolerance, may not exceed 0.5 times the nominal diameter D_n50 of the under layer rocks. This requirement holds in both the positive and negative perpendicular direction. Physical model tests have been carried out at the wave flume of DMC in Utrecht, The Netherlands. Different vertical deviations have been tested in combination with variable length scales of the deviations. Furthermore convex and concave shaped profiles are also tested to assess the influence of the direction of the deviation. The under layer profiles are measured with a laser device. A spherical foot staff is simulated numerically in order to represent prototype values of the tolerances. The difference between the laser and simulated sphere is comparable to that of the conventional staff and the sphere and therefore in line with the theoretical difference between a sphere and conventional staff. Tolerance levels are tested in the range between 1.0 and 3.5 D_n50. The tests show larger damage numbers with increased tolerance. This can be explained by introducing a transition from a steep slope to a milder slope, i.e. the step. Around the step the quality of interlocking is low and consequently this area is very vulnerable to damage. Furthermore deviated profiles have locally milder slopes which result in less interlocking as well. No clear influence of the length scales of the deviations is observed. Based on three tests with a convex profile it can be concluded that convex shaped profiles are more stable than concave shaped profiles. This can be explained by the absence of the step. Because convex profiles show a different behaviour, they are excluded from the trend line which describes the trend between tolerances and damage. An additional scenario with a narrower grading and larger D_n50 of under layer material is tested. The results show smaller settlement and larger damage of the armour layer, which are a logical consequence of the increased natural roughness. It can be concluded that both an increased additional and natural roughness result in more damage of the armour layer. It is therefore recommended not to increase the tolerance requirement for Xbloc armour layers. On the other hand, the experiments show that the lower bound of the tolerance in model situation is close to the prescribed tolerances. It is therefore concluded that sufficient efforts should be made to secure the quality of placement of the under layer. In order to determine the quality of placement of the under layer, a well carried out measurement campaign is recommended.","Breakwater; armour layer stability; under layer; tolerance; roughness; measurement method; physical scale model; Xbloc","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Kooijman, A. (mentor)","2013","This report for the degree of Master of Science, at the faculty of Industrial Design Engineering at Delft University of Technology, presents the design process of an exoskeleton system for cost effective upper limb rehabilitation of post-stroke patients. The aim of this graduation project is to optimize the effect of post-stroke rehabilitation by the design of a robotic device capable of supporting natural motion within the workspace of tasks of everyday life. In addition, the device optimizes the cost-effectiveness of post-stroke rehabilitation by introducing a low cost robotic exoskeleton device. According to the World Healthcare Organization stroke is the leading cause of disability worldwide. In Europe; roughly 1.1 million new people are affected by stroke every year and an estimated 6 million people live with moderate to severe disabilities as a result of stroke. 85 % of post-stroke patients suffer from disabilities to the upper extremities. The economic burden of stroke is estimated to be 27 billion annually in Europe alone and expected to double by 2030 due to demographic changes. Of the annual 27 billion spend on stroke 16% is attributed to labor costs for therapists providing post-stroke rehabilitation. Next to the projected increasing economic burden; the shortage of therapists able to provide adequate rehabilitation services is projected to grow. The goal of this graduation project is to address the economic burden of stroke by increasing the functionality and cost effectiveness of robotic post-stroke rehabilitation by offering an affordable yet fully functional upper limb rehabilitation system. The process for the recovery from paralysis as a result of stroke is based on brain plasticity. The working principle of brain plasticity is based upon research suggesting that the brain is capable of circumventing the damaged neuron pathways by reassigning undamaged neurons to take over the function. Brain plasticity occurs when new neuron pathways are formed, thereby partially or even fully restoring motor functions, provided that the patient is subject to intensive rehabilitation therapy to stimulate the growth of these new neuron pathways Robotics is implemented in post-stroke rehabilitating due to the potential advantages over conventional rehabilitation methods with regard to recovery of functions, costs and recovery time. Robotic devices offer a potential tool for physicians and patients to increase the cost effectiveness of post-stroke therapy. The advantages of using robotics for rehabilitation purposes are the repeatability of the task, repeatability of performance and the scalability to adjust the task to the user’s physiological properties and cognitive capabilities. These advantages promote the shortening of the required recovery time and increase the restoration of motor functions during the patient’s rehabilitation. Clinical tests show favorable results when comparing robotic therapy with traditional therapy when considering constrained induced movement therapy, bilateral therapy and repetitive motion therapy The key problems regarding robotic devices enabling neurorehabilitation can be identified as: 1) Limited supported workspace of natural motion within meaningful task exercises. 2) Limited applicability in the recovery process due to limitations to the clinical environment. 3) Limited cost effectiveness with respect to traditional treatment due to high initial costs. Current “state of the art” are implemented as high end systems. They are composed of high-tech components developed according to standards for manufacturing robots. Manufacturing robots are designed with demands on high accuracy and precision, which requires the use of precision solutions employing expensive sensor and actuator systems. In addition, development of high precision solutions requires thousands of man hours greatly increasing the labor cost of the design and development. Rehabilitation, on the other hand, does not require high precision robotic solutions. Exercising motion of the upper limb with 5-10 mm accuracy is acceptable within therapy practice in contrast to manufacturing robots operating with 0.01-1 mm accuracy. Existing robotic devices are designed to be employed in western medical practice and limited to the clinical environment because they are grounded and heavy devices. This graduation project proposes a low cost robotic exoskeleton device, named “Adjutor”, enabling upper limb stroke rehabilitation to provide rehabilitation therapists and patients with the means for cost effective post-stroke therapy. The solution supports the natural kinematic model of the human upper extremities by introducing a virtual point of rotation around the center of rotation of the glenohumeral joint. For this purpose a wearable Stewart platform is reconfigured around the human body to provide support within the natural workspace and protect the muscles joints from harmful forces during the exercise. The proposed exoskeleton supports natural motion of the shoulder girdle, glenohumeral joint and elbow joint within the current design stage. The workspace of the proposed robotic device optimizes the effect of the therapy by supporting motion of everyday life. Control software will implement a programming by example principle. Upper limb exercises can be programmed by the rehabilitation therapist by moving the patients arm wearing the exoskeleton in the desired path. The sensors log the motion of the upper limb and store it as motion path of an exercise. The patient can practice the pre-programmed exercise without additional help from the therapist. The combination of selected actuators, mechanisms, orthotic devices, sensors and control systems provide the foundation for further development of a low cost robotic device for post-stroke therapy. A prototype has been developed from a bottom up approach for 1400 within the span of this graduation project.","post-stroke rehabilitation; physical therapy robot; wearable exoskeleton; low cost","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-11-29","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master specialisation Medisign","",""

(mentor); Rognoli, V. (mentor)","2013","This is the final thesis of the faculty of Industrial Design Engineering of Delft University of Technology in collaboration with the Politecnico of Milano (Italy). The assignment is commissioned by Re-Worked (UK) and the main research question is formulated as: ‘how can waste coffee based-materials be designed both technically and experiential to optimize the material (and product) experience?’ This experience is a result of the material’s technical properties and its experiential properties. A study of literature and additional experiments were conducted to create understanding of the field of bio-composites. The technical boundaries were mapped out. Waste coffee grounds can be used as filler to create bulk and in general decrease the technical properties of a matrix. Short or long fibres can be added to enhance the performance of the material. Bio-based polymer matrixes are in development and becoming available commercially. The experiential properties are a result of the aesthetic experience, the emotional experience and the meaning experience. Materials based on coffee have preordained meanings?of being sustainable, natural and waste materials. The aesthetics of the material and the product function and context can be used to communicate to these preordained meanings. Many qualities are best perceived when they are multi-sensory, although designing paradoxical experiences can lead to more exiting emotions. Imperfections of materials link to the pillars of this?thesis: D4S, wabi sabi and standard unique. In addition imperfections are indispensible in communicating the sustainability and naturalness of materials, especially if they occur as a sign of the maturing of a material. Embracing imperfections as an aesthetic creates economic opportunities for the industry of bio-composites and creates opportunities to have more rich and enduring relationship with the user. Waste coffee grounds are small particles that can contain nutrients for plants and greens and they can biodegrade. The matrix determines the technical behaviour of the composite material and how it can be produced and manufactured. Moisture in the grounds can influence the technical properties of the material. This waste material does not evoke negative associations and its colour is the strongest connection to coffee. This is a great influencer of the meaning experience and associates to meanings as natural, organic and sustainable. Coffee smell seems to be important because it recalls memories. Fibres and pigments increase imperfections in the material surface that enhance the earlier mentioned meanings. The domain for the new material design is: ‘user-relationships between waste coffee ground-based bio-composites in 2015’. The new context of 2015 includes themes that relate to this domain, such as ‘loose ends connect’, ‘visual deception’, ‘material driven design’, ‘embrace imperfection’, ‘dynamic bonding’, ‘wake up and smell the coffee’ and ‘subconscious misbehaviour’. The vision statement that was derived from this is ‘I want people to feel desired by the material and captivate them in the course of material bonding’. To fulfill this vision in material design, the interaction has to be a ‘tempting exposure’. It was found that the material has to be modest and provocative in order to evoke this interaction. Modest and provocative materials have qualities that can be contradicting and others that can enhance each other. New materials based on waste coffee grounds will not be designed for their technical properties, but rather for their sensorial properties. Three material concepts are proposed, which are Cofflexi (a flexible rubber/silicone composite), Café Maché (a lightweight recycled paper composite that is fully biodegradable) and CapPurcino (bio-polyurethane composite material). A workshop, reflection and evaluation helped to decide which of the materials were most valuable to continue to work with in this thesis. It was concluded that Café Maché is the best match to the vision as it creates a rapidly changing bond with the user. Suggested product categories to target with this material are nutrient packaging (for coffee products) and events. CapPurcino is most promising for Re-Worked to implement on a short term. The company is already working with a PU specialist that is developing the bio-based PU polymers. The material’s imperfect aesthetics and potential to mature in time due to bad UV-resistance are a perfect fit to the vision. The final product proposal is Cof2Grow: a product set to grow greens at home. It consists of tablets and a pot. The tablets contain seeds for greens (cress, alfalfa and bean sprout) and they are packaged and filled with Café Maché that provides the seeds with nutrients. Additional nutrients may need to be added for optimal germination and growth, but this needs to be further developed. After the greens are consumed, the entire tablet can be disposed in the organic waste, because it will fully biodegrade. The pot is made of CapPurcino using a principle of standard unique to create authentic pots in each mould. The tablets fit the pot and the pot has a drainage system that collects and re-feeds the redundant water to the tablet. The pot is 100% bio-based, reused and matures in time.","waste material; sustainability; green aesthetics; material experience; bio-composite; wabi sabi; D4S; standard unique; meaning of material; MoM; material driven design; imperfection; coffee; material experience; ViP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Karana, E. (mentor)","2013","Social networking sites are today playing an essential role in our daily lives. These web-based services not only focus on providing people a platform to share interests and activities, but also facilitate the process of keeping in touch with families and friends. Take Facebook, the most popular social networking website, as an example: people can add events on the ‘timeline’ of their friends, or press ‘like’ below the status of someone to show their supports. Functions like ‘timeline’ or ‘like’ are social features that enable people to interact with each other in a better way, as well as improve their experience of sharing and communication. Instead of using social media features, as a virtual way, to create interaction and communication between individuals, how can designers create a tangible way to express the current social networking interaction? Taking this question as a starting point, the graduation project aims to explore how ""performative qualities"" of materials can be used in social networking service, in order to support actions that promote social engagement between individuals. When talking about material application in the field of industrial design, one tends to focus on the manufacturing technologies of materials. Also, one might think about selecting and applying materials on the basis of their aesthetic qualities. It is a fact that materials do not only affect use and function of products, but also contribute to the creation of meaning and particular experience. (Karana, 2009). For example, a wooded cup that is warm and rough in touch, it could provide people a feeling of cozy; while a glass cup, on the other hand, would make people feel chilly because the tactility of this material is cold and smooth. Likewise, the different kinds of affordances of materials, which we call them ‘performative qualities’ in this project, might trigger and support different actions of people. For instance, “glass is for seeing through, and for breaking, wood is normally used for solidity, opacity, support or carving”(Norman, 2002,p.9). On the other hand, much of the studies have been conducted relate to certain properties of the web. For instance, Rattenbury et al. suggests that the metaphor of ‘plastic’ captures the way in which computers have become integrated into the ‘heterogeneous rhythms of everyday life’. Based on this theory, Richard Harper argues two additional properties of the web, persistence and temporality, as a ‘digital material’ All these research point out that web, including social networking sites, is not in material but it does have a material quality. Based on the current research, We believe it is an interesting opportunity to understand how to use materials as resources for interaction design of social network. Therefore, the meaning of this project is twofold: 1) provide a new perspective for design researchers to understand the ‘performative qualities’ of materials; 2) provide practitioners with a robust reference toolkit to design for social interaction in a tangible way. This graduation project will uniquely combine lines of research in social interaction design (Prof. E. Giaccardi) and material experience (Dr. E. Karana) across the Departments of Industrial Design and Design Engineering of the Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering. This graduation project will mainly focus on exploring how the ‘performative qualities’ of materials can be linked to social networking services, and it will result in designing a tangible toolkit as a supportive source to inspire designers for further exploration on social interaction design.  Understand the current research on social features, ‘performative qualities’ of materials and ‘material qualities’ of web.  Categorize the social features into groups and pick up one of the social features from each group for further exploration  Carry out a study to investigate how people behave to express those social features  Explore how materials support social actions in which people engage.  Create a toolkit that is based on the research insights  Evaluate the toolkit","tangible interaction; social networking services; material properties","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor)","2013","Heating constitutes about 40% of the final energy consumption at TU Delft. In the present, the district heating system in campus obtains its energy from the combustion of natural gas in a combined heat and power plant. Although this plant produces heat and electricity with an efficiency over 80%, the dependance on a fossil fuel presents an opportunity for improvement by introducing a renewable energy source. In May 2013, the drilling for a geothermal plant in campus was approved. The present heating system operates at high temperature (HT - 130°C) with 3-way valves. In the new heating system, a geothermal plant will provide part of the energy and some buildings will undergo renovations to work at medium temperature (MT - 70°C); they will be connected in series after HT buildings, constituting a cascade system. In this study, steady state simulations of the heating system are performed using Cycle-Tempo. The results are then used for an exergy analysis of different configurations in the system. The analysis of the ongoing transition in the present heating system from a 3-way to a 2-way valve configuration reveals that up to 180 kW of electricity from the grid used for pumping can be saved and replaced by heat produced locally at a higher efficiency, representing up to 36% in primary energy savings. Within the system boundaries, the exergy efficiency does not improve with the transition, but a reduction in the return temperature from 75-80°C to 50-75°C allows for geothermal energy utilisation. For the new heating system, three configurations of the network are devised: a parallel network at high temperature, a cascade system renovating small buildings and a cascade system renovating large buildings. The exergy analysis reveals that the best option is to renovate the small buildings in campus. In this way, geothermal energy can provide 19% to 50% of the heat demand. The suggested configuration for the new system can operate with an exergy efficiency 14% higher than the present system, reducing the primary energy consumption and the associated emission of CO2 by 47%. Carbon capture and sequestration can decrease the emission of CO2 further by 51%. However, the capture process by means of the dominant technology, amine absorption, requires additional consumption of fossil fuels, which worsens the scarcity of these resources.","district heating; exergy analysis; geothermal energy; carbon capture and storage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Geotechnology","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

One technology aiming to increase the spectral efficiency of wireless devices is full duplex (FD) radios. These systems are capable of single carrier transmission and reception and could ideally double the spectral efficiency of future wireless systems. To make such systems a commercial reality, self-interference cancellation (SIC) techniques are required to suppress transmitter leakage into the receiver. This work investigates the level of SIC an integrated hybrid transformer can provide to make FD a reality. This work also includes an investigation in the SIC capabilities of an integrated hybrid transformer operating with a commercially available planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA) and presents the design and evaluation of a prototype in UMC 180nm RFCMOS. The prototype consists of a transformer, a tunable impedance and a LNA. Measurement results on this prototype showed isolation peaks of 80 dB, with an isolation band width of 1 MHz for 60 dB isolation and a Tx insertion loss, measured gain and NF of 3.5 dB, 5dB and 9dB, respectively, while providing a IIP3 of 0dBm at the LNA output and a common-mode Tx isolation at the input of the LNA of 20 dB. The measurements also showed that the duplexer can be made self-tunable by using search algorithms that converge within 150 measurements. The relation between isolation and impedance resolution is derived and proven to be 6dB every time the absolute difference between the impedances at both sides of the transformer is halved.","Full-Duplex; Duplexer; Self-Interference Cancellation; Wireless; CMOS; Integrated; Passive","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-09-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Van der Helm, A.J.C. (mentor)","2013","Though lifestyles have become increasingly more flexible in the past few decades with concepts like last-minute bookings and flex working, we still try to plan our lives with a rigid tool: the digital calendar. Calendar42 is a Dutch start-up that strives to re-invent the digital calendar and with that the way people plan their life. Having grown to a team of eleven in its three years of existence, it now offers a platform that intelligently connects their own plans with the plans of other people, organisations and systems surrounding them. By developing a flexible, open platform Calendar42 aims to become an important platform for distribution and consumption of time-related information and put the calendar in the centre of people’s daily life. Purpose Calendar42’s main asset have been around creating intelligent services to support the individual users. As many planning challenges are strongly related to social challenges, Calendar42 wants to gain insight into how to apply their underlying system inside the social context. Existing digital calendars already support several (rigid) social mechanics such as the ability to invite participants to meetings or share availability with others, but do not offer ways to keep up with the continuously changing priorities and new arising opportunities inside this always connected society. In order to design for these social planning mechanisms it’s crucial to understand current flexible social planning mechanisms and explore how these could be translated inside the context of a digital calendar. These social planning mechanisms should fit the strengths and values of Calendar42. Special Methodology The study contains a broad exploration of the main three components of the assignment: calendars, flexible lifestyles and social mechanisms. Within this exploration a combination of literature studies, case studies and context research will be used. The exploration will be used to form design guidelines and directions that will be used in an iterative design process. Findings The polychronic time sense has been found to be a good concept to describe the flexible lifestyle. Its characterised by a loss of social and temporal boundaries, and allows to respond last-minute on continuously changing priorities and opportunities. Fitting planning tools that mix these dynamics with some much needed structure still lack. There is a big opportunity for Calendar42 to support this desired structure by developing a social planning assistant that enables interaction between system and crowd intelligence. Offering social planning mechanisms in which users are supported by the system to coherently plan in groups. For this collaboration to be successful, a high level of translucency is key: people should always be accountable for their actions through a high level of visibility and awareness of the social context. Furthermore, in order to serve a wide range of planning scenarios and group structures, the offered mechanisms should be developed to be open-ended and allow for social self-regulation. Conclusions and recommendations The final solution, Gather, enables groups to shape events inside a conversation with a mix of free-form messages and explicit proposals of event details. The system intelligence supports the users to make relevant proposals leaving the decision making up to the group dynamics. Gather and the design guidelines should offer Calendar42 a good base to develop a successful social planning solution for the current dynamic planning needs.","calendar; planning; time sense; polychronicity; software; mobile; interfaces; service; flexible lifestyles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-11-29","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Conceptualization and Communication","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Zadpoor, A.A. (mentor)","2013","The tendon is the connective tissues that attach the muscles to bones. It plays an important role in the mechanics of the articulation because the tendon transmits the tensile force from the muscle to the correspondent bone. Even though the tendons are designed to support different loading conditions, it generally accepted that mechanical loading plays the principal role in the development of tendinopathies. The mechanical properties of the tendon have been studied for many years; however, the mechanisms associated with the response at the microscopical scale are largely unknown. In the present work a computational structural model was developed to study the failure mechanics of the tendon fibril. The proposed model was implemented using finite element methodology (FEM). The mechanical properties of the components of the structure (collagen molecule, non-covalent bonds and crosslinks) are modeled based on the results obtained from molecular simulations available in the literature. In particular, the failure mechanisms of each element were implemented. The different components of the fibril were modeled separately and validated. The geometry of the fibril is based on the 2D Hodge-Petruska model. An automatic tool was developed to assembly the structure of the fibril, in that way different dimensions of the fibril could be modeled. To assess the accuracy and numerical stability of the simulations, a parametric study of the stabilization techniques used was performed. The results of this analysis show that the inclusion of the damage properties in the structure cause convergence difficulties and the values of the parameters of the numerical stabilization vary between models. Regardless, it was possible to analyze the mechanical behavior of the fibril. Different models were created and tested under tensile loading conditions. First, an analysis of the effect of the dimension on the response of the fibril was performed. The results show that the stress-stain response of the different dimension of the fibril is similar until the accumulation of the damage of the non-covalent bonds causes a change of the stiffness in the fibril. Then, the response varies according to the geometry and the crosslinks density. Second, a tensile test on a fibril with higher dimension was simulated. The results show similar responses to the experimental results of (Svensson et al., 2013). It was found that at small strain regimes the mechanical behavior of the fibril is dictated by the response of the non-covalent interactions, while at higher strains regimes, the stiffness of the structure is determined by the crosslinks, and shows a more rigid response. Finally, the model shows that the accumulation of the plastic deformation of the molecules at high strains leads to a brittle failure of the fibril.","tendon; fibril; failure; finite element method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-11-29","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

(mentor); Pont, S.C. (mentor)","2013","This graduation report describes the process of my graduation project. This project is the final project of the master Integrated Product Design, faculty of Industrial Design Engineering, Delft University of Technology (NL). In this particular project, we aim to explore the potential of luminous materials in the context of preventive care, in particular ‘relaxation’. We have chosen to develop a relaxation device that makes use of the visual properties of luminous materials. This relaxation device is developed for a specific market: office workers. The office is a stressful environment. Stress can cause illness, burnout and even heart disease. Next to the negative effect on someone’s wellbeing, office workers are less productive when stressed. Increasing the well-being of office workers will result in an increase in productivity and a will reduce health problems caused by stress. There are already stress-relief products and services (e.g. pause software) on the market specifically for office workers, but they do not always contribute to stress reduction. Pause software is meant for RSI prevention, but can be rather annoying when you are in the middle of writing an email and the pause software pops up. Therefore, there is a need for a product that contributes to stress reduction and increases well-being of the office worker. First, we have investigated what actually is ‘relaxation’. Relaxation is a mood state that has a low arousal level (one feels not active) and a high valence level (one feels pleasant). A stressed mood, on the other hand, has a high arousal level (one feels active) and a low valence level (one feels unpleasant). Therefore, the relaxation device should ‘guide’ the user from a high arousal level to a low arousal level, and from a low valence level to a high valence level. Second, we investigated the main visual property of luminous materials: light. We researched which of the visual properties play a role in the perception of feeling relaxed. We found that the main properties were color, intensity and color temperature. Also, we looked into research about dynamic light. For color it was not possible to find a specific hue that was perceived as most relaxing, since people have different preferences for certain colors and also have different connotations with color (e.g. green is usually perceived as positive and red as negative). Whether or not a certain illuminance level is perceived as pleasant is dependent of the color temperature of the light. A warm white light is perceived as pleasant at low illuminance levels, whereas cool white light is perceived as pleasant at high illuminance levels. Also, it was found that a high illuminance level (1750 lx) was perceived as more arousing than a low illuminance level (750 lx). Concluding from research, we could conclude that warm white light with a low illuminance level is perceived as most relaxing. From the research about dynamic light it could be concluded that the rhythm of dynamic light should be subtle and have slow temporal changes in order to be perceived as relaxing. Next to the property light, we also investigated luminous materials. We have made a benchmark of luminous materials and grouped them in several categories, like electrical luminous materials, radiating luminous materials, etc. For the product it was important that the light could change intensity, since we wanted to use dynamic lighting in the product. Therefore, only the category of electrical luminous materials (e.g. OLED, LEC) fulfills this requirement, since the electrical materials can change intensity by changing the electrical input. Based on the findings from literature, we have performed an experimental study. We have tested which rhythm was perceived as most relaxing by the participants. We varied the rhythm by changing the waveform, intensity, frequency and amplitude of the rhythm. From research on relaxation techniques we found two techniques that were based on the principle of lowering your breathing pace in order to relax: bio feedback and paced breathing. During the experimental study, we asked the participants to breathe along with the light. They had to breathe in when the intensity of the light became higher and breathe out again when the intensity decreased again. Based on the findings from this study, we selected the following values for the rhythm of the dynamic light of the relaxation device: waveform = sine wave; intensity = 2363 cd/m2; amplitude = 1700 cd/m2; frequency = 0.14 Hz. Also, we have tested two diffuse sheets of which one had a matte surface finish and the other sheet had a glossy surface finish, to investigate which glossiness is perceived as most relaxing. It can be concluded that there was no difference in perception between both sheets when the dynamic light was shown. However, the participants perceived the matte sheet as more relaxing, calming, satisfying, comforting and pleasant than the glossy sheet, when the dynamic lighting was off. Therefore, the product will have a matte finish. Fourth, we analysed the context of working at the office and we explored future trends. One of the main findings was that, in the future, people would not necessarily work at the office, but also on the go or at home. Therefore, the product needs to be compact and wireless, so it can be used on the go. Based on the findings from the analysis, a program of requirements was made for the product. The program of requirements, together with a trend analysis and the design vision, were used for idea generation. Out of the idea generation, three concepts were formed, of which one concept has been selected to develop further. The final concept is called Flo. Flo is a portable relaxation device and looks like a light bulb. The dynamic light in the product flows from one side to the other and increases and decreases in intensity, respectively. By breathing along with the light, the user is guided to a lower breathing pace and is feeling more relaxed. The product can be controlled by a squeeze interaction. The battery of Flo can be charged by USB-cable.","luminous; materials; dynamic light; relaxation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2013","Introduction Different water resources are shared among neighbouring nations worldwide, as water does not recognize any (political) boundaries. This fact has led to conflict and cooperation between neighbouring states over the management of such water resources. To manage these resources in a way that it prevents conflict and promotes cooperation, a wide range of expertise is required. It is the objective of this study to investigate the possible contributions that water experts can bring to the promotion of water cooperation. These objective was achieved by a combinations means of literature study and interviews. Water conflict and cooperation It was identified that the causes of conflict and cooperation over a shared water resource can be grouped into two dimension, drivers and indicators. Drivers are events over shared water resources that generate potential conflict. While indicators are factors that strongly-influence whether the potential conflict will become an actual conflict, or even become an actual cooperation. Results Water experts can contribute to the promotion of water cooperation by influencing drivers and indicators. These contributions can diminish, or even, counteract the potential conflicts generated by the drivers. Also, they can create a more cooperative indicators. These contributions include:  To open and maintain communication lines;  To raise public awareness;  To build confidence;  To exchange and jointly collect data;  To develop and propose potential solution;  Act as an independent party;  Capacity building;  To inform decision makers. In order for these contributions to effectively impact the drivers and indicators, the water experts need to overcome barriers that may dampen the positive impacts of their contributions, or may even cause counterproductive impacts. Such obstacles range from the ones that are inevitable, attached to the complex nature of the water conflict and are beyond water experts’ grasp, to those that are avoidable. Some of such barriers are:  Insensitivity to political and social context;  Inter-disciplinary and inter-level communication;  Different analysis method;  Credibility of water experts. Conclusions and recommendations To overcome those barriers water experts are recommended to stay modest, closely collaborate with experts from other fields and to give extra effort on understanding the local public, the decision makers and the non-technical aspect of the issue. By doing so the (technical) solution that water experts will become more acceptable by those parties. Also, this will enable water experts to see whether their involvement will lead to an equal (and desirable) cooperation for all riparians. Finally, it recommended for universities, as the preparer of the future water experts, to try to make their students realize that in order to be effectively and ethically involved in a transboundary water management, and to promote water cooperation, having the technical knowledge is not enough. Further, universities also advised to provide supporting training upon the request of the future water experts.","cooperation; integrated water management; Rhine; Mountain Aquifer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-12-14","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water Resources","",""

(mentor); Govers, P.C.M. (mentor)","2013","This master thesis describes the development of a brand and product strategy for Alpine Hearing Protection. Alpine Hearing Protection has been active on the filtered generic earplug market for more than ten years with a wide range of hearing protection products for different target groups. Its main product focus is on umbrella shaped filtered generic earplugs which contain an attenuation filter. With its products Alpine wants to prevent hearing damage and bring tranquillity to as many people as possible. Alpine wants to develop and sell trendy, high quality products which will make people to enjoy auditory experiences in a comfortable manner. The generic earplug market consists of many players. Currently the generic earplug market is dominated by umbrella shaped earplugs. Through the years the design and features of earplugs within the generic earplug market have not changed much. The filtered generic earplug market is considered to be an attractive market. Because of its strong growth potential it is attractive for new entrants. Recently there have been introduced several relatively innovative earplugs by new entrants, but still, there is little product differentiation on the market. Every hearing protection brand seems to stress the same product benefits and little attention is given to building a brand users can and want to connect to. For consumers it is easy to switch from one brand to another. Therefore, this graduation assignment was a quest for Alpine how to differentiate the Alpine brand from its competitors and how to protect and strengthen its current market position. This project started with an analysis phase. During the internal analysis the strategic strengths and weaknesses of Alpine Hearing Protection have been made explicit. Subsequently, during the external analysis, Alpine’s competitive environment and its relevant outside world have been investigated and relevant opportunities and threats have been identified. The insights gathered during the analysis phase have been the input for a SWOT synthesis. Eventually five search fields have been identified. From the five search fields, two strategic directions how to differentiate the Alpine brand and how to protect and strengthen its market position have been identified: 1. Increase the Alpine brand usability and become a human brand. Currently the Alpine brand usability is rather low. Alpine should become a brand consumers more easily can and want to connect to. All the Alpine touch points should convey the true Alpine brand identity in order to stand out from the competition. The Alpine brand identity has been defined and determined by means of a session with the Alpine managing directors. In order to make the Alpine brand identity more applicable within the Alpine organization, the ‘Alpine brand identity toolset’ has been developed. The toolset consists of ‘the Alpine brand identity wheel’ and ‘the Alpine brand pop-up cubes’. The ‘Alpine brand identity wheel’ features the Alpine brand identity stated by five design principles. The ‘Alpine brand pop-up cubes’ are a summary of the Alpine brand identity and are designed to be within reach of the Alpine employees at all time. The developed Alpine brand identity should become incorporated within the entire Alpine organization. With the newly developed brand identity, Alpine should put effort in redesigning the Alpine touch points to be in line with and carry out the Alpine brand identity. 2. Design a ‘next generation’ earplug. The second way by which Alpine can set itself apart from the competition is by designing new value for its consumers. Especially designing a new innovative ‘next generation’ earplug will be a great way of standing out from the crowd. By designing a new earplug Alpine will be able to improve current earplug weaknesses, prove its earplug expertise and set the new earplug standard. The Alpine earplugs are one of Alpine’s most obvious touch points, therefore also the ‘next generation’ earplug should carry out the Alpine brand identity. The ‘next generation’ earplug ideas were generated based on the Alpine brand identity and the three most important user research insights. Eventually three ‘next generation’ earplugs concepts were being developed:  Wave The Wave’s futuristic design features six air compartments which seal off the ear canal. The Alpine ‘Wave’ is the ideal solution for protecting the hearing and enjoying music. The easy to use ‘Wave’ forms to the shape of the ear canal perfectly and confirms the user whether the earplug is inserted correctly.  Barbapapa With its clean looks and the possibility to inflate the earplug, the Alpine ‘Barbapapa’ will expand to the exact shape of the ear canal. The easy to use ‘Barbapapa’ will stay tight into the ear canal and assures its user the earplug is inserted correctly.  Like The ‘Like’ is very quick and easy to insert and will never get lost in the ear canal. With its ‘in-ear monitor-look’ , the ‘Like’ has a professional appearance which will be appreciated by the musicians target group. Based on criteria originating from the analysis phase, the Alpine brand identity and the program of requirements, the ‘Wave’ concept has been selected to be further developed. Alpine should introduce the ‘next generation’ earplug as soon as possible before the competition will do so. Therefore it is suggested to start a follow-up project in order to investigate the possibilities of the ‘Wave’ as the next generation earplug.","Brand; Product; Strategy; Hearing protection; Earplug; Design; Innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2013","Wearable and implantable devices are becoming more and more common as time goes by and one of the major bottlenecks in their development is the power delivery. In order to tackle this problem, energy harvesting arises an option to bring these devices one step closer to complete autonomy. Among the available mechanisms for harvesting, near-field inductive coupling appears as a good alternative due to the flexibility it offers in terms of size and output power. Although a certain level of maturity has been reached over the last decade, a sort of mysticism still exists around the wireless power transfer. To the author's best knowledge, none of the works found in literature addresses the entirety of the problem. Here, a comprehensive, generalized analysis and design are made starting from the from the very differentiation of the near and far-field regimes all the down to circuit design. Studying the inductively coupled interfaces allow us to estimate the performance of the link prior to any design attempt, serving as a very useful tool in the feasibility evaluation of certain application. In particular, models for the coupling factor and losses of the magnetic link are introduced. Emphasis is made on comparing the performance of the links in a resonant and non-resonant regime. An implantable device for neural stimulation/recording with a rechargeable Li-Ion as an energy storage is considered as our intended application. This requires us to realize an study of the impact of tissue in energy transfer and viceversa. From here, the circuit design of a wireless power transfer interface is presented. All circuit blocks necessary for transfer are designed and simulated, allowing us to have a complete overview of the system.","wireless; power; transfer; inductive; link; coupling; DC/DC converter; boost converter; resonance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","Biomedical Electronics Laboratory","",""

(mentor); eenaerts, D. (mentor); Mattheijssen, P. (mentor)","2013","In the commercial basestation market of today, LNAs are implemented using GaAs pHEMT technology. The popularity of GaAs pHEMT technology is based on its excellent low noise and high linearity properties. In this project, an LNA for basestation applications is designed using SiGe technology, which can provide low noise performance, but requires more work to achieve a competitive linearity when comparing with GaAs pHEMT technology. The main motivation of a LNA implementation in SiGe are the lower cost, higher integration possibilities than GaAs. As such, in this master project an ultra-linear LNA has been designed in QUBiC4Xi technology for base station applications in the 1710-1980 MHz band. The requirement for a base station LNA are low noise, high gain, and high linearity. To achieve these goals simultaneously, a 2-stage topology is used where the first stage is optimized for lownoise and high-gain operation, whereas the second stage aims for high linearity and a high 1dB compression point using negative feedback. The first stage is using a cascode topology, which provides high gain and excellent reverse isolation. Its noise figure has been optimized by proper biasing and noise matching. The output stage is implemented using a differential structure, to enhance linearity and output power handling. The techniques used to improve the linearity of the output stage include overall feedback, Implicit IM3 cancellation, 2nd harmonic termination at the output, and out-of-band matching at its output. The out-of-band matching technique has been also evaluated separately for its linearity potential using a simplified Gummel Poon model to understand the impact of individual transistor parasitic (Cje,t f ,Cjc) on linearity. Since the targeted LNA input and output are single-ended, balun have been used in the interstage connection and at output convert from single-ended to differential. The 1 dB compression point of the output stage, which is typically limited by the maximum voltage swing of the transistor technology is in its configuration enhanced by applying impedance transformation in the output balun.","LNA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Microlectronics","",""

(mentor); Stikkelman, R.M. (mentor); Bots, P.W.G. (mentor); Deighton, S.F.R. (mentor)","2013","Upstream oil companies in the Middle East are more frequently confronted with decisions on continuing the oil production of mature oil fields. The low production rates of mature fields generate low revenues. Considerable investments are often needed to continue with the production of oil at a mature field until the field is depleted because the production stations installed are deteriorating. Oil companies are only willing to make considerable investments when future oil revenues compensate the investment. However recovering the investment is uncertain, because of the low and difficult to extract remaining oil volumes. Rationalisation projects are executed to assess if and how it is possible to continue with the production of oil at a mature field. As part of these projects, remnant life assessments are executed. The purpose of the assessment is to determine the condition of production equipment. The results are used to define effective concepts plans to prolong the remnant life of equipment and to support decision-makers in deciding if it is feasible to continue the production of oil at a mature oil field. However, remnant life predictions are inaccurate and the uncertainty of the remnant life prediction might result in economical suboptimal decisions. Uncertainties complicate decision-making processes, as decision-makers do not know to what extent they can rely on provided information to support them in decision making. The described problems result in the following research question. To what extent could uncertainty quantification of remnant life predictions of oil production assets have consequences for decision-making processes in rationalisation projects in the Middle Eastern oil industry? First a desk research was conducted that provided an overview of how decision-making processes under uncertainty can be arranged and what stakeholders are involved in the Middle Eastern oil industry. The results of the desk research were used as a basis for interviews with experts that are or have been involved in decision-making processes to analyse how decisions are actually made by Middle Eastern oil companies and what the role of remnant life assessments is in decision-making process of rationalisation projects. Finally an experiment has been conducted to determine if the uncertainty quantification of a remnant life prediction provides interesting results and how this could influence the decision-making process. The uncertainty of the remnant life prediction is caused by uncertainty about degradation mechanisms, the stability of the degradation rate and the production conditions in the past, present and future. Furthermore it is caused by assumptions that have to be made by the analysts to execute the analysis. The direct consequences for the decision-making process will be marginal. The only probable consequences are that the concepts plans that are designed and developed by project teams will be more detailed, feasible and effective and project teams will be able to time maintenance or equipment replacements better thanks to the quantified uncertainty of the remnant life prediction. Uncertainty quantification is not necessarily needed for decision-makers who prefer to use single value predictions in their decision-making processes and strategic behaviour by any of the stakeholder is considered to be improbable as it will harm the relation between stakeholders. Although the consequences for the decision-making are slightly disappointing in regard to the scope of this research, it is expected that uncertainty quantification will become more important in the future.","decision-making process; upstream oil industry; remnant life analysis; uncertainty quantification; institutional context","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-11-28","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering Systems and Services","","Energy and Industry","",""

(mentor); Spronck, J.W. (mentor); Delgado Lopes, G.A. (mentor); Ostayen, R.A.J. (mentor)","2013","This master thesis describes the dynamical behaviour of a loudspeaker woofer and the modelling of it. By the use of the knowledge gained from the model, a feedback controller is implemented in order to enhance the woofer’s performance in terms of acoustic total harmonic distortion (THD) and low frequency bandwidth. The first objective of the research is to build a woofer set-up that suppresses the THD below 1% during operation. The second objective is to evaluate diaphragm break-up and compensate for this break-up by the use of feedback. The woofer is equipped with an accelerometer sensor. By the use of feedback, the motion of the voice-coil of the loudspeaker is controlled. This enhanced motion results into an acoustic enhancement. Since the motion of only a single point on the woofer diaphragm is measured and used for feedback, only the local distortion is reduced. Even when feedback is applied, the surround of the woofer is radiating acoustic distortion. Initially a woofer is used that has some very specific characteristics in terms of acoustic radiation. The contribution of distortion by the surround is large with the chosen woofer. Therefore, the increase in performance measured on the accelerometer is not identical to the increase in performance measured by the microphone. Where the accelerometer is mounted, the motion of the diaphragm is improved, but the acoustic distortion radiated by the surround is not reduced. After analysing the first woofer, the knowledge gained from the experiments is used to determine a better candidate for the experiments. The experiments are repeated on a second set-up. Two important observations have led to the final result. One observation is that the surround of the woofer is a large contributor of the acoustic radiation. Choosing a woofer that is very uniform in terms of the distortion profile across the diaphragm, is advised. In that situation, when the motion of the location where the sensor is mounted is improved, the same holds for the surround of the woofer. Secondly, it is observed that when using a piezoelectric sensor, the sensor output is not only determined by the acceleration. Stress leading to deformation of the sensor is measured too. When the contribution of measured deformation becomes dominant over the measured acceleration, the magnitude of the signal is that of the deformation instead of the acceleration. For low frequencies, this leads to a limitation in terms of potential loop gain. To some extend, both problems have been solved by the use of a different type of sensor mount and by a careful selection of the woofer. The second woofer used, has an acoustic distortion profile that is nearly identical across the membrane. This observation indicates that for the operating bandwidth of the woofer, the motion of the diaphragm is a close match to that of a rigid piston. Increasing the performance in terms of the motion of the centre, therefore leads to an increase in performance throughout the entire diaphragm. In order to solve the problem of the measured deformation of the sensor, a different type of sensor mount is designed. This sensor mount reduces the deformation of the sensor. This leads to a steeper roll-off slope in the sub-resonant frequency band of the woofer. This steeper slope makes it possible to design a controller, that leads to higher distortion suppression. The achieved reduction of harmonic distortion measured on the accelerometer sensor is up to 22 dB, a factor 12,5. The acoustic reduction of harmonic distortion measured with a microphone is up to 22 dB too. In practice, the frequency band of this high suppression is narrow. The frequency band in which the suppression is over 17 dB, a factor 7, is between 40 Hz and 150 Hz. When the woofer excursion becomes large, the THD without feedback can be over 12,5%. Suppressing the distortion by a factor 12,5 therefore does not lead to the target THD of under 1%. The diaphragm break-up is evaluated, but a controller that suppresses this motion is not implemented. A controller would only compensate for the break-up effect on the diaphragm location where the sensor is mounted. The actual break-up in the diaphragm would remain.","woofer; loudspeaker; transducer; feedback; control; MFB; motional feedback; acceleration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","Mechatronic System Design","",""

(mentor)","2013","Computational modeling offers the possibility to design alloys in a cheaper and faster way. A model for surface segregation for binary alloys in vacuum and by adsorption and absorption of gases was developed and applied. The proposed model was used in conjunction with the Miedema semi-empirical model for the calculation of enthalpies of solution and formation of binary alloys and with the cluster variation method (CVM) for the calculation of the ? and ? phase boundaries in the ternary Pd-M-H systems. The models for segregation were applied in a temperature range from 298K to 600K, considering the surface plane (111) of the FCC crystal structure. The model for segregation in vacuum was applied to Pd-Au, Pd-Ag, Pd-Cu, Pd-Ni and Pd-Pt. For this case Pd is segregated for the Pd-Pt alloys only. By increasing the temperature from 298K to 600K, the surface concentrations of Pd decreased for all of the alloys. By varying the plane from (111) to (100) few changes were observed. The calculated results compared to experiments were found to be in good agreement for Pd-Au and Pd-Ag. For the model of surface segregation by adsorption and chemisorption, H2, CO and O2 gases on Pd-Ag, Pd-Cu, Pd-Ni and Pd-Pt were considered. In the presence of adsorbed or chemisorbed hydrogen, segregation of Pd was found for Pd-Ag, Pd-Cu and Pd-Pt alloys. For adsorbed O2 and CO on Pd-Ag and Pd-Cu alloys gases, segregation of Pd was enhanced. The model for segregation by absorption of hydrogen was applied for Pd-Ag, Pd-Cu, Pd-Ni and Pd-Pt alloys, using a hydrogen (bulk) concentration of 0.50 H/M. No Pd segregation was found for Pd-Ag alloys. For Pd-Pt alloys, Pd segregation was observed. For Pd-Cu alloys with large concentrations of Pd, a surface enrichment of Pd was calculated, while for alloys with low concentration of Pd a slight Cu surface enrichment was observed. Enhanced segregation of Ni was found for Pd-Ni alloys. The H/M fractions at the boundaries of the ? and ? phase obtained with the CVM for the Pd85Ag15H system were used as input values to calculate the surface concentration of Ag. As the hydrogen concentration was increased, the surface segregation of Pd also increased. For the surface segregation by adsorption and absorption combined, segregation of Pd was observed for Pd-Ag, Pd-Cu and Pd-Pt alloys. Surface enrichment of Ni was found for Pd-Ni alloys. The proposed model enables to predict surface segregation under various conditions and the results show that it is affected by many parameters.","surface; segregation; palladium; binary Alloys; palladium membranes; hydrogen adsorption; hydrogen absorption; Miedema Model; Cluster Variation Method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Department of Materials Science and Engineering","","Master Materials Science and Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2013","During the entire era of space flight air launch is seen as a very promising concept. Despite its claimed advantages, air launch is up till now only a marginal success with the Pegasus launch vehicle from Orbital Sciences. In this study is investigated for which conditions expendable air launched vehicles can achieve a performance gain compared with expendable ground launched vehicles. The scope of this study is limited to near-term feasible concepts. Therefore, only existing carrier aircraft that require minimum modifications are evaluated. Solid propelled rockets are more promising for air launch than liquid rockets, therefore, only solid propelled rockets are considered during this study. Potential markets for launch vehicles with a 10 kg and 2,000 kg payload capability to low earth orbit are identified. The influences of different launch parameters and the presence of a wing on the potential performance gain of air launch are investigated. A Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) is deemed the most suitable approach for the comparison between air launch and ground launch. In earlier thesis work performed at the TU Delft a MDO tool in the Tudat framework is developed by Jan Vandamme. This tool is used as a starting point for this work but is heavily modified and expanded. Air launch can provide a reduction in the cost per flight between 26.9 and 31.3%. For a payload of 10 kg the gross take-off weight of the launch vehicle can be reduced with 66.7-70.1% while this is 33.6-47.4% for the 2,000 kg payload class vehicles. Moreover, air launch reduces the amount of ?V required to orbit with between 935 and 1,225 m/s compared to ground launch for a 10 kg payload for subsonic launch conditions. The ?V advantage of air launch for the 2,000 kg payload class is between 302 and 797 m/s. Winged vehicles provide a small cost advantage (2.45%) compared to wingless vehicles for horizontal launch as well as an advantage for the GTOW (19.9%) and the required amount of ?V to orbit (4.60%). As soon as a winged launch vehicle will be released under a positive flight path angle the cost advantage and the ?V advantage of the winged configuration will diminish quickly.","launch vehicles; expendable launch vehicles; air launch","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-01-11","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","Astrodynamics & Space Missions","",""

They believe that flexworkers have a greater influence on the activity in the city during the day (and night), than people with a fixed ‘9 to 5’ workday, since flexworkers move throughout the city in order to find a place to work at. Therefor the focus of this graduation project is on ‘flexworkers’. In the end it is expected to create a product that contri- butes to the flexible life of this target group. In order to design a product that fits the needs of the flexworker, a lot of effort is put on finding out what this group of people experience during their days when working flexible. Not only during a field re- search to experience what it is like to be a flexworker moving through the city, but also by actually getting in touch with professional flexwor- kers. Access to the target group’s experiences is gained in the target group research by exploring what flexworkers do, by observing what they use, by uncovering what they know and by listening to what these flexworkers have to say. Flexworkers are not utilizing the opportunities that the city has to offer to the fullest, since the total offer of workspots is not clear to them. It is notable that flexworkers often choose to work at one or two favou- rite places, but to make a deliberate choice for a new and inspiring workspot that suits the work that needs to be done, the right informa- tion is simply missing. They not only want to know whére they can work, but also hów they can work. Since the flexible workspots are spread all over the city, flexworkers never know who they might encounter. However, flexworkers have a clear opinion of their peers: you need to stay in touch and stimulate proper working. They feel it is important to be able to mean something to one another even if they are apart from each other. This form of personal contact seems to be generally appreciated; even if peo- ple are busy, they make time available for it. Networking is of great importance to flexworkers. They believe that they are able to help each other when necessary. Sharing of information and knowledge (kruisbestuiving) is a mindset, an idea that every flexworker agrees with. To set a direction for the concept to be designed, a vision has been formulated: “I would like flexworkers to be aware of the possibilities the city has to offer when they are in search for a workspot and I want them to feel assured that there is always a connection between them and someone else in the community of flexworkers....” The final concept is called ‘Flexify’. With this application flexworkers are able to find new and inspiring places to work at, depending on the type of work that needs to be done, instead of doing their work at home or at their offices. Flexworkers can share and recommend their location with other flex- workers in order to let them know what kind of flexible workspots the city has to offer. Via this way, flexers can stimulate other flexers to discover places that are new to them. ‘Flexify’ also creates a community in which flexworkers can connect kindred or other (available) flexers, at the moment they feel the need to meet somebody in order to get inspired, to brainstorm or to get any type of stimulation. ‘Flexify’ simply helps flexworkers to find their spot and to discover the city!","flexworker; flexer; Rotterdam; application; bustle; networking; flexible workspot","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Meijer, S.A. (mentor); Sillem, S. (mentor); Van Luipen, J.J.W. (mentor)","2013","ProRail is trying to increase the capacity of the rail infrastructure since the need for capacity is still growing. One of the ways to do this is by implementing DDDR (Dynamic double non-interrupted braking), which is part of the DSSU project. By implementing DDDR the expectations of the status of the signs of the train drivers might change. Therefore ProRail wants to investigate if implementing DDDR will have a negatively impact on safety. In this thesis is investigated how situation awareness (SA) can be measured and if it is a useful safety indicator to take safety decisions. SA measurements can be used for testing if the perception, comprehension, and expectations of the signs in the environment are influenced by DDDR. Decisions are made based on the SA; an informed, conscious decision cannot be made without a correct SA. SA is a requirement, not a guarantee, for making informed, conscious decisions. Three factors are identified that influence the acceptability of the SA measurements. First, the safety culture has an impact on the acceptability. It is more likely that negative results will be neglected when companies have a bad safety culture. Second, strategic decision-making has an impact on the acceptability. In all phases of decision making; goal formulation, alternative generation, and evaluation and selection, should safety be incorporated. Other interest, such as economic interest, might get the upper hand when safety is not incorporated in all three steps. Third, the use of the Common Safety Method (CSM) is a formal requirement for the acceptability of the results. The CSM has three requirements for measuring safety: the safety of a new design should be comparable with the current situation, since the safety should be at least as good as the current situation, the method should correctly reflect the system, the used parameters and results should be accurate enough to serve as a robust decision-support. The best method for comparing designs is a controlled before and after study. For the best comparison between designs, the researcher can use a simulator in order that he can exactly determine which elements are changed in the situation. Since people can show different behaviour when they are being tested, they should not be informed when they are being tested. Arbitrary measurement moments can be chosen to enhance that participants do not show different behaviour when they are studied; the participant cannot prepare for the measurements. To make the outcome of the study more robust, a mixed method design can be used; the conclusion of a study is more robust if all the methods have the same outcome. Situation awareness global assessment technique (SAGAT) is the best-known direct and objective measurement method for SA; this is the recommended method for determining SA for train drivers. By combining this method with the Mission awareness rating scale (MARS), a more robust answer can be found. In the DSSU study, SAGAT was capable to identify differences in SA between scenarios. MARS was not capable to show significant differences between scenarios, because of the low amount of participants. The SA study was combined with a workload study via eye-tracking and biometric measurements, and a qualitative time-to Signal Passed at Danger (TT-STS) study. These studies combined concluded that the probability of a Signal Passed at Danger (SPAD) decreases in DSSU compared to the current situation. Generalizability should be taken into account before a study is executed if in the future new SA measurements will be held. In the DSSU project the outcome of the study only applied to DSSU. By using the identified elements in chapter 7, scenarios can be made which are expected to have a bad influence on the SA. The worst-case scenario for SA can be used for measuring SA in the project. If this scenario is not applicable for the researched project, management has to decide whether they want results that are only applicable for the project or generic results, which are applicable on a system-level. The SA measurements showed to be a useful indicator for safety when it is combined with TT-STS measurements. The combination of the measurements gave a detailed insight in changed behaviour and awareness in the new situation. SA cannot be used as a single safety indicator, since SA is a requirement, and not a guarantee, for making informed, conscious, and safe decisions.","situation; awareness; decision-making; safety","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Policy, Organisational Law & Gaming","","Engineering And Policy Analysis","",""

(mentor); Jimenez Garcia, J.C. (mentor); Corporaal, B. (mentor)","2013","Cancer. Probably one of the most feared words when discussing your or a loved one’s health. It is needless to say that the diagnosis of cancer has a big impact on people. The diagnosis and treatment can cause a disruption in their emotional well-being, which can also distress their family and friends. This graduation project eventually focused on the emotional impact of prostate cancer. Prostate cancer is the most common type of cancer among men. Every year approximately 10,000 men in the Netherlands get diagnosed with prostate cancer. One in six men will get diagnosed with prostate cancer in their life, at an average age of 67. If the emotional well-being of prostate cancer patients is enhanced, the likelihood and significance of emotional distress, depression and anxiety can be reduced. The overall quality of life could be improved. Reducing the emotional disruption could also prevent any need for additional psychosocial care, which in the end could lead to a decrease in healthcare utilization and costs. The project was carried out at User Intelligence, an international user experience consultancy. User Intelligence is looking for ways to expand their knowledge of designing for the healthcare industry and its future developments, in particular the design of eHealth solutions. Designing for the healthcare industry can be complicated, due to the decentralized and complex network of stakeholders. At User Intelligence they have been developing a design approach that tries to take the (conflicting) interest(s) of different stakeholders into account and assesses the pain points and potential opportunities in the network. With this graduation project this approach has been put into practice. The main goal was to develop a successful eHealth solution that could reduce the emotional disruption among men with prostate cancer and support them with a sense of control. EHealth products and services in general can be a solution to enhance the quality of healthcare. They could meet the needs of different stakeholders in an efficient, effective and costs lowering way. However, the development of many eHealth solutions is technology driven and regularly misses a user-centered approach. Insights regarding the thoughts, feelings, needs and desires of prostate cancer patients and related stakeholders, like the physician, were gathered. These include the pain points and opportunities that were identified in the complete stakeholder network.  Patients would like to have more personal qualities in the communication with the physician; it is very much appreciated when a physician shows empathy.  Patients found the amount of information they received sometimes overwhelming. Complex details were often meaningless, lack a connection with the patient’s own situation and are difficult to retain.  Within in their families, men can be worried that their disease will distress others. Instead, they like to reassure their family and friends and don’t want other people to feel sorry.  Patients appreciate sharing prostate cancer experiences with peers; it supports them in making decisions. They don’t actively look for peers, because they feel a certain threshold for contacting strangers.  The workload on care providers is high. Physicians are not able to spend more time per patient and feel reluctant to work with new systems that don’t fit in their existing work activities. These insights formed the fundament of the design vision and gave the design exploration direction. Through ideation, concept development and user tests a final concept design was created: Bluebook. Bluebook is an online journaling platform for prostate cancer patients. It enables them to record, collect and reflect on their cancer related experiences, inform others about these experiences and discover relevant experiences of peers. Psychology literature suggests strong correlations between self-reflection and improved self-awareness, decision-making and overall quality of life. 1. With Bluebook the patient is able to inform his care provider(s) about the ins and outs of his personal situation anytime, anywhere. This enables the care provider to create more empathy with the patient. 2. Bluebook provides a continuous tailored feed of tips and thoughts of peers. This information is adjusted to the patient’s personal situation and embedded along his healthcare journey. 3. Patients can share (parts) of their collected experiences with family and friends through Bluebook. It enables patients to tell the bigger picture to different people with a simple action. 4. Through Bluebook patients are able to discover experiences of peers, with a low threshold. 5. The quality of the medical meeting can be increased when the care provider is better informed about the patient’s thoughts and feelings. An interactive prototype of Bluebook was build. It served as a testing tool, supported the decision-making and it gave insight in the interactions of the designed features. The first reaction of patients on Bluebook during tests was very positive. Their feedback matched with the gathered insights and assumptions that were used for the design. The ability to update family, inform the physician and exchanging experiences with peers were evaluated as very valuable. In the end all participants mentioned that they believe the value of using Bluebook would outweigh the effort. An interviewed oncologist expects that the potential impact of the concept on the emotional well-being of the patient and his family could be significant.","Cancer; Prostate; Emotional; Journal; Peers; Psychosocial; Psycho-oncology; Oncology; Urology; Interaction; User experience; Patient; Stakeholder map; Website; Reflection; Self-reflection; Personal Informatics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Henze, L.A.R. (mentor)","2013","This thesis is part of my graduation project at the OV-chipkaart Graduation Lab of the Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering at the Delft University of Technology. The aim of the Graduation Lab is to improve electronic ticketing for travellers using Dutch public transport in a 3 to 10 year time-span. This work is supported by the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment, provinces (IPO), city regions (SkVV), Dutch Railways (NS), Rotterdam public transport (RET), and consumer organisation Rover. OV-chipkaart system The analysis of the OV-chipkaart system has made clear there are many aspects to the development of such a vast system. The technology and business aspects have been dominant in the development of this particular system. Travellers are expected to follow and adapt to the system instead of making use of the strengths of technology. The system is built on some principles like a decentralized system and face calculation at the end of the trip. These principles determine the usage to a large extent and are hard to change. Technology-based Self-service bring potentially advantages like availability and speed. With the introduction of the OV-chipkaart these systems have become more important when using public transport, but lack coherence across the entire OV-chipkaart service. Problems Travellers are facing problems when they interact with the OV-chipkaart in the public transport domain. Recognition of ‘OV-chipkaart moments’ The location of validators is different for many train stations. Most travellers are scanning the station for validators and regularly forget when they are distracted. Not only the location is important for the findability, the appearance of the equipment is in competition with other services and equipment. Coherence of services and equipment Many travellers use more than just validators. For adding credit or resolving errors, they use other equipment or service channels. The current equipment is in most cases not coherent and are not presented as a product family, working together to achieve a common goal. The interaction starts over again with each touchpoint making it an unpleasant and time consuming experience for travellers. Consistency of equipment appearance and messaging The equipment in the travel domain comes from various suppliers and have differnt appearances. All transport operators maintain their own equipment or have it done by their suppliers. Operators use different messages for similar or the same tasks. Travellers have to learn these difference or they just skip the text and try to grasp the meaning of light and audio signals. This is undesirable. Proposal: the payment border The payment border is a zone in which travellers have to perform an action to acquire a valid ticket for their trip by public transport. Validation also means making the transition from an unpaid to a paid area. The concept is a collection of various touchpoints which contribute to an overall interaction for all travellers which guide them in passing the payment border. The payment zone contains three stage: wayfinding & recognition; information & support; validation. The wayfinding & recognition stage is facilitated by the vertical and horizontal parts of the portal. The border is clearly visible from a distance, it is easier for travellers to locate and recognize where they have to validate their OV-chipkaart. The dimensions and angles of the validator have been altered for an optimal validation. The various messages on the display have been made more coherent. The information & support stage is now integrated in the payment border zone: a information panel is added and the information and SOS post is now located near the border. The aim of the redesigned touchpoints was to create an overall coherent validation interaction. All different touchpoints are now (re)designed and linked to facilitate this coherent interaction. With this result it should now be clear for travellers where to validate and what to do. By applying this payment border to all stations it should bring recognition with travellers. The design does not only facilitates ‘normal’ validation but also anticipates on unusual situations like an unexpected OV-chipkaart failure. Conclusions With the introduction of the OV-chipkaart new touchpoints were added to travel domains, rules and actions changed. New interactions were formed, but were never designed. Travellers are facing many problems when they interact with the OV-chipkaart system. The payment border concept brings clarity in the required actions. Travellers are supported by a seamless link between all the touchpoints in the payment border. Both the successful and failing validation actions are supported by the touchpoints. Based on the feedback from the evaluation study, it is expected that the introduction of the payment border concept will increase the usability of the OV-chipkaart. Implementation and further development should be done by a central, independent organisation. This organisation should also develop future concepts when technology platforms change.","ov-chipkaart; electronic ticketing; e-ticketing; user-centered design; OV-chipkaart Graduation Lab; public transport","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor)","2013","Growing concerns about the environmental impact of aircraft operations and increasing fuel prices have led to the demand for more fuel-efficient aircraft. One of the technologies with the potential to offer a significant reduction in fuel burn is the open rotor engine. However, the noise emissions of such engines are higher than for turbofans, partially due to the typical installation of the open rotor in a pusher configuration. The wake shed by the upstream pylon results in a velocity deficit at the propeller disk, leading to unsteady blade loads and additional noise emissions. This thesis investigated the potential of pylon trailing edge blowing to reduce the adverse effects of airframe installation on the performance and noise emissions of pusher propellers. Experimental and numerical analyses were performed, focusing on the pylon wake profiles, the propeller performance, and the propeller noise emissions. The experiments were executed in Delft University of Technology's Open Jet Facility using a scale model pylon and a single-rotating powered propeller model. The numerical analysis combined an existing propeller lifting line code with analytic methods suited to predict the effects of installation on the propeller performance and noise emissions. Pylon wake measurements showed that application of the pylon trailing edge blowing system resulted in reductions in the integral wake velocity deficit of up to 60% when compared to the unblown configuration. However, no full mixing of the external flow and the flow blown into the pylon wake was obtained. As a result, the application of blowing did not completely eliminate the pylon wake, but instead led to a velocity overshoot in the wake center and two local minima left and right of the wake centerline. From the studies of the propeller performance it was concluded that the effects of installation on the time-averaged performance are small, with maximum differences between the isolated (without pylon) and installed (with pylon) thrust and torque of less than 2% for advance ratios below 1.4. For the same advance ratio range the peak-to-peak variations in the installed thrust and torque were computed to be smaller than 4% of the mean value. Excellent agreement was obtained between the experimental and numerical time-averaged isolated propeller performance for advance ratios above 0.7, with a maximum difference of 1% between the computed and measured data. The measurements of the propeller noise emissions showed that the sound pressure level (SPL) of the propeller tones is strongly increased due to the installation effects, with noise penalties of up to 10 to 25 dB for the first six tones occurring at integer multiples of the blade passage frequency (BPF). Broadband levels on the other hand were unaffected by the presence of the upstream pylon. The application of blowing resulted in significant noise reductions when compared to the unblown installed case. Depending on the operating conditions, at the highest blowing rate considered SPL reductions were obtained of up to 4 dB for the 1BPF tone, 8 dB for the 2BPF tone, and 12 dB for the 3BPF tone. Furthermore, the higher BPF tones (4BPF and above) were practically eliminated. The evolution of the noise reduction due to blowing as a function of the advance ratio followed the trend in the noise penalty due to installation, thereby confirming that the application of blowing indeed successfully opposes the installation effects.","propeller; propeller noise; pylon blowing; aeroacoustics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy, Flight Performance and Propulsion","","Aerodynamics","",""

In order to identify possible unsafe situations and vessels breaking the law, a port traffic control authority needs to observe marine vessel traffic 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Human operators are good at identifying abnormal behavior, but are unable to do so for extended periods of time. In this thesis we propose a system that is able to support marine traffic controllers with their monitoring tasks. This system aims to emulate the reasoning processes of human operators. Towards that goal, we have developed (Bayesian) reasoning models based on operator knowledge. Alongside these models, the system employs statistically derived information about shipping movement from sources such as Automatic Identification System (AIS). Using this combination of modeled and learned knowledge, the system is able to determine the probability of the behavior observed being suspicious. Using this measure of “suspiciousness”, the system can then help focus the attention of an operator on most important objects first, e.g. by sending and alert about vessels that behave differently from the norm and have a high suspiciousness probability. It can also send alerts about vessels that are not acting in accordance to the law as determined by a rule-based system or vessels that send alert messages themselves.","AIS; Bayesian Network; Operator Support; Behavior Detection; Marine Traffic Monitoring; Big Data; Knowledge Modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-11-16","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","Media and Knowledge Engineering","",""

Levees, bank revetments and training dikes ensure navigability and safety against ?ooding. Construction of dams in the upstream branches led to a decay in sediment supply of 70% during the last 100 years. Due to man-made constrictions, more sediment is spilled out in the Gulf of Mexico. In this Master Thesis, the Lower Mississippi River is subject to morphodynamic modeling with Delft3D to ?nd answers for the question, if there is a feasible way to restore the deltaic wetlands that su?er from high land loss rates due to land subsidence and sea-level rise without putting navigation at stake. In delta restoration plannings, sediment diversions play an important role as they convey sediment laden water to the marsh areas and, this way, largely contribute to new land-building. Several approaches are tested with the created model to understand the e?ect of altered ?ow and sediment discharge distributions on the morphology of the main channel. For a good approximation and description of the physical processes, the model comprises important factors such as dredging activities, diversion sites, salt water intrusion, and quasi-steady discharge periods. Several scenarios were tested, e.g. di?erent operation modes of planned sediment diversions and discharge distributions at Old River Control Structure. From the model outcome the conclusions can be drawn that a combination of a pulsed operation of ORCS and large-scale diversions as proposed by Parker et al. seems to be the most e?ective solution for wetland restoration in themodel domain as it only leads to similar deposition rates upstream of Venice, only slightly higher dredging volumes in the downstream reach and high sediment diversion, whereas the implementation of multiple diversions seems tbe more feasible, as they are already considered in the CWPPRA Masterplan. Moreover, it was found that additional groin ?elds can help to ensure navigability downstream of sediment diversions and thus mitigate negative morphological e?ects in the main channel. In the end, it must be emphasized that the application of additional diversions can stabilize local delta regions, but without higher sediment supply from upstream, the diverted amount of sediment is not su?cient for wetland restoration on a larger scale.","Sediment Diversion; Mississippi","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-11-23","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Environmental Fluid Dynamics","",""

(mentor); Smit, R. (mentor)","2013","Video Conferencing systems have become highly popular with the explosion of bandwidth and computing power. This has made high quality video conference possible on embedded hand held devices. This has created an ecosystem of companies developing applications which are powered by video conferencing libraries and a parallel ecosystem of companies who make those video conferencing libraries. An application developer has to design his system in a way that the video conferencing library (which is the backbone of the application) is efficiently integrated and is performing optimally. In order to do that, the developer must be acutely aware of features such as platform compatibility, resource usage, performance boundaries and bottlenecks of the library in order to make an informed decision. Hence the developer needs a test-bench which can evaluate the above mentioned features. This thesis mainly discusses the need to arrive at one such test framework followed by the framework itself. The framework designed in this thesis consists of a network emulator which is combined with a popular network protocol analyser. It profiles the library and monitors variables essential to Quality of Service (QoS) like bandwidth usage, frame rates, frame/packet sizes and audio/video delay under varying network conditions. By observing the change in these variables, the QoS offered by the library can be determined. This information can also be extrapolated to understand the challenges in guaranteeing a minimum quality of experience (QoE). This thesis applies the framework on one chosen library (Library 1) and Google Hangouts and discusses the results. The performance of the library under varying network conditions (bandwidth, packet loss and latency) is observed, enabling Presence Displays BV to extract information about how the library works. Presence Displays BV is building a video conferencing enabled product and uses the framework discussed in this thesis to analyse video conferencing libraries in order to build the application around it. It has been observed that Library 1 favours video quality above other parameters and only compromises video quality to accommodate more users participating in a call. Google Hangouts favours audio, motion content in the video, interactivity and robustness over video quality. This information can be used to configure Library 1 in a way such that it delivers maximum QoE in the available resources.","video conferencing; measurement analysis; quality of experience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","MSc Embedded Systems","",""

This work focuses instead on understanding the original constructive Schedule Generation heuristics and their interaction with a well known but poorly understood post-processing step called Forward-Backward Improvement that is known to almost always improve any generated RCPSP schedule. We follow an empirical investigation methodology by first observing the effect of FBI on a large generated testset. Based on these observations we explain why FBI works by means of hypotheses on its operation. These hypotheses generate predictions that we subsequently successfully test in a second round of experiments. In the process we are able to propose a novel priority rule heuristic based on the principles of FBI. We find that this new rule outperforms the current best priority rule heuristic.","Resource Constrained Project Scheduling; Priority Rule Heuristics; Forward-Backward Improvement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-11-12","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Algorithmics","",""

(mentor); De Rijk, T.R.A. (mentor); Ceelen, S. (mentor); Schonewille, G. (mentor)","2013","ZeeZout is a young Dutch company focused at events in the (underground) house music. A strong believe in music as common ground between people leads ZeeZout as a growing brand in the Dutch electronic music scene. With different events throughout the Netherlands, ZeeZout is striving to build a strong brand in house music, both through earning the trust and love of new clubbers as through further creating its own musical path. Current day, The Netherlands is literally overloaded with (music) festivals. The first outdoor festival starts at the end of March already and the parade continues to half way September. So, how does a young event agency with an organic operation mode make a difference in a full festival market locked by major players? The unique selling points (USP) of ZeeZout can be found in the atmosphere at the events created by the visitors. Their vast group of followers made ZeeZout as what it is today. The ‘known faces culture’ at the events is unique and creates a ZeeZout specific atmosphere. Programming for a broader audience by bringing disco, house and techno together creates greater support that enables future growth. The number of festivals in the Netherlands has increased fivefold over thirty years time. 2012 is the first year that shows decline in the number of festivals. Looking at Electronic Dance Music shows that 10 the growth of dance music festivals has a bigger impact on the total festival market than it appears, and shows no sign of decline yet. Because of the availability of ‘festival-ready’ locations the growing popularity of dance music, more small event agencies arise organizing small festivals. However, to become a household name in the festival scene is far more difficult. Differentiation within this industry is very hard; solutions can be found in marketing, story telling and niche approach. The business model is used to visualized the company and to select most valuable assets. The designed strategy proposes to build on existing values and to expend the portfolio with festival experiences in cities were ZeeZout is currently active. Key business units of the niche market approach are: Brand, Club and Festival with overall goal to become a label of quality that has earned the trust of a segment of the dancing Dutchman. The proposed action plan is translated into practice with the design of Rotterdam’s (ex)change festival. The new designed festival brings multiple parties together, Rotterdam Festivals, ZeeZout and Ducos Productions. The collaboration with Rotterdam Unlimited resulted in a crossover festival that is an extend of the multicultural city and addresses the needs and wishes of the involved parties, the city of Rotterdam and its inhabitants. With (ex)change and the proposed strategy, ZeeZout can grow from underground towards becoming an event brand.","strategy; culture; music; festival; brand; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-11-20","Industrial Design Engineering","Strategic Product Design","","","",""

(mentor); Forgione, M. (mentor)","2013","Crystallization is a slow chemical process evolving in a reactor called crystallizer. A solution initialized in a high temperature is cooled down such that the dissolved solute is transferred from the solution into pure crystalline phase. The evolution of the process characterizes the properties of the crystals in the end-product. The transient nature of the process together with the stochasticity that governs the chemical kinetic phenomena motivate the development of efficient methods for identification and control. The kinetics of the process are modeled with nonlinear equations which contain a number of parameters to be identified from the measured data. An appropriate model is required such that model-based control techniques can be implemented. Under these conditions, experiment design for open loop control of the crystallization is studied in this thesis where a nonlinear model of the crystallization is used as a model structure in the prediction error identification framework. A temperature cooling profile constitutes the input to the system which must be designed in such a way that the crystals formed at the end of the process admit the desired performance criteria. The first part of the thesis deals with the derivation of the optimal cooling profile using the D-optimality criterion in order to obtain the most informative data about the kinetic parameters. Sequentially, an optimization method is used as an open loop control law for the crystallization process. The selection of the optimal input profile is achieved by minimization of the performance degradation, occurring in the controlled process, from the use of the identified model instead of the true unknown system.","crystallization; system identification; experiment design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

In order to increase the light trapping in the solar cells, the ZnO:Al front electrode is wet-etched and nano-texturing is introduced on it. However, a decrease in the electrical performance is noticed with introducing the nano-textures. This decrease is caused by the formation of defect-rich filaments in the absorber layer at the sharp concaves of the wet-etched ZnO:Al. To that direction, the glass substrate is etched prior to the deposition of the ZnO:Al. That way, craters of large diameters (>5?m) are introduced in the surface of the etched glass. Subsequently the ZnO:Al is deposited and textured, so that modulated surface textures are introduced in the TCO. Etched glass, etched ZnO:Al and modulated surface textures substrates are tested in nc-Si:H solar cells with various absorber layer thickness, as well as in micromorph solar cells. The result is an improved electrical performance for the solar cells on etched glass substrates even for thick absorber layers, that is because of the smooth growth of the absorber layer on top of the TCO.

(mentor)","2013","Forecast models often depend on unknown parameters, such as model initial and boundary conditions, or other tunable parameters not necessarily having any physical meaning. Calibration of these parameters to minimize errors between forecasted and observed states is called data assimilation. A common approach in this context are variational methods, of which four dimensional data variation (4D-VAR) is studied in this thesis. In 4D-VAR, a cost function is defined that penalizes misfits between observations and the corresponding numerical model results, obtained by running the model with the chosen configuration. Performing optimization with regard to this cost function yields an improved initial parameter set. Associated with this type of methods, however, are difficulties in connection with programming the adjoint model, which is needed to compute the exact gradient of the cost function. Additionally, having to integrate the adjoint model backwards in time adds significantly to the computational cost of the data assimilation process. To avoid manual implementation of adjoint code and to reduce computational complexity, approximation of the gradient calculation is considered through the use of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), a flexible data-driven order reduction method. To facilitate this, a finite element model of the shallow water equations is tested with both the full adjoint 4D-VAR method and two different POD-reduced approaches. Twin experiments are performed and comparisons are made in terms of accuracy, computational complexity and sensitivity to perturbation and number of observation points.","4D-VAR; model order reduction; POD; shallow water equations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied mathematics","","","",""

(mentor); Simao Ferreira, C.J. (mentor); Bernhammer, L.O. (mentor)","2013","The knowledge about Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWT) lags behind the knowledge about Horizontal AxisWind Turbines (HAWT), since most of the development of VAWT’s ceased after the 80’s. A lack of insight exists about how certain design parameters affect the rotor design of a modern VAWT. The objective of this thesis is to gain knowledge about the influence of the size (power capacity) of the turbine on the structural rotor performance of multi-megawatt VAWT’s by optimizing the rotor design. The influence of the size is expressed by scaling trends. The scope is limited to the structural design of the rotor blade and struts. The major loads on the rotor structure are aerodynamic, gravitational, and centrifugal loads. Fatigue, buckling, and resonance are the failure modes driving the design of the VAWT rotor. Modern manufacturing techniques of composite materials are believed to have a significant effect on the VAWT rotor design, since they offer more flexibility in the blade geometry. The mass increase of the blades is identified as a limiting factor for upscaling wind turbines. Gradient-based optimizations are performed to find the optimum 3-bladed H-rotor and Darrieus rotor designs for different rotor sizes and heights. The structural rotor performance is assessed by the ratio of the rotor mass over projected area. The laminate thicknesses and the shape of the rotor structure are varied in search of the optimum performance. A constant tip speed ratio and blade solidity is imposed on the optimization. Furthermore, constraints are imposed to prevent failure of the rotor structure. Optimizations of the VAWT rotor are performed for rotor sizes ranging from 3 MW to 20 MW. Rotor mass reductions for the carbon-fiber 20 MW H-VAWT and Darrieus VAWT of respectively 35% and 44% are obtained with respect to the fiberglass HAWT rotors. Despite this mass reduction, the material cost of the HAWT rotor will be significantly smaller. The optimized VAWT rotors are rough approximations of the best design solutions because of restrictions on the design space. In general, expanding the design space of the optimization yields better design solutions. In future VAWT rotor design optimization, the design space should allow for a variable diameter-to-height ratio of the rotor, since this parameter is driving the structural rotor performance.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Wind Energy","","","",""

(mentor); Caarls, W. (mentor)","2013","Future robotic systems are expected to be so complex, that the required information -- or prior knowledge -- to program them is not always available and has thus to be discovered in an alternative way. This can be done using Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms, that learn from experience. This way of programming can also be beneficial for current robotic systems. For example robots where small changes in the hardware due to: design evolutions, repairs or production tolerances require updates to the control algorithms. A algorithm that learns to complete a task without prior knowledge could do this regardless of the changes and thus make frequent, time consuming, reprogramming and/or tuning unnecessary. The robot used in this thesis is a small ant like hexapod robot that is still in development. It is developed to take advantage of the high volume to power ratio, at low weights of Shape Memory Alloy actuators and to show collaborative behaviour. The task is to find a controller that lets this robot walk as fast as possible from A to B while using minimum prior knowledge. Three approaches to achieve this are proposed in this thesis, these are in descending amount of required prior knowledge: Min-Max, Cost Function Search and the Flat approach. All use a hierarchical division, where low level actions -- like forward or left -- and the combination of these actions, to reach the goal are learned separately. The approaches differ in the way they learn the low level actions. Min-Max uses fully defined sub-goals that are assumed to be sufficient to solve the problem. The Cost Function Search tries to find relevant sub-goals to solve the problem and the Flat approach tries to find the best low level actions by evaluating the performance of the found controller. In general it is expected that if more prior knowledge is used the algorithm learns faster and/or finds better results. The algorithms are compared using a simulator, where surprisingly the Cost Function Search method is found to result in controllers performing up to factor two better than the Min-Max approach and a factor four better that the flat approach. This indicates that care should be taken how prior knowledge is used as it not always leads to better results. Test on the robot show that the influence of repairs is significant and that the robot is able to learn to walk in straight line. It is believed that due to the back of the robot dragging on the floor it is unable to turn sharply and thus reach goals situated next to the robot. This in combination with frequent breakdowns made it impossible to test the complete algorithms on this version of the robot. Further test using an improved version of the robot need to be done to obtain conclusive results.","learning; walking; robot; hexapod; reinforcement; prior knowledge","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-06-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

Compared to analog PLLs, all-digital phase-locked loops (ADPLLs) are preferred in nanoscale CMOS, as they offer benefits of smaller area, programmability, capability of extensive self-calibrations, and easy portability. However, analog PLLs dominate the ulp arena, since the time-to-digital converter (TDC) of an ADPLL has traditionally been power hungry. In this work [1], an ultra-low power 2.1 GHz – 2.7 GHz fractional-N ADPLL is presented for wireless personal area network (WPAN) applications. A DTC-assisted snapshot TDC and a DC-coupled DCO buffer with a tunable voltage transfer characteristic (VTC) are proposed to lower the power consumption. The ADPLL prototype fabricated in TSMC LP 40 nm CMOS process consumes only 860 µW at 1 V supply, and has a measured rms jitter of 1.71 ps (integrated from 1k to 100MHz), leading to a state-of-the-art jitter -power FoM of -236 dB. The frequency modulation capability is also demonstrated with a 2 Mcps HS-QPSK modulation for IEEE 802.15.4 (ZigBee) and 1 Mbps GFSK for Bluetooth Smart. This work presents the first-ever wireless ADPLL to break the 1mW barrier and consumes at least five-times lower power compared to state-of-the-art ADPLLs.

Compared to other students their age, ROC-students experience a worse physical and mental health. Theories on well-being suggest pursuing intrinsic authentic goals contributes to mental health. To start the proces of meaningful goal pursuit, students need to think about what they really want, what is important to them and what they want to do with their lives. The goal of this graduation project is helping the target group discovering these intrinsic authentic motivations in life by persuading them to answer questions concerning their personal identity and life goals. This will provide the fundament of goal pursuit, which will further be supported in the education program developed by Erasmus MC. This classroom intervention program, which is called “Droom denk doe” (Dream think do), teaches the students to set goals and how to succeed in pursuing them step-by-step. Applying Visch’ persuasive game design model (2013), an iterative design process resulted in the concept ‘Legacy Tag’. A website ‘Legacy Life’ has been developed on which the students can create a legacy consisting desired life experiences, passions, skills, characteristics, and a motto. By persuading the users to self-expression the website facilitates the creation of a legacy to brings intrinsic authentic goals to the surface. The user is persuaded by building up the challenge of self-reflection from inspiring and choosing to self-generation and making the user curious about the outcome. A wooden tag with the legacy text engraved in it transfers the insights from the game world to the real world. This ‘Legacy Tag’ reminds the user of this personal legacy and can facilitate a link to short-term goals. By evoking feelings of pride and hope the tag could support self-determined action to pursue authentic intrinsic goals. The website has been developed and improved after a final user evaluation study to make the concept fully functioning, and arrangements with a laser cut company have been made in order to make production and distribution of the legacy tags possible. As such, the design has been included in a large-scale study to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention program throughout the school year 2013-2014. This study will teach us more about the effect on self-determined pursuit of intrinsic authentic goals and the effect on well-being of ROC-students.","persuasive game design; well-being; goal; legacy; MBO; ROC; identity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

Of the discussed techniques, one predictor and one controller are chosen to be used in an experiment: a mobile robot equipped with a camera that has to learn what happens when rotating inside a box with pictures. The chosen predictor is a new type of local linear model, the Shuffled Linear Model (SLM). In this model, the localities are chosen randomly and linear regression is used to determine the linear model parameters. It is proved that this model is a universal approximator, and an upper bound on the number of models is given. The chosen controller makes use of intrinsic rewards to aid the predictor by providing data that is both new and easy to predict.","nonlinear systems theory; control; neural networks; reinforcement learning; local linear model; system identification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied mathematics","","","",""

(mentor); Yarovoy, A. (mentor)","2013","The rapid development of wireless communication systems and the subsequent burst of wireless devices place several demands on the antenna designs. In particular, the development of high-performance radio systems require the adoption of broadband antennas featuring low profile, high gain, embedded installation and reduced manufacturing costs. Printed antennas, despite their inherent limitations can meet most of these requirements by employing innovative design solutions aiming at improving their electromagnetic performance. In this respect, a novel class of supershaped patch antennas is introduced and thoroughly investigated. The geometry of the proposed radiating structures is described by the polar equation known in the scientific literature as superformula or Gielis equation. Such equation can generate a large variety of different nature-inspired and abstract shapes which translates into the possibility of automatically reshaping the geometry of the radiating patch through the tuning of its parameters and consequently modifying the circuital performance and the radiation properties. In this context, the commercially available CST Studio Suite, based on the Finite Integration Technique (FIT), is used to perform the numerically based time domain full-wave analysis of the supershaped patch antennas. These simulations help to the deduction of useful conclusions upon the characteristics of general supershaped patch antennas as a function of the pertinent Gielis parameters. Moreover, a new developed semi-analytical method is used in order to obtain a meaningful physical insight to the operation of these antennas. At the end, we explore the possibilities of building novel high-performance antenna structures based on the supershape formula that are intended for modern applications. This investigation led in the conception of two dual-band supershaped patch antenna configurations designed for the WLAN IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n standards.

The brands rich heritage has been passed over, with the acquisition of the brand name, to the new founded Spyker company and its cars. Hand-built contemporary cars, reminiscent of the brands history. A rich heritage is one of the most important characteristics and attributes of a brand that can that can provide a sustainable competitive advantage based on its authenticity. Finding the brands core identity while remaining vibrant is key; closed-mindedness to innovation is disastrous. Spyker should constantly challenge its performance in order to become more contemporary, actually innovative, with respect to its brand values. Spykers heritage continues to be a key asset of its overall brand equity but needs to be leveraged even more with new innovative features focusing on its brand essence. The projects objective is to create design driven innovation, based on the company’s core brand values, in order to strengthen Spykers brand- identity, recognition and credibility. Providing the company with two new perspectives: first a theoretical perspective ‘strategy focus’, second a practical perspective of concepts for new design-driven innovative features. Without inspiration there is no aspiration, this is where the research is focused on, creating a source of inspiration for Spyker. Effective functioning for Spyker rests on the more intuitive comprehension about the shared dream and myth of the brand and developing cars that exactly fit the brand experience the brand embodies. Spyker should rise above the standard and distinguish the good from the emotionally enhancing and moving. This requires inspiration, creativity and a clear vision for the physical transformation: the cars and how to match the clients dream. The concept features developed in this project emphasize and strengthen Spykers character in order to differentiate Spyker in a non-competitive positioning. Spyker does not compete on a high-tech performance level but on the prestige, the intangible, the dream and the imagination. The new concept features will enable Spyker to lever its brand status and credibility, with the spiritual dimensions of aviation and racing, to create the total story.","Spyker; IDE; SPD; luxury; automotive; cars; design; innovation; marketing; strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-11-04","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master specialisation Automotive","",""

(mentor); Den Hartigh, E. (mentor); Ortt, J.R. (mentor); Van der Voort, H. (mentor)","2013","A shift is happening across industries, the traditional firm-centric, product-centric, service-centric meaning of value and the process of value creation paradigm is being challenged by personalized consumer experiences paradigm. Customer co-creation, as the up-and-coming paradigm might provide an answer for the posed challenges of today’s world. Customer co-creation emerges created at the intersection of different fields of knowledge such as design, marketing and innovation. Therefore, the concept of customer co-creation has been described through different lenses of research. This in turn lead to no consensus of what customer co-creation is. Moreover claims on the implementation of customer co-creation implementation in innovation process, could lead to sustainable competitive advantage. Although such claims has been made, there is no measurement instrument develop for customer co-creation that will help researcher in proving this causal relationship. Therefore before researches on testing and proving relation between customer co-creation and other concepts such as sustainable competitive advantage could be done, a construct of customer co-creation should first be proposed. One characteristic of construct is that it is measurable. This construct is a foundation for developing measures of customer co-creation. The objectives of this research are to summarize previously-researched co-creation concepts and furthermore propose a construct of customer co-creation, and to propose measures of co-creation. Before recommendations on measures of customer co-creation can be given; a construct needs to be defined first. Serving as building blocks for the customer co-creation construct are the dimensions of customer co-creation. Dimensions of customer co-creation were identified and validated from literature review and academia interview. In total 15 dimensions are identified. This research uses nomological network to build the construct. Nomological network is a representation of the concepts of interest in a study, their observable manifestations, and the interrelationships among and between these. It is a tool to ensure construct validation of a construct. After a validated dimensions of co-creation were obtained, a categorization is done to these dimensions using customer co-creation related concepts as categories to draw the interrelationships of among the concepts. In categorizing, a sorting task with Management of Technology students as respondents was done to ensure the face validity. Since no empirical data for any dimension was collected during the research, the nomological network is preliminary in nature. From this process a proposed definition of customer co-creation was formulated. “Customer co-creation is a tool used in innovation process that engages customers as active problem owners in collaboration with firm, during which different size and types of customer groups might participate in the process that is governed and stimulated by the firm to create co-created values as expected in the initiation.” Upon defining the construct of co-creation using nomological network, it is possible to operationalize customer co-creation by defining the methodology and indicators. However the indicators and methodologies presented here are suggestive. These indicators and methodologies are formulated through literature review and interviews with industry experts. The findings of this research are relevant not only for researcher but also for firm manager. The results achieved in this research are relevant for both researcher and firm. This research serves as a starting point for researcher who aspires to enrich the body of knowledge on customer co-creation measurement. As for firm, the insights from this research can be used in different ways, as a base to decide on co-creation implementation, to measure performance, or to evaluate previous co-creation activities, depending on the stage of co-creation implementation the firm is in.","customer co-creation; innovation process; construct; nomological network; measurement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-12-31","Technology, Policy and Management","Technology, Strategy, and Entrepreneurship","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor); Hicks, M.A. (mentor)","2013","Reliability based calculations and the identification of uncertainties in geomechanical calculations are receiving an increasing amount of attention to evaluate risk. This poses multiple challenges, of which one is the variability of input parameters such as geomechanical properties, geological structures and distribution of material properties. In this thesis, the use of reliability geomechanical analysis in oil and gas reservoirs is investigated. The focus lies on obtaining PDF from well log data, to investigate the effect of stochastic material properties on geomechanical analysis and to identify important uncertainties other than material properties in geomechanical analyses e.g. geometry and depletion pressure distribution. A method of deriving stochastic material properties from well log data is presented and stochastic material properties are described using PDF. A test is introduced to select the most appropriate PDF in terms of best fit. The most appropriate PDF can be obtained by comparing a PDF to the histogram of a set of well log data. In addition to this, it was observed that removing linear depth trends reduce the uncertainty in most observed material properties. Stochastic material properties have been used as input for a series of probabilistic geomechanical analyses. The main geomechanical reliability response studied in this thesis is large scale subsidence caused by pressure changes in a reservoir. Large scale subsidence has also been compared to a small scale SCU response. The effects of stochastic material properties on subsidence are compared to SCU in geomechanical reliability response. For subsidence it was found that, increasing the resolution of uncertainty, i.e. increasing the amount of layers, reduces the variation of results. For SCU geomechanical reliability, increasing the resolution of uncertainty The results increases the variation of results. For the geomechanical analyses, example real reservoir data are used to study uncertainties in geomechanical reliability analyses. Data from a real case were used to illustrate the effects of reservoir geometry and depletion pressure distribution on the calculated subsidence above a depleting reservoir. The different geomechanical analyses demonstrate the need to include spatial variation of the reservoir, i.e. the variation of the pressure distribution and both vertical and lateral variation in material properties.","PDF; subsidence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-engineering","",""

(mentor)","2013","Background Next-generation sequencing enables to detect sequence diversity in populations of viruses, an essential step in the development of drug mixtures to combat viral infections. The process of sequencing patient samples using bidirectional Roche 454 amplicon sequencing technology, as implemented at the Delft Diagnostic Laboratory (DDL), introduces specific errors. There are various cleaning algorithms capable of removing these errors. However, low frequency mutations may also be removed, as these are assumed to be likely errors and errors are assumed to be independently distributed throughout the sequence. We tested the performance of three algorithms, AmpliconNoise, KEC and ShoRAH on the detection of low-frequency mutations. Results Through various experiments we show that some types of errors are not independent but are direction-dependent, caused by homopolymeric regions. Such errors can occur in up to 80% of the reads. As the methods tested could not remove these errors, we developed novel algorithms (MSAR, AFKnn and AFC) to correct these specific errors. Our algorithms combine the information present in forward and reverse reads to detect direction-dependent errors. MASR, AFKnn and AFC improved the detection limit of viral sequences when applied before KEC. In our experiments we found mutations with a frequency below 1.0% could still be detected. Conclusion Bidirectional sequencing is essential for 454 sequencing to detect and remove direction-dependent errors and thereby improve the detection of low-frequency mutations.","detection limit; virus; sequencing; mutation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Pattern Recognition & Bioinformatics Group","","Computer Science: Bioinformatics","",""

The Orlovsky Tunnel in St. Petersburg serves as a case study. The Orlovsky tunnel is a 1600 m tunnel in a rapid flowing river. the ice regime of the Neva River is characterized by frazil ice, which causes hanging ice jams and anchor ice. Together with changes in the flow velocity profile in the frozen period, a more robust tunnel protection is required. Thermal expansion of ice, drift ice, and drag on an ice cover require a sloped embankment to reduce shear, which in turn increases the surcharge on the tunnel. Rubber gaskets such as the Gina and Omega profiles are researches and suggestions are given for rubber composition, and its effect on fatigue, watertightness, strength, and transport requirements. Thermal loading of the tunnel was also analyzed. It was concluded that the plastic hinge capacity of the corners was sufficient to resist the temperature differential in the outer sections of the tunnel. Cracking of the inner walls require extra horizontal reinforcement. Large temperature fluctuations may require alternate types of expansion joints or smaller tunnel elements. A probabilistic planning was finally performed to quantify the risk of non-completion in a single ice-free construction period. For this a Monte Carlo simulation was utilized. This had implication on the number of tunnel elements, foundation, the construction dock location, and so forth. Emergency measures, such as a frazil collector and ice boom are recommended in the case of early frost.","immersed tunnels; subarctic; arctic; cold region; ice jam; anchor ice; ice ride-up; St. Petersburg; Orlovsky; tunnel; thermal loading; Gina; Omega; probabilistic planning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Structures","",""

(mentor); De Vlugt, E. (mentor)","2013","Quantifying increased resistance of the ankle joint to motion, referred to as ankle impedance, is important for determining the appropriate treatment for rehabilitation of upper motor neuron (UMN) diseases. The increased ankle impedance can be attributed to increased viscoelasticity of the tissues surrounding the joint clinically treated with splinting and exaggerated stretch reflexes clinically treated with botulinum toxin injections. The choosing of appropriate clinical treatment can be improved if discrimination would be possible between the contribution of exaggerated reflexes and increased tissue viscoelasticity. The Ashworth Score is a widely used clinical test to quantify the effect of UMN diseases on joint mechanics although it is not able to discriminate between the contribution of exaggerated stretch reflexes and increased tissue viscoelasticity. Moreover, the Ashworth Score is performed under stationary conditions although the clinical treatments are aimed at improving the ability of the patients to perform functional movement such as walking. Therefore, there is a clinical need to improve the method of quantifying ankle impedance by discriminating between the two contributing factors of exaggerated stretch reflexes and increased tissue viscoelasticity. Specifically, there is a clinical benefit in quantifying ankle impedance in walking to enable the clinical treatment of UMN diseases to be determined on the basis of a functional movement such as walking. The goal of this study is to design and evaluate a method to identify ankle impedance in the stance phase of gait. Moreover, the contribution of tissue viscoelasticity referred to as intrinsic ankle impedance. An instrumented treadmill that measured forces and moments, a motion capture system that measured positions and a linear model of the moment around the ankle joint was used to estimate the underlying parameters of ankle impedance i.e. damping and stiffness as well as the mass of the foot. To investigate the reliability of the method it was also applied to a 20 kg weight where the mass was the estimated parameter. For the experiment performed on the weight the estimated mass was 21.7 kg on average with a standard error of the mean (SEM) of 8.3%. For the experiment performed on the ankle joint the mass of the foot was estimated 3.7 kg on average with a SEM of 68%, damping was 2.8 Nms on average with a SEM value of 32.1% and stiffness was 425.1 Nm on average with a SEM value of 28%. The mass of the 20 kg weight could be estimated accurately, while the parameters of the ankle joint were estimated with low accuracy especially the mass of the foot. Overall, the developed method provides a good basis for future work and further measurements.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-11-11","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

(mentor); Creusen, M.E.H. (mentor)","2013","Equip Outdoor Technologies Ltd. (Equip) is interested in opening a web shop to sell its Rab brand of outdoor sports products directly to UK consumers. The rise of e-commerce creates an interesting opportunity for a multi-channel strategy with an online direct channel operating parallel to the existing independent retail channel. In this project a concept, strategy and experience are developed to allow Equip to pursue a successful multi-channel strategy. Equip is well suited to its role as a business-to-business company and the Rab brand is very strong in the UK. However, the company lacks some of the skills and framework necessary to sell directly to consumers. It also lacks insight into how its target market approaches the purchase of products. Equip is heavily reliant on its relationships with retailers. As a result Equip cannot compete on price and must sell products at RRP. In the new concept damage to these relationships must be limited and relative to the potential for success of the online direct channel. A study of business theory led to the selection of the model of the Buyer Decision Process as a structure for consumer research. Interviews with the target market showed that young climbers rely on the Internet during the early stages of the model but that brand websites (like Rab’s) play only a minor role in this. The target market’s three main product selection criteria were identified as performance, durability and fit. A shortlist of products is created that match these criteria based on information mainly gathered on the Internet. Price only becomes a factor when selecting from the shortlist. However, they very rarely pay full RRP for a product, instead they wait for a sale or choose another product from the short-list that is discounted. The target market tends not to buy premium outdoor sports clothing (Rab’s core products) online because they feel the need to try it on in-store first. The information available on the Internet is not sufficient to fully satisfy their perception of the three main criteria, especially fit. The findings of the consumer research made it clear that a Rab web shop with full priced products would be unlikely to attract many customers. The concept therefore looked to design an “information strategy” for the Rab brand website to make it a more important resource for information during the early stages of the buyer process. In the short-term this means more Rab products appear on short-lists and are therefore bought more often. In the long-term the outdoor sports industry is expected to catch up with other industries and also become more e-commerce based. The strategy will then help facilitate direct web shop sales. A number of features are developed and tested with members of the target market. Results from these tests are used to refine the final concept. The information strategy consists of a number of different features that are designed to appeal to the target market. The target market is provided with useful and interesting information throughout the buyer process. There are three main features that make up the information strategy. The three features are:  Reviews by Rab’s sponsored athletes give professional views on products and their uses.  An improved user rating system ensures more relevant and useful information from amateurs.  Rab also provides more information on products; high resolution product photos show the quality of its products while activity categories help identify which products are suitable for different sports. A live chat feature offers customers personal product advice. Free delivery and returns help the web shop to be competitive with other retailers without dropping prices below RRP. A timeline for approaching a multi-channel strategy suggests first implementing the information strategy features fully before launching a web shop. The web shop can be launched in around two years although the first year of its operation should be focused on optimising conversion rates.","Direct channel; E-Commerce; Outdoor industry; Sports; Internet retail; Online retail; Strategy design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Strategic Product Design","","","",""

(mentor)","2013","In the field of computational physics and engineering, the introduction of computers opened a world of possibilities. The finite element method was developed in order to solve complex problems numerically. Over time, the method matured and structures in the field of engineering became more and more complex, resulting in large degree of freedom systems. Analyses on these systems can be a computationally heavy and expensive task, which led to the development of Component Mode Synthesis (CMS) techniques. These techniques generally consist of a combination of two other techniques: substructuring and Model Order Reduction (MOR). Substructuring is used to obtain the structural behaviour of large and/or complex structures by dividing them into several smaller and simpler substructures of which the structural behaviour is easier to determine. The global system is then obtained by assembly of the substructures. Using MOR, a full order model is approximated by a system of lower dimension by expressing the displacement field in terms of a set of reduced coordinates. In linear statics and dynamics problems, MOR is widely used. For nonlinear problems however, the same methods cannot be used. Two CMS techniques suitable for geometrically nonlinear structures are developed, based on the linear Craig-Bampton and Rubin methods. Both techniques use sets of component modes to approximate the displacement field. In this work, the methods are extended by adding additional component modes; modal derivatives. A modal derivative describes second-order nonlinear contributions of a vibration mode, when it is perturbed with the shape of another vibration mode. They can be systematically and cheaply computed once a reduction basis is formed for the linearised problem. The results will be presented and discussed.","Component Mode Synthesis; geometric nonlinearity; substructuring; modal derivatives; finite elements","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","Engineering Mechanics","",""

(mentor); Dijkstra, J. (mentor); Cunningham, M. (mentor)","2013","Floating piles in soft soil deposits primarily mobilize their bearing capacity by means of shaft resistance. The upper part of the pile triggers a downward traction on the pile shaft whilst the lower part mobilizes the shaft friction in the soil required for the pile bearing capacity. The transition between these two modes of shaft friction is often defined as the neutral-plane. This plane, which is not at a constant level, assists in predictions of the (long-term) settlements of a pile in such a soil. Floating piles primarily occur in areas where stiffer clay layers are overlain by softer clay layers, e.g. on the west-coast of Sweden or in the Kaspian Sea. In the past the response of floating piles is extensively described using the neutral plane approach. This approach requires a reliable prediction of the soil settlements, which in turn are affected by the pile installation effects in the soil. Additional experimental evidence on the soil behaviour during, directly after installation and in the long-term is required if advanced numerical methods are considered and current analytical design methods to be improved. A novel approach to retrieve this experimental data on immediate and long-term pile installation effects in the geotechnical centrifuge is developed. An axisymmetric experimental test setup allows for measurement of full-field displacement as well as pore pressures during and after installation. This setup uses an instrumented wall with 40 pore pressure transducers. Additionally, an image sequence taken with a machine vision camera is used to extract the soil displacements by application of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). Due to natural low contrast of the kaolin clay used for the experiments a novel method for the application of contrasting speckle material on a clay sample is developed. This method applies the contrast material on the surface of the slurry without the need of removing the transparent window of the strongbox. Therefore tracking of the material displacements during the consolidation stage and subsequent loading stages using imaging methods is facilitated. The results of the experiments are generally in agreement with the framework reported in literature and indicate that pile installation effects, such as generation of excess pore pressure and change of the hydraulic conductivity in the soil due to remoulding, have an influence on the development on the neutral plane and therefore the prediction of the response of floating piles. Additionally, the results can be used to benchmark numerical calculations with advanced constitituve models.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-Engineering","",""

The main weaknesses of the product turned out to be the lack of a thought out user interaction, the bad drop resistance and the unsuitability for mass production. During the analysis of the interaction once again the lack of a suitable user interaction was seen. Several focus points were gathered on which this interaction could be improved. To design a new context two user groups were researched which were consumers and professionals. By making a context for both groups the group with the most interesting potential could be found. In the end the choice was made to focus on the consumer market. Several user scenarios were written during the design of the new interaction which formed the basis for the interaction qualities. These interaction qualities were then turned into product features which meant the beginning of the development of the new design.

Therefore a generic approach in order to solve transfer capacity bottlenecks at railway stations was created and validated against a case study. Even though this transfer capacity analysis model is still under development, this research concludes that the model is a successful first attempt to address transfer capacity bottlenecks at railway stations. The transfer capacity analysis model can be improved in several areas, most notably further extending in the interaction between technical, institutional and process aspects and the use for other markets.","analysis model; TIP analysis; transfer capacity; transfer solutions; railway stations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering Systems and Services","","Transport and Logistics","",""

(mentor); Rossen, W.R. (mentor)","2013","Controlled calcium carbonate precipitation can be used for various applications. Calcium carbonate precipitation occurs when dissolved calcium and carbonate are mixed at concentrations which exceed the solubility of calcium carbonate. With alternate injection of pulses of calcium chloride and sodium carbonate solutions in time through a porous medium, dispersion will create a partial mixing zone in space, which moves through the whole system by advective flow. By means of dispersion and advection this should then create a homogeneous calcium carbonate deposit. By varying the concentration of the pulses, the size of the pulses, the distance between the pulses and the flow velocity it should be possible to control the location and distribution of the precipitated calcium carbonate to a certain extent. To investigate this principle a numerical model is developed, which is based on advective-dispersive-reactive transport equations for multiple dissolved and solid components using Matlab and Orchestra. Different ways of implementation have been tested and the performance of the model has been evaluated. With the final model seven different simulations were performed in which the system variables: concentration, flow rate, pulse duration and pulse distance were varied. These simulations showed that controlled precipitation of calcium carbonate using alternating pulse injections is possible. Increasing the distance between the pulses increases the distance over which the calcium carbonate is distributed, while the amount stays the same. Doubling the solute concentration in the pulse leads to a proportional increase of the amount of calcium carbonate. Doubling the flow velocity or the pulse duration lowers the peak quantity of calcium carbonate but improves the distribution. However, the quantity of precipitated calcium carbonate in all simulations was only 30% of the expected quantity of calcium carbonate. Further investigations showed a saw tooth pattern near the injection point which indicate that calcium carbonate is dissolving again at a higher rate than anticipated. To prevent this loss of calcium carbonate the model needs to be adjusted by implementing the dissolution kinetics. Secondly the model needs to be validated by experiments.","Calcium Carbonate; Controlled Precipitation; Multiple Pulses","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

(mentor); Scheepens, A.E. (mentor); Dijk, L.F. (mentor)","2013","Public street lighting has a major influence on safety, perception of safety and atmosphere perception. The municipality of Rotterdam has the obligation to provide the city with public street lighting. Also, they have the desire to create a pleasant atmosphere in the city during both day and night. A user study performed for this project has helped determine what a pleasant atmosphere means; clean streets (no litter), knowing your neighbors, enough urban nature and seeing in the dark. This thesis focuses on the last two points, because they seemed to be conflicting each other. A hypothesis was formulated, suggesting that urban nature and street lighting conflict each other above and underground. Above ground, trees reduce the light output of the street lighting when they grow close to a lighting point. Below ground, the roots of the trees get strangled between the power cables. This conflict seemed to be enhanced by the fact that space is limited in the urban environment, especially in residential areas. A certain distance is needed between lampposts and trees, because of street lay-outs (side streets, parking spots, cables under ground) the options for are limited for placing a satisfying amount of trees in between the lighting points. However, the living quality of residential areas benefits from more urban nature. The hypothesis was researched with observation and nine interviews. It was revealed that trees blocking light is solved easily by placing trees and lighting point correct. Correctly distancing trees and lighting points, both in height and horizontal spacing. Trees can be allowed to block the light a little bit, because it creates a dynamic shadow on the road. For high speed roads (from 50 km/h) these shadows would become a problem for safety reasons. However, in residential streets it is not. The underground conflict between tree roots and power cables can be solved in two different ways: find other ways to create residential green or redesign public street lighting. Within the first direction many solutions were found, however within the second direction there were not. Since 1800 the lamppost has looked the same: a light source on a pole. Other forms such as hanging street lighting and facade lighting solve some problems above ground (space consumption) but not underground. And these forms of public street lighting bring new problems with them (convincing building owners to allow this way of mounting). With this analysis the assignment for this thesis was formulated: ""Solve the conflict between urban nature and public street lighting by designing a new street lighting system."" Rotterdam has the goal to reduce CO2 emission with 50% in 2020 (compared to 1990). To help reach this goal the CO2 emission of the solution should be lower then the CO2 emission of the current public street lighting. In order to do this the environmental aspects of public street lighting were researched for every step in the life cycle. This was done together with the (financial) value for every life cycle step. Together this results in an Eco-costs Value Ratio (EVR). The manufacturing and energy consumption turned out to be the most harmful steps for the environment. Maintenance and administration and energy consumption are the most expensive steps. Reducing the energy consumption is beneficial in both environmental and financial terms. Reducing eco-costs in the manufacturing phase, together with reducing costs for maintenance and administration would make the design more valuable for the municipality. This results in a list of requirements: - create a better atmosphere - create a safer feeling - create more space for urban nature - reduce CO2 emission of Rotterdam - reduce energy costs - reduce maintenance costs - reduce administration costs - reduce eco-costs of the manufacturing phase The assignment and list of requirements resulted in a new design for public street lighting, mounted on top of the roof of a house, the system is connected to the grid of the house. During night the light uses energy from the house. During the day one or two solar panels generates energy to compensate this use. The solar panel generates more then only what the light is using. This overcapacity is delivered free of charge to the resident. He or she gets a discount on the energy bill (up to  50 euro per year per resident). The resident is not the building owner in many situation. A housing cooperation can be owner as well. Their benefit is the increasing value of a building with solar panels. For the municipality the new concept means no energy costs, no digging, no separate grid and it is easier to convince the resident and building owner to cooperate. Because of these benefits the new design is cheaper then the current system, even with addition of the relatively expensive solar panels. The initial investment is a little bit higher, but the running costs (maintenance, administration and electricity) are much lower. With one solar panel the payback time is 9 years, with two solar panels the payback time is 36 years. The lifetime is at least 40 years. Because of the energy production of the solar panels the new design has reduced the eco-costs and CO2 emission to negative values. This means the environmental burden, caused by manufacturing and energy consumption, is largely compensated. The environmental benefits can get up to 2300 kg CO2 equivalent per street per year.","public street lighting; solar panel; grid connection; residential street; rotterdam; sustainability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Integrated Product Design","","","",""

(mentor); Alkan, A. (mentor); Plomp, H. (mentor)","2013","Understanding the importance of the relationships between the neighborhoods along the Golden Horn with the actual waterfront was the reason to explore the ways to redefine this degenerated connection. The disconnection is the result of Istanbul’s XXth century industrialization, when the city walls were demolished to construct a highway between the waterside and the neighborhoods. Through researching the organization strategies applied by the Ottomans to structure the waterfront, I propose a new urban scheme, reconnecting the network of neighborhoods with its traditional habitat – the waterfront. The scheme suggests implementing new gateways of the city (Constantinople), the bodily experiences for individuals to reconnect with the tradition of bathing – water. now The neighborhood of Balat is one of the oldest and historically most important neighborhoods of Istanbul’s old peninsula. Before realizing its historical significance, my fascination was triggered by the existent atmosphere. Secluded from the rest of the city from all sides by its urban scheme (layers of the different cities clashing, (Byzantine Constantinople, Ottomans and Turkish Republic), or natural terrain, this network of small, almost gated community-like neighborhoods practically try to burst out onto the Golden Horn. The pressure of seclusion was historically released by the openness to the waterfront and neighborhoods still reach out to restore the balance, destroyed by the segregation due to the construction of the highway, and faceless waterfront. then Looking back in time, the waterfront of the Golden Horn used to be a fruitful industrial and recreational area, organized by the Ottomans in a fashion related to the waterfront. The layers of functions are organized perpendicular, going from neighborhoods, through gateways (through walls) to the waterfront and finally to the actual body of water. Here, gateways enable transition between in (neighborhood, residence, private) and out (waterfront, industrial, recreational, public). method Choosing the site of Balat as a case study for all Golden Horn waterfront neighborhoods, I suggest an urban scheme based on the genealogy of the use of the waterfronts for centuries, altering on a spectrum of recreation, trade, industry and logistics. Green strips of recreational functions (further referred to as the plots) are arranged perpendicular to the water. The precise function depends on the immediate needs of a neighborhood; the width depends on the function. To release pressure from the city, the scheme proposes mitigation points: new gateways, transporting from neighborhoods - in, to the waterfronts - out. new gateways purpose New gateways are the built extrusions of the plots. Their main purpose is providing the experience for transitioning the body to the water. function Their function is merely related to the bodily and mental experience of the water. Like: swimming pool, bathhouse, ferry terminal, fish market, scuba diving or canoeing school, aquarium, cisterns The function for the case study is an aquatic center, complex of swimming pools and diverse bathing experiences. in and out The building repeats the characteristics of the gateways. It is composed of walls and inbetween open spaces. Transition between these walls and open spaces explores further the coexistence of public and private, open and close, in and out, tradition and modern. The walls accommodate the private, mostly closed traditional functions; they house hammam, private bathes, massage therapies and changing rooms. The visitors are segregated either by gender (hammam, changing rooms), or choice (massage therapy, balneotherapy). The atmosphere here is secure, calm and dimmed, a bodily experience - sheltered. Outside, the walls are surrounded by open, public, modern functions; here men, women and children bath under the sun together. Lazy sunbathers lay on the grass, lively kids slide or play with the shallow pool water. Water reflects the sunlight; the atmosphere is - exposed. material The walls are the gates (from public to private, tradition to modern, open to close) within the gateway (built extrusion of the plot), reminiscent of Constantinople’s city walls; they wrap themselves with limestone, exposing their real (true) nature (poured concrete) only where it’s been carved out (portals). Conclusion The project can be read as a conceptual fractal system. On each scale, starting from the urban scheme up to the materialization, the theme of gateways—transition from one state to another, related to the bodily experience—is attempted. The aim was to create contrasting spaces, located in proximity of each other, and lead visitor from one to another thru architecture, by exposing to the somewhat preview of what awaits, drawing to explore and go further.","Hammam; New gateways; Golden Horn; Istanbul; Fener; Balat; swimming pool; aquatic center; waterfront; bathes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-11-27","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Public Buildings, Capital Region: Istanbul","",""

The amazing, impressive and unusual character of tensegrities leads to the wondering of structural and functional performance of tensegrity. This results in interest concerning possibilities of applying tensegrity as load carrying structure in a pedestrian bridge design. A concept presenting potential of tensegrity in bridge design is developed and analyzed. History of tensegrity, existing project, known shape, an over-view of information gained by sculpting 3D models are presented. A presentation of a 3 strut tensegrity module (module A), modeled with a FEM-analysis program follows. Combining several modules A leads to a first concept proposition for a bridge design. Next, a realization of a first alternative in tensegrity bridge concept based on a 3 strut tensegrity module (module B) is developed and presented. Node coordinates have been altered. Appurtenant structures are analyzed and compared, resulting in improved concept propositions. Similarities between the first concept and first alternative are observed. Knowledge gained from alternative one is used to improve the first concept resulting in a second working alternative. Evaluating both alternatives results in decision of developing the second alternative further. A variety of module combination for different spans is produced and results from FEM analyses are observed leading to the conclusion that less modules in a design improves effectiveness of the structure by reducing buckling issues. Replacing long deck elements by tensegrity systems result in a further optimization of the concept. Concluding analyses with static and dynamic observations leading to confirmation that bridge design using tensegrity as load carrying structural concept is possible and realistic. Exact statements concerning dynamics cannot be made, due to difficulties of determining frequencies and modal stiffness of the structure. Estimations of frequencies and velocities are made, demonstrating influence and importance of pre-stressing in the structure. Pre-stressing allows adjusting parameter such that problems of discomfort due to vibrations are prevented. However further developments of the concept should include pre-cautions allowing incorporating dampers after construction. Existing information concerning dynamics is insufficient for exact predictions on consequences of human induced vibrations.","tensegrity; bridge; pedestrian bridge; form finding; dynamics; prism; compression; tension","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); De Jong, W.M. (mentor); Hobma, F.A.M. (mentor); Eggink, M. (mentor)","2013","Historically, the Dutch public road authority (Rijkswaterstaat) had the responsibility for initiation, design, built, finance, operation and maintenance of road infrastructure projects. Fairly recently, integral DBFM) contracts have been introduced to road infrastructure. In a DBFM contract, a private party is responsible for Designing, Building, Financing and Maintaining a certain infrastructure section, usually for a period of 25 years. The road authority stays the owner and operator of the infrastructure and pays the private party for the availability of the road. Before the introduction of DBFM, private parties were only responsible for one of the components (design/construct/maintain). Rijkswaterstaat had the overall responsibility and was responsible for integrating the components. The aim of Rijkswaterstaat was to create the lowest possible cost over the life cycle of a section of road infrastructure; this is referred to as Life Cycle Costing (LCC). With the introduction of DBFM this role switched to the private parties (or consortia). Life Cycle Costing is one of the ‘core values’ of DBFM and is the process of maximizing return on investment by combining capital investment decision making and operation & maintenance decision making for the total life cycle of a project. Pursuing LCC benefits the private party as wells as the public party. However there is doubt if the current approach of consortia in DFBM road projects optimal facilitates Life Cycle Costing in DBFM projects. Earlier research shows that there is considerable room for improvement, when it comes to applying Life Cycle Costing within DBFM consortia. This research examines how consortia can improve the application of Life Cycle Costing during the realization phase (Design and Build) of DBFM projects. The goal of this research is to develop a framework to support consortia in DBFM road projects in the Netherlands. The framework should improve Life Cycle Costing in Dutch DBFM road projects by establishing the right preconditions. From two cases and expert interviews elements are identified which positively influence (enablers) or negatively influence (disablers) the application of LCC during realization. Based on the interviews and cases the identified elements are ranked. The ranking establishes the undisputed elements. The line of reasoning is that if a disabler or enabler is undisputed, it should be included in the framework. The optimal framework should solve all the undisputed disablers and include all the undisputed enablers. Using the ranking, 16 of the 29 identified disablers should be included in the framework. However, none of the enablers are considered undisputed, this could be explained by the fact that multiple solutions (enablers) are available for one problem (disablers).The enablers are therefore considered as suggestions for possible solutions. From an actor analysis appears that the considered most important actors (lenders, shareholders, Rijkswaterstaat and subcontractors) have an interest in, and have the power to influence the private consortia; a Dutch DBFM road project is a multi-actor environment. The consortia should consider this multi-actor environment, the multi-actor environment should thus be included in the framework. Using the disablers, 10 problem statements are derived. For each problem statement one or multiple preconditions are formulated to deal with this problem. With the established preconditions a framework is composed. This framework is called the single-actor framework, since the framework does not include the multi-actor environment. When the single-actor framework is combined with the multi-actor perspective, it appears that the interests and influences of the different actors limit the solutions in the single-actor framework. Therefore the preconditions of the single actor framework are adapted to the multi-actor environment. This research shows that there is still considerable room for improvement, in terms of Life Cycle Costing (LCC), in the realization phase of Dutch DBFM road projects. The fundamental goal for shareholders of DBFM consortia, maximization of shareholder value, equals optimization in terms of LCC. However, current organizational forms, contracts, and methods used prevent these from reaching this overall goal. If the frameworks are compared: preconditions in the single-actor framework will eventually lead to more improvement regarding LCC, and therefore describes a more perfect situation. However, considering the mult-actor environment, the single-actor framework is unrealistic and thus not implementable. The multi-actor framework is realistic and implementable, but therefore also time-bound. The single-actor framework is less time-bound and can be combined with a changed multi-actor environment to create again a realistic and implementable framework. Because of the focus of this research (strategic and tactical level) the framework covers a broad spectrum of solutions. The framework is thereby complete but does not deliver turnkey solutions. Therefore it is recommended that additional research is done to create more specific solutions. The frameworks established in this research should be used for the further improvement of the application of LCC in the realization of Dutch DBFM road projects. Current and future DBFM consortia are recommended to use the frameworks. This research improves Life Cycle Costing in DBFM projects. Both private and public party will, in de long run, benefit from an improved application of Life Cycle Costing.","Life Cycle Costing; Rijkswaterstaat; DBFM; LCC; road projects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Construction Management and Engineering","",""

(mentor); Hobma, F.A.M. (mentor); Hombergen, L.P.I.M. (mentor)","2013","In recent years, China has witnessed rapid development in urban transportation, especially in metro projects. However the safety records of metro projects is rather worrying and cannot help to make us think where actually is going wrong. Official reports have claimed that the causes for those metro accidents are mainly from technical and organizational aspects. But are the reports really telling the true story? Or are there deeper reasons that lead to accidents which are not so obvious? In previous studies, Martin de Jong and Yongchi Ma have asked the same question. They conduct their research on three Chinese cities of Beijing, Hangzhou and Dalian through Jens Rasmussen’s safety theory: drift to safety boundaries. In this theory, various incentives drive stakeholders to trade off quality and safety for other core values, resulting in safety boundaries to be crossed. All three cities represent a certain extent of profit driven, excessive subcontracting and loose monitoring which rightly match what is described in Rasmussen’s theory. In my study, I will take the city Shanghai as an example to do a replicative research following Martin de Jong and Ma Yongchi’s work. Based on the main research question of searching for the contractual and organizational arrangements in metro accidents, firstly Rasmussen’s theory will be discussed in Chapter 2 to lay a theoretical underpinning for latter research. Secondly the development of Shanghai metro system will be introduced to provide background information for latter case studies. Then in Chapter 4 and 5, I am going to thoroughly study two cases: Line 1 and Line 10, which are representative in terms of social impact, data availability and data freshness. The history of development, organizational structure, contractual arrangements and value tradeoffs in the design and construction process will all be mentioned in the analysis of Line 1 and Line 10. Institutional context and underlying behavior pattern of stakeholders will be described as well. Rasmussen’s theory will be checked to see whether it is applicable in my case. Comparison will be made among Shanghai cases and other three cases from value tradeoffs (time, scope, budget and quality) and subcontracting issues in Chapter 6. It is not surprising that many common characteristics exist in all cases, like profit driven, excessive and illegal subcontracting, immature safety regulations, low public participation and etc. These features exist for institutional and social reasons. I will discuss about it and find out the differences between the Shanghai cases and previous cases. Finally in the conclusion and recommendation part, empirical and theoretical conclusions are drawn respectively to shape the mechanism of metro accidents in terms of contractual and organizational arrangements. Whether Rasmussen’s theory is suitable will be answered. On four levels recommendations will be given for policy practice in order to improve current metro management level. I will lastly carefully reflect on my research method in the research, and how I generally feel about the whole case study process. The lesson learnt in this experience will also be shared. I would like to thank my main supervisor Martin de Jong, who generously gave me the chance to study this very interesting topic, which is so closely related to my home country, and professor Leon Hombergen, who gave me valuable advice on contractual arrangements, and professor Fred Hobma, who patiently explained everything I didn’t understand and gave me great confidence. All of them provide me with consistent support from beginning to end of my thesis. I also like to send my best gratitude to Professor Yongchi Ma from Dalian University of Technology for his precious guidance on my data collection. Last but not the least, I want to say thank you to my dear parents and friends in China who concern for my study and help me collecting data in all ways. I could never accomplish this work without their help. It is the thesis writing process that gives me a great opportunity to understand and reflect on China’s metro development and Chinese society. Little by little I came to realize how influential institutional and social impacts could be on a country’s construction projects, how necessary a mature and sound legal system is in China and how important it is for public to strive for their voice to be heard no matter what it costs. I sincere hope the future for China’s metro development could be better and better.","metro accidents; contractual drivers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Construction Management and Engineering","",""

Numerical simulations conducted to study this response require very small elements to capture the shockwave propagation and the material response which were found to be mesh dependent. The goal of the thesis is to implement and investigate a nonlocal model to obtain mesh independent results when simulating concrete failure under dynamic loads. The nonlocal models are implemented in LS-DYNA by modifying the user subroutines. The original nonlocal model has certain drawbacks which are investigated by means of certain benchmark tests. The use of the constant length scale and the isotropic weight function is found to be the cause of the drawbacks of the nonlocal model. A modified nonlocal model, the Stress based nonlocal model which resolves the issues of the original nonlocal model is implemented. The stress based nonlocal model is investigated to understand its behavior which leads to the resolution of the drawbacks of the nonlocal model. The stress based nonlocal model provides physically relevant fracture processes. The behavior of the model in a dynamic loading at various loading rates is investigated in comparison to the quasi-static loading. It is found that the model cannot capture the varying fracture processes zone widths as expected with the varying loading rates. The stress based nonlocal model is finally validated with experimental results and mesh independent results are obtained. The model cannot capture the varying fracture processes with different loading rates as seen in experiments. This is due to the use of the rate independent material model in combination with the stress based nonlocal model behavior.","damage mechanics; nonlocal; concrete; mesh sensitivity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural Mechanics","",""

In de ontwikkelpraktijk is weinig bekend over de psychologie van eigenaarschap. Bovendien bevindt theorievorming over het fenomeen zich in een vroeg stadium en bestaat er een behoefte aan verder theoretisch en empirisch onderzoek als basis voor de door de ontwikkelende partijen gewenste omslag naar de praktijk. Daarom zijn in dit onderzoek de componenten die verantwoordelijk zijn voor de ontwikkeling van mentaal eigenaarschap bij woonconsumenten tijdens het ontwikkelproces en in het bijzonder de mechanismen die de ontwikkeling bevorderen, in kaart gebracht en getoetst op basis van een verkennende literatuurstudie, verkennende interviews met deskundigen uit de vastgoedsector en gebiedsontwikkeling en een expertmeeting. Op basis van deze bevindingen is een theoretisch model vervaardigd. Vanuit het model zijn voor de ontwikkeling van individueel en collectief mentaal eigenaarschap aanbevelingen geformuleerd voor ontwikkelende en andere betrokken partijen bij de ontwikkeling van woningen. Deze aanbevelingen geven de partijen aanknopingspunten om de bevordering van mentaal eigenaarschap bij woonconsumenten in het ontwikkelproces van woningen te integreren en aan te sturen. Bovendien is een meetinstrument ontwikkeld, waarmee de door mechanismen bevorderde mate van mentaal eigenaarschap bij ontwikkelvormen voor woningen kan worden gemeten. Op basis van de uitkomsten van de metingen van dit model kunnen na een verdere vertaalslag door nader onderzoek ontwikkelprocessen van woningen door ontwikkelende partijen worden aangepast teneinde de betrokkenheid van woonconsumenten tijdens deze processen te vergroten.","mentaal eigenaarschap; woonconsumenten; gebiedsontwikkeling; woningbouw; proces; mental ownership","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Real Estate & Housing","","Urban Area Development","",""

(mentor); Enserink, B. (mentor); Taheri, M. (mentor)","2013","Academic spin-off firms tend to grow slowly which decreases the effectiveness of policies enhancing the knowledge based economy. The average growth of the 105 academic spin-off firms in this research is 1.2 fte per year, however the median is only 0.4 fte per year. In order to increase the speed at which academic spin-off firms grow, insight in what can go well and wrong needs to be obtained. This research is focussing on the match between incoming information about resources and resource deficiencies of academic spin-off firms, and the effect of this match on the firms growth. The match in this research will be defined as the response of the academic spin-off firms to resource deficiencies in terms of attracting external information about these resources. A good match would mean that the firms are acting pre-emptively, solving problems before they exist. The main research questions which this research answers is: ""How well does the incoming information retrieved from the knowledge networks of the academic spin-off firms match with the resources they are lacking, and how does this match influence the growth"". By using common sense the following hypothesis is proposed and later tested: ""Firms which are better at matching the incoming information from their knowledge networks with their missing resources, and thus have a higher match, grow faster"". This research question and hypothesis is analysed and tested by using a mixed quantitative and qualitative approach. The main part of this research is done quantitatively by using STATA®. After the quantitative results are known they are interpreted, and checked qualitatively through four in-depth interviews. These results combined generate the validated results. The dataset which is used to perform the quantitative part contains data about 105 academic spin-off firms in Delft and Trondheim. The trend which is found is that academic spin-off firms which are pre-emptively obtaining information about investment capital, or management skills grow faster than their counterparts which are reactive or passive. This conclusion also verifies the hypothesis and shows that firms which are better at matching the incoming information by acting pre-emptively do experience a faster growth. The recommendations which follow from these results are split into two categories: recommendations for the firms, and recommendations for the incubators. The recommendations for the academic spin-off firms are as follows. Try to be ahead of future resource deficiencies, and solve future resource deficiencies before they emerge. If your firm is experiencing a strong growth make sure that the management skills within the firm are developed to sustain such growth before the lack of management skills is holding the firm back. The recommendations for the incubators are based on the recommendations to the academic spin-off firms. In order to make sure the firms act pre-emptively they need to know when to attract information. The incubator should therefore create an early warning system based upon the actual stage of development of the academic spin-off firms. This stage of development should include the number of employees of the firm, the capital position of the firm, the maturity of the product the firm is selling, and the current resource deficiencies of the firm.","academic spin-off firms; incubator; open-innovation; matching; quantitative","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Innovation Systems","","Economics of Innovation","",""

(mentor); Roos, J. (mentor); Van de Voort, J.A. (mentor)","2013","Since the economic crisis in 2008 there is a common impression that things are about to change. No more large scale newly built neighbourhoods, growth is no longer a keyword. More transformation, reuse and redevelopment within the existing city boundaries is. New building assignments like increasing number of 1- and 2 person households and office vacancy strengthen this tendency. There is also a sustainability aspect in reuse. This is not only about saving building materials, but also saving existing structures and landmarks the area, which has characteristics for people to identify with. As a result of this, developers tend to take more interest in redevelopment. What does this mean for our built environment? Are they going to take certain values into account? The main research question is: Considering the changing building industry, what is the sum of co-operation between real estate developers and reuse architects in the initial phase in the building process in a reuse project? This will be tested on a post war housing flat, with two different design approaches known within the faculty of architecture: value assessment (department of Renovation, Modification, Intervention and Transformation) and feasibility analysis (department of Real Estate and Housing). The main reason for choosing this typology is because over 30% of our building stock is built after the war and lack modern comfort. This makes them likely to be redeveloped. Although the methods used are not completely fit for this building typology, this research shows that there is a sum. The most interesting conclusions are: - Financial analysis gives a designer insight in where exactly the costs are made and where the creative freedom might be. This resulted in equal costs for a simple functional intervention and a more extensive architectural intervention. Same costs, big difference in appearance; - The value analysis can show developers and building owners that a depreciated building, seemingly outdated and ‘ugly’, still has qualities and demolition is not the only option. - Combination of both created a profitable redesign of a post war housing flat with architectural quality and respect for values and heritage of the building and neighbourhood.","reuse; redevelopment; architecture; post-war housing; portiekflat; herontwikkeling; na oorlogse woningbouw","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","explorelab","",""

(mentor); Van Mourik, F. (mentor)","2013","With advancing technologies, drivers face dealing with an increasing number of features and controls in the vehicle. Menu-based interfaces engage the driver and take the focus away from the main task of driving. However, drivers need to access information and carry out tasks in order to get to their destination safely, comfortably and efficiently. The goal was to provide contextual information to the driver facilitating a safe, comfortable and efficient driver causing least interference to the primary driving task. In-car tasks were studied, along with causes of distraction. Ways of improving the driving experience and safety were researched. Requirements were set within the categories of in-car task completion and safety improvements. From the set of requirements, ideas were generated and concepts were created to satisfy the set criteria. The solution provides simplified navigation and safety information which is context- aware on a wearable head up display. This helps tackle distraction and the need to take the eyes off the road. Navigation information is simplified and context-aware so that junction and lane guidance instructions are provided without the need to access a full map. Junction guidance instructions appear overlaid on the road to counter cognitive tunneling. Other task-relevant information is provided in the periphery. Lane guidance is designed to be provided at all times and can be accessed when required or chosen to be ignored. Task-relevant information is person-centric and is provided when gaze direction is towards the road. Gestural interaction is provided to counter distraction from engaging touch-based screens. Information such as braking distance visualization for critically proximal situations and infrared views for low light conditions are provided to improve safety. Therefore, safety aids, along with task-relevant information that is not complex to understand in quick decision making situations on a transparent display, helps drivers counter distraction from the primary driving task and keep their eyes on the road.","user experience; automotive; head up display","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2014-11-07","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Hackauf, U. (mentor)","2013","Romania and Bulgaria are facing serious financial problems and their GDP is among the lowest in the European continent. This is due to the transition from the rule of a communist regime into a western-type economy. The problem is more evident at the states' agricultural sector: very low yields and quotas1, a population of old farmers and stray land. However, agriculture has many more potentials at the last part of Danube's estuary: high quality and quantity2 of arable land and a long tradition in agriculture. This could become the force to change the agriculture-based3 financial structure of both states and improve the lives of their citizens. One of the solutions proposed by many stakeholders is the improvement of the educational background of farmers, the introduction of new technologies and the enforcement of innovation production. Additionally, the accession of the two states at E.U. creates a fertile context for joint, cross-border cooperation for an improved agricultural sector, with extensions to the qualities of rural space and landscape. Hypothesis and strategy The hypothesis that is tested in the design is that an educational landscape can stimulate the development of the agricultural sector as well as to create attractive landscapes re-establishing connections between cities and their surroundings. The administrative areas of Giurgiu (Ro) and Ruse (Bu) will serve as a case study for developing an Open Food-production University (FoodUni). The OFPU is a spatial intervention that intends to upgrade the educational background of farmers as well as the long-term attitude locals have towards agriculture, rural space and food. It is an accessible landscape which intends to bring agricultural knowledge to local populations directly through the interaction with a landscape that agricultural scientists continuously evolve for them and not indirectly through an agriculturalist or a consultant office. It is an open dialogue between the landscape, the scientific community of the wider area of Europe, the farmers and the local population. The keyword that can describe the innovation that FoodUni brings to the area is Synergy. Project FoodUni has the strong ambition to become part of locals' everyday life. It is located next to the cities of Giurgiu and Ruse, which host two of the most important ports of Romania and Bulgaria respectively, right at the place where one of the two bridges connecting the two countries, is located. In this way, this cross border campus becomes equally important for the citizens of both countries. In spatial terms the university campus is a clear rectangle, placed in perpendicular direction to Danube, next to the two cities, stating in a symbolic way the autonomy, a univesity should have, but transferred in spatial terms. Additionally, by using such a shape, most of the landscape types (e.g. floodplain, mountainous landscape, etc.) found at the wider area of Danube's estuary can be included within FoodUni's borders and scientists can easily conduct their tests for a big variety of landscapes, within the limits of the campus. This rectangle is divided in clear strips, each one of which has a different use. Alltogether they form a collection of continuous, evolving examples of reorganizing and utilizing rural space, each of which could function as prototype for the development of the periurban and rural areas of Romania and Bulgaria. The backbone of the university is a linear intervention crossing every one of these strips, from Bulgaria to Romania and vice versa, and it is formed by the transportation networks already existing there (train, highway), a new, proposed tramline connecting Ruse with Giurgiu, the educational and research facilities of the university and the main paths, recreational, biking and walking. In the way it is designed, it becomes a device to meet, enjoy, explore and develop the landscape surrounding it, while having educational functions at the same time. The shape of this device is defined by the local landscape characteristics along the campus, the existing transportation lines and the desired, spatial relations between them. The FoodUni offers a test field for scientific experimentation and applications at real scale areas. These are called satellite landscapes and function either as transfer of already tested knowledge directly to more remote landscapes and farmers, or as initiatives to start a research in the university’s test fields and laboratories, so the other way around. Some of these examples are used to form the current snapshot-masterplan of the university given here, since the proposed landscape is under continuous transformation by people using it. It is again a form of synergy between the real landscape and the University campus. Conclusion University facilities at FoodUni give agricultural scientists the tools to work directly at the landscape they want to develop, farmers can access it at any time, come in contact with new methods and state their problems directly to the scientists, while local people can visit the university for recreational reasons and at the same time learn about food production and quality and redefine their nutritional habits based on the new knowledge they acquire. This site specific project crosses three borders: the physical border of the Danube, the borders between design typologies of landscape space and the borders between science and practice. At first glance, with great symbolism it literally projects field studies onto the landscape of both bordering countries crossing the river as a century old border. As a design, the educational landscape is defining a new type by combining typologies of campus, park, botanical garden, river landscape and agricultural garden. This new type should be also establishing a new understanding of Landscape Architecture as a generating force that integrates seemingly separated development goals and inscribes them into the land and the collective memory of its people. The landscape as educational interface is transforming first the local condition on the central campus and in satellites, but on the long run will change the attitude of both farmers and locals in order to achieve a long term sustainable development of agriculture for the near and long future of Romania and Bulgaria.","landscape; Danube; agricultural education; educational interface","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-06-19","Delft University of Technology","Landscape architecture","","Landscape architecture","",""

To broaden the knowledge of the cooperative sector, this Thesis aims to reveal what elements determine the business models of the German renewable energy cooperatives and which business model typologies can be distinguished. 15 interviews were held with German wind & solar energy cooperatives founded by cooperative banks, municipalities, project developers, utility companies and civilian initiatives. The Thesis found that the business model typologies of German energy cooperatives represent the stabilized cooperatives, developer dependent cooperatives, developer independent cooperatives and developer integrated cooperatives. The faster growing energy cooperatives all effectively applied the following elements: value proposition, network and trust, which have been labeled the expansion triangle. The integration of the four business model types with the expansion triangle revealed that the value proposition represents the vital element for an energy cooperative, with network and trust representing supportive elements. The findings of this Thesis provide interesting insights for actors involved with civilian participation into renewable energy sources. This research allows these actors to understand which business models can be selected and which requirements have to be met to build faster growing energy cooperatives.","Business models; Renewable energy cooperatives; Expansion triangle; Value proposition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Technology, Strategy & Entrepreneurship","","Management of Technology","",""

Its damaged urban fabric and more interesting divided society is still recognizable as consequences of the war during the ninties. Several places in this city are used as frontlines and division zones during the war. One of them is the Bulevar, that runs through the heart of the city and functiones as a border between west and east Mostar. The four lane carriageway was constructed in the 1960’s and whilst it was a barrier to the movement of people pre-war, it is now even more of a barrier post-war as it acts as division in the city – creating two territories on either side and a bleak landscape. The Bulevar is not only a barrier in a physical sense but also in a psychological sense. This is where the sociological and spatial task crosses each other. The main aim of this thesis is to activate the divided halves of the city and use the Bulevar as a catalyst by improving the existing public space. In other words, the goal is to give the Bulevar back to the city and unite both parts of the city.","Mostar; Bulevar; Bosnia and Herzegovina; socio-spatial patterns; public space; post-war; frontline; divided society; culture of city; centre","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-11-05","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","Urban Regeneration","",""

(mentor); Melskens, J. (mentor)","2013","Photovoltaic energy is one of the key components of a sustainable energy future. While the market is currently dominated by crystalline silicon solar modules, thin-film silicon technology holds the promise of a cheap, resource-efficient and versatile alternative. The major drawback of thin-film silicon PV is its relatively low conversion efficiency, in part caused by the metastable defect phenomenon known as the Staebler-Wronski effect. To fully optimize the potential of thin-film silicon solar cells, a thorough understanding of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) is required. To this end, an experiment is designed in which the effects of thermal annealing and light soaking on various material properties of a-Si:H are determined. Sets of p-i-n solar cells are deposited on Asahi VU substrates and sets of intrinsic a-Si:H films are deposited on Corning Eagle XG glass and on n-type c-Si wafers. The intrinsic layer of the solar cells and the films are deposited using hydrogen-to-silane flow rate ratios of 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10. The solar cells and films are annealed in vacuum for one hour at a time at temperatures increasing from 25?C to 500?C. In between annealing steps, measurementsare performed using the following techniques and methods: Fourier transform photocurrent spectroscopy (FTPS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, reflectance/transmittance (RT), external quantum efficiency and solar cell external parameter determination. A separate set of solar cells and films is light soaked in a degradation chamber at 25?C with a light intensity of 1 kW/m^2 and an AM1.5 spectrum. At 0, 1, 10, 100 and 1000 hours of cumulative light soaking time, the same measurements as during the annealing experiment are performed (excluding FTIR and Raman spectroscopy). Additionally, the solar cells are light soaked in-situ in the FTPS setup using blue and white light with an intensity of 1 kW/m^2. Light soaking times increase exponentially and range from 0.5 s to approximately 200 h. FTPS measurements are performed after each step. Analysis of the FTIR results suggests that divacancies agglomerate into larger vacancies and nanosized voids during annealing, which is supported by the evolution of the bandgap obtained from RT measurements. Silicon-hydrogen bonds start breaking at around 300?C, at which temperature FTPS data show that the subgap absorption starts to increase, suggesting that defects are created in the form of un- or underpassivated vacancies and nanosized voids. Analysis of the FTPS data also reveals that the subgap absorption coefficient spectrum consists of at least 4 distributions, implying that the isolated dangling bond (which results in two defect distributions) cannot be the sole type of defect in a-Si:H. Analysis of the light soaking FTPS data reveals metastable defect creation with two distinct regimes: a fast regime (defect creation ? t^? with ? = 0.4 - 0.9) at timescales ranging from several hours to several days, and a slow regime (? = 0.1 - 0.2) at timescales ranging from days to weeks. This finding contradicts the commonly assumed single value of ? = 1/3, associated with the isolated dangling bond as sole type of metastable defect. The combined results strongly support a view of the nanostructure of a-Si:H, in which unpassivated divacancies and nanosized voids contribute significantly to metastable defect creation. Performance changes due to light soaking using different wavelengths of a-Si:H solar cells with absorber layers deposited using different hydrogen-to-silane gas flow rate ratios have been observed using FTPS. These observations are correlated to the external parameters of the devices. It is suggested that the fitted subgap distributions are linked spatially or energetically to particular defect entities. This highlights the potential of FTPS for monitoring metastability effects in solar cells.","hydrogenated amorphous silicon; a-Si:H; Metastable defects; Staebler-Wronski effect; FTPS; thin-film silicon solar cells","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Then these methods are tested in a financial model to see the consequences of these methods over time. The third insight gained is what the consequences of these methods are related to the legally defined tasks of the housing associations. Next to making a consequence analysis of the applicable financing methods the model is constructed in such a way that it is adaptable and suited for housing associations to gain insight in their specific financial possibilities and facilitate the ongoing research to a mixed funding. The main research question answered in this graduation research is the following: What are the returns, influences and consequences for future investments of alternative ways of financing the Dutch housing associations? The research adds to the current research about the balance sheet of housing associations. The existing research is mainly focused on the assets of the housing associations. This research looks beyond the existing financial paradigm and explores the alternatives that can be used by housing associations. Due to the size of the social rent sector in the Netherlands and the growing doubt about the long term sustainability of the current financial system, research to enlarge the funding opportunities for housing associations fulfils both a scientific and social need to expand the applicable knowledge. The expected research outcome and conclusions from the financial model is that several alternatives can be cheaper than the WSW secured financing. The main reason for this expectation is the number of financiers in the market; the WSW secured loans depends on the two Dutch sector-banks, their oligopoly has an upward effect on the interest yield. In other financial markets there is a decreasing interest yield due to interventions and quantitative enlargements of governments and central banks.

(mentor); Storm, S. (mentor)","2013","The Bangladeshi garment sector is a leading garment manufacturing industry in the world that has been growing constantly during the last decades. Today the garment sector represent the 80% of the national export and counts USD 19 billions revenues; these numbers describe the sector as the most important manufacturing industry in Bangladesh. The numbers are also outstanding when it comes to number of workers employed, about five millions, and number of factories about five thousands of different sizes. The cheap labour cost attracted many international brands that chose the Bangladeshi factories to produce their products for the European and US markets that take up to the 60% and 20% of the total export. Despite the impressive numbers presented, the level of working conditions cannot be described with the same positive attitude. In fact to an increasing level of profit and continuous expansion, the new wealth has not been equally distributed and workers are employed in factories that too often can be categorised as sweatshops. The working conditions do not allow a decent level of living for garment workers that are exploited and forced to meet exhausting production quota for very little level of wage and very low social security. The situation is even more worsened by the very low power that unions have and their limited activities that cannot ensure a proper protection of workers’ rights. In this thesis project we used the literature to understand the current status quo of the working conditions in the garment sector and to identify the major factors that influence, impact and contribute in making the labour standards low. We used the interviewing methodology to gather facts and opinions of the current system and to organize the information and draw the status of the system. Afterwards we analysed the findings using cultural and economic indicators and the design of recommendation that could contribute in improving the working conditions’ level. Through the literature review and the interviews we defined the working conditions as: wage, job security, safety, discrimination, harassment and freedom of association; through the analysis we could acknowledge that workers are clearly exploited and the conditions are far to comply with the International Labour Standards defined by the international organizations. In the specific we analysed how two factors, compliance and social dialogue impact on the working conditions; the result shows the very low law enforcement level and little practice of a dialogue among government, business associations and workers, where the latter has almost no power; we can conclude that they significantly contribute to keep the working conditions low. Finally we provided recommendations to improve the working conditions and distribute the benefits among workers, employers and government, guaranteeing the sectorial long-term expansion and the significant benefits for global buyers.","working conditions; compliance; social dialogue; Bangladesh; labour rights","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Department of Technology, Dynamics and Sustainable Development","","Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

The relation between primary education and democracy can be found on two different scales. The first one is the regional scale, which is about how educational buildings are organized in a region in relation to each other. The second one is the building scale, and is about how the architecture of educational buildings can make learning environments more democratic. Democracy is in this sense a social form of democracy, in which all people get’s involved and every person get’s the opportunity to explore and develop it’s capacities. Regional scale A 30% shrinkage in the age of 4 till 11 is expected for 2020 in Vledder (The Netherlands) and it’s surrounding area. According to the current system only the biggest schools will survive, because of financial reasons. Organizing the schools in a different way, gives the opportunity to involve the whole region in learning and therefore the bigger schools aren’t longer placed above the smaller ones. Building scale Education as we know it has been set up by the higher educated with math and language as main goals. However multiple pedagogical theories show many forms of intelligence and ways of learning. The architecture of learning spaces should therefore also fit to this plurality of intelligence: a highly differentiated learning space that stimulates every intelligence and gives the opportunity to every child to develop distinctive capacities.","education; shrinkage; democracy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Design as Politics","",""

The area of Zuidas consists of mostly individualistic buildings, or aliens. It is most of all a business district and the buildings that are close to the station are mainly used by large businesses, resulting in big offices. Because these buildings are all very introvert, with little connection to the surroundings, there is no coherence in the area, causing it to fall apart. The research therefore focuses on how the station can be used to connect Zuidas. First of all, a station already connects an area on the largest scale possible.

(mentor); Bakker, K.J. (mentor); Karreman, W. (mentor); Hermans, M. (mentor)","2013","Subsea rock installation is often used in offshore engineering. With offshore activities in increasing water depths a flexible fallpipe is currently used to accurately install the rock particles. The total required volume of rock material during installation can be determined by summing the geometrical volume, the operational losses and the displacements of the seabed. Accurate knowledge of the volume loss during installation is needed to ensure proper project management and cost estimation. This thesis provides insight in the processes which influence the volume loss during subsea rock installation and focusses specifically on immediate particle penetration. During installation the following processes affect volume loss: - Immediate deformation of the seabed - Loss of fine particles due to deep sea currents - Immediate particle penetration in the seabed - Flow of cohesive material in to the pores of the rock fill - Long term settling of the berm due to consolidation - Possible erosion of the seabed - Stones deposited outside the theoretical perimeter of the construction With a lot of oil and gas activity offshore Norway the problem of large volume losses becomes more important since this seabed consists of very soft clay. Additionally, since the rocks are installed in deeper waters using a flexible fallpipe, the impact velocity at the bottom is high (~3 m/s). Due to the high velocity and the low strength of the soil, the particles are thought to penetrate relatively deep into the soil (~0.1 m). In this thesis a model is presented to predict single stone penetration in very soft clay. This model is developed based on existing static bearing capacity formulae and validated using laboratory experiments. The results agree well with the theoretical formulation. Field tests on board of FFPV Stornes are performed in the northern part of the North Sea to define all relevant processes and corresponding magnitude. Based on calculations performed seabed deformation due to consolidation forms the largest individual factor of volume loss. With one fifth of the complete loss single stone penetration embodies another important factor. However its influence is smaller than initially expected. Multi stone penetration causes the particles to penetrate even deeper into the soft soil. The stone penetration processes combined represent almost half of the average expected volume loss. Based on the validated single stone model and the described supplementary processes the total volume loss is modelled. A fit between the field results and the modelled penetration is determined to check if all processes are described and to validate their magnitude. The match between the measured and calculated processes suggests that all the right processes are taken into account. However to be able to predict the volume loss, accurate derivation of each process will have to be optimised. So far no clear conclusion can be drawn. The measurement accuracy currently used to obtain height deficits lacks the precision to undoubtedly state the influence of all separate processes. Important factors such as seabed erosion and the presence of sludge on top of the seabed, let alone the inaccuracy of the provided low stress soil properties, cause a lot of uncertainty in the determination of the individual process influence.","Subsea rock installation; Particle penetration; Geotechnical research; Immediate seabed deformation; Kaolin; Flexible fallpipe vessel; Single stone model; Multi stone penetration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geo-engineering","",""

This decision had great influence on the urbanization of Shenzhen, because it has seen one of the fastest growth rates of cities in the world, explaining the saying developing in ´Shenzhen Speed’. This thesis is a research about what it means for Shenzhen, the ´Factory of the World´, if its economy is changing towards services and more specialized types of manufacturing. This change is causing factories to leave Shenzhen, leaving behind vacant factory buildings and unemployed people. This thesis shows that the vacant industrial areas can be an opportunity for Shenzhen. These areas, and the people living in them, can help with the transformation of Shenzhen from being a factory town to a real city. The planning approach argued for suggests that an investment in a diversity of projects, organized by diverse and inclusive partnerships, can be more effective than the current strategy of the authorities in Shenzhen who invest only in large scale projects. The ‘Shenzhen Speed’ is slowed down to a pace that can take into account local conditions and local needs. This allows the city to transform gradually into a more liveable and resilient city, where people can build up their lives.","China; redevelopment; factory areas; empowerment; alternative planning approaches; migrants","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Urbanism","","","",""
