The cost of PTSD is huge, both in terms of human pain and economics. Effective treatments such as exposure therapy do exist, but obviously prevention would be preferable. There is some research into training people to become more psychologically resilient, but this is still in an early stage. Supporting resilience training with technology may offer advantages such as reduced cost and logistics as compared to in vivo training, and being able to present stressors in a very controlled manner. Measuring effectiveness with technology may be more objective than the commonly used self-reporting questionnaires.<br/><br/>In this thesis one possible technology supported resilience training system was designed and evaluated. The system involved video annotation and the cognitive reappraisal paradigm, delivered through three different versions of a computer application that were developed for this purpose. Two novel ways aiming to measure resilience using a pictorial emotional Stroop task and the fear conditioned startle paradigm were evaluated.<br/><br/>Acceptance of the video annotation tool by the target group (military personnel and firefighters) was positive. Due to feasibility considerations its effectiveness could not be measured. Empirical validation of the measurement methods as a measurement of resilience was not successful, possibly as a result of selection bias in the participating sample and use of video material that was not sufficiently aversive.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor); Dehli, S.R. (mentor); Butter, G.G.J. (mentor)","2017","The Sense Glove, which was originally called the S-Sense, is an exoskeletal glove from Adjuvo which can very accurately measure the position of the fingers. While this product was initially developed to help medical professionals in the hand and wrist rehabilitation field, the goal of this project was to see whether or not a market diversification towards the VR industry would be suitable for Adjuvo. Four research questions guided this project and related to the question (1) if the VR industry is as promising as it seems for Adjuvo’s Sense Glove, (2) which redesign requirements are necessary for a specific target group in a VR setting, (3) if using the Sense Glove in VR is both technically and economically feasible to do and (4) how this market diversification could be strategically planned. Looking at trends which are relevant for this project in the upcoming years, it is already clear that VR in itself is already a trend. However, combining it with the social acceptance of technology it enables VR to become more than simply a medium to play games. Using it to help, train or educate people are examples of this. Since applications for VR seem to become more diverse in the future the financial growth of the market is also predicted to be enormous. Predictions based on reports from Goldman Sachs and KZero seem to suggest the VR input device market could become as large as a 40 million dollar industry in 2025. Also the release of three high end VR systems in 2016, the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and PlayStation VR, indicated the market is on the brink of rapid growth. Finally there are multiple competitors in the VR input device segment but they all share one characteristic. All of these devices are still in development. This gives Adjuvo the opportunity to also enter this market without having to compete with an established competitor. The competition to keep an eye on is defined by Manus, Noitom and Dexta Robotics since they provide solutions which are comparable to the Sense Glove. However, the accuracy, force feedback potential and low price make the Sense Glove unique in the value it can offer to consumers. Combining the trends, which show potential big growth for VR and applications for the Sense Glove in all kinds of fields, with a market which is growing with the launch of three major HMDs and a lack of established competition shows that the market has much potential for Adjuvo to enter. This meant the market diversification was further refined during the project. The market analysis already gave some input regarding the improvements deemed necessary for a dedicated VR input device designed by Adjuvo. While lead user research gave insights into the projected needs from people who will invest in VR systems in the near future, consumer research was performed to uncover redesign requirements. During a between groups experiment, in which 26 people participated, the Sense Glove was compared to the HTC Vive controller to see what the perceived added value is by consumers. This uncovered problems, irritations or elements that were unclear when using the latest Sense Glove prototype. However, it also proved the technical feasibility of using the Sense Glove in VR. The most important elements which require attention in the future are: a more sturdy appearance, more comfortable thimbles, force feedback, adjustable sizes, easy to access button on the product, unique branding, washable fabrics, having support for the HTC Vive tracker, connect to a computer wirelessly and finally be more intuitive to put on. While a large amount of improvements were uncovered the findings were sorted depending on their importance. Defining this order was done by focussing on the target group which would first get into contact with the product, which would be the so called “Developing VR Users” as defined in the lead user research. While the participants of this research were not necessarily representative of this user segment, a large amount of the improvements are also relevant to them. These overlapping improvements were presented above but the remaining, more detailed improvements, can be found in the report. Implementing these points for improvement resulted in an initial redesign. This redesign is also based on the branding proposed in the thesis. The focus of this initial redesign is on the usage of specific colours to make the Sense Glove recognisable in landscape of VR input devices. Making it look sturdy, more consumer friendly and in line with the expectations of the “Developing VR Users” was also tackled in the initial redesign to inspire Adjuvo to improve their product in the future. For this redesign a set of more detailed guidelines is provided in the report. Finally, introducing the Sense Glove into the market first focussed on finding developers to work together with, by creating a landing page and promotional video. This way the found improvements can be validated, and if necessary complemented. A focus on the trialability and observability makes a difference between the Sense Glove and its competition with regards to the promotion. Before the Sense Glove can be put in stores it should be redesigned, manufactured and promoted. Finding a partner to produce the hardware would be ideal since Adjuvo does not have experience with producing consumer products. However, if Adjuvo manages to receive a large investment in the near future it is also a viable option to hire an external party. It seems that looking into the B2B industry could be relevant since responses on the Sense Glove landing page, which served as a way of validating the VR industry interest, seemed to do particularly well with simulation or training applications for larger companies. With one of the main competitors, Manus VR, taking a side step into the motion capture industry, it seems this could prove to be an important stepping stone for Adjuvo in the near future before truly entering the market with a consumer product and creating a successful cross industry innovation.","Virtual Reality; VR; Market Diversification; Consumer Research; Startup; Yes!Delft; Adjuvo","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

(mentor); Heijman, S.G.J. (mentor); Luxemburg, W.M.J. (mentor)","2017","Additional thesis - The Pungue river originates in Zimbabwe and drains into the Indian Ocean creating a large alluvial estuary. The river discharge generated in the Eastern Highlands of Zimbabwe is an important source of fresh water for water consumers in Mozambique. In Mozambique the fresh water is used for drinking water production for the city of Beira and for irrigation and process purposes of the sugarcane estate of Mafambisse. The Mafambisse sugarcane estate strongly depends on the fresh water supply of the Pungue river. In the dry season when a low discharge is combined with a high tidal range salt intrusion can lead to high salinity values at the water intake of the estate. If the salinity exceeds the threshold of 0.16 kg/m3 the water cannot be taken in, without seriously affecting the yield or the operation of the sugarcane factory. The objective of this research is to obtain a thorough insight in the characteristics of the salt intrusion in the Pungue estuary in order to give preliminary solutions to the sugarcane estate. To get insight in the characteristics of salt intrusion data is collected during November and December of 2016. In order to describe the parameters in the steady and unsteady state salt intrusion models the estuary geometry is determined, the river discharge has been measured and salinity measurements have been conducted. The steady state salt intrusion model is calibrated on salinity measurements carried out with the moving-boat method. The salinity measurements show a sudden increase in salinity values around 60 kilometres from the estuary mouth. From the calibration it becomes clear that the steady state model is not able to represent these irregularities in the salinity distribution. This research shows that it is likely that an additional source of salt is causing the increase in salinity values and that the unsteady state salt intrusion is able to represent this. To see the effect of extreme situations of the tide and river discharge on the salinity distribution in the Pungue estuary four scenarios have been developed and compared with a reference scenario. The following scenarios are chosen: expansion of FIPAG (drinking water company), an increased extraction rate of Mafambisse, a drought and a bend cutoff. From the scenarios it can be concluded that with exception of the expansion of FIPAG all scenarios exceed the salinity threshold at the intake causing serious water shortages. The most extreme situation is reached in case of a drought. The salinity value modelled at the intake becomes 2.63 kg/m3 and the salt intrudes up to 84.5 km. In this situation no extractions are possible and Mafambisse will suffer from severe water shortages. To provide the sugarcane estate with preliminary solutions in preventing salinity incidents at the intake this research elaborates on three concrete recommendations. A straightforward solution to reduce salt incidents at the intake would be the relocation of the pumping station. This research suggests relocating the pumping station to 90 km or further from the estuary mouth. Another solution offered would be an alternated pumping scheme. This research shows that alternated pumping can be beneficial under certain conditions; a high salt intrusion length combined with a relatively high extraction rate. Under these conditions an alternated pumping scheme can lead to a larger extraction volume compared to the situation where the pumps are in constant operation and suddenly needs to be turned off. This is the case because the advective transport of salt by the river is much faster than the process of effective dispersion. The last recommendation is to monitor the additional salt sources, which causes irregularities in salinity distribution. Once these sources are located it is possible to control the flushing of saline water into the river by making use of small structures (e.g. sluices).","","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","","",""

(mentor); Schermer, W. (mentor)","2017","To this end, the central aim of this research has been to explore ways for designers to incorporate ethics into their design process. A practice-based research methodology has been employed, with research methods including interviews, case studies and observations. A range of case studies has been executed at the faculty of Industrial Design Engineering at the Delft University of Technology. Various techniques based on current ethical decision making tools and design methods have been experimented with. The insights gained throughout the project are boiled down into an accessible framework of how designers can cope with ethical issues within design. The argument put forth in this research is that the development of skills allows for incorporation of ethics because skills are not limited to specific content. The proposed ethical skills for designers are moral sensitivity, moral creativity and moral advocacy. Building on the theoretical framework, a toolkit for designers to acquire and develop these ethical skills has been developed. The tools are grouped in relation to the three ethical skills. These tools include: an evaluative exercise inspired by the ‘script’ concept of Latour; an ethical framing tool to define ethical constraints and provide an overview of the designers’ responsibilities; an ethical ideation game based on brainwriting and hidden roles, which stimulates integrating values into design; a role-playing tool to uncover and experience potential unethical situations and to improve a design; a practical introduction to normative ethics; a mapping tool based on the concept of Value Sensitive Design and a tool to set ethical objectives and divide responsibilities among stakeholders. Each tool is focused on a different aspect of the design process, ranging from the deconstruction of previous work to ideation to communication with stakeholders. Thus allowing the tools to find their natural place within an existing design process. Finally, these tools have been evaluated with designers in practice. However, to fully validate the effect of the toolkit each tool should be evaluated in real life design projects. In addition, these tools can be used to investigate the effect of practically incorporating ethics into design projects.","design; ethics; toolkit; research","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2017","The river Rhine is subject to a multitude of controls imposed by nature and humans. Natural controls refer to climate and tectonics, while human activity is represented by a series of interventions aimed at flood protection, navigation, land reclamation and exploitation of river supplied resources such as hydro energy and sediment. These controls can drastically change the longitudinal profile of the river as well as the composition of its bed sediment. When analyzing field data taken for bed elevation and grain size distribution with respect to temporal changes, although being possible to lead towards useful findings and conclusions, it is not trivial to explicitly indicate the causes. This is because, especially in heavily engineered rivers as the Rhine, the aforementioned controls are existent at different time periods and act upon different sections of the river but their respective effects on river morphodynamics tend to overlap since they demonstrate temporal variability that is characterized by shorter and longer time scales. In the present literature study, the focus is on the freely flowing reach of the Rhine, that initiates from the most downstream impoundment at Iffezheim and reaches up to the North Sea. For this section of the Rhine, temporal trends of the main imposed controls are presented using available field data and findings from previous studies. Then temporal trends are then similarly presented for the morphodynamic response of the river to the imposed controls, while their relation is discussed. The main natural controls on the freely flowing Rhine that are considered in this study are water discharge and base level (due to tectonics and sea level). For the first, data were analyzed from 10 gauging stations well distributed along the study area. A periodicity suggested to be linked with atmospheric oscillations by previous studies was identified after plotting the probability density functions of discharge for different time intervals, that yet varies between different gauging stations. Considering larger temporal scales, two main base controls are recognized. The first has shaped the low gradient Mainz basin and follows directly from differential movements of adjacent tectonic units. The second is found at the mouth of the Rhine and corresponds to a relative sea rise of roughly 30 cm in 100 years. With respect to human activity, nourishment and dredging as well as training works were considered. Narrowing, straightening and impoundments of the main reach and tributaries were the main human controls in the past. Removal dredging that was also extensive in the past was followed by re-allocation dredging. Various strategies of sediment nourishments are combined with the latter to counteract bed degradation in recent times. The morphodynamic response of the river to the controls stated above as revealed by bed elevation measurements, is a general incision of the bed to lower levels that is also followed by a lowering of water levels. Degradation was most prominent in different time periods at Oberrhein below the Iffezheim dam, at lower Niederrhein and at the upstream Dutch Rhine branches. Cumulative incision reaching up to 2 meters is observed at these reaches relative to 1934 measurements. At recent times the incision rates are largely decreased especially for the German reaches where nourishments are carried out. At the Dutch Rhine, degradation continues at the upstream Waal reach and Pannerdensch Kanaal. Nevertheless the first demonstrates higher rates of bed lowering reversing the former trend and hence changing the implications for the bifurcation stability. At the German-Dutch border area, bed degradation has left Niederrhein and Waal with steeper and milder slope respectively. Finally, locations of finer exposed historical deposits coincide with locations of ongoing bed incision in otherwise stabilized reaches. A general coarsening of the bed surface texture is also revealed by field data. This coarsening is a result of bed degradation (due to depletion of the finer material from the bed and exposure of coarse historical deposits) but also of nourishments with coarse -relative to bed- sediment. An example of the first case is demonstrated at the IJssel reach during the intense degradation of 1980s. For the latter an example can be drawn by the lower Niederrhein where the strong coarsening revealed at available measurements corresponds in time with strongly decreased degradation rates and nourishments of very coarse material. Recent field data of sediment transport rates demonstrate large scatter. Nevertheless, previous studies that consider geological time scales suggest a more or less constant input of sediment load to the Dutch Rhine that yet comes with a strong increase in grain size. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that the (ongoing) adjustment of the river profile and bed texture originates from a multitude of controls, the effects of which strongly overlap in time and space. Data analysis has limitations in linking causes and effects but can still provide insights when combined with numerical modelling. The results presented here can thus be considered in a following study that will use mathematical models to reproduce the adjustment of the freely-flowing Rhine.","river morphodynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","There are many types of sequences on which classification algorithms are applied. Sequences of symbols with information on the relation between every two direct successors (referred to as link information) is one of these. A common approach for classification of such sequences is to only consider the symbols and disregard the link information. However, this can be at the expense of the quality of the classifications. In this thesis, we show how the edit distance can be used to classify sequences based on its symbols as well as its link information. The edit distance is an alignment-based pairwise dissimilarity metric. Its definition depends on the structural representation of the instances that are compared. The set of edit operations determines in which ways instances can be modified. Applying an edit operation comes with a certain edit cost that is given by its cost function. The edit distance between two instances is the least expensive sequence of edit operations that transforms the one into the other. The symbols, link information and order of a sequence can be represented by the attributed graph data structure. For every edit operation, a model of its impact has been presented. The cost function of an edit operation is based on the variable(s) on which the model of its impact relies. The cost functions are defined in the edit cost model. Using the parameters of the edit cost model, the definition of the cost functions can be controlled. The edit distance is optimized for classification by finding the values of the edit cost model's parameters that minimize the average intra-class dissimilarity and maximize the average inter-class dissimilarity. Results of experiments conducted on real and artificial data show that classifications based on the edit distance can outperform both models that only incorporate symbols and models that incorporate the symbols, link information and order of sequences. In addition, the results show that the classification performance is positively correlated with the length of the sequences. A limitation of the presented method is that optimization of the edit distance can be computationally expensive.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","In the preliminary design phase of an offshore wind turbine, a complete aerodynamic model is not required to assess its feasibility. As a result, engineers often switch to a simple model which is reliable and efficient, economically and computationally. Such a simplified model is based on the research interest. The main objective of this project is to study the aerodynamic interaction of a Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT) blade. The aerodynamic interaction is basically the dependency of the relative wind velocity experienced by the blade on its structural response. Since the aerodynamic forces depend on the relative wind velocity, the interaction influences the force experienced by the blade. In addition, the cross-section of the blade is generally asymmetric, which results in a coupled bending-twist vibration of the blade, consequently influencing the aerodynamic interaction. Therefore, this project incorporates the coupled bending-twist vibration of the blade along with the introduction of gravity. A rotating blade is modeled accounting the bending-twist coupling by assuming a singly symmetric cross-section of the blade, which introduces an eccentricity between the center of mass and the elastic axis. The centrifugal force introduced due to the rotation of the blade, which induces an additional bending stiffness to the blade, is incorporated into the model. The relative wind velocity experienced by the blade is then defined by generating the wind profile from the Kaimal turbulence spectrum and incorporating the structural response. Due to the inclusion of torsional motion, the relative wind velocity varies along the chord line of the airfoil. Therefore, a point is selected along the chord line, generally the third-quarter chord point from the leading edge of the airfoil, for the definition of the relative wind velocity. Henceforth, the aerodynamic loads are defined and parametric studies are performed in order to assess the influence of gravity, aerodynamic interaction and bending-twist coupling on the structural response of the blade. It is found that the gravity induces a harmonic motion to the blade when rotating. In the case of a standstill blade, it only induces a static deformation due to the self-weight of the blade. The aerodynamic interaction is found to introduce an additional mass and damping to the system due to the dependency of the aerodynamic forces on the structural response acceleration and velocity, respectively. These added mass and stiffness result in lowering of the natural frequency of the system and significant damping of the structural response, predominantly in the flapwise direction when rotating. The bending-twist coupling is found to be dominant for the edgewise-torsional vibration.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural Engineering","",""

(mentor); Visser, H.G. (mentor)","2017","A minimization of disturbance caused by aircraft noise events and a reduction of fuel consumption during the initial and final phase of flight. These are the two objectives that play an important role in the Flexible Runway Allocation Model. By taking into account fuel consumption alongside noise annoyance, this model enables to analyze and optimize runway allocation from a broader perspective. This study aims to identify the improvements that can be made with respect to the initial Flexible Runway Use Model. Accordingly, these enhancements should be implemented and quantified in order to establish the Improved Flexible Runway Allocation Model. The improvements that are found in this study relate to both objectives in the mixed integer linear programming optimization as well as particular linear constraints. A major contribution is made to the runway occupancy constraint, which has shown a transition from a single aircraft computational method to a pairwise flight separation approach based on RECAT-EU. The proposed Improved Flexible Runway Allocation Model is applied to a case study that represents daily operations at London Heathrow Airport. This model shows that, by assigning a small delay to inbound and/or outbound flights, significant contributions can be made with respect to noise annoyance in the vicinity of the airport as well as the overall fuel consumption from the airline’s perspective. By allowing opposite direction operations, flexibility is added to the use of the airport’s runway ends, which results in a more efficient utilization of the available capacity. The results of this analysis are visualized by means of a Pareto front, indicating the Pareto optimal solutions to a runway allocation assignment based on a differentiation in objective weights.","runway; allocation; capacity; MILP; Linear Programming; Heathrow; London; optimization; fuel; noise; noise annoyance; Pareto; RECAT-EU; separation minima; opposite direction operations; flexible; flexible runway allocation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operations","","Air Transport & Operations (ATO)","",""

(mentor)","2017","The rodent whisker system is becoming a prominent experimental subject for the study of active sensing. As a result of improved video recording hardware/software and progressively better neurophysiological methods, there is now the prospect of precisely analyzing the intact vibrissal sensorimotor system. The vibrissae and snout analyzer (ViSA), as a widely used algorithm based on computer vision and image processing, has been proved successful for tracking and quantifying rodent sensorimotor behavior, but at great cost of processing time and power. In order to accelerate this offline algorithm and eventually apply it in online tracking, optimization is essential on both software and hardware level. We implemented 6 different versions of the algorithm, thereby exploring a wide range of diverse high-performance approaches including GPU parallelization, multi-thread computing, and FPGA dataflow computing on the optimized algorithm. Our experimental results indicate that the optimal solution for an offline implementation of ViSA is the mutli-threading execution. By using 16 CPU threads, we achieved x4,767 speed-up compared to the original Matlab serial version, resulting in a processing speed of 1.2 ms/frame, which is a solid step towards the real-time tracking. Analysis shows that running the algorithm on a 32-thread enabled machine reduces this number to 0.72 ms/frame, thereby enabling 1 KHz real-time tracking.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Quantum Engineering","","Computer Engineering","",""

However, the wake inevitably created by every turbine will lead to an aerodynamic interaction between the individual turbines. Common practice in industry has been to control turbines individually and ignore this interaction while optimizing the power and loads of the individual turbines. However, turbines that are in a wake experience reduced wind speed and increased turbulence, leading to a reduced energy extraction and increased dynamic mechanical loads on the turbine, respectively. Neglecting the dynamic interaction between turbines in control will therefore lead to sub-optimal behaviour of the total wind farm. Therefore, wind farm control has been receiving an increasing amount of attention over the past years, with the focus on increasing the total power production or reducing the dynamic loading on the turbines.

(mentor)","2017","Floating Production, Storage & Offloading (FPSO) units are extensively utilized in remote offshore areas for deep water developments where a pipeline infrastructure is not an economically viable solution. Traditionally, FPSOs are converted from oil tankers, which entails that they are not equipped with an appropriate mooring system. A spread mooring system is often employed to allow the FPSO to maintain its position offshore. The mooring loads from the catenary system further contribute to the internal loads in the hull structure. Currently, only the highest wave-induced section loads along with the still water section loads are taken into consideration in longitudinal strength. In the design of the mooring integration structure, which is the structure that transfers the loads from the mooring system to the vessel, the highest wave-induced section loads are combined with the highest local mooring loads. However, it is unclear whether the present adopted approaches lead to safe, unsafe or unnecessarily conservative designs for the hull and the mooring integration structures. The goal of this thesis is to assess the contribution of the slowly varying mooring loads to the global design loads. The study aims to investigate the effect of concomitant wave and mooring load-induced section loads. To this end, a numerical tool is developed in order to facilitate the synchronization between wave and mooring load-induced section loads. In this thesis, a linear hydrodynamic model is employed for the calculation of first and second order motions and internal loads in the frequency domain. Then, a time domain mooring model is utilized to compute the mooring line loads on the basis of a quasi-static approach while taking into account second order drift loads under the combined action of wind, waves and current. Subsequently, the mooring line tensions, the internal load response operators and the low frequency vessel position are implemented in the developed numerical tool that computes the internal load time traces due to mooring loads and synchronizes the latter with the wave-induced internal load time traces. A large number of extreme environmental conditions is considered to allow for a reliable statistical analysis. Under this scope, a statistical tool for extreme value and probabilistic dependence analysis is developed. It is concluded from this analysis that current practice according to which the contribution from the mooring loads in the global design loads is not taken into account is valid. However, considering the design of the integration structure, this study shows that it is significantly conservative to assume that the highest wave-induced section loads will coincide with the highest local mooring loads.","FPSO; Global loads; Mooring loads; Wave-induced loads; Internal loads; Probabilistic dependence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-03-30","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Offshore & Dredging Engineering","",""

After coating these inks on a scale-up compatible planar selective electron transport layer, the crystallographic, optical, and electrical properties of these inks were studied and compared to the Solliance baseline perovskite, a Iodide-Chloride based Methylammonium ink. Currently, the main inks used in Perovskite solar cells (PSC) research are Methylammonium (MA)- (MAPbI3 was the first perovskite to be used for solar cell purposes) and Formamidinium (FA)- based perovskites, because of the ease at which their bandgaps can be tuned by changing their compositions. However, MA- based perovskites have been shown to be less than ideal for future scale up purposes due to their instability when exposed to humidity in the atmosphere, and FA-perovskites are inherently unstable as the crystal structure prefers to relax into a non-perovskite phase after crystallisation. This has paved way for research into hybrid perovskites where the crystal structure is engineered by mixing the different cations to “arrest” it in the active perovskite phase, and prevent it from phase-transforming into the inactive phase. Based on literature, two possible candidate inks were chosen and studied for their high stability and performances: FA0.85MA0.15¬PbI2.5Br0.5 and the triple cation Cs0.05(FA0.85MA0.15)0.95¬PbI2.5Br0.5.","Thin films; Organometal halide Perovskites; Solar cells","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-03-29","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Materials Science and Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","As the number of large scale photovoltaic power plants (which also known as solar parks) is growing in recent years, standard activities related to the system such as the operation and maintenance of the plant and grid management have become more crucial. In order to ensure a standard quality of these activities, accurate irradiance measurement is required. Due to the relatively wide area of a large scale solar park, the irradiance measurement would most likely be suffering from additional error induced by spatial variation. Therefore proper planning regarding the optimum amount of irradiance measurement devices and how these devices are arranged in a space is one solution to minimize the issue. A statistical model based on data interpolation, clustering, and searching concepts has been built in order to approximate the optimum irradiance measurement devices configuration on an actual solar park. The statistical model utilizes satellite-derived irradiance data as its main input. In return, the model estimates the measurement uncertainty for every additional irradiance measurement devices and also roughly approximates themost probable positions for the devices. The study case result shows that an imaginary solar park in Leipzig with a total area of 1.8 km2 can reduce its measurement uncertainty for about 4% by increasing the amount of irradiance measurement devices from 2 to 30. While in similar case, identical imaginary solar park built in Arizona is only able to reduce its measurement uncertainty by no more than 2%. It has also been shown that utilizing a dataset with 4 times less temporal resolution would lead to reduction of measurement uncertainty for a maximumof 1%. Instead of being uniformly distributed throughout the solar park, the model’s suggested positions for the measurement devices are concentrated on certain areas within the solar park. It is found that these concentrated areas are formed due to yearly spatial variations that occur within the particular region. In the end, it is hoped that the information provided by themodel can accommodate the need of some actors within the solar park industry with regards to how relatively large area of a solar park influences the accuracy of irradiance measurement.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor)","2017","Analyzing large numbers of log entries can be challenging, especially when there are many short log entries that each describe only one execution of the system, either successful or unsuccessful. How can one determine whether the system is working correctly, based on these logs? The logs that are of interest (e.g., log entries pointing towards some anomaly in the system) may be hidden between all the logs that are of less interest. Luckily, there are so-called passive learning tools that infer a (graph) model from such set of logs, which allows the user to oversee all paths that were taken in the system. In this thesis, we discuss the opportunities for passive learning for Adyen, a large-scale payment company. We compare three different open source passive learning tools (namely Synoptic, InvariMint, and DFASAT) in terms of runtime performance and output complexity, and show that all tools struggle with an increasing input size. We also share the results of a survey we conducted under developers to identify their perceptions, and for which purpose(s) they would use such tools. Furthermore, we provide six examples of different types of analyses that are possible with passive learning (such as finding bugs, comparing within a context, and analyzing timings), and that are useful for the company. We include a short guide on how to adopt passive learning, and what we had to change in one of the tools to make it so useful. Finally, we show how a graph difference tool can help to compare different graphs, for example over different time intervals. This tool highlights differences in both structure and frequencies. Altogether, this shows what passive learning brings to Adyen.","passive learning; model inference; log files","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems","","Software Engineering Research Group","",""

We built a framework for a complete workflow to experiment with multimodal sensor data ranging from recording (with Kinect 3D sensor), labeling, 3D signal processing, analysing and replaying. We also built three custom recognizers (automatic speech recognizer, 3D object recognizer and 3D gesture recognizer) to convert the raw sensor streams to decisions and feed this to the neural network using a late fusion strategy. We recorded 25 particpants performing 27 unique verbal and gestural interactions (intents) with objects and trained the neural network using a supervised strategy. We proved that the framework works by building a deep neural networks assisted speech recognizer that performs approximately 5% better with multimodal data at 20 dB SnR up to 61% better with multimodal data at -5 dB SnR while performing identical to the individual recognizer when fed a unimodal datastream. Analysis shows that performance gain in low acoustic noise is due to true fusion of classifer results while gain at high acoustic noise is due to absence of speech results as it cannot detect speech events anymore, while the gesture recognizer is not affected. The impact of this thesis is significant for computational linguists and computer vision researchers as it describes how practical issues with (real and) real-time data can be solved such as dealing with sensor noise, GPU offloading for computational performance, 3D object and hand tracking. The speech-, object- and gesture recognizers are not state-of-the-art and the small vocabulary with 27 unique phrases and 9 objects can be considered a preliminary experiment.

(mentor)","2017","A crown wall is a gravity based L- shaped concrete structure on top of a rubble mound breakwater. Functions of a crown wall are: reduction of wave overtopping, enable transport on the breakwater and placement of pipelines on top of the flat surface. Marine contractor Van Oord was awarded to extend a breakwater with a crown wall on top, located in Romania. The design, already made by a local consultant, was reviewed by Van Oord, which led to the conclusion that the crown wall would be blown of the breakwater for that particular design in combination with the design wave conditions. Subsequently, physical scaled model tests were executed by Artelia in Grenoble, but, against all expectations the crown wall appeared to remain stable. Based on the contradiction between stability calculations and the outcome of the scaled model tests, the hypothesis arose that currently used wave load calculation methods lead to designs that seem to be conservative especially when freeboard, the vertical distance between the still water level and the base of the crown wall, increases. An experimental research is carried out in which the effect of freeboard is examined by varying water levels and wave conditions while geometrical properties of the structure remain constant. Tests are divided in three main subjects: pressure measurements, uplift stability and overall stability. Based on pressure measurements it is concluded that the mostly used design method PEDERSEN [1996] and its extended version of NØRGAARD et al. [2013], assume an upward pressure distribution which is too conservative in shape and distance over which pressure is exerted against the base of the crown wall. These methods assume a linear pressure distribution whereas this seems to be conservative based on test results since S-shaped and parabolic upward pressure distributions are found. Furthermore, it is assumed that upward pressure acts over the full length of the base whatever wave conditions and freeboard are. However, a relation is found which indicates that the effective length of the upward pressure actually depends on wave height and freeboard. Comparing the predicted vertical loads based on the methods of PEDERSEN [1996] and NØRGAARD et al. [2013] to the found vertical loads derived from uplift stability in this research, lead to substantial overpredictions when freeboard increases. Generated data with respect to critical weights confirms that the conventional methods of PEDERSEN [1996] and NØRGAARD et al. [2013] are too conservative in predicting overall stability with respect to sliding, especially when freeboard increases. However, by implementing the found relations for the effective length, especially NØRGAARD et al. [2013] become more reliable with respect to the found critical weights. Design guidelines are presented. It is advised to use these guidelines for prior design purposes in combination with the adapted method of NØRGAARD et al. [2013] in which a reduction coefficient for vertical loads must be taken into account. Since the range of application for the critical weight predictions is still small it is recommended to extend this range by varying more parameters in further research, which should make these guidelines generally better applicable.","Crown wall; Stability; Freeboard; Rubble mound breakwater; Experimental research; Sliding; Swell waves; Storm waves; Norgaard; Pedersen; Wave flume","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","This study aims to improve the predictive capabilities of flow pattern and depositional behaviour of non-Newtonian, high concentration sand and fines mixtures. The depositional behaviour influences the geometry of the deposit and the distribution of sand and fines particles, which in turn influence the strength and consolidation performance of the deposit. Ultimately this affects the area reclamation targets from the mining industry. In this study an existing numerical model, Delft3D (a three-dimensional, open source flow model from Deltares utilized world-wide in various hydrodynamic and sediment transport studies), is extended with the physics that describe non-Newtonian rheology and sand settling in shear flow. The rheology determines the yield stress and viscosity of a fluid. Shear induced sand settling occurs for fluids with a yield stress. Sand settles under shear whereas smaller particles stay suspended, producing segregation. Segregation leads to non-uniformity in deposit composition (e.g sand and fines dominated areas). Rheology and sand settling mutually interact, directly influencing deposition patterns. This study is a continuation of the work of [Hanssen, 2016], who included specific rheology and sand settling formulation in a one-dimensional version of Delft3D (i.e. 1DV). As part of this work, further verification of this one-dimensional model has been performed and the model has been extended to two-dimensional vertical (i.e. 2DV in a longitudinal cross section). The extended model has been tested in 2DV with deposition over a 400 meters slope. A sensitivity analysis is performed to consider the effect of different solid contents and rheological properties. The model is also tested on specific oil sand applications and data, such as tailings deposition down a beach, mutual interaction of tailings with different rheology or strength and a characterization of fines capture compared with data. This study proved that the extended version of Delft3D can simulate a 2DV non-Newtonian high density flow including sand settling. However there are still some physical processes where the model needs improvements or further research is needed, such as laminar-turbulence regime; transition to 3D and the motion of sand layers. Further model verification and development goes hands in hands with a good data set. Specifically important are flume/field tests with rheology data and its variation with time, especially for polymer added tailings, to verify the model.","slurries; non-Newtonian; Delft3D; rheology; shear setting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore and Dredging Engineering","","Dredging Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2017","This master thesis provides details on the development of a personalised home security solution for the company HomeWizard. The current alarm system market focuses on products that recognise a burglary and then signal the user. The used technology has been around for quite some time and the modular approach of most products allow the user to customise the alarm system to his own wishes. Research firms believe that the market of home alarms will thrive when it merges into the home automation market. This development should be obvious, since the modular approach is a characteristic of both markets. Still most vendors of alarm systems in the lower end of the market fail to offer devices that can integrate with home automation products. During the analysis three opportunities were observed in the market for affordable home alarm systems. First of all it appeared that current solutions fail short in stimulating prevention. Although it is known that actively closing all doors and windows when leaving the house, greatly reduces the chance of a burglary, most systems do not support their users in this behaviour. Also other actions that can be taken to improve prevention are neglected by alarm systems. The second opportunity is that current systems create a negative user experience, as the daily interaction is found annoying, cumbersome, and easily overlooked. Finally alarm systems fail to support the user during and after an incident. Clear guidance is not available, and asking people’s help is not easy in a stressful situation like a burglary. The final concept, HomeWizard Protect, is a security product with two door sensors, a wireless RGB bulb, a central gateway and a smartphone app, that focuses on two elements. The first element, being prevention, is realised by the system warning the user when he forgets to close doors and windows when leaving. It also tells the user about burglaries in the neighbourhood. And when the inhabitants of the house are absent, it automatically turns on the light when it darkens, thus simulating that someone is at home. The second focus is on comfort and ease of use. The system automatically changes its alarm states, based on the user’s location, it turns on lights when the user comes home in the dark, and it tells the user who is entering his house when he is not present. The final design consist of four components, two of which have been designed from scratch: the user interface and the door sensor. The UI/UX application for smartphone is designed not only to inform it’s user, but also to give him easy control of his security system, both remote and at home. Moreover this UI can be used as foundation for expanding the system in the area of home automation. Several prototypes of the smartphone application have been tested with the target group, validating it’s ease of use and clear communication. The hardware component, being the door sensor, is designed to have a new look and feel compared to the sensors from the competition. The sensor is water resistant and fits the aesthetics of the current HomeWizard portfolio. Moreover it can be produced within the financial requirements of €6.50 a piece. Two prototypes have been created to validate both wireless capabilities and mechanical properties.","HomeWizard; Security system; Alarm system; Safety & Security","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Mechatronic design, Design engineering","","","",""

System level integrated circuits are needed to simplify the automotive electronics design and increase the reliability of automobiles. In this thesis, a prototype of a linear voltage regulator is designed for system level integration. Instead of a conventional Internal PMOS or NMOS linear regulator topology, an external NMOS transistor produced by NXP is chosen as the pass device on considerations of certain commercial application. The parasitic inductance and capacitors of PCB traces and packaging are both modeled and calculated. The requirement differences of internal and external NMOS linear regulators are compared. This external NMOS transistor complicates the high-frequency design of this voltage regulator. The development of frequency compensation strategies as well as their implementation is the core of this work. Based on transistor models made by the author and the Root-Locus analysis method, the effectiveness of conceptual active compensation is examined in this thesis, and a passive frequency compensation scheme is proposed. This proposed scheme is not only able to accommodate the wide variation of load capacitor (470nF to 47μF) and the wide variation of load current (0 to 250mA) but also able to be compatible with the external NMOS. The effectiveness of passive frequency compensation is examined by both Root Locus analysis and transistor level simulation. The over-current protection of the NMOS linear regulator is also designed, which is realized by applying another current regulation loop to the voltage regulator. This voltage regulator is able to maintain a constant output current around 400mA in over-current protection scenario. The regulator quiescent current is 10μA, the output voltage accuracy is ±2%. At the end of this thesis, the performance aspects are discussed and analyzed, and the influence of parasitic PCB trace and packaging is examined.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","","",""

Reducing the drag of an aircraft will result in a reduction of the fuel consumption. Non-planar configurations may offer a solution to reduce the drag while maintaining the performance of today’s aircraft. The aim of this study is to identify the effect of using different climb and descent strategies on the planform optimization of non-planar wing configurations. In order to analyze these effects, a generic aero-structural model is developed, which combines a developed mission analysis model to assess the aircrafts performance over an entire mission profile. In this study, four aircraft configurations are considered: a planar configuration, a wing with winglet configuration, a C-wing configuration, and a box wing configuration. Using a gradient based optimization method, the configurations are optimized for minimum fuel consumption over an entire mission profile. The optimized box wing configuration offer fuel reductions up to 2% with respect to the planar configuration. The lift over drag ratio of the box wing is lower, but this is compensated for by its lighter wing mass. The C-wing has higher lift over drag ratios, but this does not compensate for the heavier wing mass. Therefore the C-wing results in a higher fuel consumption.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-01-01","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & Propulsion","","","",""

This energy has a lot of potential which can be recovered and used for the heating of the cold steel strip. Tata Steel, TU Delft and Drever International are developing a new process concept which recovers a part of this energy and can reduce the energy consumption of the system to 30% of a conventional process. The new concept uses ’multiple heat pipes’ for heat recovery. Heat pipes can be perceived as conductors with high thermal conductivity, with the working fluid evaporating at one end and condensing at the other. Previous studies in the context of this project focused on the working of a single heat pipe. However, the heat pipe system consist of multiple heat pipes interconnected by the strip being heated and cooled. Thus, it is required to develop a model which describes operation of the multiple heat pipe system. This heat pipe system model has been developed in this graduation project. The heat pipe system consist of different components like the strip and the heat pipe. Individual models have been developed which simulate these components and after validation of these models they have been integrated together to form the system block. Assembling and inter connecting multiple system blocks together forms the heat pipe system. To achieve the project aim, two heat pipe models have been developed. These models describe the behaviour of the heat pipe and its interior. The pre-existing strip-shell model which describes the evolution of the strip temperature as it passes over the heat pipe, was taken. Integrating these individual components forms the system block which is used to build the heat pipe system model. Each of this system block can be independently configured so that any working fluid suitable for the operation of the process can be used. Any number of system blocks can be interconnected to form the annealing line. Thus, the heat pipe system model is generic and modular, making it possible to scale up the system simulation for any number of heat pipes with different working fluids. The heat pipe system model developed in this graduation project allows simulation of a defined heat pipe system. It allows evaluation of the thermal behaviour of the heat pipe assisted annealing process. The resulting simulation can be used to study the effect of process configuration changes. The model allows determination of the effect of the number of heat pipes on the process efficiency, which makes it possible to optimize the process design. In addition, it allows simulation of dynamic process conditions such as line speed and strip cross section changes which allows determination of the dominant factors in the dynamic behaviour. Successful development of the process concept allows fuel saving of 400 - 600 MJ/tonne compared to the current process, when expressed as natural gas consumption. Also, the associated CO2 emission reduction contributes to the overall CO2 reduction targets of the steel industry.","Annealing; Dynamic; Heat pipes; Heat transfer; Modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-03-28","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","This master thesis will elaborate on the development of a device for laparoscope tip cleaning within the abdomen of the patient. In modern laparoscopy the optics are of high quality, since the laparoscope is the only way to get a view of the surgical site. However, when the view is obstructed by blood, tissue, smoke or fog the most important function of the laparoscope cannot be sufficiently fulfilled anymore. These interruptions often lead to the retraction of the laparoscope, which adds risks by leaving the surgical site unsupervised and interrupts the workflow or the surgical team. These interruptions lead to a longer surgery time and to more errors during laparoscopic surgery. Above all, in case of a bleeding, the surgeon could lose the view on the surgical site at the most crucial moment. Taking the laparoscope out of the body to clean it means to leave an uncontrolled situation not knowing what to expect on re-entry since the laparoscope is the only source that provides a view on the surgical site. Until now, available solutions for this problem have not been widely adopted. Research has been done to find these reasons to be able to implement the findings into the final design to make sure the product balances the human, business and technical demands. The final design helps to keep the users focussed on the surgical site by providing them with the ability to quickly regain their view on the surgical in a discreet and convenient way.","laparoscopy; cleaning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2019-03-28","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","The iron and steel industry is the one of the largest source of CO2 emissions due to its dependence on carbon based fuels and reductants such as coke and coal. In order to analyze the CO2 sources and magnitude of emissions from the steel mills, the entire process from the processing of raw materials to production of hot metal iron is modeled in a flowsheet model. The model is generated for the case of Tata Steel site at IJmuiden. From themodel it is clear that top gas from the blast furnace is the largest source of CO2 emission on the site. The model provides insight in the variation of CO2 content in various works arising gases due to process changes such as variation in coke or coal input to the blast furnaces. From the analysis carried out using the flowsheet model, it is clear that amount of CO2 content in the blast furnace gas remains in the average range of 24%-27%. From the analysis of the site-wide flowsheet model, the average composition of blast furnace gas is considered to model a chemical absorption system for CO2 capture from blast furnace gas. The chemical absorption system is modeled forMono-Ethanol Amine(MEA) and Piperazine(PZ) . A parametric analysis is conducted to optimize both the systems for minimum thermal energy requirement for regeneration of the absorbent. It is concluded from the analysis that the optimized thermal energy requirement for PZ system is approximately 30% lower than that for the MEA system. Economic analysis of the modeled systems indicate that MEA system is costlier as compared to the PZ system.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-04-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","The desorption step of the carbon dioxide absorption/desorption process is an extremely energy intensive process, which accounts for approximately 70% of operating cost according to Mofarahi et al. [2008]. Technip-ECN has proposed a solution of Heat integrated distillation column which will be adapted for the absorption process. In order to develop a model for this new column, an equation based model of the regular absorption column was required to be made where the equations are written in residual form so that the programmer has control over the parameters and equations. In this study, two models of CO2 absorption were developed in Python which represent the two different approaches that exist in literature, namely the rate based model and the equilibrium model. These models are then compared against each other on the basis of their ability to predict experimental data in four varying conditions. The key research question is to find out if the models can predict the temperature bulge inside the absorption column and what factors affect the position and shape of the temperature bulge. The results show that the rate based model gives better predictions as compared to the equilibrium model. The rate based model further reveals that competing absorption and evaporation processes produce the temperature bulge and that the position and shape of the bulge can be changed by changing the extent of absorption and evaporation. It is observed that the results of the rate based model are dependent on the model parameters such as mass transfer coefficient, enhancement factors, rate constants etc. This model is recommended to be used in the second stage of the project.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","Adaptive Optics (AO) play an essential role in the field of astronomical seeing for ground-based telescopes, providing a corrected image from the disturbance caused by the light having to travel through the turbulent atmosphere of our Earth. To provide us with more detailed images, the sizes of these telescopes are getting increasingly larger. As a consequence to the increased size for the primary mirror comes the increase in the number of actuators necessary for the deformable mirror as well as the increase in phase point measurements by the wavefront sensor. Apart from the technical challenges of constructing such devices, there is the challenge for adaptive optics control systems to handle such a large amount of inputs and outputs. Many control methods that are used for adaptive optics rely on some prior knowledge about the atmospheric turbulence to estimate a model for use in closed loop operation. By relying on this prior knowledge, the inherently changing dynamics of the turbulence are neglected and the accuracy of the control system will suffer when the changes in atmospheric turbulence are large and frequent. Rather than relying on first principles, we derive in this thesis scalable data-driven methods to obtain better prediction performances. This thesis suggests an approach for adaptively optimizing the coefficients of a Vector Auto-Regressive (VAR) model where the coefficient matrices can be written as a sum of Kronecker products. This approach relies on the Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm to continuously update the coefficients of the model to account for the changing dynamics of the atmospheric turbulence and uses the Kronecker product together with Alternating Least Squares (ALS) to reduce the computational complexity while still guaranteeing similar variance of the prediction error. The accuracy of this approach is compared to other commonly used control methods by subjecting it to generated non-stationary turbulence. Numerical experiments show that a significant increase in accuracy is achievable for this approach compared to unstructured non-recursive VAR models due to its recursive nature as well as a reduction in computational complexity due to the Kronecker structure. The algorithm is implemented by using CUDA on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and is evaluated by comparing the performance to a Python implementation. Numerical experiments done in this thesis show that, irregardless of the the matrix dimensions, a speedup factor of up to 7 times can be achieved over the implementation in Python for the ALS identification segment of the algorithm. For the RLS segment it is shown that the GPU is not an optimal device for implementing recursive methods and is better implemented sequentially for the sizes considered in the experiment.","Kronecker product; Recursive Least Squares; large-scale systems; Vector Auto-Regressive; Adaptive Optics; CUDA; GPU","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-03-27","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC)","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","Clients and vessel manufacturers are always looking for ways to increase the performance of their fleet. Therefore, a novel modelling strategy for the propulsion plant of naval vessels is explored here. This has been done by using the Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) framework. On one hand, a non-linear description is needed to fully understand the intrinsic dynamics of the system. On the other hand, linear models are required for frequency domain analysis and controller tuning and design. This work shows how an intermediate step between these extremes can offer a different strategy. Naval vessels are often equipped with a diesel engine in combination with a Controllable Pitch Propeller (CPP). In order to study the behaviour, these actuating systems have been modelled individually by a first principle approach. By then incorporating the propeller and engine model into a one-dimensional motion model the overall dynamics of a vessel have been studied. The results of this modelling strategy have then been used to develop both a Linear Time Invariant (LTI) and LPV model of the propulsion plant. Thereafter, comparisons are made both in the time and frequency domain. Results show that the dynamics of a diesel engine can well be represented by the LPV framework. This shows promising results with respect to future control strategies. The CPP model on the other hand, can be represented by a linear approximation. Results furthermore show how a wake disturbance on the propeller and the hull are effecting the overall dynamics. It is shown how the feedback controller reduces the disturbance on the propeller and vessel speed. Moreover, by describing the model as a function of the sailing conditions, these results can be extended to the entire operating range.","Linear Parameter Varying (LPV); Vessel propulsion; Diesel engine; Controllable Pitch Propeller; Propulsion control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-03-14","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC)","","","",""

(mentor); Sodja, J. (mentor)","2017","Aeroelastic analyses traditionally consider the airfoil of a wing to remain rigid, only allowing deformation in the span-wise direction of the wing. Recent investigations have shown the benefits of adding chord-wise flexibility in the trailing edge of a wing, however so far only two-dimensional studies have been carried out. Therefore, the investigation presented here determines whether chord-wise flexibility in the trailing edge improves aeroelastic behaviour for three-dimensional wing structures as well. To determine whether chord-wise flexibility improves the aeroelastic characteristics, a dynamic aeroelastic state-space model is built to compute the flow velocity at which the wing structure becomes instable and a closely coupled static model to compute the steady aerodynamic loads. Linear Timoshenko beam finite elements are used to represent the wing-box structure and are part of the existing aeroelastic framework PROTEUS, which is developed at the TU Delft. Linear flat shell elements are used to model the structure of the flexible trailing edge and rigid links couple these elements to the wing-box structure. The aerodynamic model in PROTEUS is modified in such a way that individual panel forces are extracted and trailing edge deformation can be transferred to these panels. By varying the thickness of a quasi-isotropic carbon fibre laminate in the trailing edge, its flexibility is managed. It was found that increasing the flexibility of the trailing edge increases the flutter speed of the wing in a similar manner as with a 2D typical section. A difference with a 2D typical section is that in the region of plate flutter, mode jumps occur due to span-wise deflection of the wing-box. If only part of the wing in span-wise direction is equipped with a flexible trailing edge, the flutter speed can be increased more effectively by positioning it towards the tip of the wing. The downside of increased trailing edge flexibility is the reduction in steady lift generated by such a wing.","Aeroelasticity; Chord-wise flexibility; Finite element model; Plate elements; Vortex-lattice method; State-space system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures and Materials","","","",""

In this study unbundling is understood as separation of through and local traffic on motorways by a physical separated main carriageway and parallel road. The circumstances under which the alternatives have been tested are six different distributions of through and local traffic, and the (total) traffic demand (the simulations are executed for a 10% and 20% increase of the initial determined demand).

Currently, the suspicion of sepsis in premature infants is based on non-specific physiological changes. The detection of alterations in the inter-heartbeat interval preceding sepsis can offer a solution. The aim of this study was to design a predictive model which captures the relation between physiological changes and variability in the inter heart beat interval, Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and the development of sepsis. A retrospective study was performed in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at the Sophia Children’s Hospital from January 2016 to June 2016. The study focussed on very preterm infants, of Gestational Age (GA) <32 weeks, with a birth weight below 1500 gram. Sepsis was defined as a blood culture proven Late-ONset Sepsis (LONS) with elevated levels of C-reactive Protein (CRP). Logistic mixed effect modelling was used to estimate the probability of developing sepsis based on GA, gender, birth weight, CRP, percentage weight, bradycardia, median RR and HRV. During the inclusion period, 18 of the 60 infants developed at least one event of sepsis. Infants with sepsis had lower birth weight and GA, with higher mortality rates and length of stay. Logistic mixed effect models showed a significant relation between CRP, bradycardia, median RR, HRV and the probability of developing sepsis. Bradycardia, CRP, median RR and HRV are found to be useful predictors of sepsis. Since the authorisation of a blood culture to prove sepsis takes about four days and the model predicts sepsis at the moment the blood culture is taken, the model is faster in providing results.","premature infant; sepsis; heart rate variability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomedical Engineering","","Biomechatronics","",""

The urge to act now mainly revolts around resilience to adapt well in the face of adversity. Fuel cells are a revolutionary technology which can be used as energy conversion devices for distributed combined heat and power generation which can be used as auxiliary power units on board maritime ships alongside the main prime mover, normally provided by internal combustion engines. In this thesis, the principle of operation of fuel cells as well as their technical advantages and limitations are covered. Thereafter, a broad overview of the fuel cells being developed is given as well as in-depth review of how solid oxide fuel cells are categorised. The study mainly focuses on the intermediate temperature operation of solid oxide fuel cells which could prove to break the deadlock in the maritime market. Of all potential technologies for small cogeneration plants (1-10 MW), solid oxide fuel cell systems offer the highest efficiency, highest end-user cost/benefit ratio and the lowest pollutant emissions. In this research, a dynamic model is developed by the finite volume method for co-flow planar solid oxide fuel cells, which can be used for both steady-state and transient performance analysis. The spatial distributions of current densities, pressures, temperatures and gas compositions in the solid oxide fuel cell are dealt with by discretising the cell into small units along the flow direction in the model. For each unit, the partial pressure of each species in the gas flow and the temperature of each solid layer and gas channel are assumed to be homogeneous, and therefore the dynamics are derived as a lumped parameter system. The model is applicable for various fuel inlet compositions and compatible with direct internal reforming. Flow velocities are approximated by applying linear orifice equation instead of solving momentum balance dynamics while a two-temperature layer is enough to capture the dynamics of solid oxide fuel cells, thus mitigating computation intensity. The model developed in this thesis is compared with the “Baseline” model of (Handa Xi and Jing Sun, 2008) which taken as the reference model published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Fuel Cell Science and Technology, (renamed to the Journal of Electrochemical Energy Conversion and Storage, in 2016). The comparison between the two sets of models is made using the same choice of operating parameters made in (Handa Xi and Jing Sun, 2008) on steady-state and dynamic performance. In retrospect, this thesis will attempt to provide a solid oxide fuel cell diagnostic tool to be able to tackle the last bottleneck mentioned in the introduction chapter which was associated with maritime breakthrough problems. Ultimately, the model developed will be convenient and effective for achieving the larger goal in future ship system integration projects for simulating advanced energy systems based on solid oxide fuel cells.","Intermediate Temperature; Anode Supported; Planar SOFC; 1-D Dynamic Model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","Space debris, composed of man-made objects orbiting around Earth in an uncontrolled fashion, represents a critical issue for long-term sustainability of outer space activities and for space safety. A reliable and accurate mapping and monitoring of space debris is therefore a critical necessity for modern space industry. For relatively low-altitude orbits, most debris can be accurately tracked by means of ground-based observations. However, for higher-altitude orbits, this debris detection method becomes less precise and smaller debris cannot be tracked anymore. The solution to this problem that will be analyzed in this thesis is the possibility to triangulate the position of the debris with the use of a formation of two or three satellites orbiting near the area of interest. In particular, the possibility of monitoring debris in the geostationary ring will be investigated. Due to the presence of perturbations, the satellites of the formation will deviate from their nominal orbit and by consequence from the optimal debris triangulation conditions. It will therefore be necessary to maneuver them in order to maintain a relative distance and position between spacecraft that results in a accurate and constant tracking of the geostationary debris. These maneuvers require a form of propulsion in order to provide the necessary thrust. Among the various propulsion technologies available for spacecraft control, this thesis will explore the possibility of using solar sailing. Solar sailing is a propulsion method theorized 100 years ago, but only developed in recent years, that uses the pressure exerted by electromagnetic radiation on a large and lightweight surface attached to the satellite in order to generate thrust. In this thesis, the possibility of maneuvering the satellites by means of solar sail propulsion in order to maintain the formation in an optimal position and shape for the triangulation of debris will be analyzed. This concept will be studied by developing a simulation model describing the orbital dynamics of the spacecraft under the influence of the Earth’s gravitational attraction, the thrust generated by the sail and a number of perturbations. The control of the formation will be parametrized and subsequently optimized with a self-adaptive differential evolution algorithm. This optimizer will work towards maintaining each satellite of the formation on an optimal orbit, characterized by a number of orbital requirements such as minimum and maximum inclination and inter-satellite distance. Among the simulations that were performed with different parametrizations of the formation control and with different optimization set-ups, only one complied with all the defined requirements. In fact, it is noticeable that maintaining the inter-satellite distance within the required range for time spans of a year or longer is very challenging and the developed optimization formulation in most cases cannot determine the necessary control law. It can also be noticed that the perturbations that tend to make the formation drift to larger orbital inclinations are more difficult to counteract and that a particular attention needs to be directed to this phenomenon in case long duration simulations are considered. Furthermore, it was found that better results are obtained if the decision variables representing the solar sail attitude are optimized simultaneously for the entire simulation duration rather than separately over limited time periods. However, the results obtained also show that the developed concept tends to control the satellites towards an improvement in the objective function and it is the opinion of the author that a better definition of the control parametrization coupled with a larger computational effort and eventually more suitable optimization algorithms could yield better results and comply with the concept requirements.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","Astrodynamics & Space Missions","",""

The developed algorithm to showcase the multi-robot coordination capabilities of the laboratory uses a model predictive based formation controller with a coordinate transform from Euclidean to spatial coordinates where the agents’ position is expressed in terms of traveled path length and path deviation. The method was implemented on multiple iRobot Create platforms with independent computing power. A distributed formation controller was achieved by applying a consensus algorithm on the traveled path length. Results show that the desired formations can be achieved even while tracking a target path. Implementation of the complete experiment in ROS illustrates that the developed laboratory setup and its components (hardware and software architecture) are capable of running distributed robotics experiments.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC)","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","One of the cause of slow download speed in the BitTorrent community is the existence of freeriders. The credit system, as one of the most widely implemented incentive mechanisms, is designed to tackle this issue. However, in some cases, gaining credit efficiently is difficult. Moreover, the supply and demand misalignment in swarms can result in performance deficiency. As an answer to this issue, we introduce a credit mining system, an autonomous system to download pieces from selected swarms in order to gain a high upload ratio. Our main work is to develop a credit mining system. Specifically, we focused on an algorithm to invest the credit in swarms. This is composed of two stages: prospecting and mining. In prospecting, swarm information is extensively collected and then filtered. In mining, swarms are sorted by their potential and then selected. We also propose a scoring policy as a method to quantify swarms with a numerical score. Each detail of the sub-algorithm is presented and elaborated. Finally, we implemented and evaluated the credit mining system in both live and controlled environments. The system is now fully integrated with Tribler and is able to adapt to user activity, while correctly selecting undersupplied swarms. In terms of advantages, users can gain an upload/download ratio of up to 4.91 by using 80% of their resources. The majority of the swarms in the community also get their average download speed increased by up to 34.6%. Based on the results, we showed that the implementation of the credit mining system is beneficial for both parties, especially considering the freeriding phenomenon.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","Distributed systems","",""

(mentor); Van Nederveen, S. (mentor); De Vries, P. (mentor)","2017","In the southern part of Vietnam, where the lower Mekong Delta is located, coastal erosion problems occur. In the Bạc Liêu province, one of the twelve provinces in the Mekong Delta, the width of the mangrove belt between the sea dyke and the sea is reduced by 100 m in the last four years. By rehabilitation of the mangrove forest, the hinterland can be protected against flooding. Mangrove rehabilitation is the action of improving the health of the forest to a previous condition. The primary goal of this project is to design a coastal protection system, including mangrove rehabilitation, to provide the Bạc Liêu province with a sufficient safety level against flooding till at least the year 2050. For this project a Systems Engineering (SE) approach is used. Currently, the coastal area of the Bạc Liêu Province consists of a sea dyke and an integrated-shrimp system, which means that there are mangrove plants inside and in front of the shrimp ponds. The current characteristics of the mangrove ecosystem is described by a four spheres approach, the hydrosphere, lithosphere, biosphere and the atmosphere. Several laws have been adopted on the management of mangrove forest. The obligation to assure a 500 m width of mangrove belt in front of the sea dyke and the rule of 60% mangrove coverage in the shrimp ponds are the most important requirements for this project. In the ideal situation, the coast is protected by a healthy mangrove ecosystem which has a variety of flora and fauna (Stieglitz, Ridd, & Müller, 2000). Older trees have more salinity resistance and can handle wave disturbances better. Therefore, a zonation is highly recommended for the ideal situation to create good living conditions for every species. Mangrove ecosystems need sediment to sustain the elevation of the trees in the tidal range and to counteract erosion. In Bạc Liêu a mangrove belt width of at least 500 m is required for flood protection. At the moment, the ideal situation and current situation deviate. A wider mangrove forest creates better conditions for a zonation with a better distribution of different mangrove species. Sea level rise causes a backward movement of species within the mangrove forest. This backward movement is hindered by the integrated shrimp ponds and the existing sea dyke. If the mangrove forest cannot expand backwards, it is likely that mangrove trees will drown and erode at the seaside, whereby the width of the mangrove forest will decrease further. When erosion occurs, the erosion pattern will likely create a concave-up mud flat profile which leads to stronger wave attack enhancing even more erosion. The government has great power to prevent this, since they influence the land use by means of policies. After the stakeholder analysis, two dilemmas were identified. First, at locations where the width of the mangrove belt is less than 500 metre it might be more convenient to restrict the land use and make space to plant mangrove at the landside instead of taking expensive measures to improve the conditions for mangrove plants to grow at the seaside. Second, the 60% mangrove coverage rule for the shrimp farms does not guaranty 500 m of mangrove belt everywhere. The system requirement specification, which is an overview of all the requirements for this coastal protection system, is partly based on the customer requirements, and partly on a function analysis based on the Function Analysis System Technique (FAST) method. However, the specification process is an iterative process, which is developed further during the research of different alternatives and the final design. After the FAST method, different alternatives like groynes, soft measures and breakwaters are investigated. There are two scenarios’ possible to guarantee a 500 metre mangrove belt for the flood protection system. The first scenario (scenario 1) is focussed on optimised land use behind the mangrove belt. By rearranging the shrimp ponds, a significantly smaller area of mangrove forest has to be rehabilitated in the seaward side. In the second scenario (scenario 2), the shrimp ponds will not be adjusted and mangrove rehabilitation fully takes place in front of the ponds, which results in a large area that needs to be elevated and protected for mangrove planting. A multi criteria analysis (MCA) is executed to evaluate which alternative is considered to be most suitable for this project location. The top results from the MCA are permeable fences, Geohooks, floating breakwaters, permeable groynes and longshore sandbars (cheniers). The final design for scenario 1 is chosen to be permeable bamboo T-fences. Calculations on the strength of the structure are made together with a mangrove-zonation, a cost estimation, a risk analysis and an implementation plan. For the second scenario, the choice is made to combine the permeable fences with a chenier, which provides a higher safety level and a faster accretion for the larger area that has to be elevated in the second scenario. Again, the structure is tested for the wave loads and risks are analysed, an implementation plan and cost estimation are made. These analyses are done for comparison with scenario 1. Thereafter, the uncertainties, limitations of calculations and assumptions are discussed and recommendations on further research are given. The biggest limitation during this project was the limited available data, most values are based on data from other locations. Lastly, the conclusion about the best way to protect the hinterland of Bạc Liêu against flooding is given.","Mangrove(s); rehabilitation; Vietnam; Coastal protection; Shrimp farms; Building with nature; coastal erosion","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","Multidisciplinair project","9.192422, 105.716350"

(mentor)","2017","This research is part of IPIN project (Smart Grid Innovation Programme) which aims to minimize the supply temperature for the TU Delft buildings by predicting and managing the buildings’ heat requirement and the heat supply. The prediction of heating demand is currently performed by a physic-based simulation tools which gives good estimations of the thermal energy demand of the building but it requires a large number of unknown input parameters (building & system characteristics). The estimation of these parameters is a time- & budget-consuming task, in addition to reducing the accuracy of the heating demand prediction. This thesis was proposed in order to give an optimal solution to the inconvenience mentioned above. The goal of this research is to study the possibility of using simple and fast mathematical models to predict the heating demand of the building with enough accuracy and physical meaning. The final model resulted in a multivariate linear equation defined by weather data, indoor air temperatures and the internal heat gains of the building. The equation shows a high predictive potential and accuracy level. The data collected from the previous season (2.5 months) are able to predict the next month with an accuracy in the range of 90-99%. This study concludes that the multivariate linear regression model is a more suitable predictive tool than a physics-based model for large scale implementations.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-10-01","Architecture and The Built Environment","OTB","","Energy in Built Environment","",""

(mentor); Goethals, F. (mentor); Romero Herrera, N.A. (mentor)","2017","The Emergency Department (ED) treats patients who have acute conditions and operates twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. At the ED department at the University Medical Centre Utrecht (UMCU), the patients are treated in single rooms. There is not always direct contact between patients and the ED team, because the team is responsible for the treatment of several patients at the same time. Emergency nurses want to be more aware of what is happening or what may happen in the patient’s room. This project will focus on designing a product that supports the emergency nurses to maintain the Situational Awareness at the Emergency Department with the purpose to reduce incidents and to increase ‘patient safety & quality’. Primary research and user research generated insights about the complex field of acute care treatment and the impact of Situational Awareness on ‘patient safety & quality’. It is evident that when the ‘shared’ Situational Awareness of the emergency team among a single patient gets lost, ‘patient safety &quality ’ may be negatively impacted. During peak hours the Situational Awareness of emergency nurses is reduced. To avoid calamities, continuity in the flow of information and orders should be guaranteed. During peak hours, the emergency nurse feels insecure about the safety of the patients. The main goal of emergency nurses is to keep patients under their supervision safe by identifying risk conditions through constant observation and by intervening on time. During peak hours they get limited support to reach this goal. Based on this problem a design goal was formulated: Give emergency nurses a feeling of security if they need to leave their ‘stable’ patients in the room without their personal supervision due to attending higher prioritized cases during peak hours. To give emergency nurses a feeling of security, the design solution should focus on supporting emergency nurses by observing ‘stable’ high-care patients properly at a distance as to make the emergency team aware of risky conditions. The final design should facilitate the emergency nurses with easily access to patient information in real-time upon the beginning of their daily shift in order prioritize care effectively. Emergency nurses should feel supported by design in order to perform well and to save and take care of human lives. Different design exploration activities have shown that emergency nurses believe that technology (such as sensors collecting patient information and receiving effective patient information through notifications) has the potential to contribute to observing patients at a distance effectively. Innovative technology should save time by replacing current computer-interactions and they want to be exposed with information in a clear overview. After assessing three concept directions, it was confirmed that nurses believe in the added value of implementing new technologies if it can be used to keep insight into changing conditions of patients regardless their locations. Additionally, to fit the context of use, the concept should be cost-effective and should have the potential to diminish calamities & incidents. The combination of rapid prototype sessions with emergency nurses and literature research resulted in desired design features as reflected in the final concept. This means that the final design solution should be connected to the alert system of the ED with an integrated following-up system, the device carried by nurses should contain a combination of an alert display & additional information display and the user should have easily access to an overview of real-time trends of patient’s vital signs on demand. A device, named HOLO, was designed to support nurses to keep insight in the conditions of patients present. It allows emergency nurses to observe patients from a distance and to keep patients who are under their supervision safe. The innovative product feature of HOLO is the possibility to review the trend of patients’ vital signs at all parts of the department. If the vital signs are becoming risky, the device alarms the emergency nurse who has the ability to intervene in time. The top display allows to re-prioritize care effectively and a main display automatically gives additional information as a response to an occurring alert. The evaluation study revealed that HOLO has a major contribution to the nurses’ experiences as they feel that it supports them to keep insight in patients’ conditions, to become aware of risk changes from a distance, to understand the cause of the alert and to hand-over responsibilities easily. However, the HOLO was also intended to support nurses to re-prioritize care at any time. Yet this goal could not be reached due to the fact that patient information on the top display was not perceived as sufficient in all cases. Regardless of the fact that HOLO has his drawbacks and should be improved and further assessed in terms of feasibility and viability for further development, it can be concluded that HOLO fulfils the main project goal. This research resulted in a tangible concept that is desired by emergency nurses of the UMCU as they feel that it has the potential to support them in improving ‘patient safety & quality’.","co-creation; design; healthcare; emergency department; Situational Awareness; alarm fatigue; hospital","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design for Interaction","",""

During test runs of this systematic investigation, all product and usage variables expected to influence microbial leakage were closely controlled. The results showed that airtight O-ring seals can leak bacteria, even in static conditions, and moreover, rotation of the axle was found to be a significant bateria leakage promoting factor.

Their benefit of low fuel consumption grants operation particularly for rising kerosene price. Detrimental is the high level of noise emission, especially tonal sound.

Delft University of Technology currently develops an automated aircraft design tool, which considers different disciplines. One of which is the noise prediction tool called INSTANT, already capable to predict noise emissions of turbofan engines. This thesis report presents and explains the development of an in-design noise prediction tool for Counter Rotating Open Rotors as a starting point for an advancement in application variability of INSTANT. A two-system approach, based on an analytical and a semi-empirical tool, is implemented to increase the tool’s fidelity and optionally keep its computation time minimum. The analytical tool relies on blade discretisation and aerodynamic properties, while the semi-empirical tool is based on empirical analogies. To a certain extend, the user is able to choose the algorithmof evaluation.

There are however multiple problems. Compared to arrays currently in use which have in the order of 128 elements, matrix arrays can easily contain 1000 to 10000 elements. If all elements would be connected independently, the cable would become very thick. Therefore, beamforming methods are required that can operate with fewer transmit and receive channels. Furthermore, the room for electronics on the chip is limited. So, the required electronics for the beamforming methods should be kept simple.<br/><br/>In this thesis we will propose beamforming methods that are able to operate with fewer channels. This will be done separately for the transmit and receive part, but they do in no way exclude each other. To be able to focus pulsed waves in transmit we propose a method based on Fresnel zone plates which are used in optics to focus continuous wave light. Our method only requires a single continuous-wave excitation signal to be present, which is connected and disconnected on demand to each element. We have evaluated our method with measurements and simulations. As compared to the conventional focusing method, the spatial resolution is not affected by our method, but the Contrast-to-Noise ratio is 5\% lower for shallow depths and up to 20\% lower deeper into the medium. Overall though, the differences were relatively small and so it is clear that our new focusing method works very well. If needed, better results can be obtained by trading in frame rate. In this case the results are almost indistinguishable from the conventional focusing method.<br/><br/>To solve the problem with image formation, we have developed a frequency domain two stage beamforming method for use with matrix arrays, which does not require all element data to be present. This has been done for two matrix types. For the first method we have confirmed with simulations that it performs similar to the respective results obtained with two 2D frequency domain two stage beamforming method that have already been experimentally verified. For the second method we have evaluated the performance with simulations and measurements. Our method was able to obtain a 25\% better spatial resolution as compared to Dynamic Receive Focusing(DRF), without additional artefacts. As an alternative to the last method, we have also developed a frequency domain beamforming method that does require all element data, but only requires a single insonification by a spherical wave. This method did perform worse than the method discussed before in both simulations and measurements, but it does outperform DRF applied to spherical wave data.<br","ultrasound imaging; beamforming; Stolt Migration; healthcare; health care","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has found widespread applications in the fine chemicals, agrochemicals, food and pharmaceutical industries. However, crystallization is a complicated process and is not easy to control. In conventional crystallization, many of the phenomena’s like nucleation, growth and agglomeration are all interlinked to each other. Furthermore, product quality variations among batches of crystalline products is also observed due to the presence of undesired primary or secondary nucleation. In order to minimize primary nuclei and to improve seed crystal growth in seeded crystallization experiments, the metastable zone width of L-ascorbic acid was determined for the airlift crystallizer and compared to the stirred crystallizer. Batch cooling crystallization experiments were conducted to study crystal growth using a third order cooling profile. The results from the batch cooling crystallization experiments served to confirm the results of previous research and to help get a better understanding of the setup. Continuous crystallization processes claim to improve product quality by minimizing batch to batch variations. After the batch experiments, continuous cooling crystallization experiments were carried out using the airlift crystallizer to study the growth of L-ascorbic acid crystals in a continuous process. Process conditions were determined for the continuous cooling crystallization process in which, the crystal production could be improved per residence time while ensuring a constant supersaturation for the growth of the seed crystals. To disentangle crystal growth and supersaturation generation, the membrane module was coupled with the airlift crystallizer. Experiments were performed with the continuous membrane-assisted crystallization process to determine an effective strategy for production of high quality products. Furthermore, improvements were made to the selected strategy in order to stabilize the process. By determining the metastable zone width of L-ascorbic acid in the airlift crystallizer, seeded crystallization experiments could be performed in the absence of primary nucleation. In the batch cooling crystallization experiments, the product crystals grew to double the size of the seed crystals. For the continuous cooling crystallization experiments, a balance between the seed amount, residence time, production rate and supersaturation generation was determined. Lastly, an effective strategy for the continuous membrane-assisted crystallization process was determined and optimized which improved flexibility in operation, product quality and crystal production.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","Intensified Reaction and Separation Systems","",""

Furthermore, the consistency of this method was proved by using several independent data sources. Finally some challenges are presented and some suggestions are made for improved retrieval of global 3D electron concentrations in future research, which can be then be used to increase the quality of space weather assimilation and GNSS ionospheric delay corrections.","earth; Ionosphere; plasmasphere; 3D; IRI; mapping; imaging; tomography; GNSS; GPS; LEO; satellites; space; weather; electrons; retrieval; navigation","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","","",""

(mentor); Tsouvalas, A. (mentor); van Dalen, K.N. (mentor); Besseling, F. (mentor)","2017","One of the most commonly used seismic analysis methods, over the last few decades is the equivalent lateral force method. This procedure, which was initially intended for elastic design of structures, has been extended to inelastic design, with the incorporation of the behaviour factor q or with the integration of response spectrum procedures with non-linear static pushover analysis. The behaviour factor, which is meant to reduce the elastic forces, depends on the ductility capacity of each structure. However, the connection between the ductility ratio and the behaviour factor has been approximated by employing an elastic-perfectly plastic hysteretic system, which is a very simplistic form of inelastic behaviour. Meanwhile, the last decades, a number of non-linear effects, that develop during the cyclic loading of an earthquake on different types of structures have been identified. The influence of those effects on the response of single degree of freedom (SDoF) systems subjected to seismic load has been recognized by various authors. The purpose of this work is to enhance the understanding of the impact of various typically observed effects on the seismic response of structures. Models that incorporate the effects of strength hardening, stiffness degradation, strength deterioration and pinching are examined and their response is compared to the response of the elastic-perfectly plastic system. The non-linear models are subjected to an ensemble of 167 earthquake ground motions, which is divided into eight different groups according to the magnitude of the earthquake, the significant duration, the soil conditions while one more group consists of signals similar to the ground motions of the area of Groningen. The response measures that are examined have been selected through an extensive investigation of various damage indices and measures proposed in the literature. Through this investigation, it is concluded that the measures of the maximum displacement response, the residual displacement, the total hysteretic energy, the total dissipated by viscous damping energy and the total input energy are sufficient to describe the response of a structure subjected to seismic load. The results of this investigation showed that these non-linear effects influence more the response of the systems with short eigen-period. The effect that seems to affect the most the response is the pinching effect. Additionally, it is shown that there is high dependency between the frequency content of the input signal and the deviations of the response calculated by the models that incorporate this non-linear effects and the response calculated by elastoplastic model.","strength hardening; stiffness degradation; strength deterioration; pinching; behaviour factor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-03-22","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Anisimov, A. (mentor)","2017","With an ever increasing demand for energy, the renewable energy sector is gaining a lot of importance. Among the various renewable energy sources, wind energy is becoming more attractive compared to its counterparts (solar, biomass, etc.). Some of the main advantages of wind energy are faster payback time and that power generation is possible both during the day and night. The wind energy industry is constantly aiming at larger size rotors for increased power generation and these larger rotor blades demand stronger and more durable materials. Currently, composite materials are extensively used for wind turbine blades. With a large heterogeneity in composite materials and complications in manufacturing processes, defects in composites are inevitable. A variety of defects and damages can be seen in wind turbine blades. Composites with such defects and damage undergo a significant loss in their mechanical properties. For the use of composites as a structural material, a good knowledge of possible defects and their behaviour should be understood. To do so, the behaviour of defects under different load conditions should be assessed. Many techniques such as ultrasound scans, X-ray radiography, etc. are available to detect the defects in composites, whereas studying the damage growth in a composite is still a challenging process. In this research, a method has been developed to use thermography for characterising the delamination under dynamic loading. To demonstrate this method, a test sample with double shear configuration (DSC) and an initial delamination consisting of a Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) insert was developed. The test sample was tested under fatigue loading and an infrared (IR) camera was used to monitor its thermal response and the delamination growth during loading. The data from the thermal camera was processed in two steps, firstly, fast Fourier transform (FFT) was used to transform the raw data from time domain to frequency domain. In the second step, FFT thermographs were further processed using an image segmentation algorithm. Here, the thermal plots are segmented to separate the delaminated and un-delaminated areas. By computing the number of pixels in the delaminated region, the area of delamination was obtained at each cycle and was plotted against the cycles to failure. The strain energy was computed with the help of force and displacement data from the test machine. Such signals allowed computing of the fatigue propagation curves and an understanding of the fatigue behaviour of the test samples. The results from this research were promising as the delamination behaviour reported using this method was in good accordance with a reference visual inspection method. The quantifiable output from this method can be a good starting point to study delamination experimentally and computationally. In future, this technique could be extended to different test types that cannot be quantitatively analysed using the conventional testing methods. The research was also presented at the European Conference on Composite Materials ECCM17, Munich, Germany.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures & Materials","","Structural Integrity & Composites","",""

(mentor)","2017","The subject of this master thesis is related to the passive suction under mud mats. Mud mats are used in the offshore industry to prevent structures from sinking in the soil after installation. If for some reason a structure has to be lifted, on the one side due to an installation error, on the other side due to removal the force needed to lift the structure sometimes exceeds the total submerged weight. This report contains a Literature survey conducted regarding the above subjects. This report also shows the design of a test setup and procedure for lifting a plate from a sand bed. In the end the report follows the modelling of an analytical model which is validated using the test data The focus of this report lies with finding out what basic parameters dominate this force and what the influence of these parameters are during lifting is sand. Experiments will be conducted to test these parameters. In the end these parameters will be used to develop a simple analytical model to predict the order of the breakout force. The model will then be validated with the experiments. The main research question is: How are the breakout force and breakout time influenced by the permeability of the sand and the lifting force? Can an analytical model, that uses these parameters, predicts the lifting force within a certain margin? Literature states that no breakout forces are to be expected due to the large permeability of sand but from cutting theories it is known that under pressures exist around the blade tip, especially for the smaller grain sizes. A test setup was built to study the lifting process and measure the pressure under the plate and his displacement for a given load. The tests were performed in two different sands (Silverbond and Geba Weiss) for a range of different loads with two different plates: A 2-Dimensional setup and a 3-Dimensional setup. An analytical model was created to predict the lifting force for a given permeability and upward velocity of the plate. In the end the model was validated with the test data. The test data showed that for the 2-Dimensional case the pressure profile was of a rectangular shape. A factor 10 in breakout time between the sands can be observed. The 2-Dimensional model gives a good estimation of the lifting load in Silverbond sand when using velocities from the beginning of the lifting process. For the Geba sand, after adjusting the length of the flow paths, the model also gives a good fit. The experiments with the 3-Dimensional plate showed that the pressure profile under the plate is of a rectangular shape with steep slopes towards the edge of the plate. Nothing can be concluded about a relation between the breakout time and the permeability for the same load between the two different sands due to an inertia dominated process. The 3-Dimensional model predict the lifting force accurately for the Silverbond sand using the velocities from the beginning of the lifting process. For the Geba sand the permeability had to be scaled to give a good fit. This is because of model assumptions and using flow paths. Adjusting the tune factor did not give satisfactory results.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine & Transport Technology","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","Electricity fraud generates costs for different stakeholders in Dutch society. Media publications about fraud costs often only refer to stolen electricity and lost taxes. But that is not all. In many of the electricity fraud cases there is a strong relationship with the illegal cultivation of hemp. The combination of electricity fraud and hemp cultivation places a cost burden on Dutch society, because many of the costs caused by fraud cannot be recovered. Regional network operators (RNO’s) continuously maintain their networks to keep operating costs as low as possible. RNO’s are encouraged to operate their businesses with efficiency. This is achieved by yardstick competition using tariff regulation as an incentive. Operational activities more efficient than the benchmark may be added to the RNO’s operational results. To keep operational costs as low as possible, RNO’s try to prevent electricity fraud to limit the costs of administrative grid loss. The main issue to be answered by this research is: ‘Are the stakeholder incentives around electricity fraud aligned with the social costs and benefits and, if not, how can these better be aligned?’ To answer this question, it is necessary to investigate how to define ‘costs’. Better understanding of costs provides a basis for estimating the impact of electricity fraud. Because reliable fraud cost figures are hard to estimate, a qualitative approach is used which focuses on how costs for society should be understood and how they emerge from activities related to electricity fraud. The interpretation is viewed from three different economic perspectives. The current stakeholder incentives to prevent electricity fraud are compared to the social costs of electricity fraud discovered from the economic viewpoints to get a picture of their alignment. In fraud enforcement proceedings RNO’s collaborate with covenant partners. The current covenants are compared to the theory of policy integration to discover how further alignment can be achieved to improve effectivity of enforcement operations. A graphical analysis is added to discover extra potential in the difference between fraud costs and prevention benefits. The incentives used by the regulator (Authority for Consumers and Markets, ACM) are to be interpreted as an economic instrument imposed on the RNO’s as being the main stakeholder. Using these incentives has in fact a reducing effect on fraud, because fraud is a part of grid loss and reduction of grid loss improves efficient operation. Fraud is causing disturbances in the daily process of RNO’s. Simultaneously costs for society emerge as a result. The current incentives are targeted at efficient operation of electricity grids in the natural way, i.e. business as it is commonly performed and not at reduction of costs for society as a whole. In this sense the current incentives are not aligned with social costs and benefits. A better alignment can be achieved by using the economic views to include non-monetary issues into the estimations of the social costs and designing incentives applying to a larger group of stakeholders, currently not empowered. The stakeholders could be represented by organizations/institutions taking care of their interests. Also the collaboration of the participants in enforcement against fraud and illegal hemp cultivation can be better aligned by pursuit of joint approach, joint policy and joint goals.","Electricity fraud; social costs and benefits; alignment; stakeholder incentives","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Multi Actor Systems","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis & Management (SEPAM)","",""

(mentor)","2017","220 miles offshore the West-Australian coast lies the Ichthys Field. In 2013 Heerema Marine Contractors (HMC) was contracted to install the umbilicals, risers and flowlines for the Ichthys Project, including the installation of several in-line structures such as in-line tees (ILT) and flow-line end terminations (FLET). The ship assigned to these installations was HMC’s deep water construction vessel Aegir. Environmental loads, such as waves and currents, as well as vessel motions induce significant loads on the submerged structures and pipeline. These loads could impose high risks and damage to people and equipment when not completely controlled. Therefore, each installation step is thoroughly analysed. The main software package for these analyses is Flexcom, FEM software specialised on pipeline calculations. The installation analysis of the 18” ILT-structure installations involved in the Ichthys project shows high compression in the upper- and upper-counter stem, the connection between the ILT and the pipe. Although Flexcom shows that buckling limits are exceeded, offshore load measurements of previous installations show hardly any compression. By means of a sensitivity study, the Flexcom model has been investigated to determine the driving mechanism for compression. Varying several parameters, it was found that the compression in Flexcom was closely related to the wave kinematics, and thus to the hydrodynamic loads on any of the submerged structures (pipeline, ILT & weight-compensation buoy). Finally, the compression could be related to the hydrodynamic loading of the weight-compensation buoy. The reason for the discrepancy between the Flexcom calculations and offshore load measurements is the fact that the weight-compensation buoy is hanging in a moonpool. Flexcom does not account for the flow characteristics of the water in the moonpool and is, by taking the incident waves for hydrodynamic loads calculations, over-predicting the loads on the buoy. In operational conditions, water in the moonpool moves in a so-called piston mode, a purely vertical motion, and moves periodically with its resonance period. In order to predict the water motions in the moonpool for future installations, 1,5 year of offshore motion measurements of the water in the moonpool have been compared to the incident wave field. Using this data, RAO’s for water motions in the moonpool have been developed for each wave heading. From these RAO’s it was found that the response of the moonpool is wave heading dependent; beam waves tend to excite water in the moonpool to a larger extend than waves reaching the bow or the stern. This relation is also observed in moonpool response calculations with diffraction software (WAMIT). Knowing the moonpool is excited by pressure fluctuations at the inlet of the moonpool, the pressure distribution around barge models of varying lengths has been studied. It was found that the distance between the hull side and the moonpool is a governing parameter for the response of the moonpool, but in case the moonpool is located close to the side, pressure interference patterns along the hull could both in- or decrease the excitation. This interference occurs at hull lengths of a multiple of the incoming wave length. Using the acquired knowledge from both literature and measurements, two new analysis procedure are proposed for structure installations through a moonpool. The first procedure uses incident waves for the vessel motion calculation, but uses a separately defined moonpool motion spectrum for the calculation of hydrodynamic loads on the buoy. However, due to the assumption of empty-moonpool conditions and the exponential decrease of wave kinematics over depth, this procedure yields some inaccuracies. The second procedure comprises the application of a user-defined load time-trace on the submerged structure, which is generated from non-empty moonpool measurements or CFD-results. Although the second procedure is more accurate, both procedures have shown to well approximate the loads measured offshore. Further research should be done on object-specific water motion characteristics of the moonpool.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-03-21","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Offshore & Dredging Engineering","",""

(mentor); Verhaegen, M. (mentor)","2017","Electricity can not be stored efficiently in the grid, resulting in a need for demand and supply to be in balance. The Transmission System Operator operates a real-time electricity market to acquire extra supply or load. Traditionally, electricity usage is forecast as accurately as possible a day ahead and deviations from this electricity program are kept to a minimum as financial risk is involved with these deviations. Deviations from the submitted electricity program are settled at the real-time electricity market clearing price, which can be profitable to the parties involved. The aim of this project is to achieve accurate, real-time and interpretable prediction of the electricity market price. To this end the Generalised Fuzzy Neural Network formulation of a Non-linear Auto-Regressive with eXogenous inputs model structure (GFNARX) model structure is proposed as contribution to existing fuzzy modelling literature. Accuracy of the proposed model is shown to be comparable to that of state-of-the-art fuzzy models on a popular literature benchmark, prediction of the Mackey-Glass chaotic time series, while using computationally cheaper means. As there is no substantial amount of literature on Real-time Electricity market Price (REP) forecasting which enables comparison of GFNARX predictions to any other, two other models from time series literature are used to generate comparison material: Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous inputs and Generalized Auto-Regressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (SARIMAX-GARCH) and Nonlinear Auto-Regressive with eXogenous inputs (NARX). To assess whether information about the real-time electricity price can be used to reduce electricity consumption costs for assets in a demand response portfolio, a benchmark method which simulates control of the cooling motor of a developed cold storage warehouse model according to the predicted state of the real-time electricity market, is proposed. Using the GFNARX model to predict the real-time price throughout the year 2015 based on historical data, a 25.5% reduction in cumulative electricity costs is obtained compared to the reference case where all electricity consumption is bought on the day ahead market. When comparing the GFNARX prediction result to using the most recent electricity price observation as naïve forecast which achieves 16.9% cost reduction, a relative 10.3% cost reduction is achieved.","electricity market; fuzzy; neural network; black-box identification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-03-20","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","Introduction: Diarrhoea is currently the second major cause of child mortality, which mostly affects children in developing countries. Dehydration is the major risk involved with diarrhoea, which is therefore the actual cause of death in most cases. Currently there are no cheap and reliable methods for assessing dehydration, while dehydration assessment is key for determining proper treatment. In this research two digitally measured diagnostic variables will be investigated: skin turgor and capillary refill time. Research Question: Does the severity of dehydration significantly correlated with increased capillary refill time and decreased skin turgor, when these variables are measured objectively using digital methods? Methods: To objectively measure skin turgor and capillary refill time, two experimental devices were used: the Cutometer and a prototype using green-light photoplethysmography (respectively). An experiment was conducted where subject volunteers were dehydrated. The loss of body-mass was used as the gold-standard for measuring dehydration. A regression analysis was conducted to determine the adjusted coefficients of determination R^2. Results: R^2 for most parameters of interest show arbitrary results. One parameter that stood out was R2 of the Cutometer, which represents skin elasticity. This parameter showed relatively high consistency in terms of high $\bar{R^2}$ and trends, although still it seems to be subject to noise. Discussion: Most results showed to be quite unexpected and arbitrary. It is believed that this might be primarily due to some considerable limitations of the experiment and equipment. Most importantly, it is believed that the dehydration achieved with the subjects was not high enough to have effect on the measurements. Conclusions: In general, no significant relations have been detected between the variables of interest and the severity of dehydration. The results should be interpreted with care, due to the major limitations of the experiment and the equipment. Recommendations: Future research should focus on building a set prototypes based on different technological principles and diagnostic variables. Also, using these prototypes, a data-collection study in the field should be conducted in areas where child-dehydration is frequent. Data collected will be much more representative. All collected data should be used for building a regression model for future diagnostic devices.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-03-20","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomechanical Engineering","","","",""

This paper demonstrates an approach, named the actor-judge approach, to make the exploration safer while imposing as few as possible restrictions on the agent. The approach combines ideas from the fields of Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning and Safe Reinforcement Learning to develop a Safe Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning algorithm.

(mentor)","2017","The role of traditional entry guidance systems is to ensure that the vehicle is brought from a nominal entry interface point (EIP) to the neighborhood of a designated landing site at an acceptable energy state. Such systems are designed in such a way that the landing site can be safely reached even if off-nominal conditions are present at the EIP or during the descent flight. A common aspect of traditional guidance systems is that they heavily rely on prior knowledge of the nominal entry trajectory and often require significant planning time prior the de-orbit burn. Due to the nature of abort scenarios, not only is prior knowledge of the entry conditions usually unavailable, but also there is often limited time to plan and execute any entry procedures. In addition, the range of entry conditions that may be encountered in an abort situation is significantly large, meaning that planning a trajectory to an alternative landing site may be required if the vehicle needs to be brought to safety in due time. The goal of this thesis is to develop and test a dedicated guidance system for abort entry missions, focusing on flights that originate from a low Earth orbit. Due to the limited computational power of current flight hardware, performing on-board trajectory optimization is not feasible, especially in an abort situation. This issue is tackled using the concept of on-board trajectory generation via Adaptive Multivariate Pseudospectral Interpolation (AMPI), which attempts to achieve the optimality and accuracy of solutions obtained on the ground with a feasible computing speed. The AMPI-based trajectory interpolator feeds off a large database of optimal trajectories computed off-board, where the selection of the appropriate database sub-space is made according to the projected entry conditions at the moment of the abort. The AMPI method is reduced to bivariate interpolation and thus uses a database that simply covers off-nominal latitude and longitude values. Dispersions in the remaining entry state variables are addressed by a combination of a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) tracking law and a simple lateral guidance implementation. The developed guidance system is capable of planning a reference trajectory in the order of a few milliseconds, proving its capability to run on-board. Furthermore, the system can handle multiple abort scenarios, since the trajectory planner is capable of selecting the most appropriate reference trajectories from the database based on information provided by the navigation system. Thorough testing of the system showed that while the constraint compliance is marginally affected by the density of the trajectory database, the position dispersions at the terminal point are strongly correlated with the chosen density. Despite this, the AMPI algorithm employed in the trajectory planner allows for a loss-less compression of the database. Consequently, manageable database sizes can be achieved even for fine spacings, ranging from only 18 MB for a database spacing of 5 deg to 900 MB for a spacing of 0.1 deg.","adaptive entry guidance; orbital aborts; trajectory optimization; adaptive multivariate pseudospectral interpolation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-02-28","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","Astrodynamics & Space Missions","",""

(mentor); Fanzio, P. (mentor)","2017","Wearable technologies are receiving a growing attention from research and industry in many different scientific areas [1]. Many of the commercialized devices are mainly based on the detection of gravitational, electric or acoustic impulse and environmental sensors [2]. However, for various healthcare applications it is of vital importance to be able to analyse bodily fluids, detecting microscopic biomarkers in order to monitor health conditions in a continuous, not-invasive and localized way. For this reason, the realization of the realization of in-situ wearable electrochemical bio-sensors is highly needed since it will open the possibility of mass screening and personalized medicine [1]. Conductive polymers are well suited for wearable bio-sensor applications, due to their unique electrical and optical properties that can be selected by choosing among a broad range of available materials [3][4][5]. Moreover, they provide also biocompatibility, low cost and easy manufacturability. This thesis presents a low cost and simple method for fabricating an all polymeric device for pH monitoring. Indeed, pH is one of the keys indicator of wound infection and it is important to study its evaluation during wound healing in order to select the right therapy. The device consists of a microfluidic channel, for uid handling, and polymeric electrodes made of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), one of the most promising conductive electrodes. The PEDOT layer has been created by spin-coating on a cyclic ole_n copolymer (COC) substrate and has been characterized by both contact and optical interferometry. In order to increase adhesion, isopropanol has been added to PEDOT before spin-coating and a post-process treatment with ethylene glycol has demonstrated to be crucial to increase the PEDOT conductivity and decrease its solubility in water, Electrodes coupled with microchannels were fabricated by mean of a single hot embossing process. The thesis presents a comparison between a standard hot embossing process with a soft embossing one (in which the mold is polymeric). Two different processes for fabrication the mold are discussed: direct milling of aluminum for the hard mold and soft lithography with polydimethilsiloxane on a polystyrene master. The polymeric electrodes obtained after embossing have been characterized by means of electrical and electrochemical measurements. In order to impart pH sensitivity, a pH sensitive layer of polyaniline has been electropolimerized on the PEDOT working electrode and characterized by means of SEM imaging and electrochemistry. Finally, the response of the device to a relevant range of pH is tested and validated by monitoring its potentiometric response. In conclusion, this thesis describes the development and characterization of an all polymeric microfluidic pH sensing system with integrated electrodes manufactured by means of a single-step embossing process.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","The current ship speed prediction at a given fuel consumption shows large differences with the actual operational values for the Happy Star. This can result in schedule fines, unexpected fuel expenditures and difficulties in bunker schedules. The first goal of this research is to improve these predictions for the expected range of weather conditions and expand it for cargo or no-cargo condition in good or bad weather. A second goal of this research is to gain insight in the uncertainty of predicting fuel consumption. A prediction model is built which takes into account the calm water, added resistance due to wind- and swell waves and added resistance due to wind. The total resistance follows from the sum of these separate components. The total resistance is translated to a value for daily fuel consumption. Using hind-casting a validation is performed with daily fuel consumption from noon reports. The uncertainties accompanied with these calculations are reported as well as the uncertainty propagation in the translation of resistance to consumed fuel. From the results of the simulations it seems justified to conclude that; 1. The separation of cargo/no-cargo conditions and good/bad weather gives an improved estimation the relation between vessel speed and daily fuel consumption, as expressed by the prediction error; a. For no-cargo condition from 79% to 60%/55% in good/bad weather respectively b. For cargo condition from 79% to 56%/60% in good/bad weather respectively 2. The goodness of the fit for no-cargo conditions is 63% while this is 32% for cargo conditions. This difference results from overhanging and high deck cargoes. 3. Wind resistance is the dominant resistance component after calm water resistance in all sailing conditions. In cargo condition during bad weather this contribution gets up to 32% of the total resistance comparing to 9% for wave resistance. 4. Following from the previous statement, the most important calculation parameters including highest uncertainty are the true wind angle, the wind load coefficient and true wind speed. Recommendations 1. In case of a long voyage with a large deck-cargo, BigLift should consider to perform a more extensive research on the wind resistance. 2. Monitoring of the following parameters would decrease the uncertainty in the calculations for fuel consumption; a. PTO enabled and how many power produced b.

(mentor)","2017","Thermoplastic composites are very attractive for aerospace structures due to their high specific strength and stiffness, enhanced toughness and high temperature resistance. One of the manufacturing methods used to produce thermoplastic composite parts is press forming. Press formed parts typically have constant thickness and fibre orientation. However, composite parts may be optimized by tailoring the stiffness and strength, thereby reducing structural weight. In this thesis, the processing techniques for this manufacturing method were developed by investigating the feasibility of a multiple step forming approach for the production of parts with variable thickness and fibre orientation. This manufacturing approach was proven from both a formability and structural integrity viewpoints. By using an efficient blankholder system with clamps and springs, thermoplastic composite laminates can be multiple step formed into three-dimensional shapes with no occurrence of visual forming defects such as wrinkling, fibre buckling or ply folding. Furthermore, good quality bonds can be achieved between laminates formed and co-consolidated in different steps. To achieve a high degree of bonding between GF/PEI composite laminates, the co-consolidation process window was estimated to be between 270ºC and 300ºC. The use of a post-consolidation stage in a hot press was needed to improve the degree of bonding between co-consolidated laminates formed in different steps, which led to very long production cycle times. For future research, the maximum temperature limit of the metal mould should be increased and tooling active cooling mechanisms must be incorporated to allow the mould to be rapidly cooled down, thereby decreasing production cycle times. With these implementations, a better insight on the feasibility of the process in an industrial environment may be gained.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-03-06","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures & Materials","","Structural Integrity & Composites","",""

A large kite flies crosswind developing a strong pulling force through a tether which is connected at the ground to an electrical generator. The power output of such innovative systems is directly related to the wing aerodynamic properties which therefore play a key role. Moreover, the latter, often assumed with best guess, are also required for computational simulations at development stage. In this context, the research group of TU Berlin recently designed a car towing test bench for evaluating flexible airfoil performances in an automated and repeatable manner. By towing the kite at a prescribed speed, relevant information, such as tether force and elevation angle, are extracted and can be converted into aerodynamic properties thanks to a suitable analytical model. With the purpose of improving the assessment of aerodynamic properties and their exactitude, the present work takes advantage of the TU Berlin test bench by investigating the Kitepower wing. An alternative testing methodology is suggested and compared against the current procedure, indicating a dynamic behaviour of the kite. A 2D quasi-steady point mass model is implemented to compute the kite aerodynamic properties by taking both wing and tether mass as well as tether aerodynamic effects into consideration. Eventually, a detailed analytical model of the tether is developed to assess its sag and effects on the kite performance. Finally, an attempt to provide polar curves with re-spect to the angle of attack rather than the power ratio is experimentally carried out.","Airborne Wind Energy; Pumping Kite Power System; Kite; Aerodynamic Properties; Lift-over-Drag Ratio; Tether Sag; Power Ratio","en","master thesis","","","","","","In collaboration with Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) and TU Berlin.","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Aerodynamics and Wind Energy","",""

(mentor)","2017","Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion is a relatively new renewable energy technology, aiming at producing electricity by combining deep cool sea water with tropical warm surface water. One of the biggest technical challenge for offshore OTEC plants is represented by the installation and deployment of the cold-water pipe, which is required to bring cold sea water to the power plant at the sea surface. The pipe is approximately 1000-meter-long, with an external diameter between 4 and 10 meter and a free hanging configuration from a floating structure, which results in a complex dynamic behaviour. Large bending stress, high-tension loads, and the potential buckling risk must be reduced to ensure a safe and secure pipeline deployment. Pipelines of this size have never been installed before. This project, carried out at the company Bluerise, has the objectives to investigate how a very large diameter cold water pipe can be installed, and to assess the technical feasibility of the deployment method. This research project provides an initial investigation on how a very large diameter cold-water pipe can be designed and installed for large scale offshore OTEC plants. After identifying the best material and best installation method from a technical and economical point of view, it presents several approaches, both analytical and numerical, that can be used to model the pipeline during deployment, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Based on the models comparison, this project also provides an optimization design of the chosen float and sink installation method, consisting of the use of counter weight and multi-point liftings. In general, the (non-linear) beam theory represents a relative quick way to estimate the behaviour of the pipeline during deployment, giving the most reliable results among the models considered. In terms of installation capabilities, bending curvature and combined stresses from the base case result in a safe configuration, being lower than the maximum values allowed for HDPE material. From this analysis, a large diameter pipe can be safely installed through the float and sink method. Further research will be required to deeply investigate the installation of the cold-water pipe. In this study the models are judged and compared based on the results from just one static configuration. This analysis should be conducted for every phase of the pipeline deployment. This can be done by considering a range of the pull force values exerted by the tug boat on the pipeline, instead of considering only one value. It is recommended to extend the pipe-lay analysis also to the dynamic part. Waves and current influences on the pipe are not considered in this work. It would be very interesting to execute a model test of the deployment and validate the model with actual experiment. Solving the residual challenges for the cold-water pipe might represent the answer to the question on how to make the development of large scale OTEC plants a reality.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-03-16","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore & Dredging Engineering","","Bottom Founded Structures","",""

The largest share of this group is poor and lives in the developing world, and has to deal with unmet basic needs.

Having access to energy is also often linked to economic growth and has a positive impact on health. (Gradl &amp; Knobloch, 2011) Improving energy access is therefore a hot topic worldwide. With a Solar Home System (SHS), energy can be generated and used on a household level at places where the electric grid does not reach. The main components of a SHS are a solar panel for the generation of electricity, a battery for energy storage and balance of system (BoS) components, including power electronics, to coordinate the flows of energy. SHS are offered by multiple companies worldwide, and come in various configurations. The smallest SHS are capable of powering for example LED lights, phones and/or a radio, while larger SHS can power for example televisions and fans. Generally speaking, SHSs are increasing in size. This is due to dropping prices of system components. Where in 2003 a SHS of 20 Wp was economically competitive with kerosene lamps, in 2015 this was already 70-80 Wp. (Chattopadhyay, Bazilian and Peter Lilienthal, 2015) The conventional technologies are likely to dominate the SHS the upcoming years. Proven technologies are favourable as reliability is key for SHSs. This means that most of the SHSs in the future will rely on crystalline silicon panels and lead-acid batteries.

Even by eye this can intuitively be judged. When switching to indoor training come winter, this intuitive measure is taken away as the athletes throw into a net suspended 5–8 metres in front of them. The coach believes this lack of feedback is the reason for the drop in performance over the winter. This project aims to develop a training solution that can measure the relevant variables of a discus throw and compute the final distance using a theoretical model. The relevant variables that should be measured are release speed, release angle, angle of attack and release height. To obtain these, the three dimensional position of the discus has to be tracked over time. Many state of the art technologies are trying to crack the indoor-positioning problem. Among them are many virtual reality headsets. One such system is the HTC Vive's Lighthouse tracking system. This is an optical tracking technology that provides ~2 mm accurate three dimensional tracking, at a rate of 60 times per second. Moreover, it is an open standard and can be used without licensing fees. A functional prototype was built that uses the Lighthouse tracking system. This prototype proved that it is a viable technology for use in a discus. This prototype had an accuracy that approached that of the Vive, at 2,5 mm. Concurrently, an Android app was developed to receive and process the data coming from the discus. This proved that the data can be processed into meaningful information on a smartphone.","Discus throwing; Data driven sports; Indoor positioning; Virtual reality","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2017","To protect the hinterland, flood defences are often located on the border between water and land. This same border however is also an attractive place to live, which may hamper improvement of flood protections. Closing off a tidal (river) system, especially in case of little discharge, may in this case be a logical consideration. This would however result in the disappearance of tidal action, while ecological value in urban areas is already under pressure. Environmental organisations are representing the increasing voice and power of society and its cry for nature conservation. The Hollandsche IJssel is one of the side branches of the Dutch delta. It is a perfect case of the conflicting interests mentioned. The aim in this research was to design a hybrid barrier for this case that provides (1) the security of a close-off to the hinterland and (2) the openness of a surge barrier (tide and flow are possible) to nature and thus conserves this unique system. The core of this research is to come up with a preliminary design of a hybrid barrier that is appropriate from an ecological point of view. To do so, boundary conditions were distilled that ensure conservation of ecological value of the freshwater tidal river system. Focus was laid on the unique aspects of the ecosystem at hand. Ecological value is considered to be conserved if the hybrid barrier conserves the tidal range as much as possible (90 %) and if fish migration is still possible. The line of thought on how to take into account ecological value presented in this research could be used by others seeking to fully incorporate ecological value in their design. Several concepts and locations for the eco-friendly barrier are discussed. Furthermore, in order to increase the available intertidal area, a proposition is made to narrow the river. The proposed strategy consists of three aspects, namely (1) an eco-friendly barrier with pumping capacity, (2) river narrowing and (3) no dike reinforcements after implementation of the new barrier. Until the proposed strategy is implemented, dike reinforcements may still be necessary however. The proposed strategy was compared to the current or reference strategy. The reference strategy consists of three aspects, namely (1) improvement of the current barrier, (2) replacement of the barrier with a similar barrier in 2050, and (3) continuation of dike reinforcements. In both strategies the current barrier is replaced. It was found that for the proposed strategy, a single gate solution is not an option, hence multiple small gates are required. A single gate solution would lead to too high water levels in the Hollandsche IJssel. The final design consists of 31 square culverts with sides of 2.7 m. To maintain maximum tidal range pumps are required between 2105 and 2140 (depending on the severity of sea level rise). Therefore, a pump structure with 6 square inlets with sides of 3.7 m is included in the design. Approximately 90% of the original tidal amplitude is maintained and the available intertidal area almost triples. Furthermore, fish are able to migrate the majority of the time. The slight reduction of the tidal range is compensated by creating extra intertidal area. Therefore, the design is considered to be acceptable from an ecological perspective. The cost of implementation of the proposed strategy in 2030, 2050 and 2070 was compared to the reference strategy. Three points of comparison were taken into account, namely: (1) societal cost of shipping delay (2) cost of construction and (3) dike reinforcement cost. It was found that the proposed barrier including the creation of new intertidal areas is significantly cheaper than the reference strategy in two cases considered (implementation in either 2030 or 2050) or just as expensive as the reference strategy (implementation in 2070). In total, societal cost ranging from 400 M€ up to 700 M€ can be saved when implementing the new barrier complex in 2030. Although the societal cost due to shipping delay are higher, construction cost of the barrier itself are lower. More importantly, expensive dike reinforcements can be averted in the proposed strategy. Earlier implementation results in lower investment cost, mainly because less dike reinforcements need to be carried out.","Ecology; eco-friendly design; Storm Surge Barrier; Hollandsche IJssel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","51.91723, 4.57952"

(mentor)","2017","Focusing on the rapidly increasing debris population around Earth as well as the scientific and corporate interest in Asteroids, multiple missions for interaction with non-cooperative bodies have been proposed over the last years. Applications such as the Electrostatic Tractor (ET) aiming to reduce the debris populations and missions introducing close proximity or even berthing with bodies in space all require knowledge about the electrostatic characteristics of the target. In order to infer this information in a real-time manner, the Remote Sensing for Electrostatic Characterization (RSEC) method can be applied. By measuring the ambient potential with probes extended from a dedicated spacecraft, an optimization can be performed as to find a best-fit Multi-Sphere Method (MSM) model. onsisting of a set of spheres with a point charge in their middle, this model approximates both the charge and potential of the rotating target. Comparing the in-situ measured potential with the potential obtained from the MSM model, the accuracy of the MSM model can be found and with it the model can be optimized. This thesis provides an extension of the RSEC method to three-dimensional space allowing for multi-axis tumbling motions of the target. Furthermore, simplifications of the model allowing for greater computational speed and simpler application are discussed. In order to validate the model, a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is performed allowing the RSEC method to be tested for a representative missions scenario where the ET is applied. Based on the results of the FEA simulation, a Surface-MSM (SMSM) is constructed, allowing for multi-axis rotations of the debris, where this would be too computationally expensive with a FEA. The accuracy of force prediction within the ET method is assessed for a representative debris model. Furthermore, insights are offered in the effect of varying model parameters, and the influence of force mis-prediction on reorbiting time and fuel cost is evaluated.","electrostatic; space debris; sensing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","Space Flight","",""

This method is used on the Tribler technology to create a multi-core architecture. The resulting architecture is shown to be significantly more efficient in terms of consumed CPU for the delivered file download speed.

(mentor)","2017","In order to guarantee safe operations in the offshore industry, at all time it is necessary to predict motion behaviour of structures in specific sea states accurately. Safety is very important for the offshore industry, which can come in jeopardy when motions are either extreme or unexpected with regards to predicted motion behaviour. This thesis aims to establish improved motion behaviour prediction of a barge in shallow water. A parametric model is developed, in both frequency as well as time domain, which contains flexibility for other, non-linear wave theories, as well as other non-linear effects like viscous damping or an additional inertial force which can atone for the approaching seabed in shallow water motions. It utilises hydrodynamic coefficients from the diffraction analysis in ANSYS AQWA, with which motions are also verified. As no validation data were available, this verification was very important. The accuracy of motion prediction is verified in both Frequency Domain (FD) and Time Domain (TD), which assures its applicability. The model subsequently is wider applicable, as it allows for non-linear wave theories or modifications by other external forces. Parameters Ursell Number (UR), steepness S and relative depth μ are defined which determine the validity of wave theories. These parameters display theoretical limits of applicability and validity of the Linear Wave Theory (LWT). The parametric model is capable of calculating associated wave forces up to second order, which can modify the predicted motion behaviour for higher waves than the LWT allows. In the model a Vessel - object and Wave - object are defined. The former is for this thesis a rectangular barge, while the latter contains information on the sea state, defined by input parameters wave height H, wave period T and water depth d. In both FD and TD vertical displacements of four vertices are calculated, based on the heave, roll and pitch Degree of Freedom (DOF). Subsequently, viscous effects are included based on a factor of the critical damping in each specific DOF, which moderates the vertical motion especially near resonance. A numerical example of an additional inertial force to account for cushioning and sticking is elaborated, which displays effects of an approaching seabed on heave displacement. These values are based on water particle velocities in the Under Keel Clearance (UKC), but is not verified nor validated, so no general conclusion can be drawn. It does show nicely how the model is capable of dealing with additional external forces and subsequently calculates resulting motions. Second order effects increase in significance in shallow water of which set - down is an important non-linear shallow water effect, which has great significance in predicting ultimate vertical motions. The numerical solutions for a mono-directional bi-chromatic wave group show that these additional displacements are in such an order of magnitude that it should be accounted for in shallow water ship motion hydrodynamics. Viscous moderations are also within this order, although these exist by the grace of the structure’s velocity, while set - down is a phenomenon related to the waves, which occurs regardless of a vessel present or not.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore & Dredging Engineering","","Offshore Engineering","",""

(mentor); Botterhuis, A.A.J. (mentor); van Vuren, B.G. (mentor); Tissier, M.F.S. (mentor)","2017","Wave overtopping in harbour areas is a fairly untreated topic in the context of flood risk analyses. Pragmatic approaches were undertaken to evaluate the possible influence of wave overtopping on the frequency of flooding. However no consensus was reached on how wave overtopping in a harbour area could be quantified. Therefore it is also difficult to determine whether wave overtopping should be accounted for in a flood risk assessment or not. This master thesis seeks to find an answer on the question which method is best suitable to quantify wave overtopping in harbour areas. Along the way it is studied which wave processes play a role and how available models take into account these processes. Subsequently a choice for a certain method or model can be made. Using this approach the question whether the effect wave overtopping might be significant in a flood risk analysis is answered. At first a theory study is undertaken which consists of two parts. The first part examines the theory on the wave processes which play a role in the nearshore and inside harbours. The second part explores the capabilities and limitations of empirical and numerical modelling of wave heights and wave overtopping in harbour areas. It was chosen to develop a non-numerical model within the scope of this thesis. The available numerical models are either not capable of modelling all relevant wave processes or model an entire harbour area in a sufficiently efficient way. These considerations might change by future updates of the discussed numerical models or the development of a new and suitable numerical model. Furthermore the computational speed is expected to keep growing, such that the problem of a lack of computational efficiency might decrease in the future. The developed non-numerical WGPO model considers the most relevant processes, namely: wave generation, wave penetration and wave overtopping. Wave generation is estimated using the empirical Bretschneider formula. Wave diffraction and wave transmission and the interaction between the two are the considered components to determine the contribution of penetrated waves. The wave diffraction pattern is determined using the analytically derived Goda diffraction diagrams. Finally the expected amount of wave overtopping over the quay walls of the harbour is estimated using the empirical EurOtop formulas. Using the case of the Vlissingen Buitenhaven the performance of the WGPO model was verified with respect to earlier researches. Due to the assumptions which lie at the basis of the model it is not (yet) possible to model complex harbour geometries. This would require improvements to the WGPO model or the application of a numerical wave model. By applying the model to the case of the Brittaniëhaven in the Botlek area of the harbour of Rotterdam the influence of wave overtopping on the probability of flooding was estimated. It appears that the frequency of flooding of the harbour areas may double. In conclusion, this case study of the Brittaniëhaven thus shows the importance of taking into account wave overtopping in a flood risk analysis of a harbour case.","Wave overtopping; Wave growth; Wave penetration; Harbours; Wave modelling; WGPO model; Flood risk","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","River Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2017","At this moment a revolution is going on in the development of our vehicles. The driver is going to be replaced by the vehicle itself. To investigate this autonomy Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) is project leader of a partnership called Dutch Automated Vehicle Initiative (DAVI). This group of industry and academics are combining their efforts in development and implementation of autonomous driving systems. The aims of the initiative is to investigate, improve and demonstrate automated driving on public roads. One of the DAVI projects the TU Delft is currently working on is the development of an autonomous vehicle. This autonomous vehicle is designed in different stages with different systems. Apart from observing the surroundings of the autonomous vehicle and planning a trajectory it is also required to have a system that is capable of controlling the movement of the vehicle. In this thesis such a system will be developed for the Toyota Prius of the DAVI project. In contradiction to most Advanced Driving Assist Systems (ADAS) the developed system does not follow another vehicle, but instead it follows a trajectory that is represented as a list of path points. As part of this design a suitable vehicle model is selected with use of literature. Because this system will be based on the Toyota Prius it was required to find the vehicle model parameters from the actual vehicle. This is done with use of measurements and optimisation. The path following system was split into two control parts, lateral controller for steering and a longitudinal controller for acceleration. These controllers are designed with the aim of real implementation via LabVIEW from National Instruments. Therefore the real-time capabilities are discussed. The control algorithms are selected based on the expected requirements for computational power. After the construction of the path follower system in LabVIEW the performance was tested with use of simulations. The tuning of the controller was investigated and the best performing control parameters were found. Then the system was implemented into the real vehicle and tests were conducted to see the difference between simulation and real world. The results of these tests were then evaluated. The distance error between the vehicle and the path was in the real test within $15.8 cm$. It was proven that the system is able to perform in real-time with a satisfying performance in terms of stability, comfort and trajectory tracking.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC)","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","Apnea of prematurity is one of the most common diagnoses in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Frequent breathing pauses occur in almost all infants born at <28 weeks gestational age or with a birth weight of <1000g and can result in serious brain damage. Medicines are used to suppress the apnea but are not able to eliminate it. Manual tactile stimulation is currently used to terminate apneas that occur despite the preventative treatment. However, the duration of apnea is dependent on the reaction of the nurse. A direct automatic response could significantly shorten the apnea hence reducing hypoxia and bradycardia and reduce the chance of infection due to cross-contamination. In addition, detecting imminent apnea could potentially prevent it. The goal of this graduation project was to find out the best way of preventing and terminating apnea in premature infants by automatic tactile stimulation. During this project three studies were performed. The first study was a literature review. The purpose of this review was to verify what is known about the effects of (automatic) tactile stimulation on the termination and prevention of apnea in preterm infants. This was done by systematically reviewing available literature. The results showed that the effects of touch, oscillation, pulsation and vibration were studied. In conclusion, although the big variations in study design, amount of subject etc., the majority of studies show positive results of tactile stimulation on the termination and prevention of apnea. However, it is not known which receptors are stimulated by specific stimuli and what their neuronal pathways are. Therefore it is currently hard to tell which stimulation mode and stimulation characteristics are most optimal for the termination and/or prevention of AOP. The second study focused on the design of a vibrotactile actuator that was suitable for comparing stimulation with different (stochastic) frequencies. Voice coils, linear resonant actuators and piëzo elements appeared to be most suitable for studies comparing the responses of vibrations with different frequencies. The selection of the right specific actuator is dependent on the frequencies and strokes that it should generate. In the final study the effect of stimulation stroke and stimulation spot on the regularity of breathing (experiment 1) and on the termination of apnea (experiment 2) in preterm rabbits were compared. The results the first experiment show that stochastic vibrations of 490-980Hz applied at the chest cause an increase in the variability of the breathing pattern compared with the same stimulation at the sole of the foot. However, statistical significance was only reaches for low stroke stimulation. The results of the second part of the experiment show that, in contrast with earlier performed studies, the vibratory stimulation does not reinitiate breathing following apnea provoked by hypoxia. This might be caused by the high frequency. However, it seems very likely that apnea caused by severe hypoxia requires more vigorous stimulation. All in all, automatic tactile stimulation seems to be able to improve the current treatment of AOP. However, more research is required to select the most optimal stimulus.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-06-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomedical Engineering","","","",""

DGG’s mission is to lower CO2 impact of historical buildings. Currently, DGG has no structured approach to keep in touch with their customers after delivering their service and experience a loss in contact. DGG wants to build a long term relationship with their customers. In this way, insight in whether their advisory is taken into practice and the perception of sustainable adaptations are gathered. According to research, building a long term relationship improves service quality as well and is therefore interesting for DGG. In this master thesis, the process of making historical buildings sustainable is analysed. The aim is to discover the experiences of customers during the process. The process consists of three phases. The orientation phase, the implementation phase, and the use and maintain phase. Currently, DGG only supports their client’s orientation and implementation phases. The design of the service should support the customer in the use and maintain phase as well with new designed touch points. An internal and external analysis is done to explore the context of DGG. The business market is presented as interesting for DGG. The contacts with municipalities, the knowledge about arranging licences and subsidies and the link with Wubbo Ockels are core strengths of DGG. The current tailored approach and usp’s of DGG are a solid ground for building long term relationship. A multiple case study method is applied to reserch this topic. Four cases are analysed in single case and cross case analyses, where the similarities and di erences are discussed. In the sample, three cases represent the three di erent phases of the process and one case represents a discontinued project in order to analyse all phases equally. An interesting nding is interesting, the fact that the customer and DGG have di erent incentives to start the process of making the building sustainable. The customer starts the process due to failure of installations and DGG starts the process from an environmental perspective. Second, the customers tend to see becoming sustainable as an end result they buy. During the process, this vision might change towards a more ongoing perspective on becoming sustainable, as they get more familiar with the sustainable installations. Finally, a feeling of pride is strongly represented by the customer. A creative session is organised to generate ideas based on the outcomes of the research. The ideas are clustered and four concepts were built. After an evaluating the concepts, a combination of monitoring the end results and appointing expert ambassadors emerged as most interesting. The concept proposes a procedure to incorporate the experience of the customer in the DGG service and makes them feel proud of their sustainable historical building. The new developed touch points are an evaluation survey, that measures the satisfaction of the customer and a phone call after 6-12 months to exchange experiences of using and maintaining the sustainable adaptations. Furthermore, a monumental shield, that enhances the feeling of pride of the customer and an inspiration book of the top 3 most interesting projects are designed. The book communicates examples of sustainable adaptations in practice, to show new clients that becoming sustainable is not as complicated as it seems. During this procedure, a long term relationship is built and the service quality for new customers is improved, due to the increased knowledge gained from the structured approach of evaluating each project.","Sustainable; historical buildings; customer; customer experience; service; long term customer relationship","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Circular Product Design","",""

These conditions are influenced by bathymetry, geometry, climate characteristics, interacting fresh and salt water flows, and mixing effects caused by winds and wind-waves. The interaction between fresh and salt water flows in combination with mixing effects caused by wind and waves give rise to spatial and temporal varying salinity and temperature fields. Gradients in these fields can give rise to density driven circulation. These density driven currents play an important role in sediment circulation and water quality properties of estuaries. This research focuses on density driven circulation patterns in complex estuarine systems, in which San Francisco South Bay (SFSB) presents an interesting and excellent case study. SFSB can be considered as a unique estuarine system that is influenced by both far-field and local fresh water sources during periods of high fresh water inflow. Fresh water inflow from local sources causes a classic estuarine circulation with a lower salinity landward. In contrast, peak fresh water flows from the far-field sources enter SFSB through the same inlet as through which ocean water enters SFSB, which is exceptional in an estuarine system. As a result, SFSB changes in a reverse estuary, which is normally only found in regions where evaporation rates exceed precipitation and fresh water inflow so that the estuary becomes saltier than the ocean. The research objective of this thesis is to understand the circulation pattern and density dynamics in SFSB, caused by spatial and temporal gradients in salinity and temperature. A 3D process-based model, Delft3D FM, is set up in order to simulate the influences of fresh water, tide and wind, referred to as the driving forces, on the density driven circulation in SFSB. Model results showed that the main drivers of estuarine circulation in SFSB are the tide and the frehs water inflow. The influence of the wind on the density driven circulation is negligilbe. Additionally, it is found that the influence of salinity is dominant over the influence of water temperature on the water density in SFSB. During the majority of the year the fresh water inflow is low. As a result, SFSB is well mixed and a classic estuarine circulation can be observed. However, peaks in fresh water from far-field fresh water sources can drive a temporal reverse estuarine circulation in SFSB. The reverse estuarine circulation and stratification are found to be restricted to the main channel of SFSB. In addition, it is found that the amount of fresh water that originates from the far-field fresh water sources determines the extent of which reverse estuarine circulation can be observed in SFSB.","Delft3D FM; San Francisco Bay; hydrodynamics; density driven circulation; estuary","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","37.753, -122.442"

Tractor-trailers are very fuel inefficient making them a good candidate for drag reducing devices to reduce fuel use. In this thesis the focus lies on the base of the trailer, where flaps will be added. The aim is to find the increase in drag reduction when using the optimum asymmetric flap angle per crosswind angle instead of the wind-averaged axisymmetric flap angles. Using the results of steady-state CFD calculations and force measurements in the open jet facility wind tunnel on a scaled and simplified European tractor-trailer model, the optimum asymmetric flap angles can be found and verified. Furthermore, the behaviour of the streamlines over the flaps in all crosswind angles has been tested using oil in the wind tunnel. Although the differences between the baseline drag coefficients found in the wind tunnel and with CFD were quite high, the difference in predicted drag reduction when using flaps was at most 15 drag counts. Furthermore, the behaviour of the streamlines over the flaps was quite alike in both the experimental and numerical analysis. Comparing the drag reduction produced with asymmetric flaps to the drag reduction produced with axisymmetric flaps leads to a minimal decrease in drag.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-03-13","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","The challenge of this project is to explore how Philips Lighting could use Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to create a smart supermarket with safe and healthy food. Literature review and interviews with consumers and retailers revealed a shift in consumer awareness concerning healthy and safe food. An increasing amount of consumers is getting aware of their health and safety and seeks products which avoid negative impact on their health on both the short and the long term. However, each consumer has his own definition of safe and healthy and considers multiple aspects when choosing food. A concern which prevents consumers from eating safe and healthy is the effort it takes. Further, consumers often don’t know whether a certain product is healthy or not. They distrust the industry as food scandals are frequently in the news. This distrust creates a need for clear information. However, retailers still struggle to communicate this information. This calls for a solutions which can support the motivated consumer with trustworthy information to make a choice more easily in line with his individual values. The motivated consumer is a consumer who is conscious about health and/or food safety. The consumer wants to live a healthy life, and eat accordingly but may not always make the right choice. In order to ensure the desirability of the design a co-creation session, interviews and user test with consumers were conducted. A system was designed to provide consumers with personalised information to support them while making choices in the supermarket. By means of a mobile application the consumer is able to make an individual profile. Consumers indicated that the fit of the profile is very important. Therefore, the profile contains the consumer’s nutritional goal but also aspects the consumer would like to avoid (e.g. e-numbers) and values the consumer would like to achieve (e.g. organic food). To enable the consumer to quickly make a choice in the supermarket the application shows a ranking of the products nearby based on the fit with the consumer’s individual values. Using Philips Lightings indoor positioning technology the location of the consumer inside the store can be accurately determined. In combination with the product location, the products nearby the consumer can be determined. Because of this, it is not needed to scan the products; the consumer will automatically see an overview of the products on his mobile phone when walking through the store. In this way the consumer can see at a glance which product fits with his values. Optional, the consumer can click for more detailed information, which will be adjusted to the consumer’s individual values. The distrust in the industry calls for a trustworthy system. In order to make the information more reliable than the current information, the product information will be provided by supermarket stakeholders as well as an independent party. Together with the shopper location and the product location this data is stored in a database platform on which the application can be build. It is expected that in the near future it will be economically beneficial to track products on unique item level. A blockchain database could be used to store this information, this decreases the chance of bribery or tampering with information. This would increase the reliability of the system and open new opportunities for the retailer to save costs. When this gets available the database platform could be enhanced with item level information. The question remains how far Philips Lighting’s role will extend in this system. However, choices will have to be made internal with the company’s long term vision in mind.","Food Values; Internet of Things; Food; Food Safety; Health; Healthy Food; Indoor Positioning; Internet of Food","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2017","River systems are vastly changing environments, not only due to natural process, but also human intervention plays an important role. With the many different river functions at play, large amounts of maintenance budgets are associated with river management. For decision makers it is important to know expected costs or losses and the spread therein to decide on mitigating measures. Therefore a risk assessment for morphodynamic behaviour is needed. In this study a risk assessment for navigation is made relating uncertainty in discharge to economic consequences. Using MCS the uncertainty in discharge is propagated to a morphodynamic model of the Rhine: the Delft3D DVR model. The importance of including uncertainty in morphodynamic behaviour was proven since the bed level change in 15 years showed a 90 percent confidence interval of up to 1.2 meter. The water depths resulting from the model simulations is translated to a price increase using the load factor. An estimate for the welfare loss is given by the change in economic surplus (the benefits of a transaction). The expected yearly costs in 15 years amounts to 811 million euros with a skewed distribution. A case study applying nourishments on the IJssel, Boven-Rijn and Waal was compared with the reference case. This resulted in an expected benefit of 1.4 million euro, however the 5th percentile that a loss is well within the possibilities: -9.8 million euro, therefore again the importance of inclusion of uncertainties is proven. It is expected that the benefits are larger if other river functions are included in the study. Therefore, it is recommended that in future studies other river functions such as flood safety, cables and pipelines and environment and recreation are taken into account. It is also recommended that the supply and demand of inland water transport on either market or single trip scale is further investigated. Finally, it is also recommended that the definition of welfare loss for different stakeholders is further investigated and an estimate for the indirect costs is made to assess whether they should be included in the method.","uncertainty; risk; Morphology; Morphodynamics; Rhine; navigation; inland water transport; nourishment; dredging; Delft3D; DVR","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","hydraulic engineering","","","",""

For treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI), a range of motion (ROM) simulation is used, based on collision detection on segmented CT or MRI-data. Imaging data of the femur is often incomplete, due to the fact that radiologists want to minimize radiation dose and scanning time. The lack of data negatively influences the range of motion simulation. In this research we present a statistical shape model (SSM) based point set registration method that is able to accurately register to incomplete femur data. It is based on an iterative schema that minimizes the squared distance between the target data and the modes of variation in the SSM. We introduce a weighting vector that is derived from point density in the target data to force each point to equally contribute to the final solution. This greatly improved registration performance in the distal femur region. Furthermore, we introduced an iteratively increasing amount of modes of variation in the solving approach. This lead to faster convergence while achieving more accurate registration. The implemented method outperforms current state-of-the-art registration algorithms.","non-rigid registration; statistical shape models; partial data; femur","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","ImPhys/Quantitative Imaging","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Bocken, N.M.P. (mentor); Holtrop, M. (mentor)","2017","The growth of competitors in the consumer-to-consumer market pressures PostNL - a Dutch mail, parcel and e-commerce corporation – to develop new ways to ensure their market share. Nowadays, PostNL is responsible for the delivery of almost 156 million parcels per year. The consumer-to-consumer (C2C) market consists of almost 5 million consumers who send parcels to each other via online trading platforms. In order to escape the pricing competition, PostNL needs to differentiate their offering by adding value to the service. The challenge for PostNL is to retain market share in the C2C market. This thesis develops a product-service system that anticipates on the specific needs of consumers who send parcels in the C2C market and contributes to realise a sustainable revenue and to retain market share for PostNL. A product-service system is defined as “a consisting of tangible products and intangible services designed to fulfil specific consumer needs”. After thorough analyses, still little is known about the needs and wishes of trading consumers regarding franking, packing and dropping parcels. Therefore, consumer research is conducted, consisting of a qualitative and quantitative part. The goal of the qualitative research is to discover the needs, experiences and expectations of trading consumers. This is achieved by using semi-structured interviews. The quantitative research validates and quantifies the gained insights, conducted by means of a questionnaire. The results contribute to defining a direction for the project. The most important finding of the consumer research is that 89% of the trading consumers collect and reuse packing material received from Internet purchases. Trading consumers are price-driven and find it easy and sustainable to reuse materials which are already available. Additionally, 39% of the trading consumers wants to frank online, but the online migration targets are set on 18%. Trading consumers who do use online franking believe it is easy-to-use. In addition, 75% of the trading consumers aim to increase the credibility to the receiver by dropping the parcel as fast as possible. Since consumers in the C2C market trade individual products, the protection of traded products in order to avoid damaged parcels is of great desire (70%). Following the analyses and consumer research, the design goal is established. The goal is to bind and retain trading consumers to PostNL by providing a costless and easy-to-use service. This is achieved through facilitating the reuse of packing material to ensure a reliable delivery for all traded products. Two creative sessions are done to generate ideas, which are later translated into four concepts. These concepts are evaluated with various employees of PostNL and with trading consumers. A combination of two concepts is chosen to develop a valuable product-service system for PostNL. The designed product-service system is a reusable bag, made from leftover PostNL raincoats, protecting the products inside the parcel. It enables trading consumers to fully prepare the parcel at home. The reusable bag is sealed with a sticker that contains a barcode. With a mobile phone, the barcode is scanned and the address of the receiver is added. Ideally, the parcel should be dropped at a parcel/post automat or a self-service desk. According to evaluations with trading consumers, the product-service system is perceived as easy-to-use and protective towards the products inside. The product-service system will first be distributed via known trading consumers. At the same time, PostNL will contract business clients to pack certain products with the reusable bag. This way, trading consumers will receive the products of the product-service system in a natural manner. To be able to develop the product-service system, an internal product owner needs to be identified and external campaigns should focus on stimulating trading consumers to send parcels with PostNL. The designed product-service system anticipates on the specific needs of consumers who send parcels in the C2C market and provides a sustainable revenue and market share for PostNL. It is a viable project for PostNL, because of the revenue gained by extra sales and the establishment of business contracts. The product-service system adds to reaching the long-term goals of PostNL, such as migrating consumers to online solutions and creating a sustainable impact and image for PostNL. Distributing the product-service system among trading consumers increases the awareness of online franking and results in an increase of the market share for PostNL.","Parcel delivery; PostNL; C2C market; consumer-to-consumer market; Reuse; Packaging; Packing material; Trading consumer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovatie Management","","Strategic Product Design","",""

Slogans like ‘Smaller, Cheaper, Faster’ or ‘Do More with Less’ are easy to encounter in the proposed concepts of Space Missions with SOKS, as well as statements like ‘Think Big, Fly Small’ and ‘The next big thing in Space is something small’. However, the expectations are only based on these concepts and are in contrast with the reality, which show a limited record of launches. What would the expectations be, based on Space Missions with SOKS from the past? Would they foresee the same bright future or would they state the opposite? The search for a scientific motivation of these expectations resulted in the first complete overview of Space Missions with SOKS that were launched in the past. This thesis provides a journey through time from the controversial West Ford Needles, at the start of the Space Age, to beyond the first crowd funded Space Mission known as KickSat 1. It also resulted in a unique dataset of Space Missions with SOKS. The analysis thereof provided new insights with a clear outcome. A selection of these graphical representation is presented and discussed in this report.

This report describes the research on developing a structured selection methodology to compare benefits between different strategies on removing or maintaining redundant topside equipment, while taking the installation end of design life into consideration. The selection methodology is applicable in an early project phase and structured by three consecutive steps through which the 'no removal' and three different 'removal' execution strategies are analyzed and compared. This comparison is based on the work scope corresponding fabric maintenance and deconstruction activities. To enable the comparative assessment a costs, risks and scheduling profile per strategy is created by their corresponding execution related activities. The differences between the execution strategies are defined by the amount of deconstruction related man hours, using the platform deconstruction capacities or support by a lifting vessel and the reduction in fabric maintenance work scope. A 'removal' execution strategy is optimized based on approaching the removal on an opportunity basis. The selection methodology is applied to a case study to evaluate its capability to select and support an execution strategy to be used as a basis for minimizing the operational expenditure relating to maintaining or removing the redundant work scope. From the case study application, it is found that the methodology is capable to select and support an execution strategy suitable for the specific redundant work scope and correlates with the early phase project application. Further research on including a case-by-case strategy optimization and other affected operational expenditure contributing systems is recommended.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-03-10","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Offshore & Dredging Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Lagendijk, P. (mentor); Robbemont, A. (mentor); Everts, H.J. (mentor)","2017","In Rotterdam underneath the first load bearing sand layer is a layer of compressible soil, called the ""Kedichem"" layer. Under this layer of compresible soil is another load bearing sand layer located, at approximately -50m NAP, but most of the buildings in Rotterdam are foundated on the first loadbearing sand layer at approximately -23m NAP. Due to this most buildings undergo differential settlements caused by deformations in the Kedichem layer. This differential settlements causes an increase of internal forces in the structure. Highrise buildings are causing higher deformations in the Kedichem layer because a highrise building has a large weight on a relative small area. This thesis is a research of the behaviour of a highrise building on compressible soil. The main research question is: Can a structure be modified to reduce the differential settlements. As a case study the Cooltower will be used. The height of the building is 102m, and the floorplan is 29x29m. The structure of the building is modeled in the structural software Scia Egineer. The differential settlements caused by the deformations in the Kedichem layer are introduced in the structural model by forces on a stiff spring element. The deformations in the Kedichem layer are calculated by using a soil settlement program, called D-settlement. Due to the deformations in the Kedichem layer the force flow in the structure will change. The force flow describes how the forces in the structure are distributed to the foundation. To calculate the final force flow it is needed to perform some iterations between the soil settlement software and the structural computer program To answer the research question there are 2D calculations made to investigate the influence of the connections between the precast elements on the differential settlements. Also the influence of the openings in the structure on the differential settlements is investigated in this part. After this step there are 3D calculations made of the Cooltower. In this part the interaction between core and facade is studied. In this part it is tried to reduce the differential settlements in the facade by adjusting the stiffness of the facade, and it is investigated in which way the differential settlements between the core and the facade can be reduced. The main conclusion of this thesis is that it is difficult to create a general conclusion for the differential settlements due to the many factors that influence the differential settlements in the structure. Most of the researched topics in this thesis don't influence the differential settlements that much. The stiffness of the facade influences the behavior of the Cooltower on compressible soil the most. By making the facade twice as stiff, the differential settlements will be reduced by 37% on average. The conclusion is only valid for the Cooltower. For the Cooltower the extra normal forces in the columns of the facade due to the differential settlement can be estimated to be 15% of the forces in the structure due to the permanent and the variable load. In preliminary design phase the structure can be designed with a unity check of 0,85.","high-rise; soil-structure interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural and Building Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2017","When modelling fluid fl ow in subsurface, the impact of solid deformation on fluid fl ow is often oversimplified/neglected in reservoir simulators. It is assumed that solid volume/s-tate of stress is a function of fluid pressure, while the opposite effect is not considered. This assumption is made mainly to reduce computational costs and complexity of fl uid flow models. Nevertheless, this simplification is not valid in case of unconsolidated rocks. This oversimplification results in wrong estimation in prediction of surface subsidence, earthquakes and fault activation, fluid production and rock permeability values, etc. Numerous reports suggest that neglecting the two-way coupling (i.e. both fluid-to-solid and solid-to- fluid coupling ) has led to disastrous events in many cases. This necessitates modified fl uid models and simulators which take into account the two-way coupled nature of solid deformation and fl uid flow in porous media. Efforts have been made to model this two-way coupled nature properly which can be categorized as follows. There have been attempts to connect commercial softwares to model this problem. They fail due to differences in data structure, different underlying assumptions embedded and due to the increased computational costs. Therefore, it is essential to integrate fluid modelling and solid deformation into a single simulator. This requires developing new numerical models. Presuming an elastic nature for unconsolidated rocks, Biot's consolidation equations are employed to numerically model the two-way coupled solid deformation and fluid fl ow in porous media, so called poroelasticity. During my master work, I developed 2D MATLAB codes based on two different finite volume discretization schemes (cell-centred and vertex-centred FVM). In the first stage, two cell-centred FVM 2D MATLAB codes were developed: One to model fluid flow, and one to model solid equations in poroelasticity. At the next stage, the two cell centred codes were iteratively coupled. Then, another 2D fully coupled model based on a vertex-centred finite volume discretization scheme was developed for poroelasticity. The fl uid and solid data structure in both developed models are the same; in other words, unknowns are collocated. To verify and conduct error analysis on the developed finite volume based simulators, 2D MATLAB codes for one classic benchmark problem in poroelasticity, namely the Mandel problem, as well as 2D MATLAB codes for synthetic test cases were developed. At the next stage, the performance of the two models is compared. Though both methods illustrate adequate performance, fully coupled finite volume method is preferred. Finally, the reaction of the fully coupled finite volume model to different systems, its performance under stress and displacement boundary condition configuration, sensitivity of the model to uncertainty of input parameters, robustness of the model, and applications of this method are being analysed. Furthermore, thorough discussion on enhancement of the model is provided. To our knowledge, it is for the first time that a cell-centred finite volume scheme is applied to poroelastic problems and is compared with the vertex-centred finite volume method. In addition, there is no prior investigation done of robustness for finite volume methods. The results showed that both cell-centred and vertex-centred FVM are computationally efficient in applications for poroelastic problems. However, the fully coupled vertex-centred finite volume model outperformed the sequentially coupled cell-centred model in terms of computational efficiency.","finite volume method; fully coupled; sequentially coupled; poroelasticity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering and Geosciences","",""

(mentor); Schrijer, F.F.J. (mentor); van Gent, P.L. (mentor)","2017","The importance of reliable and efficient launch vehicles pervades the many industries which rely on space based hardware. An experimental investigation has been performed into the effects of nozzle length and exhaust plume presence on a FESTIP axisymmetric base flow at Mach 0.7. Three different nozzle lengths (L/D = 0.6, 1.2, 1.8) were tested to account for the effects of fluidic, hybrid, and solid reattachment of the shear layer. Additionally, an underexpanded exhaust plume (NPR = 100) was simulated using compressed air driven through the model. Tomographic PIV was used in combination with a momentum based pressure reconstruction technique to study the effect on the mean pressure coefficient. This approach was validated using a similar, sting mounted model equipped with pressure transducers. Excellent agreement within 10% (less than 0.02 Cp) is found between the transducers and the PIV derived wall pressure value. Performance of the technique is found to largely rely on the in-plane, both streamwise and radial, Reynolds stress terms. For this reason, it is concluded that the pressure reconstruction technique would perform similarly well using a simpler, planar PIV arrangement. Statistically, the hybrid nozzle length with exhaust plume was the least stable and for the fluidic reattachment case, the exhaust presence had a stabilizing effect. Only in cases of fluidic reattachment does the exhaust plume affect the mean pressure field; this is attributed to a `jet-suction’ effect, which imparts a consistent decrease in wall Cp. It is recommended that future researchers also image the near-wake as this may show additional instabilities affected by an exhaust plume.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & Propulsion","","Aerodynamics","",""

(mentor)","2017","Additional thesis - The exchange and transport of sediment between intertidal zone and backshore are subject of ongoing research in order to assess the dynamic behaviour of sandy coastal systems. How the sediment moves in the coastal system is relevant knowledge for e.g. the Dutch coastal nourishment programme. It is a scientific challenge to describe and predict the transport of sediment. There is recent progress in describing the aeolian transport. De Vries et al (2014a) gives a new model approach for describing aeolian sediment transport in supply limited situations. The state of the art AeoLiS model covers the aeolian domain only and is not capable of describing the exchange between the shore face and the intertidal zone (de Vries, personal communication 2016). The aim of this additional graduation work is to assess the effect of variability in topography and grain size distribution on aeolian processes in the intertidal zone. It is hypothesised that there is a measurable daily variability of the topography and grain size distribution along the cross shore profile and that these factors have a significant effect on aeolian transport. Detailed measurements of the intertidal zone are needed to describe the topographic change of the intertidal zone and the variability in grain size distribution. From 11 till 15 October 2016 fieldwork was done at the intertidal zone near Kijkduin. With use of a laser scanner the daily topographical changes were monitored. Sediment samples were taken along the beach profile to assess the variability in grain size distribution. The gathered laser scan data was processed and a variability in topography was measured. The sediment samples were sieved in the lab to find the mean grain size, d50 per sample. A variability in d50 was measured along the profile. The influence of the variability in topography and grain size distribution on the aeolian sediment transport on a daily scale, is assessed using the AeoLiS model. The results of the simulations show that the measured variability in topography does not has a significant influence on the predicted aeolian transport. The influence of the variability in grain size distribution is illustrated with 3 sediment samples (with increasing d50 values). The sample with the smallest d50 gave surprising low results for the predicted aeolian transport. It appeared that this sample had a significantly higher fraction of coarse sediment (small pebbles/shell fractions) compared to the other samples. This was considered an outlier. After removing the outlier from the sample, the aeolian transport increased. Now, the results show that the predicted aeolian transport decreases with increasing grain sizes. The removing of the outlier shows the potential of armouring; a small fraction of coarser material in the bed can have a significant effect on the aeolian transport.","","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Yarovoy, A. (mentor)","2017","During this thesis research an attempt is made to introduce a computational lightweight horizontal wind retrieval method applied on scanning Doppler radar velocity data. Horizontal wind parameters are the wind speed and wind direction. If know they are known in a vertical extend, they form a wind profile. In a typical approach, horizontal wind parameters can be obtained through a least squares fit of the measured Doppler radar velocity data. As the least squares fit can be computational costly the discrete Fourier transformation (DFT) is tested in this study. A new method called the Fast Fourier Wind Vector Algorithm or FFWVA is proposed for horizontal wind field determination. The proposed FFWVA method is based on the Velocity Azimuth Display or VAD. The VAD is a frequency based analysis method mentioned by Doviak and Zrnic. Tests are performed with wind field simulations that have multiple wind layers. These multiple wind layers are common in local weather hazards like vertical wind shears, microbursts and whirlwinds. The tests include validation with wind fields as described in the Doppler velocity interpretation guide of Brown and Wood. Apart from ideal simulations other cases with noise and gaps in the azimuthal scanned velocity data are tested. The results of an ideal simulation show that the horizontal wind field parameters are determined with negligible error. However, in cases with random gaps in the data or with less than 50% data the FFWVA shows significant errors. The FFWVA wind determination works when the data input is done following a specified manner: either with an even spread of gaps or with exact 50% data available","horizontal wind determination; radar; Doppler; VAD; Velocity Azimuth Display; Frequency based Analysis; Discreet Fourier Transform; Fast Fourier Transform; Multi-layered wind profile","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","The demand for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) has increased rapidly over the last 30 years. LNG is Natural Gas (NG) that is cooled down until it becomes liquid. LNG is easier to transport over long than NG distances and also in larger quantities. Before the LNG can be used it is made gaseous again, for example at an LNG receiving terminal. In this thesis we create multiple Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs) to solve the problem of creating an Annual Delivery Plan (ADP) for an LNG receiving terminal. An ADP describes the times vessels should arrive at the terminal and when this LNG will be gasified and send-out to the network. We proof this problem is NP-Complete. First we create three MILPs that can solve for terminals with a single client. We have a discrete time formulation, a formulation that makes use of piecewise linear functions and an event based approach. Experimentation learns us the discrete time and event based formulations are solved the fastest. We then expand the discrete client formulation to work for multiple clients and also adjust this for- mulation to work with a rolling horizon approach, which gives up some optimality in return for solving speed. From experimentation and evaluation using a simulation model we learn that the rolling horizon approach is comparable with an heuristic algorithm currently used in practice. While the heuristic is a little faster our solution shows potential to improve the found solutions.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2018-03-08","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Computer Science","IN5000",""

Computer aided engineering (CAE) is one possibility to achieve these reductions and becomes an inevitable tool in the development process. However, CAE does not provide the subjective evaluation, which still have to be conducted. In the development of the thermal comfort of open cabriolets, the subjective evaluation is dependent on expensive experimental methods and can only be conducted in a late phase of the development process, at which freedom of decision is low. Especially the thermal comfort in open cabriolets is very challenging as the passengers are surrounded by a turbulent flow field, exposing the passengers to velocities up to 40% of the driving speed. This leaves room for optimization, which is why the idea of a flow mock-up is investigated. The procedure of a flow mock-up is a combination of digital development and physical simulation. A flow mock-up should simulate the flow field inside a passenger compartment of an open cabriolet from the results obtained from CFD simulations. The research objective is to concretise the idea of a flow mock-up by identifying the requirements a flow mock-up has to fulfil in order to be advantageous for the development process as well as to be able to replicate the flow field of an open cabriolet. This is done by analysing the actual development process and proposing a modified development process, which includes the use of a flow mock-up. Furthermore, the characteristic factors, which influence the human perception while driving an open cabriolet, are identified from researches found in literature and analysis of measurement data. Finally, to investigate the technical practicability of a flow mock-up, a preliminary CFD investigation is conducted to investigate the possibility of replicating the flow field, which is present inside the passenger compartment of an open cabriolet. The flow field simulation should be replicated in a closed space and without the dependency on the vehicle geometry.","CFD; Cabriolet; Thermal Comfort; Simulator; Flow Mock-Up; Program StarCCM+","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-12-31","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & Propulsion","","","",""

To be part of this elite establishment one must have a minimal net worth equal to or exceeding 30 million US$ and be the owner of a yacht longer than 25 meters from bow to stern. The individuals who are part of this group have the financial means and are motivated to make everything in their surroundings adapt to their specific taste. A yacht is one of the ultimate must haves for the so called Ultra High Net Worth individuals (UHNWi’s). The general rule for these yachts is the bigger the better, going from super yachts towards mega yachts.These humongous billionaire playthings come with an upkeep cost that can bankrupt small countries within a year. But when one has virtually unlimited financial resources and a passion for impressing their surroundings this is an investment worth while. The Netherlands is one of the largerst caterers to the wishes of this elite club with 17% of the world’s superyachts being produced in shipyards in the Netherlands. Diana Yacht Design is part of this Dutch superyacht industry. They design and help in the development of superyachts, build throughout the Netherlands but also abroad. Diana was looking for a (graduation) project to use as press release material to harvest some attention from this elite club of UHNWi’s. There is where this project comes in. In this report the reader will be taken to the year 2030 and dive deep into the yachting context. With the use of the Vision in Product design method (Hekkert and van Dijk.,2014) the context of yachting by UHNWi’s in 2030 could be constructed. Within this future context a desired behaviour towards yachting was chosen to design for. This resulted in a mission statement aiming for a yacht as a platform for progress in 2030. From this mission statement the concept yacht for 2030 was designed. This resulted in the Nomad concept yacht. The Nomad originates from the ‘living the location independent lifestyle’. This means that this yacht is designed to feature as a home away from home for the full duration of the year in contrast with the current use of superyachts that lasts a maximum of one month at a time. With all the necessities on board ranging from a laboratory to a beach club ,to a Helipad, and quadcopter parking space. This yacht with a relative small length of 45 meters can support a family of 4 and up to 6 guests in ultimate luxury. The Nomad makes use of a diesel-electric hybrid propulsion system. The electric energy is stored in flow cell batteries containing positive and negative electrically charged fluids. These fluids can fully be charged and discharged over 2000 times without losing any potential in contrast to lithium-ion batteries. Furthermore, when in need of a fast recharge the discharged fluids can be replaced with freshly charged fluids, in a similar fashion to filling up with diesel. To regain some energy ,while on the move or away from the harbour, the Nomad has several energy producing systems onboard. By using wind, solar and wave power generators the yacht can regain 70% of the daily needed electrical energy onboard the yacht.","Superyacht design; Vision in Design ViP; Conceptual design; Maritime Engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design / Human Information Communication Design","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Lourens, E. (mentor)","2017","In order to accurately predict passing vessel interaction forces, different simulation tools have been developed over the years. Many of these are based on a double body flow approach. MARIN (a hydrodynamic research institute located in the Netherlands) developed a simulation tool called the FlowInteraction (FI) module, which is part of the modular hydrodynamic simulation tool aNySIM. This module is based on double body flow theory – new is that it takes bodymotions into account in the force interaction. This is done by solving the equations of motion at every time step. The FImodule has been verified and validated during this research. An assessment was made of whether the physics in the FI module has been implemented correctly. To do this, verification and validation case studies have been done. The verification case studies have been evaluated based on expectations from the implemented physics and mathematics. Unexplainable results suggesting an incorrect implementation have been analyzed and used to draw conclusions. As validation material, a set of results from model tests done during the ROPES joint industry project has been used. When the added mass force is neglected (as it is in the FI module) during a single body heave oscillation, cushion forces are dominant. This leads to a positive netmean force, which does not correspond with reality. Therefore, in order to simulate realistic behaviour, the added mass force should be included. Some numerical and discretization errors, due to the additional functionality of taking the body motions into account, are recognized. Based on these findings, recommendations on how to solve these problems are made. It has been concluded that a double body flow model, as implemented in the FI module, only provides good force estimations when the added mass force is implemented. The usability is currently restricted to the simulation of captive ships; radiation forces can then be neglected without consequence. The FI module enables a fast hydrodynamic time domain simulation taking the influence of body motions on the interaction forces into account.","Double body flow; Passing vessel interaction; Hydrodynamics; Panel methods; aNySIM XMF","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Offshore & Dredging Engineering","OE54030",""

In order to allow access for multiple (new) heat producers and fair competition a suitable market design is required. An agent-based model of a competitive market design is created to explore how multiple heat producers and greenhouse owners (as consumers) will behave, learn and adapt in open district heating networks. Results shows that in an open district heating network with insufficient supply and elastic demand, strategic behaviour of greenhouse owners prevents producers from exercising their market power and the ability to drive market prices up. However, this behaviour is only possible in theory since in an actual district heating network, producers will respond aggressively on strategic behaviour of greenhouse owners to prevent them to influence losses in profits for producers.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering Systems and Services","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management","",""

(mentor)","2017","Gas flow in fractured nano-porous shale formations is complicated by a hierarchy of structural features, ranging from nanopores to microseismic and hydraulic fractures, and by several transport mechanisms that differ from standard viscous flow used in reservoir modelling. In small pores, self-diffusion becomes more important than advection, also slippage effect and Knudsen diffusion becomes relevant at this scale. The characteristics and properties of the fracture networks plays a major role in the performance of shale gas reservoirs, therefore the use of accurate simulation technique that honor the complexity of these reservoirs and capture the associated dynamics of nanopores is strongly required. However, these accurate simulations often necessitate a large amount of computations for field scale models and therefore require upscaling. Yet the upscalling techniques generally in use are based on idealizations that do not reflect the discrete features of the reservoir. In this work, we first incorporate the formulations of a statistical bundle of dual tube model to describe the dynamics of shale gas into a discrete fracture model. The formulation of the DFM model we use applies an unstructured control volume finite difference approach with a two point flux approximation. We then propose to upscale these detailed descriptions using two different techniques, with the major difference in their coarse grid geometry. The first approach, referred to as EDFM upscaling, relies on a structured Cartesian coarse grid. While the second method, which we call the multiple subregion (MSR) upscaling, introduces a flow based coarse grid to replicate the diffusive character of the pressure in the matrix. The required parameters for the coarse scale model in both methods and the geometry of the subregions in the second method are determined efficiently from global single-phase flow solution using the underlying discrete fracture model. The methods are applied to simulate single-phase gas flow in 2D fractured reservoir models, and are shown to provide results in close agreement with the underlying DFM and with considerable reduction in the computational time. We notice that in order to account for the prevailing transient effects in low permeability shale, the upscaled transmissibility need to be related to pressure for better results. Finally, we consider the EDFM upscaling we propose as an easier approach in its implementation, while the MSR technique as a more accurate method.","Reservoir Simulation; Shale Gas; Upscaling; Fractures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","A high percentage of hospital admissions is due to surgical interventions. The operating theatre, which holds the operating rooms (ORs), is therefore one of the key resources in hospitals. Managing the operating theatre and finding an optimal OR schedule is complex due to the many factors that influence it. Scheduling a surgery in an OR influences downstream facilities like the post anaesthesia care unit, intensive care unit and general patient wards. This research was conducted at Leiden University Medical Centre (LUMC), an academic teaching hospital in Leiden, the Netherlands. During the week, the LUMC experiences a large variation in bed occupancy at the patient wards due to the way surgeries are scheduled. The large variation in bed occupancy causes surgeries to be cancelled, because there are no beds available at the ward. Because the OR theatre is such an expensive resource, we want to find a schedule that utilises the OR optimally during opening times. In this research, we develop a clustering method to cluster surgical procedures into surgery groups based on surgery duration and the length of stay. Then, we extend a model that analytically determines the patient distributions over the wards and intensive care for a given OR schedule. We define a mixed integer programming model with the objective to maximise the OR utilisation and minimise the variation in bed occupancy at the wards and intensive care. The model produces an OR schedule with the defined surgery groups assigned to days in the OR. We use two different methods to solve the model: a global approach and a local search heuristic, i.e., simulated annealing. The model has one nonlinear constraint and a complex objective function. Therefore, we linearise the constraint and the objective function, which results in a mixed integer linear program that is proven to be 𝑁𝑃-hard. Both approaches are tested on a dataset provided by the LUMC. Furthermore, several scenarios are evaluated. We conclude that the mixed integer linear programming method performs better and faster than the simulated annealing procedure. To obtain an even better solution it is possible to use a combination of both. By using this method, the OR utilisation of the LUMC can improve by 11% and the variation in bed occupancy can be decreased by 80%.","master surgery schedule; Operating room scheduling; bed occupancy; mixed integer linear programming; simulated annealing; length of stay; optimization; hospital","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied Mathematics","","","",""

For the Netherlands, a reduction of 80% implies that a limited amount of 30 Mton CO2 per annum may be emitted in 2050. Such a reduction could especially affect the Dutch refining industry as it is a large emitter of CO2 with a total of 11 Mton of CO2 in 2015. Assuming that the CO2 budget of the Dutch refining industry also decreases, investments are required that in alternatives that reduce CO2 emissions. However, due to increasing competition, decreasing European oil demand and thin refining margins these investments cannot be taken for granted. The main research goal of this master thesis is to “To explore the Dutch refining industry, determine the different factors that contribute to their CO2 emissions and assess which CO2 reducing alternatives are the most promising”. The Dutch refining industry contains 6 refineries of which 5 are located in the port of Rotterdam. Allocating CO2 emissions to individual processes shows that the atmospheric distillation unit is most cases the largest emitter of CO2. Other polluting processes are the FCC unit, hydrocracker and flexicoker. Besides the effect of the refining processes, the CO2 emissions of Dutch refineries are also influenced by their crude oil intake. CO2 emissions increase if crude oil has a lower API gravity (heavy) and a high sulphur content (sour). A wide variety of CO2 reducing options is identified within this master thesis which are assessed by an extended Technology Assessment that incorporates economical and institutional perspectives. In the end, a multi-criteria analysis, that includes the perspectives of multiple actors, is used to identify the most promising CO2 reducing alternatives. It can be concluded that heat exchange, optimisation of the distillation unit, processing lighter and sweeter types of crude oil and CCU are the most promising CO2 reducing alternatives.","The Dutch refining industry; CO2 allocation; CO2 reducing alternatives; Technology Assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management (SEPAM)","","Energy and Industry","",""

(mentor); Beekman, A.Q. (mentor)","2017","Healthcare processes will need to transform Healthcare is an ever-changing domain in which the care process of today are already facing difficulties to meet existing demands. It can be foreseen that in 2030 our ageing population will cause healthcare costs to increase, while there will be a shortfall of medical personnel. Emergency departments will get more overcrowded with patients. Amongst others these factors will force healthcare institutions to rethink their processes and services to maintain optimal care outcomes. A visionary and human-centric approach is taken to design for meaningful experiences and interactions in a future emergency care context. Stepwise information exchange in separate databases hinder communication flow Emergency care teams are used to a stepwise workflow of handing the patient from care giver to care giver along the service chain. Thereby multiple points of interpretations and communication of the situation happen verbally. While fast assessment and decisions are indeed required to perform efficient emergency care, this information flow can lead to misunderstandings, data loss or require extra time and effort for information exchange or reporting. Pro-active patient behaviour Furthermore, we see the patients’ behaviour shifting to being more pro-active, as people develop an awareness of their health and lifestyle, have free access to (online) medical education and self-tracking devices – all of which will empower them to have conversations on eye-level with their care givers. In emergency incidents this new behaviour and mindset will cause people to have difficulties giving over control to care givers. Another aspect of this pro-activeness is that healthy people will act preventively to keep an optimal condition, while people with chronic diseases will build long-term relations to multiple interconnected care institutions. Emergency incidents will be embedded in this care continuum. Patients will also seek more social connection to their relatives during an hospital stay. Besides they will show an increasing need to understand care processes in order to accept their situation and show respect to others. Linking personal and professional healthcare in dialogs The concept of MED Dialog is proposed in this project. It suggests that care organisations acknowledge patients’ control of their own health profile and use it to bridge the gap between personal and professional healthcare. MED Dialog is an information platform that is used by emergency care givers to seamlessly cooperate and communicate around a patient to ensure a tailored care quality and trustworthy patient experience. This contributes to transforming the admission process from being an extra burden to helping get to know patients at a glance. MED Dialog is also a tool to facilitate reassuring and transparent conversations between patients and nurses. Facilitating a seamless dialog between teams of care givers and their patients MED Dialog helps patients to be prepared for any incident and contribute to the emergency care chain: They create a health profile and continuously overview their care history and plan. In emergency incidents people give over the control to professional care givers, by making their health profile accessible via a finger print identification – providing deep insights for paramedics and physicians when knowledge and minutes matter. Patients will feel like they are well understood as individuals and can receive consistent care. Enabling efficient and rich knowledge exchange between care givers around a patient MED Dialog provides each care giver with relevant background information he/she needs to know. For instance, it can reveal high priority medical facts about a patient (like a medication and allergy list) which contributes to the paramedics’ decision of which first aid to give and where to bring a patient to. MED Dialog helps paramedics in briefing the ED team by integrating a pre-announcement feature via an app and during the patient handover. This is facilitating interdisciplinary cooperation, saving time that can be spent with the patient. The ED team can benefit from pre-arrival communication – accurate vital signs trends, a more elaborate and verified handover and can involve external experts or the general practitioner more directly. Improving efficiency and lowering healthcare costs Besides enhancing the patient experience and care givers’ workflow, the implementation of MED Dialog can improve efficiency and lower costs: Because internal and external communication is simplified, the labour for admission and reporting can be reduced. For instance, less lab tests/scans will be needed if there is access to existing, relevant patient files, preventing over diagnosis. Increasing the quality of emergency care MED Dialog leads to better diagnoses and decisions, less misinterpretation or data loss and it reduces the risk of harmful interdependencies of medication. Its monitoring features can help forecasting incidents as well as smoothing the transition to home recovery. Increasing trust among care teams In the performed user research it was found that the ED personnel verifies information presented verbally by the paramedics, due to a healthy mistrust. Good communication was identified as the essential factor to high quality emergency care. MED Dialog can help eliminating unnecessary safety checks and make communication more seamless, verified and therefore more trustworthy. It was found that visual data support can better inform and calm down patient handovers, while also speeding up reporting. Integrating technologies into existing care practices User research insights also reveal the importance of embedding new products and technologies into established work routines. Therefore MED Dialog lets care givers focus on executing care by integrating its features into existing interactions like patient assessment and paramedics’ handover in the emergency department. Furthermore, MED Dialog is not directly used by patients, thereby it lets care givers take the control in dialogs. Keeping patients’ contacts in the loop During treatments patients will be supported by MED Dialog to reach out to their relatives or work contacts. This will make patients feel socially connected, reassured and eventually increase compliance to a treatment. Helping patients reflect and recover After a visit to the emergency department, all treatment data will be logged in the profile and people will better understand what happened and regain control for their future plans, because MED Dialog’s monitoring features support people in their recovery process and transition to home care.","Design for healthcare; Vision in product design; Design for Interaction; Patient experience; E-Health","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design / Design Aesthetics","","Design for Interaction (DfI)","",""

(mentor); Minnoye, A.L.M. (mentor)","2017","Grammer is a manufacturer of, amongst others, seating systems for trucks and off-road vehicles (agricultural, construction, and material moving). Their most advanced products may offer up to 15 adjustable features to accommodate every user optimally. At the present, these features are controlled by a mixture of mechanical, pneumatic and electronic sub-systems. Therefore, a coherent fully-electrical system was requested, with a strong focus on product usability. An online user survey exposed two underlying problems. There are too many different controls, this could confuse the users and result in negligence. Furthermore, the users lack knowledge on what seat settings are appropriate in which situations, resulting in them not adjusting the seat when needed. The eSAI (Electronic Seat Adjustment Interface) concept was developed, battling these problems. It consists of four main elements: (1) a centralized controller knob, functioning as the sole controller for the entire system; (2) a graphical user interface (GUI), naturally mapped to the knob’s interactions and without complex menu-layers; (3) haptic feedback actuators along the seat, allowing the driver to keep his eyes on the road and; (4) posture guidance, notifying the user when adjustments could be made for improved comfort. Evaluation with truck drivers decisively showed they judged the concept design as more effective, fluent and satisfactory in achieving its goals than the current system. In conclusion, the eSAI offers increased usability, allowing the users to intuitively adjust their seats when required, and provides guidance for achieving a potentially more appropriate posture.","design; evaluation; usability; seat; adjustment; system; truck; agriculture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2017","On one hand, welded hulls of aluminium high speed craft are found to have a decreased displacement. On the other hand, ship stability is determined based on an inclination test and the design lines plan. The combination of reduced displacement, results of an inclination test and the design lines plan reduce the stability. This reduction is undesired and should be controlled during hull construction. The following research question was formulated in order to allow this control: How does the construction process of high speed craft effect displacement of aluminium hulls? The literature study has confirmed that welding produces relatively large deformations of thin aluminium panels. These deformations can be split into out-of-plane and in-plane deformation. Out of plane deformations are caused by asymmetric shrinkage of a weld with respect to the middle of the plate in the thickness direction. In-plane deformations result from in-plane shrinkage of a weld and surrounding material. Both types of deformations contribute to transverse and lengthwise reduction of plate dimensions. A little has been found on quantitative prediction of these deformations. Analytical prediction models as function of material properties and welding parameters exist, but they are mainly applicable for steel structures. Also some empirical models have been found for steel. This has led to the following research program. Assuming that physical phenomena responsible for deformation of steel and aluminium structures are the same, it has been decided to tune coefficients for these models based on deformations measured during construction process of aluminium structures. Three measurement campaigns were carried out. The first campaign was focused on selection of a method to measure relatively small panel distortions. Different methods were considered. Finally a 3D scanner provided by FARO and software provided by Polyworks were chosen because this method allows for measurements at different stages of panel construction in laboratory and shipyard conditions, see Figure 1. It has been found that the method is accurate enough providing that fixed reference blocks are used. The second and third measurement campaigns consisted of measurement of a deck panel and T-frames. During production of the panel, multiple scans were performed to capture evolution of deformations. Processing the results revealed that in-plane deformations dominate in-plane shortening of the panel and that the out-of-plane deformation can be disregarded. Production of the T-frames consisted of joining the flange to the web of the frame. This was done by means of a double sided fillet weld. Scans were performed before and after welding. In this case it has been concluded that the out-of-plane deformation cannot be disregarded. The obtained analytical and empirical formulations have been used to develop a method which is capable to quantify shrinkage of aluminium structures depending on welding sequence. The method is relatively simple but resembles the observed phenomena. Finally, the method has been implemented in a computer tool. The validity range of the method is limited to structures similar to those measured. The tool is capable to predict displacement changes of aluminium high speed craft caused by welding during the engineering stage so that some measure can be undertaken to mitigate these effects.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-03-03","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","","",""

We systematically evaluated the input number of beams, the comparison between the equal distance versus optimized beam directions and the comparison between coplanar and non-coplanar plans. Finally, a dose escalation problem tried to be solved for the same lung cancer patients. Materials and Methods: The Erasmus MC developed algorithm iCycle was used for automated generation of multicriterial optimized plans with optimized beam orientations and intensity profiles, and plans with optimized profiles for preselected beam arrangements. Results: IMRT treatment planning is superior to 3DCRT for lung cancer patients. Fifteen (15) optimized beam directions plans are superior to the fifteen (15) equal distance plans. Moreover, the improvement of using fifteen (15) non- coplanar beam orientations is not proved to exist. Last but not least, we succeeded to escalate the prescription dose more than 16Gy for the half of the patient group. Conclusions: iCycle was able to automatically generate high quality plans for lung cancer patients and to escalate the prescription dose almost for all the patients. Nine (9) coplanar beam arrangements plans are similar with fifteen (15) equidistant beam plans.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomedical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2017","The emission of green-house gases, such as carbon-dioxide, has been increasing rapidly in the last 50 years. Leading to an increase in the overall temperature, melting polar ice, rising sea-levels and more natural disasters. Aviation is one of the causes of these emissions. The efficiency of aircraft engines can be improved by improving the combustion. In order to optimise the combustion and the reduction of unwanted species in the emission, it is important to be able to predict how the flame will behave. This thesis investigates snap-shot photography of multiple transient species in flames by recording chemiluminescence spectral information from a planar field obtained in a non-scanning procedure. Chemiluminescence is a process in which an electron gets into excited state by the chemical reaction and relaxes. When the electron relaxes, a photon is released with a wavelength characteristic for that specie. Although information at one plane is desired, emissions from other planes will also be captured. The reason is because chemiluminescence is a passive technique where the signal corresponding to a pixel on the sensor is an integrated value of all planes in the line of sight of the pixel. A survey was done on existing spectral imaging techniques. The existing techniques did not capture all the dimensions at once because they employed spatial scanning or band pass filters. The objective of this thesis was to be able to record all the spatial and spectral information simultaneously. Two different setups were considered in this thesis, one to study the larger structures and one to study the details in the spectrum. The investigated setups consisted of a collecting lens, a transmission grating, a focusing lens system and an imaging sensor. Two gratings with different lines per mm were investigated, 1200 lines/mm (low spectral resolution) and 3039 lines/mm(high spectral resolution) respectively. Additionally, a spectrometer has been added to the setup to calibrate the captured image afterwards. The flame used for this research was a hydrocarbon flame fed by a butane (80%) and propane (20%) fuelmixture. The chemiluminescence signal of this flame was weak, resulting in an integration time for the spectrometer of 8 seconds. The camera was more sensitive, but still required an exposure time of 0.5 seconds. The point spread function at full width half maximum of the low resolution grating on the image sensor was determined to be 25.8¹m. Using the magnification of the lens system, the smallest structure that can be observed in the flame can be computed. The smallest structure in the flame using the low resolution setup is 0.5mm. The high resolution grating had a point spread function at full width half maximum of 187¹m, corresponding to a structure of 1mm in the flame. For each of the results obtained, the corresponding spectrum by the spectrometer was used to calibrate the image. The spectrometer output was validated with spectra found in literature. The spectrum did not match the image for the longer wavelengths due to the non-linear dispersion of the grating. The spectral resolution of both setups was determined by using the shorter wavelengths. This is a conservative approach which will result in the lowest resolution. The spectral resolution of the low resolution grating setup was 0.15nm/pixel and 0.02nm/pixel for the high resolution grating setup. With the low resolution grating setup attempts have been made to modify the flame to be a two-dimensional flame, this was to counter the effects of this line-of-sight technique. Of these attempts the V-flame was the most successful, it was practically two-dimensional and the larger structures in the spectrum were all separated. These frames have been used to construct a three-dimensional hyper-spectral data cube, which contains information of the spectrum for every two dimensional point. This is the main result of this thesis. Although the results could be improved in many ways it can be concluded that the snapshot flexible chemiluminescence hyper-spectral imager is a useful addition to the existing species detection techniques. This thesis proved the working principles of this technique and further research is needed to extend the limits of this technique.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-03-02","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Performance and Propulsion","","","",""

(mentor); Beekman, A.Q. (mentor); Tange, J. (mentor)","2017","Servitization: Shifting from products, to integrated product service bundles in B2B - Clients do not want standalone products, they want solutions. Those solutions often require a combination of products and services integrated in one effective solution. For the past 20 years, the provision of services has permeated almost every facet of industrial activity. When asked to give an example of great service, most people still refer to those received in “classic” service industries – hospitality, telecommunications, or finance to name a few. However, reality is that some of the best and most innovative services stem from companies that provide products. Case in point: Toyota just launched a huge campaign for their new product-service combination: Toyota Flexdriving1. Customers no longer have to buy a car or take care of the responsibilities associated with owning one (e.g. road tax, maintenance or repair). B2B manufacturing or constructing companies have jumped on the bandwagon, shifting from providing products to bundling those products with services. Notable examples are Rolls-Royce “Power-by-the-Hour”2 and Xerox “Pay-per-Copy”3. Each company has built its new business strategy around the services it could provide. This is servitization – the process through which companies, once focused solely on products, shift their strategies to services. This project set out to explore this phenomenon (the drivers, enablers, inhibitors and design practices) and translate the findings into a “Servitization Framework of Knowledge” and two tools that make the gathered insights actionable. The literature on servitization provides a wealth of scattered best practices4,5 but was found to be lacking in providing a clear overview of challenges organized both by topic and by specific shift a company makes. The objective of this project was to provide the service design consultant Livework with a framework of knowledge that could be used for projects in the context of specific servitization shifts. For that reason, the framework was designed to accommodate relevant knowledge to specific shifts rather than generalized best practices. One of the biggest challenges found, was determining the right servitization strategy. No servitization shift is the same and companies struggle with finding the right foundation to build their strategy on. Since earlier research shows that the presence of a clearly-defined service strategy is an indicator for the likelihood of a successful servitization shift6, developing a tools for this purpose was paramount. The technique and tool help companies structure the information needed to ground a servitization strategy, in one overview. For a servitization strategy to succeed, it is key that the entire organization of the new service provider understands that the true value to the client lies in the efficiency and effectiveness of an offered solution rather than the proper functioning of the product. The organizational mindset has to change from a product-focus to a service-focus and that proves to be a big challenge. The second technique and tool address this by changing the focus from provisioning products to solutions in a workshop setting.","servitization; framework; toolbox","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovatie Management","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Cankurtaran, P. (mentor); Palumbo, C. (mentor)","2017","This report describes a graduation project carried out at Exact business software. The goal of the project was to develop data-driven personas for the accountancy team within the company. The previously used set of personas were based on intuition, which created a feel for what type of person to design for. This might be relevant for empathizing and designing, but not if decisions are based on them. Therefore, a data approach was needed. In this project the user activity in the software served as input for the persona creation to enhance more informed decision making. The creation of these personas was performed with the use of data analysis from a sample that contained 1725 users in 163 administration offices. These users performed around 400.000 clickstreams in three months. Two levels of clustering techniques were applied to retrieve similar usage behaviour. First, dominant tasks were grouped together into common workflows. Second, these common workflows were used to retrieve groups of users with similar usage patterns. As a result, the user types were different in the type of tasks they were likely to perform. To create a complete picture of these user types derived from the data analysis, additional user interviews were conducted that obtained qualitative insights. All pieces of information (data analysis clusters, qualitative insights, and existing knowledge) came together in a persona co-creation session with the accountancy team of Exact. After further interpretation of the research results, a new set of personas was created which contained empathy, data, and creative thinking. The accountancy team decided to replace the old personas with the data-driven ones. In other words, the team is now able to make more informed decisions and have a better understanding of their users. Next to software usage, additional information on how these users act when they do not use the software was explored during the user interviews. This resulted in examining the collaboration between accountant and entrepreneur. What derived from current collaboration moments was that there is a “mismatch” between accountant and entrepreneur. In more detail, the two have different values regarding their financial situation and this often results in friction (e.g. too late delivery of documents by an entrepreneur). To solve this problem a new concept is presented in this graduation project which is in line with a current developing trend. This is the changing role of accountants to become business advisors. The concept helps accountants to “think like an entrepreneur” by communicating among goals. This facilitates accountants to give more natural advice, since they retrieve insights in their client. Entrepreneurs now have a internal driver to make use of Exact Online, because they want to complete their goals in order to strive towards success.","data-driven personas; consumer insights","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovatie Management (PIM)","","","",""

(mentor); Riva, R.E.M. (mentor)","2017","Atmospheric particulate matter (aerosols), originating from both natural and anthropogenic sources, is affecting the regional and global climate through direct, indirect, and semi-direct effects on the radiative energy budget of the Earth-atmosphere system. In order to quantify these effects it is necessary to determine the load of aerosol particles in the atmosphere. An effective way to do this is by measuring the aerosol optical depth (AOD). The higher the AOD values the greater the aerosol load. Along with AOD, the Fine mode Fraction (contribution of particles smaller than 1 μm to the total AOD, FF) is an effective parameter for the characterization of the aerosol, providing a rough proxy for the size of the particle present in a region at a particular time. In this study, I investigate the spatiotemporal variability of the AOD, FF, fine and coarse mode AOD over the Northwestern European Seas (that extend from 43° N to 67° N and from 10° W to 31° E), where the presence of both natural and anthropogenic particles is significant. Anthropogenic particles (both primary and secondary aerosols, mostly fine mode) originate from ship activity, or from urban-industrial and fossil fuel and biomass burning processes. The natural, coarse mode particles are primarily originated either from the oceans (sea salt particles) or from the desserts (dessert dust particles). In the present study I use mean daily aerosol data (Collection 006 Level-3) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument that is on board Aqua satellite. These data are available in 1° × 1° resolution (ca. 100 km × 100 km). The study period extends from 2002 until 2014. A significant spatial variability of the aerosol load is observed over the study region. On annual level, the highest AOD values (up to 0.32) are observed over the English Channel and the coasts of the Netherlands and Germany. The highest FF values (values up to 0.77) are observed over the same regions, indicating that a large contribution of the aerosol load is from anthropogenic particles. Offshore (at remote regions), both AOD and FF are lower compared to coastal regions, thus indicating the predominance of maritime aerosols (sea salt particles). The data also show a clear seasonal cycle, with larger aerosol load observed during spring and summer period (AOD up to 0.60), and lower during autumn and winter period (AOD up to 0.30). A similar pattern is observed only for the FF, implying a larger contribution of anthropogenic particles during spring and summer period compared to autumn and winter period. The highest FF values (up to 0.80- 0.85) are observed during summer over the Baltic Sea, while year-round the lowest values are observed in remote maritime areas, mostly in the northern part of the study region, accentuating the predominance of maritime/sea salt particles. The AOD experiences an overall decreasing trend over most of the study region (slope range between -0.18 to 0.05 per decade). Over the northwestern ocean parts of the study region positive values are observed (sea salt particles are dominating), while over most of the rest study region parts the slope is of the order of -0.02 to -0.05 per decade. These decreasing AOD trends are associated with a reduction of mostly the fine mode AOD. Therefore it can be assumed that the decrease of the aerosol load over the study region is mainly due to the reduction of the anthropogenic emissions.","AOD; AOT; Fine mode AOD; Coarse mode AOD; Fine Fraction; Aerosol optical properties; Northwestern European Seas; aerosol load","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","Master Applied Earth Sciences","",""

(mentor)","2017","Myoelectric as well as body-powered hand prostheses, the two commercially available prosthetic control types, have both their specific advantages. Advanced myoelectric prostheses for example have the characteristic of facilitating multiple degrees of freedom due to grip type variation and/or wrist movements. Compared to prosthetic devices with only one degree of freedom (e.g. body-powered ones), the usage of prostheses with multiple degrees of freedom appears more natural and the need for compensatory body movements in everyday life activities is reduced. The accuracy of grasping and the dexterity when conducting complex movements is improved. Furthermore, a more stable grip is achieved especially in case of grasping irregular shaped-objects. On the contrary, body-powered prostheses are e.g. lightweight, robust and cheap. Furthermore, they provide extended proprioceptive feedback, whereas the amputee always knows the prehension state of his/her prosthesis and how much pinch force he/she applies without having to visually monitor the device. Since a prosthesis providing both extended proprioceptive feedback as well as multiple-degrees of freedom would strongly benefit the amputee, a literature review has been conducted to investigate, if attempts have been or are currently undergone to design a body-powered prosthesis with multiple degrees of freedom. This literature review has shown, that less successful attempts have already been conducted on this regard. The approaches to equip body-powered prostheses with multiple degrees of freedom are mentally challenging, counterintuitive or restricted to unilateral amputees. Therefore, they are inadequate solutions. Myoelectric prostheses, on the contrary, solely require a trigger signal, co-contraction or a signal combination to control multiple degrees of freedom. In order to expand the advantages of body-powered prostheses, the aim of this project was to develop a mechanism to cooperate multiple degrees of freedom of a body-powered prosthesis as easily as with the myoelectric control. More precisely, the mechanism should enable to switch between a lateral and an opposition grip of a body-powered hand prosthesis.

This aids with design changes and trade-offs regarding the stability characteristics of the design. This software was developed with a focus on stability analysis in the Terminal Area Energy Management phase (TAEM), the penultimate phase of the return to Earth. For the HORUS spaceplane, a design study by MBB in the 1980s, the stability coefficients are known down to a Mach number of 1.2 and the dynamic stability characteristics down to a Mach number of 2.5. In this thesis a method is developed to calculate the aerodynamic forces and moments on a spaceplane. This method consists of two parts, an inviscid Euler code for the flow field away from the spaceplane and a viscous boundary layer code for the flow at the surface. The boundary layer code is based on the axisymmetric analogue, which uses a coordinate to transform a complex body into a series of axisymmetric bodies as long as the cross-flow between the streamlines is negligible. Using the Mangler transformation, these axisymmetric bodies can be transformed to flat plates, upon which momentum thickness and skin friction equations can be used. The inviscid Euler code calculates the pressure forces and moments, while the viscous boundary layer code calculates the forces and moments due to friction drag. The combined pressure (inviscid) and friction (viscous) forces and moments on the HORUS are then used for stability analysis at Mach numbers of 2, 1.2 and 0.8, adding to the existing data set. The stability analysis focuses on the stability coefficients (static stability) and motion characteristics (dynamic stability) around the trim condition at the aforementioned Mach numbers. For the dynamic stability an eigenvalue and eigenvector analysis is performed to investigate which motions are present in the lower Mach regimes, whether these motions are stable and how the vehicle behaves during these motions. It is shown that the forces on the vehicle are simulated very well using this methods, as well as the longitudinal pitch moments. For the moments and derivatives regarding roll and yaw the simulated values differ significantly from the reference values. The simulations also show the large influence on the center of mass position on the stability of the HORUS, slight changes can turn an unstable motion in a stable motion and vice versa. Finally, the simulations show that the HORUS generally becomes more stable at lower Mach numbers, which indicates that the TAEM is not the critical phase regarding design for a stable spaceplane.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Astrodynamics and Space Missions","","","",""
