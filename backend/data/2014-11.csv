(mentor); Rueda Torres, J.L. (mentor); Boemer, J.C. (mentor)","2014","It is expected that the share of renewable energy sources will increase to meet rising demand. One of the challenges integrating this distributed generation (DG) into the power system is the behaviour of low voltage connected DG in case of a transmission system fault. This research aims to give recommendations for low voltage (LV) grid codes to improve system stability in case of transmission system faults in systems with very high penetration of distributed generation. The study horizon is 2022. A comprehensive benchmark system is designed, ranging from the low (400 V) to extra high (380 kV) voltage levels. Three distribution system types representative of Germany are developed. Positivesequence, root mean square stability simulations are performed for current (2012) and future (2022) scenarios in the commercial DIgSILENT PowerFactory 15.1 software. Sensitivity analyses are performed for pre-fault operating point and, for the 2022 scenario, the fault control mode of the low voltage connected photovoltaic systems. To reduce complexity of the test system and facilitate the simulations, the low voltage and medium voltage (20 kV) networks are aggregated. The research shows that LVRT requirements should be set for converter coupled DG in the low voltage network. Due to their high penetration, the loss of active power with current regulations is likely to cause major frequency stability issues in the future. Due to their low penetration and difficulties remaining transiently stable, no LVRT requirements should be posed for directly coupled synchronous generators that are connected inside a low voltage feeder. Those connected at a substation can ride through faults as long as they remain transiently stable.","power system stability; photovoltaic power systems; power system modeling; distribution networks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Sustainable Energy Technology","","Electrical Sustainable Energy","",""

(mentor)","2014","This thesis presents a new approach to reading out thermal-conductivity-based gas sensors. This method is intended for the readout of a CMOS compatible resistive thermal-conductivity transducer for indoor CO2 sensing applications, without requiring precision off-chip components. Instead of accurately regulating the power dissipated in the transducer and measuring its temperature, the temperature and power dissipation are both measured using an algorithmic approach. A high-resolution ADC digitizes the voltage drop across the transducer and the current through it, measured using an on-chip reference resistor. Moreover, by digitizing several base-emitter voltages of an on-chip bipolar transistor, a precision bandgap voltage reference is constructed in the digital domain, and accurate information about the ambient temperature is obtained, which is used to temperature compensate the voltage reference and the reference resistor. Thus, all necessary ingredients are obtained to calculate the power dissipation and temperature of the transducer, from which the thermal conductivity of the surrounding air, and hence CO2 concentration, can be obtained. A prototype integrated circuit implementing this readout approach has been realized in 0.16um CMOS. It has been tested in a climate chamber in combination with a platinum resistor mimicking the transducer. The digitally-constructed voltage reference has a temperature coefficient of 9ppm/°C, while ambient temperature is sensed with accuracy of ±0.2°C, with a resolution of 0.15°C. The resistance readings have an inaccuracy ranging between -1mOhms to 4mOhms on a nominal resistance of about 100Ohms (-10ppm - 40ppm) with a resolution of around 2mOhms in the temperature range from 10°C to 40°C; for the power measurements, the circuit achieved an accuracy between -0.03% and 0.06%, with an 800nW of resolution (in the same temperature range) which is one order of magnitude better than results presented in previous work. Although no CO2 measurements have been performed, an estimated thermal resistance accuracy of around 2862ppm with a resolution of 155.64[K/W] should be possible, which would enable detection of the CO2 levels in the air with an accuracy of around 0.72% and a resolution of 7705ppm.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-11-28","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","Electronic Instrumentation","",""

A close and trustful relationship is needed between the caregiver and the child/family to provide good care. Given the physical, psychological and spiritual problems of the children this relation can be long-lasting, intense and emotional, making providing this care a demanding job. The Pallas helps caregivers to deal with the issues and challenges of their demanding job by helping them to explore their feelings and reflect on them. This is currently often overlooked because of lack of awareness about the importance of reflecting on their emotions. Next to this, caregivers do not know how to properly reflect and where to start.

(mentor); Hendriks, M.A.N. (mentor); Hoogenboom, P.C.J. (mentor); Borgart, A. (mentor)","2014","The Finite Element Method is used in many computer programs to analyse the mechanical behaviour of shell structures. Although this method provides good quantitative insight into the mechanical behaviour of shell structures, it provides little qualitative insight. This master graduation thesis is aimed at expanding Finite Element Analysis (FEA) programs in order to obtain better insight in the qualitative aspect of the mechanical behaviour of shell structures. A FEA-program can compute and display forces, stresses, strains and displacements in a structure due to a prescribed load or displacement. Based on these quantities (i.e. forces, stresses, strains and displacements), five new quantities have been computed and researched during this thesis. These new quantities are aimed at increasing the insight in the qualitative aspect of the mechanical behaviour of shell structures. Four shell structures have been modelled in the 3D modelling software package Rhinoceros. The FEAprogram TNO DIANA has then been used to obtain the required quantities for computing the five new quantities. This computation of the new quantities has been done with the aid of a self-made post processing tool. This tool has been developed in the Rhinoceros plug-in Grasshopper so that Rhinoceros is also used for displaying the analysis results. As it turned out, two quantities in particular produced good results. These are the strain energy and the buckling load factor. Strain energy is the energy that is stored in a structure when it deforms due to a load. The buckling load factor is the ratio between the occurring normal forces in a shell structure and the normal force that will cause the shell to fail by buckling. With the aid of strain energy it turned out to be possible to show whether a shell structure is displaying shell or plate behaviour. Furthermore, strain energy combines forces and deformations in all directions, resulting in a single display of analysis results with which a shell structure can be assessed. The buckling load factor shows where and to what extend a shell structure is most likely to buckle. With the self-made post processing tool it is also possible to display the steepest descends in every part of a shell structure. This provides the tool with opportunities for implementation of the Rain Flow Analogy. The Rain Flow analogy is an alternative method that shows how forces are transferred throughout a shell structure. Based on the results above it is proposed to implement the strain energy and the buckling load factor in existing FEA-programs. These quantities allow for the design and development of better shell structures by increasing the insight in the mechanical behaviour of these structures.","shell; FEA; Finite Element Analysis; post processor; structural behaviour; Grasshopper; strain energy; eccentricity of the normal force; buckling load factor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural Mechanics","",""

(mentor)","2014","Designers are confronted with high time-to-market pressure and an increasing demand for computational power. As a result, they are required to identify as early as possible the quality of a specification for an intended technology. The designer needs to know if this specification can be improved, and at what cost. Specification trade-offs are often based on the experience and intuition of a designer, which in itself is not enough to make design decisions given the complexity of modern designs. Therefore, we need to identify the performance boundaries for the execution of a specification on an intended technology. The degree of parallelism, required resources, scheduling constraints, and possible optimizations, etc. are essential in determining design trade-offs (e.g., power consumption, execution time, etc). However, existing tools lack the capability of determining relevant performance parameters and the option to automatically optimize high-level specifications to make meaningful design trade-offs. To address these problems, we present in this thesis a new profiler tool, cprof. The Clang compiler front-end is used in this tool to parse high-level specifications, and to produce instrumented source code for the purpose of profiling. This tool automatically determines, from high-level specifications, the degree of parallelism of a given source code, specified in C and C++ programming languages. Furthermore, cprof estimates the number of clock cycles necessary to complete a program, it automatically applies loop optimization techniques, it determines the lower and upper bound on throughput capacity, and finally, it generates hardware execution traces. The tool assumes that the specification is executed on a parallel Model of Computation (MoC), referred to as a Polyhedral Process Network (PPN). The proposed tool adds new functionality to existing technologies: the estimated performance by cprof of PolyBench/C benchmarks, as compared to realistic implementations in Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) platforms, showed to be almost identical. Cprof is capable of estimating the lower and upper bound on throughput capacity, making it possible for the designer to make performance trade-offs based on real design points. As a result, only the high-level specification is used by cprof to assist in Design Space Exploration (DSE) and to improve design quality.","Polyhedral process networks; Profiling; Source code optimization; Design Space Exploration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Computer Engineering","",""

(mentor); Correljé, A.F. (mentor); Stikkelman, R.M. (mentor)","2014","The European downstream oil sector has seen drastic changes over the past years and particularly after 2008 and the outbreak of the financial crisis. The developments which have taken place have put the sector under serious pressure, which was mainly felt by the European refining industry. In a nutshell, the industry has been greatly affected by the declining demand for oil products in Europe, the imbalance between gasoline and diesel supply and demand in the European market, the changing crude oil qualities with which European refineries are being supplied, the refining overcapacity in the region, the thin margins and high energy costs and finally, the stringent environmental legislation of European Union about oil fuels. Additionally, the sector faces increasing competition from its counterparts in the US, Middle East, Russia and other emerging countries in Asia, not only in Europe but also in other global markets. However, companies involved in European downstream oil sector react differently to these challenges and whereas some are divesting, others are able to see investment opportunities. Moreover, some companies involved in the petroleum refining, oil products storage and trading business, are moving from refining to trading and vice versa, thus switching their business models and responding with different strategies to the dynamics of this sector. The spectrum of drivers behind corporate decisions concerning these strategies is quite wide, and this research has aimed to identify which are the important incentives underlying the decisions of these companies. The study effort comprises two main phases; in the first, the unique characteristics of the European downstream oil sector are described with the use of theory. Two theoretical frameworks were used: The Transaction Cost Economics (TCE) and Transaction Cost Regulation (TCR). The constructs offered by these theories were critically evaluated for their applicability with respect to the goals of this research, and after considering their limitations and strengths, a new theoretical framework was proposed. This framework combines elements from both TCE and TCR, and it is customized to depict the idiosyncratic nature of this sector. Furthermore, this framework is suitable for describing the nature of industries similar to the European downstream oil one. For the second phase of the research, the Q methodology technique was employed. At first, the constructs of the theoretical framework helped to identify, from the literature, the important drivers for corporate investments or divestments in the European downstream oil sector. Subsequently, 13 Q methodology interview sessions were conducted with individuals-experts on the topic. Interviewees were related to private and public parties, but also to research organizations. The interviews revealed similarities and differences among the viewpoints of participants, with respect to what is driving corporate investment or divestment decisions in the sector. A comparison and discussion of the different viewpoints helped to identify the most important of these drivers and also revealed the variety in perceptions of stakeholders in the sector. Moreover, the Q methodology research results allowed for testing the premises of the TCE/TCR framework. It was shown that the framework is indeed valid and suitable for the purposes of this research. The results of this research are important for designing appropriate policies on a European and National Government level, in order to ensure competitiveness of the European downstream oil sector and security of oil products supply in Europe. Furthermore, these results are useful for firms involved in the business, as they offer insights into how other actors in the sector think, and decrease information asymmetries between the industry side and the policy-makers side. Last but not least, this research revealed that the European downstream oil sector is not capable to solve its competitiveness problems on its own, as the Neoclassical Economics predictions about “self-correcting” market forces are not verified. On the contrary, it seems that it will be necessary to see increased activity in the future, from the European Commission or European National Governments, in order to stimulate the industry and restore its competitiveness vis-à-vis other downstream oil industries worldwide.","oil; downstream; investment drivers; divestment drivers; refining; strategy; transaction cost economics; transaction cost regulation; Q methodology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Economics of Technology and Innovation","","Management of Technology","",""

Multivariate simplex B-splines form a class of nonlinear function approximators capable of approximating scattered data. Simplex B-splines are piecewise polynomials defined on a triangulation. Currently, data approximation using simplex B-splines is done by optimizing the B-coefficients of the spline function, without optimizing the triangulation. Triangulation optimization is a standing problem of function approximation using simplex splines. Recently the Interspline was presented, an interval extension of simplex splines with interval B-coefficients defined on a triangulation with interval vertices. Using Intersplines guaranteed global optimization of the vertices of the triangulation and the B-coefficients is possible. However, until now this method was only applicable for optimization of univariate and bivariate linear simplex B-splines on very specific triangulations. The contribution of this work is a method for guaranteed global optimization of vertices and B-coefficients of $n$-variate linear simplex splines with zero order continuity on general triangulations. This partly solves the triangulation optimization problem for simplex splines. Using this method data can be approximated more accurately, while the triangulation stays the same size.","Simplex Splines; Interval Analysis; Model Identification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-11-28","Aerospace Engineering","Control & Operations","","Control & Simulation","",""

(mentor); Ravesteijn, W. (mentor)","2014","For the last four decades, inequality has been increasing in both industrialized and emerging market countries. Inequality is a concern in development due to its social-ethical and economic rationale. Inequality can impair social well-being which leads to political unrest. Also it can trigger economic instability and hamper economic growth. Indeed, inequality is not a recent debate in development economics. Previous studies have focused on many factors such as economic policy, labor, education, health, culture, technology, political economy, etc. This research aims to examine the relationship between economic growth and inequality, then analyze its influencing factors in the context of emerging market economies. Thus, it proposes to look into the inequality-growth relationship anew and go beyond most of the earlier studies in the case countries (Indonesia and Korea) by two approaches. First, it employs Theil’s T statistics method to assess how the changes in the economic structure have driven inequality and economic growth as presumed by Simon Kuznets. Kuznets supposes the existence of an inverted U-shape curve between inequality and economic level in which inequality first rises along the growing economy then followed by a decline inequality despite the economy keeps growing. This pattern is driven by the structural economic transition. Second, it examines the influencing factors of changing inequality with a special attention to economic policy then puts it into institutional and historical context of Indonesian and Korean economies. A regression model is developed to identify the correlation between these factors and inequality. The motivation of this comparative analysis is based on the fact that Indonesia and Korea experienced rapid economic growth and structural transition. They have managed to leap from low income countries in 1960s to high income (middle income for Indonesia) countries nowadays, with massive structural transition from agriculture to industry and services. Moreover, they also experienced some profound changes in their institution which have influenced the orientation of their economic policy, especially in the mid-1990s when both countries fell into the economic crises and most of the new economic policies were suggested by the donor institution. Theil’s T method shows, despite the declining trend of economic inequality in terms of sectoral and regional GDP, income inequality is increasing since 1990s in Indonesia and Korea. Theil’s T index calculated from regional and sectoral wage data confirms the official Gini ratio measurement. It indicates service sector (in Indonesia) and financial sector (in Korea) as the main driver of this rising income inequality. Then, the regression model shows this trend is correlated with some economic policies which are, for Indonesia case, fiscal policy in terms of declining tax ratio and progressiveness, and economic openness in terms of declining tariff rate. For Korea, these are monetary policy in terms of higher real interest rate, and investment in real economy in terms of declining gross-fixed capital formation. Moreover, there are also correlation between income inequality and technological progress in terms of capital-to-labor ratio in both countries. Looking back to the 1960s-1990s period; Indonesia and Korea not only experienced rapid economic growth but also steady inequality within moderate levels. They have been successful to manage growth with equity. However, this was influenced by the transition from an authoritarian to a democratic regime, which has caused a profound change in their economic policies from a coordinated and planned economy to a more liberal economy. Revisiting the debate about Kuznets’ theory, it is concluded that the existence of Kuznets’ curve could be a common phenomenon unless there is a force (more active role of the government) governing income distribution and growth. Therefore, a free-market economy would be more likely to create an unequal economic growth.","inequality; Kuznets theory; Theils T; economic growth; economic policy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Economics of Technology and Innovations","","Master Engineering and Policy Analysis","",""

(mentor); Mattheijer, J. (mentor)","2014","Orthopaedic surgeons can be assisted by Patient Specific Surgical Guides (PSSGs) during the determination of prostheses’ alignment in joint replacement surgeries. These guides are designed preoperatively – using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Computer Tomography (CT) – to have a matching contact surface with the patient’s bone. This enables the surgeon to place the guide in a uniquely planned position intraoperatively. Saw slots and drill holes are incorporated in PSSGs to create the crucial saw planes and drill holes for prostheses positioning. Tissues not detected by MRI or CT cannot be accounted for in the design of the guide’s matching surface. When such undetected tissues are present at the bone contact, they can introduce a positional error of the surgical guide. In our study multiple concepts are created which possibly decrease the positional error. The choice is made to develop a rigid and a compliant pin-based guide. Pin-based guides are configurable and thus suitable for multiple patients, since a patient-specific fit can be created. When relatively much contact points are used for the fit, compliant pins are able to absorb local irregularities. Therefore, a compliant guide can result in a lower positional error when a contact is placed onto an undetected tissue. Using more contact points will increase the ability of a compliant guide to result in a lower positional error. The two guide types are compared to their sensitivity to bony deviations in an experimental validation. The guides are placed onto a printed distal femur bone model with bony deviations. The actually reached position is measured using the optical tracking system Qualisys and is compared to the obtained position without bony deviations. For each guide four contact sets are tested to investigate the effect of the number of contact points. For validation of the experimental data, the positional error is calculated for the rigid guide with six contact points using an analytical model. Analysis of the measurement data results in a significantly lower rotational error for compliant guides compared to rigid guides. No significance is found between the translations of the two guide types. Further development of the compliant guide can be considered, since a significantly lower rotational error is obtained.","configurable surgical guides; compliant contact","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-12-18","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

(mentor); Wever, R. (mentor); Desmet, P.M.A. (mentor)","2014","In this master’s thesis, a design intervention is presented that triggers people to think about continuous spatial changes in their neighbourhood. It aims to create awareness of the ever changing character of the surroundings and make people more open and willing to support developments that are beneficial for the future. With an emphasis on local wind farm implementation, the final goal is to make local residents experience wind turbines less as a threat and to enable them to see how they can be beneficial for the neighbourhood. The project has been conducted in collaboration with Delft Institute of Positive Design and Energie-U. Energie-U is an energy cooperative of citizens in Utrecht. Start of this year their proposal for a wind farm located at the industrial zone Lage Weide in Utrecht was voted down by the city council. Although the majority of the public seems to support the idea of renewable energy, resistance within a community seems to arise whenever a wind farm is to be located nearby. An important reason for this is that people are often more sensitive to losses than to gains, i.e. we feel better safe than sorry (Johnson & Scicchitano, 2000). Future benefits, such as being independent of large energy companies and contributing to a sustainable future, fail to evoke positive emotions when people fear negative consequences of a having a wind-farm in their neighbourhood. Moreover, people are easily influenced by opposing teams that communicate in an emotional and provocative language. Positive messages of proponents, developers and local governments are often received with suspicion. Opposing opinions and fear for negative future consequences cause the majority of the public (64%, SmartAgent company, 2008) to remain undecided about implementation of a wind farm in the neighbourhood. Consequently, these circumstances cause local governments to often postpone or even cancel plans for wind farms. Exploration of the context was done through observations, expert and user interviews. Altogether this revealed the concerns and underlying goals of local residents that determine whether people are more likely to become opponent or proponent of a local wind farm. A main conclusion that was drawn from research is that concerns that evoke resistance are often triggered by fear for prospected change. While concerns that lead to support involve a more positive look towards changes; seeing them as an opportunity. People in doubt find it hard to make a decision regarding two primary concerns: they want to enable the community to produce and consume its own energy, but at the same time they want to prevent changes to the environment (i.e. local wind farm) that harm local identity. The proposed design intervention is a neighbourhood lookout point that is linked to an online platform. Via its design the concept subtly confronts local residents with the fact that opposing a specific spatial plan (i.e. a wind farm) is not a guarantee for the surroundings to remain as they are. Moreover it shows that every spatial plan comes with advantages and disadvantages for the neighbourhood. Residents are stimulated to think about spatial changes in a different, more open way and subsequently determine what they think is important for the neighbourhoods’ future. Besides reflection, the concept invites local residents to participate in spatial planning procedures in a new and more appealing way.","dilemma-driven design; ViP; wind farm implementation; spatial changes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Aesthetics (DA)","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Mosselman, E. (mentor); Sloff, C.J. (mentor)","2014","Depth-averaged morphological computations using Delft3D tend to produce ‘strange’, results for river bends when the sediment transport formulas of Van Rijn are used. Even pools in inner bend regions and bars in outer bend regions can result from the model. The objective of the present thesis is to identify the cause of the problem and propose potential solutions. A short analysis shows that the ‘strange’ predictions are not connected to the Van Rijn’s formulations, but to suspended sediment transport modelling in general. An axi-symmetric solution (viz. the equilibrium solution of the transverse slope in an infinitely long bend with constant width and curvature) is derived for the case where suspended sediment transport is included, based on a formulation for the bed load transport by Olesen (1987). It is indicated that the limitations of the model including suspended sediment transport, along with bad modelling practices, can produce unrealistic results. Delft3D implicitly models the influence of secondary flow on the suspended sediment transport with the help of a mixing coefficient. Numerical experiments show that this is not possible in a river bend context, unless calibrating the parameters in such a way that they would lose their physical meaning. In order to overcome this problem, it is concluded that the influence of secondary flow on the suspended sediment has to be modelled explicitly. A suspended sediment transport model is designed, which includes the influence of secondary flow due to the variation in vertical direction of the profiles of secondary flow and suspended sediment. The depth averaged expressions including the dispersion of suspended sediment by the main and the secondary flow are derived by using analytical similarity profiles of sediment concentration (0th order Rouse profile) and secondary flow (Kalkwijk & Booij, 1986) for closing the extra terms. These expressions are implemented in Delft3D and the resulting code is used to carry out numerical simulatoons for hypothetical and real test cases including flume experiments. The analysis is confirmed by the simulations and the results of the improved depth-averaged code are much more realistic (from a mathematical point of view) as they show, especially for the hypothetical test cases, good agreement with the results from 3D computations (using also Delft3D). On the other hand, the applicability of the model to cases with large curvatures is more problematic, unless a more accurate expression for the secondary flow is used. It is concluded that incorporating the influence of secondary flow on the direction of suspended sediment along with the option of using a distribution function with variable shape is highly beneficial for morphological modelling in river bends. Another alternative is indicated to be the appropriate calibration of the morphological model. This is a less viable option, as it could even lead on disconnecting parameters from their physical meaning.","river; morphodynamics; suspended sediment; secondary flow; Delft3D","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

Big life events such as wedding, graduation, the birth of your child, are certainly those memorable moments. But our life is also full of moments that are tiny and spontaneous, like having a brunch with your good friends, chatting with your family, that the beauty of them is often realized after it is gone. “What if we could capture every moment of our life?” With this idea in mind, the Narrative team developed a wearable life-logging camera that can log one’s life into a photographic E-memory. It is called the Narrative Clip. With the knowledge gained from a preliminary exploration of the context, the assignment was formulated as to create an engaging and inspiring experience of sharing life moments that is built on top of the Narrative Clip. Then a series of research activities were conducted and focused on both the Narrative user experience and general photography experience were carefully studied. “Sharing”, defined as a key interaction of social connection, was emphasized in both aforementioned research focuses. It is realized that users mostly prefer to use the Clip at special events in which family and friends (non-Narrative users) participate. The captured photos are often shared via two different ways, privately or publicly. Public sharing takes place mainly on social network platforms and is considered as self-expression to the public audience. Private sharing, on the other hand, targets at specific audience depending on the shared contents. Consequently, senders and recipients are closed connected to each other through such sharing behavior and thus creates the intimacy in between. This key insight set a clear direction of focusing on the shared experience between Narrative users and non-Narrative users and create dynamic interactions around the shared experience. As the project continued to the design phase, ideas were generated and four design concepts were proposed. Reflection and evaluation were carried out to keep polishing and elaborating the design concept. My Narrative & Our Stories, the final design, came into form. The design goal is to empower users to co-create an engaging reliving experience with their family and friends. Via a website crafted for this goal, Narrative users can effortlessly share stories with other non-Narrative users. Not only the shared contents are accessible for both groups, but also they can import photos from other devices to complete the stories. While browsing through the stories, they are encouraged and motivated to show their appreciation and add descriptive contents. All these collaborative efforts are used to present the story in a dynamic and engaging way. A subtle reminder is also created to motivate long-term usage. The final design was evaluated together both the Narrative users and non-Narrative users. The design received very positive feedbacks. The design achieves the design goal to create an engaging reliving experience between Narrative users, their family and friends. However, there is space for future development. Thus, some feedbacks were collected and recommendation were proposed.","Life-logging; social engagement; experience; Narrative","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design for Interaction","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Cunningham, S.W. (mentor); Bouwmans, I. (mentor); Timmermans, J.S. (mentor)","2014","The purpose of this research is to provide insight in the system design process of an ocean ecopark, from the viewpoint of an independent policy analyst. More concretely efforts are made to provide capabilities gain insight in the value creation process between interdependent actors that influence the configuration of an ocean ecopark. An ocean ecopark is an initiative that deploys the potential of the ocean by utilizing cold ocean water through synergetic relations between tenants. This initiative can provide small island developing states (SIDS) with an opportunity to produce their own food, energy and drinking water in an economical and sustainable manner. The construction of a cold water network, that enables the connection among different tenants on an ecopark, is a very expensive investment. The configuration of an ocean ecopark is still undefined and is adapted to the needs of a location to ensure the success and acceptance. In order to do so, this research assesses the actor context to provide insight in the aspects where an ocean ecopark can be valuable for an island. Corresponding with the socio-technical background, the complications within this design process are, for the purpose of this research, related to the actor situation. Namely, the many actors are involved on or around on ocean ecopark that can affect or are affected by this project. Each of the actors has their own objectives that they like to accomplish, and for which the ocean ecopark can be an excellent possibility. The ocean ecopark has only limited opportunity to accommodate these, sometimes, conflicting interests of actors. Moreover, actors possess different resources and capabilities to influence the design process. This creates interdependencies in the actor environment and complicates the design process. The analysis of this problem consists of a proposition of mutual beneficial transactions that actors can make when rationalizing their decision over the control they possess. By exchanging excess control (resources) for favourable control based on their interest (objectives) over issues (core values), an actor is better capable of fulfilling its objectives. This static assessment leads to a redistribution of the control, which actors can exert for the purpose of an ocean ecopark design. The results shown by the exchange model tool encompass the weighted values for an ocean ecopark and preliminary system specifications. The weighted issues are derived by accumulating the different interest functions of actors. A designer can apply these weighted issues as criteria for the creation and evaluation of conceptual designs. The preliminary system specifications can be obtained through the actors who possess a large portion of the resources to influence a relevant issue. Since there resources are needed for the design process, their commitment and acceptance can be realized by integrating their wishes for a particular issue into the conceptual design. This value creation process arises through the commitment of actors for the design process. Exchange modelling shows what control actors are seeking in order to achieve their goals, and under what conditions they are willing to cooperate. Communicating and integrating these aspects in the design process enhances the commitment of actors to the design and design process. This substantiates the need for an integrative effort of systems and actors to realize an ocean ecopark, as actors input is necessary for the system design and a system design can convince actors for engaging to the process.","ocean ecopark; value creation; exchange modelling; actor interdependency","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Policy Analysis","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management","",""

(mentor); Silvester, S. (mentor)","2014","This report is the result of a graduation project performed to obtain the Master degree at the faculty of Industrial Design Engineering at Delft. The graduation assignment has been executed for Centric, a Dutch IT company. One of its departments develops software for local governments and water boards to raise and collect taxes and to calculate the value of properties. Centric has recognized that the end users of their software are hardly contacted and included in the development of their products. Although contact with clients is a daily routine, the end users are not part of this. This especially counts for the development teams who build new software parts. More user involvement results in more efficient software and increases its usability, which is the overall goal. In this project also the development process used by the development teams of Centric plays a crucial role. The Scrum method prescribes many elements that affect the possibilities for communication with end users. The goal of this project is therefore to develop a tool for Centric, well positioned in their development process, to let their IT developers (better) connect and engage with the end users of their solutions. Observations and interviews with development teams, Product Owners, Scrum Masters, consultants and end users were the basis of an extensive analysis of the context. It showed that the Scrum method forms a very important guideline for the design of the tool. A canvas workshop (Henze, Mulder, & Stappers, 2013) especially helped to visualize the exact moments where and what kind of communication with end users is desired and needed. Short and frequent communication fits the short and incremental Scrum method best. To truly engage with the end users it is however required that also contextual information such as the work environment of end users, their available equipment and emotions is included. The analysis also showed that there are too many end users to involve all of them in the development process at the same time. The selection of groups of end users functioning as lead users is therefore the suitable solution. As a result of the analysis a design goal and interaction vision were formulated to further define the project goal. The focus was to create an approachable, motivating and almost innate form of communication between end users and a development team, which provides input for long-term knowledge on end users shared between multiple development teams. The consecutive ideation phase resulted in pre-concepts, which were evaluated by end users and developers. Also an interaction prototype was made to test the envisioned interaction. This led to the final concept, Tessera. The proposed Tessera concept exists of three parts that relate to three sequential actions, namely communication, reflection and sharing. For the communication between development teams and lead users a mosaic panel is installed at Centric. This panel includes nine tablets with which contact with the lead users can be sought through video calls or chats. The developers can initiate a conversation whenever they have a question and because of the fast response time they are able to implement insights in the development of new software directly. To make sure the whole development team shares the insights gained in conversations the retrospective sessions, prescribed by Scrum, are used to reflect on the contact moments of the past sprint cycle. In order to make all user information available to all development teams and others of the Tax department, an interactive knowledge tree is projected on one of the walls within the department. All conversations with lead users and the insights linked to them are visualized and stored on this tree. One can watch recordings, read insights, change categorizations etc. so that all information is shared with the whole department. Eventually, in the prototype test an actual connection was made between developers at Centric and end users at client organizations. The awareness about the importance of user involvement has already grown, especially with the users and developers who participated in tests during this project. It is expected that this concept will consequently result in more engagement but this can only be confirmed after some time of use. The total final concept still has to be made into an operational version and be implemented at Centric’s Tax department. The implementation and adoption of the concept will approximately take one year.","Connect; Engage; End users; IT developers; Tool; Scrum; Centric","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Zhou, C. (mentor)","2014","DC-DC converters are critical building blocks in energy harvesting systems which are applied to provide the energy for the implantable biomedical devices. They are required to meet very strict specifications and consume as less power as possible. Therefore, their power conversion efficiency and stability of the functionality in the varying environment become the major considerations in this thesis project, the target of which is to design a DC-DC converter for energy harvesting applications. The conventional PWM control is not usually suitable for the DC-DC converters applied in energy harvesting applications because of its bad stability and low power conversion efficiency over wide input voltage and load current ranges. It is demonstrated that the adaptive on-time/off-time (AOOT) control proposed in this thesis is an excellent alternative to deal with the issue and the zero current switching (ZCS) adjustment technique can be applied to improve further the performance of the DC-DC converter by the fine tuning of the off-time. In this thesis, a systematic design flow of a boost DC-DC converter has been presented from the design of the power plant, to the selection of the most suitable control technique, then to the transistor-level implementation and finally to the layout design. Moreover, the circuitry of a boost DC-DC converter and the layout of its most parts have been implemented in TSMC 40nm CMOS process. The post-layout simulation results prove that the proposed boost DC-DC converter can generate a stable 1V output voltage with very small ripples (<~10mV) and achieve more than 90% (maximum about 95%) power conversion efficiency over a wide input voltage range (0.35V~0.65V) and a wide load current range (1mA~10mA).","Boost DC-DC converter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-12-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Engineering","","Microelectronics","",""

These models predict downdrift nourishment migration and the generation of alongshore sand waves for persistent conditions with high oblique wave incidence. However, these models exclude either the effect of wave chronology or use unrealistic nourishment properties. In this research the reshaping mechanisms of beach nourishments of realistic proportions (i.e. 2 km long and a cross-shore extent of 250m or 1000m) which are exposed to high angle waves are explored using Delft3D. This analysis distinguishes two phases: (1) static sediment transport for time invariant wave climate and (2) evolving nourishment morphology under time varying wave conditions. Model results show that: - A proper quantification of the degree of downdrift migration could be obtained from the skewness in the initial alongshore sediment transport distribution. Large nourishments under high angle waves result in high skewness and subsequent translation of the feature, while normally incident waves result in symmetric sediment transport distribution with skewness equal to zero and a more classical diffusive response. - The morphological response of the considered nourishments depends on (1) the moment in time at which a high angle wave event took place and (2) the persistence of the high angle waves within the wave climate. Simulations showed that a period with low-angle waves can rapidly wipe out the instabilities of high-angle wave situations and thus result in a diffusive pattern. However, a longer period with high angle waves will result in smaller net losses from the nourishment area for large scale nourishments.","beach nourishment; high angle of wave incidence; wave chronology; refraction; Delft3D","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); De Bruine, M. (mentor); Verburg, R. (mentor); Diez, M. (mentor)","2014","Crowdsourcing has become a very popular field over the last decade. Many applications where crowdsourcing can be used have been identified. This thesis project researches if some of these crowdsourcing applications can also be applied for internal crowdsourcing, where the crowd consists out of the firm’s employees to improve a company’s innovation process. Crowdsourcing bring many opportunities for improving the innovation process, as it can help to involve and connect a larger amount of employees in the innovation process that can boost the creativity or simply reach out to more resources within a company. The research project is conducted in cooperation with Robert Bosch GmbH, which sets the context for the case study. Based on the case study at Bosch, two use cases were identified that can improve the innovation process within tech-driven multinationals. The first and most relevant type is related to crowdsourcing solutions to specific problems, often referred as expert sourcing. In this type the focus lays on identifying the experts within the company that are then invited to solve very specific problems. The second type is related to crowdsourcing ideas. Other companies like IBM or Dell have already applied this type. In this context, it has been shown, that the second type should only be used for specific projects, as there are other more efficient alternatives available. To define when each crowdsourcing type is applicable during the innovation process, several contextual factors were identified. One major factor is the expected knowledge distribution about the problem to be solved by the crowd, which has been transferred to the long-tail distribution theory. Moreover, intellectual property and confidentiality are factors to differentiate the type of crowdsourcing that has to be used. In addition, a framework has been developed to codify the information about both crowdsourcing types. By applying the framework to the Bosch context, a best practice guide for future crowdsourcing campaign initiators was created.","crowdsourcing; internal crowdsourcing; crowdsourcing for B2B; long-tail of knowledge","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-11-26","Technology, Policy and Management","Management of Technology","","","","48.7666667, 9.1833333"

Nowadays there is an ever-­increasing concern towards the importance of sustainability in supply chain management in different industries. Currently, there are not enough studies performed on SSCM of O&G industry considering three aspects of sustainability. Therefore, there is a lack of research in this field. The purpose of this study is to gain an in depth understanding of the importance level of contextual factors affecting the environment and sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) of oil & gas (O&G) industry. To fulfill the aim of this study firstly reviewing literature on studies related to SSCM and O&G subjects is conducted. Secondly, after identifying the relevant external forces, a survey is carried out to investigate the importance level of each identified criterion. For this purpose, a Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method is used to investigate and distinguish the importance of the forces based on data collected using a questionnaire sent to academic experts in the fields of SSCM and O&G. It is found out that economic followed by competition factors are the most important external forces and regulations and energy transition are the least important forces influencing the SSCM of the O&G companies. Amongst the identified external forces, it is found that capital investment programs, investment in environment protection programs, international O&G companies, uncertainty in government’s energy policies and investment in social investment programs are top five most important factors affecting the O&G sustainable supply chain practices and political unrest, energy companies working in another fields of energy, opposition to company activities due to social issues, regulations on materials use, and policies promoting a level playing field for energy players are the least important criteria. The outcome of this study can be used as a tool in decision-making processes. It would assist the O&G companies to increase the effectiveness of their strategies with regard to SSCM implementation.","Sustainable supply chain management; Oil and Gas; Contextual factors; external forces; Multi criteria decision making","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Transport and Logistics","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor); Van der Toorn, A. (mentor); Verlaan, J.G. (mentor); Reedijk, J.S. (mentor)","2014","In December 2002 the highly innovative inflatable storm surge barrier near Kampen in the Netherlands was finished. This Ramspol barrier (named after the small villages next to it) has to protect the area surrounding the ""Zwarte Meer"" during north-western storms. These storms result in water setup that can cause severe problems for the very low area in the Eastern part of the Netherlands. One of the reasons to build an inflatable barrier instead of a more traditional barrier, amongst others reasons, was that it was expected to be an economically preferable solution. No real proof for this claim exists until now. This thesis focusses on a Life Cycle Cost (LCC) comparison between inflatable barriers and 'traditional' vertical lifting gate barriers. This means that all costs that occur during the lifetime of the barriers are taken into account. During this thesis a case study has been performed for the location of the Hartel barrier near Spijkenisse in the Netherlands. An inflatable barrier based on Ramspol has been designed for that location with the same requirements that hold for the original Hartel barrier. Based on this design the construction costs have been determined for such a barrier and these have been compared to the construction costs for the original barrier. Then maintenance strategies based on decompositions for both types of barriers have been determined in order to predict and calculate the expected maintenance costs in a deterministic way. In order to increase the reliability and get an insight in sensitivities a sensitivity analysis has been performed by making use of a Monte Carlo simulation. This provides results with a 5%, 50% and 95% confidence level. The LCC costs for both barriers are compared and checked with the deterministic results. Since this thesis is about a LCC comparison between the general types of barriers some general aspects, e.g. the influence of gate length, water depth, ship collision, etc., have been investigated. This is done mainly in a qualitative manner due to time considerations. The possible effects of the phenomena on both types of barriers are studied per phenomenon. These results are linked to the case study results and combined. The most important conclusions that follow from this thesis are:  For an inflatable barrier at the Hartel location both the construction- and the maintenance costs are lower compared to the original vertical lifting gate barrier. Over the total life cycle a cost reduction of about 20% could be achieved. The LCC with a 95% confidence level (upper bound) for the inflatable barrier is still about 9 million less lower than the LCC for the original barrier with a confidence level of 5% (lower bound).  In general can be said that inflatable barriers appear to be economically (and structurally) preferable when barriers are required with increased gate lengths or in deeper water. Furthermore, the design of inflatable barriers can possibly be improved by leaving out the abutments or by making it adaptable for increased water levels. This options increase the number of applications for inflatable barriers.  Based on the findings of this thesis the scores for inflatable barriers in a comparison between storm surge barriers is updated. Based on this updated comparison can be said that inflatable barriers should be considered as a serious option for almost all circumstances.","Life Cycle Costs; Inflatable barrier; Ramspol; Hartel; LCC; Construction costs; Costs","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic structures and flood risk","",""

(mentor); Quartel, C.D.A. (mentor); Baten, G. (mentor)","2014","The truck industry plays a major role in the transportation of goods within the European Union. Although the production of green house gasses has decreased in the past years, there is still room for improvement. The typical European truck nowadays is box-shaped due to current legislation. Upcoming changes of the European Commission in legislation on the maximum weights and dimensions of trucks offer the possibility to design more aerodynamic trucks, which will reduce fuel consumption and as a consequence, reduces the amount of greenhouse gasses. In addition to aerodynamic improvements, the upcoming changes should lead to an increase in safety and driver comfort as well. Furthermore, the extra length may not lead to an increased cargo capacity. Since there are no guidelines on the amount of length extension yet, this graduation project focuses on the investigation of the upcoming changes in legislation and the influence it will have on the typical European truck architecture and the styling that is related to it. The main goal is to find the sweet spot in truck layout. This project will function as a showcase of the future possibilities in truck layout. In order to create a solid foundation for the design of the future truck, four pillars of innovation are determined: aerodynamics, safety, layout and interior architecture. For aerodynamic purposes, it is key to keep the bodywork as clean as possible with the least amount of interruptions. This is specifically important for the transition between the frontal and side surface of the truck. The main focus on the safety topic will be on active safety for reducing the accident rates with trucks involved. Another major aspect to increase safety is the enlargement of the direct field vision of the truck driver. This is especially important in rural areas to prevent vulnerable road users to be in a collision with a truck. The frontal shape of the truck is very important for the ability to deflect other road users. The possible amount of length extension is investigated by creating a maximum design envelope for the future truck, in compliance with current legislation. An elongated front end of the truck has major implications for the truck its architecture. Due to the approach angle, axle loads and proper functioning in existing infrastructure, the front wheels are displaced in compliance with the front extension. A length extension is also beneficial for the level of comfort. Different interior setups are tested and rated. The chosen interior layout functions as a major input for the exterior on aspects like placement of the doors, A-, B- and C-pillars and the daylight opening. DAF’s unique selling point has been interior space and comfort. However, competitors have caught up in recent times. The current DAF trucks are proud and refined but lack an air of quality radiated by the exterior styling, while the surreptitious technology does live up to these standards. In the competitive field, DAF should aim at a more progressive and extravert spot, in order to draw the balance even between exterior styling and the high-end feel to the truck. This results in a paradigm shift from a proud and modest servant into a powerful leader. This is underlined by a more robust character that radiates more self-assurance and features a distinctive look. A future truck was realized using sketches, 3D-models and a physical model. The final outcome of the project is a 1:5 scale model of a future DAF truck, while keeping in mind all the challenges and in compliance with current legislation. Although the concept has not been tested on aerodynamics or safety performance, several factors are pointed out that are estimated to be an improvement in relation to the current typical boxy European trucks. This scale model is actually only a step in the design process and should not be seen as a final outcome that is ready for production. Several recommendations are made to further elaborate the design proposal towards a final new model.","trucks; mobility; DAF","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master specialisation Automotive","",""

For long distances, by boat, plane, truck, or for short distances, by conveyors, people, etc. The belt conveyor has been proven to be cost-effective, for transporting large amounts of material, in many scenarios. Improvements have been made in the past decades on energy efficiency as well as environmental impact. One of these improvements is the possibility to save energy by means of speed control. Energy efficiency decreases when the belt conveyor is not loaded to it’s designed potential. Therefore adjusting the speed, to make sure the belt is loaded correctly, could increase the energy efficiency of the system. However as a speed transition costs energy the possibilities of saving energy whilst using speed transitions should be researched.

(mentor); Van de Geer, S.G. (mentor)","2014","A skin lesion is an abnormal tissue formation on the skin, examples are skin cancers and nevi (moles and birthmarks). Every day, thousands of people have a skin lesion removed, for a number of different reasons. The lesion could be malignant (like skin cancers), show a risk of malignancy or removal could be for cosmetic or practical reasons. The skin lesion can either be removed in the hospital, by a dermatologist or surgeon, or by the patient’s GP. While it is a relatively simple procedure many people are referred to the hospital, where the costs are higher and two staff members, a surgeon or dermatologist and a nurse, are occupied for performing this procedure. In order to decrease the time and cost per procedure, as well as improve the situation for the patient, general practitioners have to be enabled to complete a skin lesion excision on their own. A new device could help achieve this goal. The device should be appealing and easy to work with and should make the experience for the patient as comfortable as possible. This graduation project started with an analysis phase in which a clear understanding of the skin lesion removal procedure was formed. Through interviews with GPs, surgeons and a dermatologist, as well as observations of minor surgery in both the hospital and at the GP, a list of requirements for the design was created. The GPs that already did minor surgery did not experience great difficulty performing skin lesion excisions, but they were interested in techniques that are faster and give better wound healing than currently employed methods. Using a function diagram the necessary functions to perform a skin lesion excision were identified, these six functions formed the basis for a morphologic chart. Wound closure is the step that takes the most time while performing a skin lesion excision with the methods currently available (mainly suturing), so it was clear this is the most important thing that can be improved with the use of a new design. Solutions for each function were generated and combined to generate several concepts with a new excision and wound closure method. The chosen design features an adhesive dressing that is applied to the skin around the lesion before the procedure, the GP performs the excision supported by the dressing and the wound is then zipped shut. Further iterations and testing were done to improve and detail the design. The final design, the Zip-Xcision, was subsequently evaluated by five GPs. These tests and interviews yielded further recommendations for improvement of the design, but also showed that this is a promising direction for wound closure in skin lesion excisions. It saves time and removes the need for the patient to return to the GP for suture removal. Clinical trials are needed to assess the effect of the new wound closure method on the number of infections that occur and the aesthetics of the scar.","skin lesion; minor surgery; wound closure; general practitioner; medisign","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design for Interaction, specialization Medisign","",""

The mobility of the wheeled systems are restricted to continuous path with small obstacle, legged locomotion requires only few proper footholds to compromise those obstacle, this makes legged locomotion ideal for scenarios like stairs, gaps, soft surface and other obstacle. These remarkable advantages of legged locomotion have inspired and persuaded robotics researchers to design and build legged robots. Biological studies have proven that the joint elasticity attributes more to the efficiency and robustness of legged animals. This marked the advent of compliance in legged robots. After the introduction of series elastic actuator (SEA) by MIT leg laboratory, several variants were built based on it. Still they lack proper position control characteristics.This gave rise to the concept of Variable impedance. Variable stiffness actuators a subset of variable impedance actuator, where the stiffness are varied either by pre-compression or using a mechanical transmission. current designs are not capable of changing there stiffness at loaded condition and stiffness changing time is slow under unloaded condition. Recent works have shown theoretically, that by varying the leg stiffness at any instance of gait cycle, energy can be added and removed from the system. Similarly using this concept to design a theoretical framework for automated transition from walking to running and vice-versa for a SLIP biped by varying its leg stiffness. This motivates the development of a variable stiffness actuator that can change its stiffness at faster rate independent of its loaded condition. The thesis work aims at conceptualizing, designing and building a variable stiffness actuator which inherits the capability of the previous designs and additionally capable of faster stiffness change under loaded condition.","variable stiffness actautor; legged robot","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-12-21","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

Due to reliability and processing issues, lead containing solders are still allowed and being used in high demanding microelectronics bonding application. Potential for reliable environmental friendly low temperature interconnects relies in the exceptional properties of Metallic Nanoparticle Pastes (MNPs). Combined with lithographically based stencil-printing of copper paste, the study proposes an insight in optimization of the paste use for wafer level fine pitch vertical interconnection. Copper nanoparticle is investigated as interconnect material. Despite its high oxidation tendency, Copper is compatible with the current interconnect materials used in microelectronics, has good electrical properties and is cheap as compared to silver or gold. In commercial available copper MNPs, organic coating is added to protect oxidation and to enable sintering by a combined effect of coating evaporation and temperature increase. The study investigates the fine pitch bonding process and the coated nanoparticle paste sintering behavior. Advanced electrical measurement structures for contact and sheet resistance are studied and integrated on newly designed test wafers optimized for bonding measurement. A high potential nanocopper paste fusing and oxidation behavior is then extensively studied during heating via in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) observations. Finally, sintering of the paste is evaluated and wafer bonding is successfully performed. Hardness of dried paste is measured to be 8.37 ± 0.6 Vickers Hardness (HV). Stencil printing method and wafer bonding is presented and discussed in detail. Good electrical resistivity of 78.4 ± 14.5 m?.µm (4.6 times that of theoretical bulk copper) is measured on sintered paste for 10 minutes at 260?

Modern technology makes it possible to develop the field in a more challenging way by making use of deviated to horizontal wells where and when needed. The Tambaredjo oilfield is encountered North and South of the Saramacca River. For this reason, the young generation of the State Oil Company Suriname speculate that the North and the South Block of the oilfield are well connected below the Saramacca River. Production of crude from below the Saramacca River requires the use of deviated to horizontal wells. As part of a huge ongoing research on deviated wells in the Tambaredjo Oilfield, a research study was conducted as an internship project. The area of interest for this research study is the southern part of the Tambaredjo Oilfield, near the Jossi Area. The aim of this study is to gain information and make a statement on the connectivity of the North and South Block of the Tambaredjo Oilfield below the Saramacca River. In order to achieve this goal, a set of nine 2D profiles were constructed through the area of interest, which were adapted and corrected after construction of a 3D profile. The data used for this research study consists of cutting descriptions, sidewall core descriptions, wire-line logging results, well proposals, formation evaluation reports, mud-loggers reports and gamma-ray log data of 11 wells. During the process of profile construction, knowledge gained from an extensive literature study on especially the depositional environment of the Tambaredjo Oilfield was used as reference. In this article the results of the research study are presented. From the results it is concluded that a good connectivity is observed for the North and South Block and positive advice can be given when it comes to the point to start drilling deviated to horizontal production wells below the Saramacca River, near the Jossi Area. The structure of the article is as follows: First, a general introduction of the State Oil Company Suriname and the research study itself is given. Afterwards, detailed information of the Tambaredjo Oilfield is presented. Then, the methodology of the research is presented followed by the results and discussion.

Lower-limb amputees and patients suffering from neurological diseases partly lack that ability. Therefore, prosthetic and rehabilitative devices have been designed to re- store and repair nominal locomotion. For bio-inspired control of these devices, the underlying physiological behavior of the lower-extremity must be identified and quantified. Deeper under- standing is also important to determine appropriate therapy for patients with upper motor neuron diseases. Different identification methods exist to quantify joint impedance during well-controlled, static tasks using continuous random perturbations. However, methods are lacking that which quantify joint impedance during walking The goal of this Master thesis was to experimentally validate a novel method to identify joint impedance during the stance phase of walking. The thesis investigated whether transient, endpoint perturbations applied using an instrumented treadmill were sufficient to identify the dynamics of a single-joint system where all properties were known. The influences from the experimental setup were evaluated and finally, the method was applied in a pilot study of a human subject standing on the treadmill. Results indicate that joint parameters could be consistently estimated with a good fit. How- ever, they were not physically meaningful and did not match the true parameters of the system. This was caused by influences from the experimental setup, which could not be di- rectly subtracted from the data. Model simulation demonstrated the sensitivity of the method to measurement noise and that the set of estimated parameters were not unique. The limitations of the method and the available experimental setup were carefully identified in this study. Thorough guideline for the method was developed which facilitates the use of the method and sharpens the goal for further research.","Transient Endpoint Perturbations (TEP); System Identification and Parameter Estimation (SIPE); joint impedance; validation; simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-11-24","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

(mentor); Van Zeijl, H. (mentor)","2014","LED-based lighting is becoming increasingly popular in recent year, but LED development especially for lighting application now seems unavoidable. The various benefits of LEDs and the continuous increase in their performance allied to the decrease of the manufacturing costs makes it quite attractive. It is widely believed that LEDs would be a reliable alternative to conventional fluorescent and incandescent lamps which dominate the lighting applications in the last century. Integration and packaging is one of the critical issues that enable efficient and reliable solution to fulfill modern lighting requirements. Wafer Level Packaging (WLP) is a promising method for having lower costs, higher reliability and superior yields. In order to further improvement of the functionality and controlling capabilities of LED lighting system, various sensors and other electronics can be monolithically integrated with LED package on the wafer level. 7-mask BICMOS process was invented and developed by DIMES in Delft University of Technology. Just as its name implies, this process only requires 7 masks to fabricate fully functional CMOS transistors, sensors, passive electronics and even integrated circuits. Based on this process, the monolithic integration of light sensor readout circuit on a novel LED wafer level package is presented in this thesis. A blue selective stripe-shape photodiode is utilized as the light sensor to sense the light intensity of the blue LED in every 10 ?s. In this case, the BXCD4545 blue power die with nominal forward current of 350 mA was selected. Subsequent to the fabrication of silicon package, blue LEDs are glued and mounted in the package. The analogue output of the senor will be firstly amplified and then, synchronously converted to the digital code by a 4-bit analogue to digital converter (ADC). Each sample signal is encoded to a 4-bit digital string that is corresponding to 16 different light intensity levels. Afterwards, the code can be fed to an off-chip microprocessor which enable further control and adding more smart functions for different application to the system. Excluding the microprocessor, all the other components such as light sensor, amplifier, ADC and other passive electronics are monolithically integrated on the LED wafer level package. Since the 7-mask BICMOS process is an easily feasible and cheap process, it has the potential to enlarge the integration scale and have more functions embedded in a single system. The present system offers a promising solution for the further research and development of smart LED package on the wafer level. The use of WLP not only makes it possible to apply the highly-developed and batch-production methods of integrated circuits to the LED packaging, but also makes it achievable to combine sensors and integrated circuits on one single chip with LED.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Department of Microelectronics","","Electronic Engineering","",""

After the age of 11 months, this coupling is largely inhibited so that each limb can be coordinated individually. For stroke patients however, bilateral coupling tends to return. The goal of this study is to experimentally identify bilateral coupling and quantify the underlying dynamics of the wrist joint. The experiment consist of a tracking task which is performed unimanually and bimanually. Conditions and levels of difficulties are varied within each task to investigate the behavior of bilateral coupling. Fifteen healthy adults and two stroke patients were tested in a setup with two haptic manipulators. MIMO SIPE techniques were used to identify and quantify the underlying dynamics of the wrist joint by fitting the data toA a newly designed bilateral neuromusculoskeletal model. Results showed that cross lateral proprioceptive reflexes could be identified in both the control group and for the stroke patients. By analyzing the interdependency of the parameters, a linear behavior in the intrinsic stiffness was estimated across the two limbs. A linear behavior implies a bilateral activation of the limbs. For stroke patients, cross lateral proprioceptive reflexes and bilateral activation of the limbs were dominating during the bimanual condition. These findings are of great importance for rehabilitation techniques. An increased coupled behavior of the limbs could be used either to increase neural activity, or should be suppressed because the paretic limb might influence the healthy limb.","bilateral coupling; stroke; SIPE; cross lateral proprioceptive reflex; bilateral activation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-12-18","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

(mentor); van Duin, R. (mentor); Lodewijks, G. (mentor)","2014","Port of Rotterdam is one of the biggest port infrastructures in the world which plays an important role for Dutch economy. While these container flows are handled by the port’s facilities, some containers require second-tier container services (e.g. repair, custom clearance, storage) which usually they are not provided at all of the facilities in the port and normally the container that requires them are not located at the facility that services are provided. Under the circumstances these containers needs to be transported to the location that those services are provided and moved again to another location after they have received the service; this category of transport services is referred to as Inter Terminal Transport and the system that provides it is called Inter Terminal Transport System. Due to planned developments of the port in the following years, it is expected that Port of Rotterdam absorbs more container flows in the following years which decreases the quality and efficiency of the functional operations that take place to facilitate Inter Terminal Transport. In other words, using Multi-Trailer System for providing Inter Terminal Transport in Port of Rotterdam become more and more inefficient in the following years. One of the possible ways to improve the efficiency of the Inter Terminal Transport In Port of Rotterdam is to investigate the possibilities to use Belt conveyors for Inter Terminal Transport. Belt conveyors are one of the most applied equipment in transport industry and here are numerous transport systems that use conveyor belts for handling loads (e.g. industrial packages) that has similar characteristics to intermodal containers. This similarity in application makes them as an interesting alternative option to be used as Inter Terminal Transport System. On the other hand, conveyor belts consume considerably more amount of energy in comparison with other transportation system which can decrease their attractiveness dramatically. Under the circumstances, energy efficient conveyor belts seem to be an interesting option for Inter Terminal Transport System in Port of Rotterdam in following years. Considering the problem the main research question in this thesis is stated as follow: How to design a belt conveyor system to transport possible future demand of Inter terminal transport of containers in Maasvlakte area of the port of Rotterdam in an energy efficient way? In order to answer this question, the objective of this study is set to determine to what extent it is feasible to implement energy efficient belt conveyor system to transport possible future container demand of Inter Terminal Transport in port of Rotterdam. The available theory about Port of Rotterdam and belt conveyors is used to create a Inter Terminal Transport System which is referred to as ”ITT Belt Conveyor System”. This system use belt on roller conveyors and turn tables in the Maasvlakte area and it is capable of providing transport service for the maximum amount of container demand in 2030. In the design process, trial layered model is used to identify stakeholders and systems engineering methodology is used to define the necessary quality attributes that any suggested system for Inter Terminal Transport should have. Detailed information about the ITT Belt Conveyor system is determined using a system engineering process, in which a conceptual model is created about the system and a physical model discuss how the functions and behavior of the system can be realized. In addition, step by step simulation studies are conducted in the project to visualize if the components of the system behave as it is expected from and to determine how far the performance of the ITT Belt Conveyor System can be judged. Resulted from these methodologies, a network consisting of 11 layers of conveyor belts and turn tables are suggested in this project which contains 125 dedicated path between each origin and destination. After conducting simulation studies, it is illustrated that ITT Belt Conveyor System I able to fulfil the requirements. Under this circumstance, ITT Belt Conveyor System can operates in Port of Rotterdam in an energy efficient manner; although ITT Belt Conveyor System is able to satisfy all of the requirements, but its design is highly ambitious.","experimental simulation; port; inter terminal transport; belt conveyer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-11-24","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

Mimi aims to make the hearing aid market more accessible by bringing hearing technology to your smartphone, Medigo wants to globalize the healthcare market by providing you with the opportunity to book your abroad treatment online, and Vimcar strives to democratise the second-hand car market by introducing a quality seal for used cars. Atlantic Labs believes in user-centered products and the startups were eager to explore how design could work together with the lean startup (Ries, 2011) methodology to foster successfull innovations. To that effect an exploratory project was undertaken, in which the context of the three startups was explored first in order to understand their way of working. Simultaneously solutions in the form of interventions were iteratively tested during this process. This thesis describes the analysis of a year worth of innovation by the startups as well as an exploration of the application of design in this context. It was found that the evaluation of their companies is of critical importance to the startups, especially at an early stage. The main priority the startups have is therefore to increase their investment readiness level (Blank, 2014). Design can facilitate in achieving higher levels of investment readiness both quicker and more proficiently by facilitating the harmonising of desirability, feasibility and viability. Design is used to this end in two ways: (1) In the application of the user-centered process and (2) by taking cues from design as an approach. In this thesis a guide is suggested which Atlantic Labs can provide their startups. The lean design guide explicitly tackles the application of a user-centered process for the startups; which tools/methods are relevant for the startups and when they can best apply them to proficiently achieve higher levels of investment readiness. The guide consists of six workshops, nine core tools and 39 additional tools. The workshops have been specifically developed for the startups and help them apply the core tools. They are divided into two sets, working towards problem/solution-fit (level 3) and product/market-fit (level 5) respectively: * Set 1 (towards problem/solution-fit) * Business model canvas workshop * Interview workshop * Storyboard workshop * Set 2 (towards product/market-fit) * Ideate workshop * Prototype workshop * User test workshop By facilitating the workshops Atlantic Labs has the opportunity to inspire the implementation of a process which allows the startups to develop a product that harmonizes desirability, feasibility and viability. Using the experience from these workshops, and leveraging the online component of the guide the startup can successfully implement design as an approach; increasing the likelihood of successful innovation.","user-centered design; lean startups; innovation process","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","","52.5167, 13.3833"

(mentor); Da Costa Junior, J. (mentor); Coll, A.L. (mentor)","2014","Electrification can have a major impact on the lives of those enduring energy poverty. A solar home system offers a sustainable and affordable electricity source for households in Mexican rural areas which are not connected to an electricity grid. Iluméxico, a social enterprise based in Mexico City, wishes to expand its current product portfolio beyond solar home systems. In this thesis a process is developed to guide Iluméxico’s portfolio expansion. An analysis of the company and the context it operates in shows an opportunity for new solar products that address the challenges of affordability and payback. Additional literature research indicates that the use of product-service design and sustainability evaluation methods in electrification projects can result in more sustainable projects, with a larger contribution to the alleviation of energy poverty. A structure for a new product portfolio is presented using a framework based on the theoretical assumption that rural households can be placed on an electrification ladder. An evaluation tool ensures that products will only be added to the new product portfolio when they offer sustainable solutions. The proposal framework has a focus on products that are complementary to solar home systems, aiming to increase the overall revenue stream for Iluméxico as well as to increase the positive impact of solar electricity on daily lives.","BoP; solar; portfolio; strategic; design; PV; Mexico; PSS","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2014","Even though maintaining upright quiet stance might be considered by humans as a trivial task, it requires a complex balance control mechanism, in which sensory, nervous and muscle subsystems continuously cooperate and interchange environmental information to stabilize posture. Age, diseases and medication often degrade the related subsystems and affect balance control. System redundancy in the closed-loop control system allows for corrections and, as such, certain balance control compensation strategies are employed by humans to regain stability. However, there are cases in which the compensation strategies are not sufficient, resulting in impaired human balance and increased risk of falling. Therefore, there is a need of an efficient model of human balance control, able to disentangle the underlying systems involved in standing balance and detect the primary source of balance control impairment. In the context of this study, first a multi-segmental human balance control model was developed, based on an experimental setup, which highly resembled balance control hazards encountered by humans in daily life. The model’s ability to describe the dynamics of the balance control subsystems and to quantify balance control parameters of physiological relevance was subsequently tested on simulated and experimental data, using system identification and parameter estimation techniques. The developed balance control model proved to be efficient in identifying the dynamics and estimating the related parameters of the nervous and muscle subsystems involved in standing balance, using the particular experimental paradigm. Further adjustments will enable the model to fully capture the dynamics of all of the underlying systems involved in standing balance and thus to be utilized in clinical applications.","modelling of human balance control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-12-18","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

(mentor); Grefte, A. (mentor); Prest, E.I.E.D. (mentor); Van der Laan, H. (mentor)","2014","Oasen has set itself the goal to “produce water of an impeccable quality and to delivery it flawlessly to its customers”. In formulating this goal, Oasen expresses its concern for unknown pollutants and the increasing concentrations of organic micro-pollutants in its source waters (primarily anaerobic groundwater). To achieve this goal, the company has devised a new treatment approach which is first to be implemented at an outdated treatment plant called ZS de Hooge Boom by 2018. The new approach centres on Reverse Osmosis (RO) as a primary barrier against pollutants, treating the anaerobic groundwater directly after abstraction. RO is followed by ion exchange (IEX) columns to remove remaining ammonium and a remineralisation step which is used to add calcium and magnesium. After these three treatment steps, the water is still anaerobic and contains methane (2700 ?g/L CH?). An additional step, capable of removing sufficient amounts of methane to produce biologically stable water, had to be designed. In contrast to conventional treatment, where part of the methane is broken down biologically in sand filters, the removal had to be achieved by a single aeration system. Additionally, experts expected large quantities of biomass to be produced on even very small concentrations of methane, which would lead to biological instability. There is however no legislation on the allowable concentration of methane and there was till now, no direct assay quantifying the effect of methane on the biological stability in drinking water. Two questions, therefore had to be answered: How much methane should be removed in order to produce biologically stable water? Which (aeration) system is most optimal to achieve this concentration? Growth potential tests were carried out on batches of samples containing various concentrations of methane. The yields of methane-oxidising bacteria (MOB) were calculated and the difference in cell volume between MOB and AOC bacteria (from control sample) was analysed. The results show that the yield of MOB on methane falls in the range of 8.6 x 10?-1.7 x 10? cells/?g CH? and that there is a factor 2 cell volume difference between MOB and AOC bacteria. Since the yield of bacteria on AOC is known (1x10? cells/?g AOC) the following bulk parameter for biological stability was derived: Bulk GP=C_AOC +C_(?CH?_4 )/Y_f =C_AOC +C_(?CH?_4 )/2.7 [?g AOC eq./L] This parameter takes into account the cell yields and the difference in cell volume so that the resulting value is a measure of the bio-volume produced on a certain amount of AOC and CH? and expresses this in AOC equivalents. With Oasen’s treatment approach, the AOC content is expected to be very low (<1 ?g/L) so that with an effluent methane concentration of 10 ?g/L, the bulk GP <5 ?g AOC eq. /L. Three aeration systems were tested in a pilot plant: Tower Aerators, Plate Aerators and Membrane Contactors. The latter has never been used for large scale drinking water treatment or the removal of methane. The three systems were tested for removal efficiency, a conceptual design was made and costs and energy consumption were estimated. Where necessary the gaps were filled with information found in literature. Having tested all three systems, a multi-criteria analysis was performed, in which it was determined that Tower Aerators are the most optimal treatment technique for the sufficient removal of methane in order to guarantee biological stability at Kamerik.","methane removal; drinking water; biological stability; bulk growth potential","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Sanitary Engineering","",""

However, fractional spurs and insufficiently low power dissipation are main problems related to conventional TDC-based structures. In this work, a sub-half mW 2.2 GHz - 3 GHz fractional-N ADPLL is presented for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) applications.

This prototype ADPLL was taped out on Sep. 11th 2014 in GlobalFoundries 40 nm Low Power (40 nm-LP) technology. Based on post-layout simulations and modelling, it is expected to consume less than 450 ?W with integrated rms jitter of 1.5 ps for the close integer channel and 800 fs for the rest of channels, leading to a potential state-of-art FoM below -240 dB.

(mentor); Forzoni, A. (mentor)","2014","To assess, and validate the most recent interpretations on the Panther Tongue\rq{}s depositional history we use the conceptual process-response model, 2Dstratsim. The focus of this study is on the Ksp040 parasequence which reflects the wave-dominated shoreface along the southern Wasatch Plateau. The associated Panther Tongue delta to the north is considered as the dominant sediment source for the Ksp040 parasequence. As a result of the complex 3D nature of the individual Panther Tongue delta lobes it is infeasible to correlate it to a 2D simulated profile of 2Dstratsim. Before field data is used in the 2Dstratsim model, the model is first brought to a workable level through debugging, and rewriting of the C++ source code. Then the model uses parameterised equations together with user implemented input signals in a forward routine to generate a cross-sectional profile of a shoreface on a linear decreasing initial surface. This forward routine is used through inversion techniques to automatically correlate measured, and simulated logs with the data format average grain-size to depth. By generating a best match between these logs, the forcing signals of the geologic environment are disentangled. To disentangle the forcing signals of the Panther Tongue first the cross-sectional diagram of the Panther Tongue\rq{}s shoreface is modified to prepare it for a visual correlation to the simulated cross-sections based on observed bedset characteristics. Then, the measured average grain-size log data is digitised to enable a detailed correlation calculation between the measured, and simulated logs. New tools are added to examine the model\rq{}s output graphically, in addition existing ones are enhanced. Four forward scenarios are created based on the bedset characteristics of the shoreface to set preliminary parameters, and constrain the statistical functions of the inversion routine. This improves the automated correlation procedure between the measured logs and the simulated logs. The forward scenarios use two different geologic settings, with, and without back-barrier formation on the shoreface profile. These settings are again subdivided into a scenario where solely the sea level is changed to match the simulated profile to the measured cross-sectional diagram. The other scenario primarily uses fluctuations in the sediment supply to match the cross-sections, and uses the sea level to a minimal extent. In the inversion scenario the model is matched to the simulated logs of the forward scenario, that was created without back-barrier formation, and only changes in sea level. Because the model requires additional work to generate a profile from the field measured logs. This issue is related to the stability and sensitivity of the 2Dstratsim model, the difference in average grain-size classification between the model and the field, and the gaps in the individual measured logs. Thus, 2Dstratsim can be used to create sedimentary environments using the forward routine. The model is also able to use its inversion routine to automatically recreate sedimentary environments to a limited extent as no geologic constraints are considered in this routine. Therefore, there is no assurance that the final result is geologically plausible. Additionally, extensive preliminary work is required to use the inversion routine.","forward; inverse; model; 2Dstratsim; Panther Tongue; process-response","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

An intriguing aspect of this tsunami is the delayed arrival of a destructive wave, larger than the initial wave, at Talcahuano harbour three hours after the initial earthquake shock. The 2010 Chile tsunami has been modelled using H2Ocean tsunami model using Moreno’s, Delouis’ and Vigny’s earthquake solutions. Each earthquake model produces realistic tsunami wave fields and predicts the large wave which severally flooded the Bay of Concepción. Numerical simulations also show persistent sea surface oscillations for several hours. The computed surface elevations have been processed to compute the energy flux. The energy flux shows the presence and the important role of edge waves during this event. It shows that constructive wave interference of two edge waves over the submarine canyon nearby Cobquecura leads to the large wave which destroyed Talcahuano harbour.","Tsunami","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-12-29","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience and Remote Sensing","","","","-36.695920, -73.048611"

Full-thickness cartilage discs (Ø = 8.5 mm, n = 3) were extracted from healthy equine femoral condyle (n = 2). The diffusion of four different contrast agent baths (Condition A: Visipaque 320 mg/ml, 290 mOsmol/kg; Condition B: Visipaque 320 mg/ml, 600 mOsmol/kg; Condition C: Visipaque 160 mg/ml, 290 mOsmol/kg; Condition D: Hexabrix 320 mg/ml, 600 mOsmol/kg) was allowed only through the articular surface. Samples were imaged with a micro computed tomography scanner (micro-CT) before the contrast agent bath was applied, and after 5, 10, 20, 30 minutes and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 24, 30, 36, and 48 hours. Findings show that osmolality and concentration do not have a pronounced effect on diffusion. However, concentration influence on diffusion is seen on zonal curves. Moreover, the diffusion coefficient of Hexabrix was between 2.9 and 8.6 times lower than that of Visipaque that reflects the important effect of solute’s charge on the transport through charged hydrated tissue such as articular cartilage. Slightly different diffusion coefficient observed within dilute and concentrated Visipaque baths suggested deviation from ideal Fickean behavior within articular cartilage. However, close diffusion coefficients of cartilage exposed to low and high osmolality baths confirmed the minor effect of osmolality on the transport of neutral solutes.","articular cartilage; diffusion; contrast agent; contrast enhanced computed tomography; Visipaque; Hexabrix; cartilage zones; diffusion coefficient","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-12-18","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

(mentor)","2014","There are two important perspectives in Green ICT (Green Information & Communication Technology). First, is the Primary Level Segment (PLS) which deals with minimizing the negative impact of ICT use on environment and greening the ICT infrastructure of an organization [4]. Second, is the High Level Segment (HLS) which uses ICT as an enabler to create a sustainable world (The term HLS in green ICT has been coined from the International Telecommunication Union conference in Paris, Sept 2012) [5]. Both perspectives aim at reducing the carbon footprint and solving complex environmental challenges. The present world is seething with excessive carbon emissions, heat production, chemical wastes, power wastage and abundant usage of natural resources which needs to be controlled. In a technology-driven era, most of these negative impacts are being caused by technologies themselves. PLS aims to manage the ICT infrastructure by introducing smart, intelligent, compact & sustainable trends so that the ICT environment of an organization can be made greener and environment friendly. The companies contribute to PLS through singular action where they perform sustainable practices within the company and the impact is felt in the company level. When an ICT trend is used as an enabler for achieving sustainability, it is termed as a green ICT trend (e.g. cloud computing, smart grids, e-governance) and contributes to the HLS through collective action where several actors participate together to create and exchange value in a network. In this research, PLS has been analyzed from an organizational or micro-perspective, whereas the HLS portrays the macro-perspective of an ecosystem or an economy and is dependent on the individual contributions of PLS in establishing a sustainable world. Organizations are increasingly incorporating sustainable practices in their business operations but they often miss out on where these practices are headed and what impact it can have on the macro-level. Channelizing the sustainability objectives of an organization towards that of the ecosystem is one of the major challenges, the world is facing today across various sectors and industries. Literature distinguishes a clear knowledge gap between PLS and HLS which needs to be bridged in order to align the micro and macro perspectives. If the perspectives are aligned, companies can get a better understanding of how they are contributing to the sustainability of the macro ecosystem; which are the fronts they should improve on and what the best method to do so is. The energy sector presents a case in the research and the smart grids technology is the green ICT trend which will be analyzed on the backdrop of PLS and HLS. Smart grids is a promising technology that has the potential to solve complex energy issues and green the energy sector and therefore it will be used to explain the coordination between PLS and HLS. The research will propose a mechanism to bridge the knowledge gap between PLS and HLS and analyze the value created, to support the possibility of the mechanism in contributing towards a sustainable economy (further discussed in 1.1). The proposed method will also be used to explore whether public good can be generated through the smart grid network as a value addition. The research approach is to propose a high level design of an open ICT platform for monitoring energy performance of companies through literature study and exploring the possibility of the platform solution by conducting interviews of experts from businesses, energy companies, and government and academic researchers. The determined platform design will provide insight into what the necessary conditions are for creating an open ICT platform for smart grids. Furthermore the value network analysis will delineate who the important actors are and what values they can exchange from using the platform. In the results, a risk and a positive attribute analysis will give a practical overview of the developments that need to be made in functional requirements of the platform. Additionally, whether initiatives like corporate social responsibility (CSR) can lead to value addition through the platform will also be analyzed in the research. This study can pave the way for future research on open platforms for smart grids and how they can be useful for controlling the energy trends in the economy. Especially, the financial perspective can be investigated in detail, as to who will fund the platform and what the return on investment will be. Apart from this, the conditions for implementing the platform that will be highlighted in this research, can be further investigated to validate if these conditions are sufficient or more considerations are needed to be addressed for implementation. The perspective of business as users of the platform is taken in this research, future direction can include the perspective of regulators and common households, in order to expand the usability and utility of the open platform in the field of sustainability. Future research can also make this study a base and formulate similar sustainability monitoring mechanisms in top sectors other than energy.","Green ICT; open ICT platform; sustainable economy; sustainability; value network; value addition; value; CSR; incentives","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","ICT","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor); Ndreko, M. (mentor)","2014","Driven mainly by the Kyoto Protocol and the EU climate action (20-20-20 targets), the country members of the European Union have taken actions towards the reduction of emissions and the increase of the electricity generated by Renewable Energy sources (RES) [49]. According to studies of the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSOE), the participation of RES generation in the generation mix of Europe will be majorly increased compared to the present situation [2]. According to these studies a major contributor to this RES increase will be Germany. The German government’s energy transition plan [5], intends to replace most of the country’s nuclear generation with renewable energy generation. A large part of the renewable energy generation will come from offshore wind parks. These windparks will be located in the north of Germany, in the North and Baltic seas. This change in generation mix will affect the geographical distribution of Germany’s generation sites leading to possible threats for the secure operation of the German transmission system [3]. In order to overcome congestions in the transmission system the German Transmission System Operators (TSOs) have proposed the construction of four High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) transmission corridors which will be embedded in the German transmission system. These HVDC corridors (termed A, B, C and D) will span from the north to the south of the country and will facilitate the transmission of the large offshore wind generation in the north to the large load centers in the south. This MSc thesis focuses on studying the effect of Corridor A on the transient stability of the transmission system. Due to the proximity of Corridor A to the German border with the Netherlands and thus the proximity of its HVDC converter stations to the Dutch transmission system it is interesting to see if and how this HVDC corridor affects the transient stability of the German as well as the Dutch transmission system. An analysis of the control parameters of the VSC-HVDC under various faults in the AC system is implemented in order to examine their effect on the voltage of the AC network and the rotor angles of the system’s online generators. The grid code compliance of Corridor A with the short circuit current contribution and its effect on the system’s voltage and rotor angle response of its generators will be observed. Additionally this thesis studies the effect a sudden loss of Corridor A will have on the power tie-line power between the Dutch and German power systems and the rotor angle stability of generators located both in the Nethrlands and Germany. In order to perform the aforementioned studies time-domain simulations will be performed using Siemens PTI’s software tool Power System Simulator for Engineers (PSS®E).","VSC-HVDC transmission; transient stability; voltage support","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Electrical Power Grids","","Electrical Power Engineering","",""

These, in addition to the uncertainty of the climate change, point towards the need for adaptive sustainable solutions. Floating urbanisation is an old concept, which recently is gaining attention since it combines solutions for the above-mentioned problems. A number of aspects need to be investigated in order to move forward with the implementation of floating urbanisation. One of them is the possible effect on the water quality and ecology. Since water quality is a complex problem this thesis will focus on the effect of floating houses on Dissolved Oxygen levels. A small floating residence of six houses in the area of Delft will serve as a case study. In this area a measurement campaign in the months of July to September 2013 was conducted in order to collect data, which later served to assess the impact of the floating houses. The results from the field measurements were further evaluated by analysing which physical property or weather condition is responsible for the observed Dissolved Oxygen differences. Later on, a numerical model was developed in order to analyse in more detail the sources of these effects on Dissolved Oxygen. In particular the consequences of shadow and wind tunnel effect, induced by the floating houses, were studied. The results of the measurements and numerical simulations showed that there are differences on the Dissolved Oxygen levels in the upper part of the water column. The average measured differences are close to 10% (1mg/L), similar to the results obtained by the numerical models. Nevertheless, both of the floating houses effects (shadow and wind tunnel) are active on the same region of the water column, which makes it difficult to isolate their contributions. Further research and improvements on data collection and model development is recommended.","Water Quality; Floating Houses","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water Resources","",""

(mentor); Spronck, J.W. (mentor)","2014","During rough sea conditions, vessel motions prevent people to be transferred safely from one ship to another. To increase accessibility, the Ampelmann system has developed a Ship to Ship (S2S) transfer system . The Ampelmann system is a ship-based, self stabilizing platform that actively compensates all vessel motions using a Stewart platform. In this way, a motionless transfer deck is created. A gangway attached to this transfer deck can then be used to compensate the motion of the other vessel, called the target-vessel, so transfers can be made safe, easy and fast. Currently the motions of the target-vessel are measured by an Motion Reference Unit (MRU) which needs to be mounted on the target-vessel. This MRU is expensive, must be powered and needs to be installed on the target vessel before any controlled S2S transfers are possible. During operation the motion data measured by the MRU is relayed to the Ampelmann system via WiFi. This connection often fails or has an interruption, during this time the Ampelmann system is not able to compensate for the motion of the target vessel. This means that the operator has to manually control the gangway in order to make S2S transfers. Although the current setup for S2S is functional, their is a lot of room for improvement. The usage of the MRU on the target-vessel is not desirable because it means that before any transfer the MRU needs to be installed on the vessel. The regulations for installing external systems on vessel that can carry gas and oil are very stringent to insure safety. The wireless connection between the two vessel is an inherent weakness in the complete system. In this research, a new measuring system for S2S transfers has been developed which can mounted on the transfer deck of the Ampelmann system thus eliminating any sort of wireless data transfer. This system will use a Laser Rangefinder (LRF) to create a spatial 2D representation of the target-vessel. These 2D spatial images are than compared to a reference in a matching algorithm to extract the motion of the target-vessel. To test this novel way of measuring ship motions, a prototype of a LRF is build and tested. The algorithms for extracting the motion of the target-vessel where tested with a scale-model test setup.

(mentor)","2014","Wave climates in ports can determine the efficiency of port operations to a large extent, so good predictions of them are important. This thesis therefore focusses on the modelling of wave penetration in ports, using several numerical models as well as a physical model. The goal is to compare numerical wave models for the use of wave penetration in ports and to determine application boundaries. An overview of existing classes of numerical wave models and their potential for modelling wave penetration in ports is made first. This leads to the conclusion that mild-slope models, Boussinesq-type models and non-hydrostatic models are probably the most appropriate. From each of these model classes an operational model is chosen (i.e. PHAROS, TRITON and SWASH) for further study. It is demonstrated that these models are all capable of accurately reproducing analytical solutions for linear shoaling and diffraction. These two wave processes are, together with reflection, identified as crucial for wave propagation in harbours. Differences between these models are pointed out as well. Most notable are the differences in underlying equations, schematisations of boundaries and computational efficiency. To be able to study the performance of operational numerical models for wave penetration in ports, in scenarios that are more realistic than analytical benchmark test cases, measurements from a physical model are used. The physical model represents a typical seaport, is schematised to facilitate numerical modelling, uses three layouts with increasing complexity, and is subjected to a large variety of wave conditions. The physical modelling is carried out at Deltares in the framework of one of their projects and the produced dataset will become freely available. A selection of the 57 scale model tests are analysed in detail and numerically simulated using PHAROS, TRITON and SWASH. A comparison between the simulation results and the corresponding physical model measurements shows that TRITON and SWASH are capable of modelling the penetration of primary waves in ports. PHAROS simulations are less accurate and appear to overestimate wave heights in areas sheltered from direct wave attack, which is ascribed to its specific use of reflection boundaries. Wave conditions with very large wave height over depth ratios (up to 0.5), where wave breaking is significant, can still be simulated accurately with both PHAROS and SWASH. TRITON could not be used to simulate these wave conditions due to numerical instabilities. The total amount of low frequency wave energy modelled by TRITON and SWASH corresponds well with measurements from the physical model (for PHAROS this comparison is not made). Specific harbour oscillations are however only reproduced qualitatively by all three numerical models.","wave modelling; port; harbour; PHAROS; TRITON; SWASH","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

These, in addition to the uncertainty of the climate change, point towards the need for adaptive sustainable solutions. Floating urbanization is an old concept, which recently is gaining attention since it combines solutions for the above-mentioned problems. A number of aspects need to be investigated in order to move forward with the implementation of floating urbanization. One of them is the possible effect on the water quality and ecology. Since water quality is a complex problem this thesis will focus on the effect of floating houses on Dissolved Oxygen levels. A small floating residence of six houses in the area of Delft will serve as a case study. In this area a measurement campaign in the months of July to September 2013 was conducted in order to collect data, which later served to assess the impact of the floating houses. The results from the field measurements were further evaluated by analyzing which physical property or weather condition is responsible for the observed Dissolved Oxygen differences. Later on, a numerical model was developed in order to analyze in more detail the sources of these effects on Dissolved Oxygen. In particular the consequences of shadow and wind tunnel effect, induced by the floating houses, were studied. The results of the measurements and numerical simulations showed that there are differences on the Dissolved Oxygen levels in the upper part of the water column. The average measured differences are close to 10% (1mg/L), similar to the results obtained by the numerical models. Nevertheless, both of the floating houses effects (shadow and wind tunnel) are active on the same region of the water column, which makes it difficult to iso- late their contributions. Finally, the small amount of data collected and the uncertainty that is inherent in water quality modeling hinder us from drawing a definite conclusion regarding the effects of floating houses on Dissolved Oxygen levels. Further research and improvements on data collection and model development is recommended.","water quality; floating houses","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water Resources","",""

(mentor); Scholten, D.J. (mentor); De Vries, L.J. (mentor)","2014","In the aftermath of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011, several countries have decided to rethink their energy policies and subjected their nuclear reactors to stress tests. According to national law drafted in 2003, Belgium must have phased out all seven nuclear reactors by 2015-2025. However, to date Belgium still has not presented a clear plan how to replace their nuclear power climate-friendly and securely while maintaining an acceptable electricity price. According to the Belgian energy development plan, renewable energy sources will play an important role in power generation in the coming decade, but the uncertain investment environment undermines the confidence of energy investors. Belgium will not reach its 2020 EU target and even suffer from power shortages if it maintains the status quo. This paper aims to give new insights into the assessment of RES-E policy instruments and provide possible solutions to improve the RES-E promotion system in Belgium. To realize these objectives, the paper mainly uses the multi-system framework, neoclassical economics and new institution economics throughout the study. To be specific, the research firstly uses the multi-system framework to clarify the RES-E investment environment, and then based on economics theories and existing experiences, defines six policy assessment criteria to evaluate the policy instruments. In the case study of Belgium, the current Belgian power market situation is presented following an adapted multi-system scheme. Furthermore, the history of Belgian RES-E policy instruments are shown as well. With six defined policy assessment criteria, this paper evaluates policy performances of four main RES-E policy schemes in the case of Belgium. Based on the evaluation results, we find that Belgium is most in need of improving the policy performances on cost effectiveness, transaction and administration cost efficiency and compatibility. To improve this situation, three policy options have been listed for Belgium, two of which are recommended in light of the specific characteristics of the Belgian case. Specifically, we suggest Belgium improve its current TGC system and investment subsidies on the one side, and try to implement a tendering scheme on the other side. In the research, some scientific contribution and practical contribution is recognized as follows. Firstly, an adapted multi-system framework for power generation is established, which could simplify the investment environment and make it possible to get a quick overview of one country’s power sector. Secondly, applying new institutional economics in the study is a meaningful step in the field of policy assessment. Most existing studies evaluate the policy scheme only on effectiveness and cost efficiency, but this paper not only summarize and define six policy assessment criteria but also make explanation on each of them based on economic theories and practical experiences. Finally, other countries besides Belgium could also evaluate their RES-E policy schemes in a more comprehensive and accurate manner with six policy assessment criteria and find the right improving direction for the RES-E promotion system. It is certain that there are limitations in this research. For instance, there might be other investment determinants which I have ignored; the policy assessment criteria are defined only based on certain theories and limited experiences; this paper only focuses on four main RES-E policy instruments and one case study, etc. All of these should be improved by future studies.","electricity generation investment; neoclassical economics; new institution economics; multi-system framework; renewable energy support schemes; policy assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-06-18","Technology, Policy and Management","Values, Technology and Innovation","","","",""

When this information is archived over time, it could be analyzed to elicit trends and gauge the level of interest in particular topics. A novel way of visualizing this data would make such large datasets more approachable for the general public, and thus make it possible for publishers to extract additional value out of the available news stories. A user interface that helps the user navigate through the large document cor- pus would improve users’ perception of the value of the news content, and ensure continued consumption of this content. There were two aspects to building the right user interface - the usability of the interface itself, and the appropriateness of the vi- sual metaphor used to visualize the data. This thesis adopts an iterative approach to building the most usable interface to achieve this goal. Starting with an initial design based on study of the system and literature in the ?eld, design iterations were carried out, with a usability testing phase at the end of each iteration. The resulting interface provides a simple way to navigate news article archives in terms of concepts like peo- ple, places and organizations.

(mentor); Prins, J.F. (mentor)","2014","Philips Lighting acquired the Genlyte group in January 2008. For 4 years Philips continued to manage the acquired company at arms-length, but in 2012 started working on integrating the many brands into one Philips structure. The Fall River group was one of those brands, previously known as Lightolier. Their R&D department of 40 engineers specializes in Indoor Point Source Recessed Downlighting, specifically for Retail, Hospitality and Office purposes. The integration into Philips and the resulting product rationalization caused significant changes in the Fall River group, and led to expected disturbances in the business. Now that the integration process is complete the Fall River group is making an innovative leap forward, and developing a best-in-class product portfolio based on Philips technology. This project is aimed at developing an innovative solution that works towards restoring the position of Philips at the forefront of luminaire design in North America. This presents a major challenge: there is significant complexity in much of the recessed downlighting portfolio due to years of incremental development. Additionally, Philips caters to a much larger market than Lightolier originally could, encouraging the Fall River group to step outside their comfort zone. This project takes a two-pronged approach: learn what the client wants through discussions with sales and marketing experts, and understand what the company is capable of through discussions with engineers within the department. This leads to a broad design phase, where many individual problems are investigated separately. Careful analysis of the recessed downlighting frame, light-engine and reflector led to questioning of the practicality of having custom frames with each individual lighting product. The make-up of the products is also questioned. The final concept completely overthrows the current frame, replacing it with a simple bar. The lighting products are no longer reliant on the frame to be placed in the ceiling, but become independent light units that have almost complete freedom in placement. The number of frames is reduced from several hundred to one, significantly reducing the number of Stock Keeping Units for both Philips and its distributers. Standardized electronic connectors are used that allow for significantly faster and easier installation for contractors, and make it possible to match the concept frame to any light-engine. Lastly, the positioning of the driver is changed, integrating all the electronic components into one unit. Initial evaluation interviews with sales managers appear to have positive reactions. The reduction in Stock Keeping Units is appreciated, as well as the simplification of stock keeping, transport, and use of economies of scale. Additionally, sales estimation can become more accurate, and lead-times shorter. At this stage there are two major questions that influence the feasibility of the concept. The first regards the heat dissipation of the light-engine when the driver and LED board are placed together. The second is a legal obstacle concerning the positioning of the junction box. At this stage it is expected that with the right legal approach, as well as further technological improvement these obstacles can be overcome.","recessed; downlighting; Philips; lightolier; luminaire; portfolio; rationalization; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2014","Fatigue loads and failures in metallic structures are a well-known technical problem. Commonly, the fatigue life of the steel elements is determined by an analytical calculation using S-N curves as design resistance to periodic action. However, the technological improvements in almost all structures continuously stretch the limits of acceptance levels of flaws in structures. Consequently, crack growth control might provide an assessment tool in lifetime predictions. BS 7910 provides a general procedure to predict fatigue crack growth commonly addressed as fracture mechanics fatigue assessment. It is based on the well-known Paris Law relationship which relates the crack growth rates to the stress intensity factor range. BS 7910 provides a library of SIF solutions to support this procedure. However, several limitations are contained which trigger research for possible extensions Furthermore, it is common that a more sophisticated method than the analytical is usually required to predict fatigue crack growth. FEM, as one of the most sophisticated numerical methods; it is widely used as a tool to predict fatigue life. From this, stems the need for research on the FEM to predict fatigue crack growth. The purpose of the present thesis is to present these topics, evaluate the current status and examine possible extensions. At first, the terminology related to fracture mechanics and fatigue crack growth is explained and an evaluation of the current BS 7910 stress intensity factor solutions is conducted. Then, the results of a research on new SIF solutions outside the limitations of BS 7910 based on FEM analyses are presented. At the end of the thesis, a study on the various numerical and analytical techniques to perform a fatigue crack growth analysis is conducted.","Finite Element; Fatigue; Stress Intensity Factor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2014","Prediction of the stock market has been a research topic for decades. Recently, data from social media like Google and Twitter are included in prediction models. This data serves as an indicator of sentiments that are potentially useful for prediction. Interpretation of current prediction methods is cumbersome. Beforehand it is not known which data is relevant for the prediction and hence which data should be added to the model. To improve interpretability and thereby credibility of the results, this thesis uses sparse regression methods that automatically discard data that is not useful for the prediction. Current methods induce sparsity via L1-regularization such as the LASSO. In contrast to traditional applications, this thesis assumes that a sparse, time-varying regression vector is estimated from time series data that arrives sequentially over time. Data can thus not be treated in batch form where constant behavior over a window is assumed and hence performance of current sparse regression methods is limited. Therefore, a new Weighted Sparse Kalman Filter (Weighted-SKF) is proposed that induces sparsity in the KF equations. The KF is able to track time-varying behavior, while the sparsity ensures that interpretable results are obtained. Simulations demonstrate that the Weighted-SKF outperforms current regression methods in identifying the time-varying support and regression vector. Moreover, the time-varying usefulness of social media data is demonstrated: the Weighted-SKF includes social media data in its prediction model only during large declines in the stock market.","L1 regularization; sparsity; LASSO; prediction; stock market","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

Two series of late-Weichselian Barents Sea sediment models were created, the first using in-situ observations on sediment displacements and the second using data on glacial erosion from a numerical ice sheet dynamics model. These sediment models were used to run the GIA- model using various viscosity profiles, which approximate the local rheology of the Fennoscandian region. The results were compared with paleo sea level records, GPS-based vertical uplift rates and GRACE gravity changes.

(mentor); Haagsman, E. (mentor)","2014","This project describes the development of a redesign of NHGDoc for ExpertDoc. NHGDoc is a clinical decision support system (CDSS) that supports Dutch GP’s in their decision making process by providing patient-specific medical advices with regard to medication, treatment and diagnosis. NHGDoc is integrated in the EHR provider of GP’s, a supportive computer program to document, transfer and evaluate care that is given to patients. A majority of all potential NHGDoc users consists of moderately active and inactive users. In the analysis phase, a number of explorative studies was done. A literature review was performed to identify possible barriers and facilitators for the acceptance of CDSS’s among GP’s. Also, a user study was performed to gain insight into the workflow of GP’s, their values and attitudes towards CDSS’s. These studies revealed a number of interesting insights that could possibly explain why a relatively large group of GP’s does not regularly use NHGDoc to support their decision making process. A major barrier is failure to fit the workflow of GP’s, by providing excessive amounts of alerts that are not always actionable or relevant. Moreover, there is a worry that CDSS’s preclude the GP’s ability of own reasoning and hinder the interaction with patients during patient consultations. The user study revealed that GP’s experience continuous time constraints during work. Also, the interaction with the computer during patient consultations is kept to a minimum in order to fully focus on the patient. The following design goal was formulated: “Make a redesign of NHGDoc that improves the quality of interaction and user experience and makes the tool fit within the workflow of GP’s in order to increase the number of active users.” The aim in the redesign of NHGDoc was to tackle the barriers that were identified in the analysis phase and to obey the values of GP’s. The design proposal consists of two main features: the NHGDoc medical advices and the NHGDoc to do lists. A list of medical advices for a specific patient can be accessed via the NHGDoc button, which is positioned in the patient health record. Medical advices can be related to different disease domains. Advices related to different disease domains are split up in separate tabs. GP’s are able to indicate what advices are important to him and what advices are not relevant. Advices can be ‘flagged’ to indicate that they are of important to the GP or important for a specific patient. Flagged advices will be positioned at the top of the list, also in future alerts, to make sure these advices are read first. Irrelevant or disturbing advices can be hidden. All preferences that are made are also applied to future alerts, so that is easier for GP’s to focus on the information that is relevant to him. The presence of flagged advices is indicated by the appearance of the NHGDoc button, to make the GP’s aware of the presence of advices that are important to him. By hovering over the NHGDoc button, a ‘sneak preview’ of the available advices is shown, in which information is given about the importance of the advices and the disease domains they are related to. The sneak preview enables GP’s to assess the relevance of available advices and enables him to directly view the advices that are most relevant in that situation. The purpose of these functionalities is to support the GP in finding information that is most relevant without spending too much time on reading through an extensive list of advices. This is important to make sure the GP is not hindered in its workflow. By the placement of an NHGDoc button behind the patient’s name in the agenda overview, the GP is motivated to view advices before the consultation starts. This is done to make sure the GP is able to focus on the patient instead of the computer during the patient consultation. The purpose of the To Do functionality is to allow GP’s to postpone advices and view them later, in case there is no time to process them directly. Moreover, the To Do functionality allows GP’s to delegate tasks to colleagues.","CDSS; Workflow; General Practitioner","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

Firstly, a lack of process control and understanding is limiting the design freedom. Secondly, a lack of process repeatability and standards are prohibiting process certification. A Knowledge Base System was developed for the centralization and standardization of knowledge, on the effect of input parameters on process performance. Novel methods for Design for Manufacturing, and Design for Cost were developed and validated using a Design of Experiments.","Additive Manufacturing; 3D printing; Selective Laser Melting; Heat Transfer; Knowledge Based System; Design for Manufacturing; Design for Cost; Knowledge Based Engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Flight Performance and Propulsion","","","",""

(mentor)","2014","Decision Support Systems (DSSs) that are used nowadays by water managers often predict states that do not correspond with the observed states. This is caused by changing parameters in the real systems, while the parameters used in the current DSSs are kept at a fixed level or follow a temporal pattern that does not always represents reality. Usually, these parameters are calibrated in an off-line setting, but when utilising in an on-line system there is a significant drift in performance. Therefore, there is a high need to some form of on-line parameter estimation that reduces the differences between the modelled and observed states. The objectives of this study, in order to reduce the differences between the modelled and observed states, read: (1) defining the state-of-the-art knowledge on optimisation of DSSs regarding on-line parameter updating and optimisation techniques for modelling of large-scale river networks; (2) determining whether automatic parameter updating is possible with reasonable results in a twin experiment set-up for different normative scenarios, with respect to parameter identifiability, model bias and model performance; (3) determining whether automatic parameter updating is possible with real measurement data, with respect to the same performance indicators; and (4) determining how much the performance does improve when implementing some form of parameter updating. The first objective is addressed by former studies (e.g.[2],[4],[7],[9]), which have confirmed On-line Parameter Estimation (OPE) can be applied successfully as a tool to decrease model discrepancies. Both the Doesn’t Use Derivatives (DuD) algorithm, [1], and the Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCE) algorithm, [2], have proved to be robust and effective methods for parameter estimation in multiple fields of expertise, e.g. [3],[4],[5],[6],[7]. The DuD algorithm is utilised in this study, since initial model results have illustrated that the high robustness level of the DuD algorithm. The second objective is addressed by constructively up-scaling the amount of calibration parameters by using several scenarios. The optimisation results are analysed extensively regarding the model performance in terms of robustness, effectiveness, efficiency and model bias. Prior to the OPE, an initial model analysis is performed to determine the model sensitivity to parameter perturbations and identifiability and uniqueness of the optimisation parameters. The analyses of the scenarios’ results demonstrate a high level of model performance, in terms of the performance indicators, in a twin experiment set-up. However, coincidentally the bias follows the temporal pattern in model states, which is probably a numerical error induced by the OPE tool. Nonetheless, the level of bias is sufficiently low to neglect this effect. Third objective is addressed by following the same procedure as for the second objective. However now, the observational data is assigned with white noise in order to facilitate upscaling of the twin experiment set-up to field conditions. The analyses of the results illustrate that up-scaling to field condition is very well possible, since the results show high levels of robustness, effectiveness and efficiency while suppressing the model bias. The fourth objective is addressed by implementing OPE in an existing DSS. Assignment of practical real scenarios, like river maintenance programmes, illustrates the necessity of the OPE tool to accurately estimate the correct parameter values, thereby improving the model performance of the original DSS. The transition zone between two parameter values in time, however, is not predicted, as sharp transitions cannot be predicted well as result of the used calibration window with the assumptions of this study. Moreover, local transitions in parameter values are difficult to predict by the OPE tool. Concluding, this study demonstrates that it is essential to use some form of OPE to predict the actual parameter values accurately for highly varied scenarios. This statement is grounded by the high level of performance indicators that have been observed in the results of the OPE tool. The computation time is sufficiently low that it is applicable in real-time systems. However, more research on discretisation of the transition phase, on inclusion of control actions and on other types of additive noise is required before implementing the tool in a real system. Furthermore, the added value to the model performance of using more observation locations and more parameters should be investigated.","Decision Support Systems; automatic calibration; on-line parameter estimation; updating; operational water management; optimisation; DuD; river networks","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water Resources","","51.62657, 5.222788"

(mentor)","2014","The intrusion of sea water into estuaries creates a complex flow that results from the density difference between fresh river run-off and salty sea water. In combination with other processes, such as tides, these complex flows are of interest because they affect the transport of e.g. salt, sediments and nutrients in water, which determine the future shape and ecology of the estuary. This research focusses on mechanisms that result in exchange flows and transport of salt. The model study has led to new insights into the way in which tides and baroclinic pressure gradients contribute to the straining circulation, i.e. the exchange flow that is induced by the interaction of temporal variations of turbulence and velocity. The straining circulation is traditionally associated with the tidal flow. To make a distinction between this traditional view and the new findings, we will call this the {\em tidal straining circulation}. It is shown that the tidal straining circulation explains only a small part of the total straining circulation in a parameter space typical for well-mixed and partially stratified estuaries. This research identifies a new and more important contribution to the straining circulation. This is caused by interactions between the gravitational circulation and temporal variations of turbulent mixing, which we will call the {\em gravitational straining circulation}. The gravitational straining circulation increases non-linearly with increasing temporal variations of turbulence. Large tidal variations of turbulent mixing are typically found in well-mixed and partially stratified estuaries. Such temporal variations of turbulence can be caused by strain-induced periodic stratification (SIPS), asymmetric mixing or symmetric variations of mixing, such as the variation of turbulence with the tide. The dominant contribution of gravitational straining circulation to the total straining circulation explains why the straining circulation is larger than the gravitational circulation in partially stratified estuaries and why both the gravitational circulation and the straining circulation have the same dependency on the along-channel salinity gradient. It also explains why the straining circulation is much smaller in strongly stratified estuaries, where the tidal variations of turbulence are not as large as in partially stratified estuaries. The direction and magnitude of the gravitational straining circulation is additionally shown to be independent of the timing of temporal variations of turbulent mixing. The magnitude and direction of the tidal straining circulation depend not only on the timing of temporal variations of mixing, but are shown to also depend on the bed roughness and the rate of mixing. This implies that the tidal straining circulation can act in the opposite direction as is expected from current theory in certain model parametrisations. Concerning the transport of salt, it is shown that temporal variations of turbulent mixing are able to create a strong salt transport. A potentially large salt transport is caused by temporal correlations of the salinity and the velocity. This salt transport contribution is shown to be highly sensitive to the phase of the salinity, which is strongly dependent on the phase of turbulent mixing. Accurate modelling of turbulence is therefore essential to obtaining accurate results for the salinity.","estuary; exchange flow; salt intrusion; perturbation model; turbulence modelling; estuarine circulation; straining circulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-11-14","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Mathematical Physics","","Applied Mathematics","",""

As free space is becoming sparse, coastal disaster risk reduction plans need to be spatially efficient. In this thesis the sandy coast with hard structures, such as buildings or dune revetments, is addressed. These structures can either provide additional protection or enhance erosion. Field measurements and experimental data featuring these phenomena are scarce, but the measurements of the devastating impact of Hurricane Sandy (October 2012) on the New Jersey shore provide new model validation possibilities. Hard structures in the barrier have three effects: 1) The main effect of a structure is the impact on the sand balance (both cross-shore and longshore), by cutting of (part) of the supply of sediment (WL | Delft Hydraulics, 1987). 2) In cross-shore direction a structure may result in the development of scour at the toe as a result of higher energetic conditions at the toe. However, in the post-Sandy bathymetry at the (buried) seawall at Bay Head, NJ, no scour holes were found. XBeach (Roelvink et al., 2009) simulations have reproduced these profiles and suggests this is the result of infilling of scour after the peak of Sandy. 3) In longshore direction a hard element will result in the extra erosion at the sides of the structure as a result of exchange of sediment and locally higher short waves. XBeach simulations have shown that the presence of a condo at Camp Osborne, NJ, during Sandy resulted in 32% additional erosion in adjacent locations However, these effects are no reason to state on forehand that multifunctional use of the barrier is not possible. Its applicability needs to be addressed case-by-case. Process-based models, like XBeach, can accurately reproduce the effects noticed in the field.

(mentor)","2014","Gas resources in The Netherlands are steadily running scarce, therefore alternative gas resources are necessary. One of those alternatives present in the Dutch subsurface is shale gas, present in among others the Posidonia Shale Formation (PSF). Little is known about this formation and drilled cores are rare. This study therefore focuses on a time and depositional equivalent in the U.K.: the Whitby Mudstone Formation (WMF). Stimulating the production of a reservoir by hydraulic fracturing (fraccing) is necessary in order to produce the gas economically viable. To determine the prospectivity of this fraccing (fraccability), several concepts are assessed, e.g. Brittleness Index (B.I.) (Rickman et al. 2008), Fracture Toughness (KIC) (Lawn & Wilshaw 1975) and Fraccability Index (F.I.) (Jin et al. 2014). The fraccability of the WMF is determined through geomechanical experiments and X-ray micro-computed tomography fracture propagation analysis. Samples were taken along an exhumed outcrop 8 meter in height. To account for anisotropy, experiments were conducted at different angles to the bedding. The applied unconfined stress to create new fractures in repetitive tests, depends on the interplay of the already present fractures. Fractures that do not reach the sample’s edges, simulate a triaxial ellipsoid shape and follow a sublinear aperture-length ratio. The WMF results show low KIC-values, which is favorable, but scattered B.I. and F.I. values, which do not provide a clear view on the prospectivity of the WMF. In general, the B.I. and F.I. provide important insights in fraccability, though its significance is relative. Values can be compared with other datasets or intervals under the condition that the same limits of experimentally measured Young’s Modulus, Poisson’s Ratio and Fracture Toughness in these concepts are applied. The WMF thus exhibits a questionable fraccability. Near the formation’ top and bottom, fraccing is preferred opposed to the middle. But weathering and exhumation of the WMF samples has certainly had its effect on the quality and uncertainty of the results.","Posidonia Shale Formation; Hydraulic Fracturing; Brittleness Index; Fracture Toughness; Fraccability Index","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

Although some of this adaptiveness is controlled by software (mainly the operating system), the goal of the ERA project is that great deal of this control actually takes place automatically at hardware level, by the Hardware scheduler. This thesis deals specifically with the problem of hardware task scheduling. We studied a variety of possible implementations for the task scheduling in the ERA platform. After getting an inside look of the Processing component of the ERA platform and understanding the particularities of it, as well as of its main building block, the ?-VEX core, we tried to find scheduling algorithms available in the bibliography to implement as the Hardware scheduler of ERA. This literature research did not yield any results, both because of the complexity of the problem, as well as the pioneer characteristics of ERA that we would like to take advantage of. We designed some simple scheduling algorithms, especially tailored for the ERA platform and tested them. The most important of them were Basic, which simply stalls the tasks until there are enough resources for them, Versioning, which brings a different binary from the memory which is compiled to run on a smaller core and Generic Binary which uses a binary that is especially compiled to run on any core, so downgrading a task does not lead to the communication cost that Versioning suffers and upgrading a task becomes possible. We present the most important of the experiments that took place within this thesis and show that GB++ (a version of GB that supports forced priorities, interrupts and upgrading by default) is the most promising algorithm that can take advantage of all the characteristics and the abilities of ERA, without being the fastest one, which is Versioning. Finally, we researched and defined the minimum requirements of GB++ in order to become apart from the rest also the fastest algorithm for ERA.","adaptive hardware; reconfigurable architectures; task scheduling; VLIW; multicore","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Computer Engineering","",""

(mentor); Zitman, T.J. (mentor); Hu, Z. (mentor)","2014","Vegetation in coastal areas plays an important role in its environment. In addition, vegetation can also be utilized for coastal protection. Incoming wave energy could be effectively attenuated by the upstanding vegetation plants. The reduced wave energy results in stabilized seabed and harmonious environment in coastal zones. Nowadays, an increasing number of projects have been carried out to apply vegetation as a soft measure for coastal protection. Wave energy dissipation by vegetation is primarily induced by the work done by drag force acting on the vegetation. A drag coefficient (CD) is introduced to characterize the flow resistance from the plant stems. Knowledge of CD is of great importance for understanding and predicting the wave dissipation process. In previous studies, relations between CD and Reynolds number (Re) have been proposed in pure current or pure wave. In addition, relations between CD and the Keulegan-Carpenter number (abbreviated as KC and KC=Uw*Tw/d, Tw is the wave period and d is the plant stem diameter) have also been suggested. In Keulegan-Carptenter number, the wave period Tw is also considered. Since waves are oscillatory flow, it would be preferable to use the KC number to describe the behaviour of CD in wave-present conditions. However, contradictory conclusions are found in the literature on the CD-KC relation in pure wave condition. Monotonous decreasing of CD with KC has been reported for multiple vegetation mimics. On the contrary, the rise-and-fall variation trend has been observed in pure wave, but only for single cylinder. It is noted that the transition point (from rise to fall) occurs when KC value is small, which is often left out in the experiment with multiple vegetation mimics in previous studies. Hence, it is necessary to investigate the variation trend of CD-KC for multiple vegetation mimics in pure wave with a wider KC range. Moreover, background tidal currents may also play a role in the wave dissipation process. It is often the case that when the tide penetrates the coastal wetlands during flooding phase, waves propagate in the same direction as the tidal currents. The underlying current may affect the behaviour of oscillatory wave flow during the energy-damping process and the CD-KC relation. Yet, the CD-KC relation in combined current-wave flow has not been reported in previous studies. In order to fill the knowledge gap in the CD-KC relation, an experimental approach was adopted by using the laboratory flume to replicate such complicated hydrodynamics. The flume is 40m long and 0.8m wide, with a patch of rigid wooden cylinders as vegetation mimics installed over the entire channel width over a 6m long test section. Pure wave can be generated by the wave generator. The underlying current can be made by using a water circulation system in the flume. After the generation of underlying current, waves could be generated afterwards and propagate together with the underlying current in the flume. The velocity was measured using EMS within the vegetation patch. Direct measurement data of the force on individual rods within the array were collected by attchaching the rods to the force sensors and embedding them in the false bottom of the flume. Three densities of the vegetation mimics were investigated for two water depths in this study. The results of the experiments reveal a rise-and-fall variation trend of CD-KC for multiple vegetation mimics in pure wave. The rise-part occurs when KC is small, around KC=3 to 10 and this phenomenon could be phycisally explained based on the changes in vortexes shedding directions. In this range of KC, the vortexes motions would change its propagation direction from lateral to oblique and longitudally parallel with the incoming flow. It is the changes in vortexes directions that lead to the increase of flow resistance experienced by the cylinder. Beyond this range of KC, the vortexes motion would keep moving longitudinally parallel and behave much the same way as in steady current. Natuarally, similar to the behaviour found in steady current conditions, the values of CD would decrease gradually and converge to 1. In the combined current-wave flow conditions, it is necessary to make a distinction between oscillatory-dominated flow and unidirectional-dominated flow. For small underlying current applied in this study, the flow could be regarded as oscillatory-dominated. It is found that the similar rise-and-fall pattern of CD-KC relation occurs in this kind of combined flow. And the transition point of KC locates at around KC=10, which is also the case found in pure wave conditions. But the peak value of CD would decrease a little bit. However, for larger underlying current conditions, the combined flow is similar to pure current. Consequently, the peak values of CD would collapse. Thus, the values of CD obtained in these conditions are stable and close to 1. The experimental results suggest the vegetation density as well as the water depths has limited effects on the values of CD and its variation trend with KC. It is recommended to carry further investigation concerning the influence on CD caused by vegetation density (N) and relative vegetation height (?) in future studies. The product of this thesis is a general description and explaination for the variation trend of CD-KC in pure wave and combined current-wave flow conditions. Physically, more insights have been gained about the evolution of vortex shedding in different flow conditions, say from pure wave to combined current-wave flow conditions. Moreover, both the calibration approach (used by Mendez and Losada, 2004, etc.) and direct measurement method have been utilised for data processing. The direct measurement method is recommended to apply in all the complicated flow conditions. As to the calibration approach, it should not be applied to obtain CD values in combined current-wave flow.","vegetation; drag; Keulegan-Carpenter number; wave; combined current-wave flow","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","","52.083, 4.3"

But commercially viable production of unconventional gas requires applying the reservoir stimulation technique hydraulic fracturing. One of the formations classified so far as potential interesting formation for shale gas exploration in the Netherlands is the Lower Jurassic Posidonia Shale Formation (PSF). There are vast numbers of data published regarding the characterization of the PSF, however nothing on the variation and heterogeneity. Since knowledge on this is crucial for proper hydraulic fracturing, this thesis elaborates on the variety in certain characteristics and on the anisotropy within the shale. As up to date exploration drilling is prohibited in the Netherlands, material to conduct research on is scarce. Therefore research is conducted on a time and depositional analogue of the PSF: the Whitby Mudstone Formation (WMF) in the U.K. Porosity and matrix densities are quantified with variation in the section, as well as mineral composition analysis based on XRF analysis. Velocity measurements are also conducted at multiple heights in the section and in multiple directions to elaborate on anisotropy of the material. Attenuation anisotropy is incorporated as well as Thomsen’s parameters combined with elastic parameters, e.g. Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio, to quantify the elastic anisotropy. The aim of this thesis is to assess whether the integrated results prove to be promising for gas exploration in the PSF-analogue, and if so, what the most promising horizons within this formation could be. The results show that the WMF is highly anisotropic and that none of the horizons prove to be obviously favorable for gas exploration. However, based on changes in the characteristics, 4 subsections are obtained. The upper and lower part of the WMF do show relatively enhanced prospects compared to the middle. But this is a cautiously taken conclusion as some characteristics seem to contradict each other and some less decisive parameters point towards other favorable subsections. The pessimistic results might be a distorted view caused by the many induced fractures or weathering, but one thing is clear, this time analogue of the Posidonia Shale Formation is no Barnett Shale equivalent.","Whitby Mudstone Formation; Anisotropy; Posidonia Shale Formations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

Sustainability does not have to be traded off against profit or business success, but sustainability can be a driver for business, this is called green growth. The Ministry of Economic Affairs aims to promote green growth. She has identified and is actively supporting several front runners that are ahead in this change to green growth. It was hoped that these companies would lead the way for potential followers. Despite some good examples, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has identified that most businesses are still stuck at start. They are aware of the urgency to move to sustainable development and green growth but find it difficult to adopt it in their specific situation. The initial goal of this graduation project was to design a tool box to support businesses in setting their first steps towards a green and growing business. An in-depth research into green growth, the governmental organisations aiming to promote it and their relation to businesses, revealed a complex network of problems. The initial problem was merely a symptom of a complex network of problems, in other words a wicked problem. A wicked problem is a problem that is extremely difficult to deal with because it is contradictory, the requirements are fluent and it is incomplete. Trying to tame the problem will not solve it and in most cases will even aggravate it. This thesis puts forward a new approach of how to set the first steps in dealing with a wicked problem. The complexity of the problem was mapped out. This map revealed a missing link between two key elements: natural capitalism and innovation. They were brought together in a matrix. The matrix revealed the full spectrum of oppertunities for green growth, but also highlighted the current limited focus of the Ministry. Furthermore, this matrix could be used to create shared understanding of the problem within the Ministry, and become a boundary object for problem solving. A boundary object is an object all stakeholders can refer to, which supports a shared understanding. The interpretation of this object has a wide scope, from sketches, to 3d models, to role playing. Two mean literature findings highlighted that the first step in dealing with wicked problems is to create shared understanding and that this can be effectively achieved through the use of boundary objects. The new approach proposed in this thesis of designing a boundary object may be a step towards a more generic design solution to deal with wicked problems. This new approach might particular be interesting for governmental organisations who are often the owners of potentially wicked problems. Recognizing that one is dealing with a wicked problem and selecting the most appropriate approach of how to deal with a wicked problem will significantly improve the quality of the outcome.","innovation; natural capitalism; green growth; wicked problem; policy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2014","The promotion of resource-saving technologies by the public authority was being intensified during the last years in order to reduce energy consumption and CO2-emissions. If charged from renewable energy sources, electric vehicles can contribute significantly to these objectives. Additionally, they can be employed to store and balance the fluctuating energy production of renewable sources. Therefore, however, a high availability of electric vehicles in the grid has to be guaranteed. In order to achieve a widespread dissemination of electric vehicles, several barriers for the usage have to be dismantled. Available charging systems for electric vehicles use cables to connect the vehicle to the grid, although this involves certain disadvantages such as risk of vandalism, additional effort for the user and present safety issues due to the open contacts and hanging charging cables in public areas. Unplugged cables lead to uncharged batteries, which causes a minimization of mobility. A further reduction of the available range of electric vehicles is not acceptable. An alternative is wireless charging on the basis of resonant inductive energy transfer. This technology provides galvanic isolation, has no open contacts and hanging charging cables, which represent potential hazards in public places, and are susceptible to vandalism allowing an automatic, reliable and safe charging process. Therefore, automatic resonant inductive charging will improve the user acceptance of electric vehicles in general and will contribute to the integration of electric vehicles into the market and thus will support the full exploitation of benefits through electro-mobility. This thesis discusses a topology for charging electric vehicles, the basic principles of wireless resonant inductive energy transfer, different coil configurations, resonant converter topologies and presents experimental results of a 3.3kW inductive energy transfer system with bidirectional energy flow capability operating at 140kHz.","inductive charging; wireless power transfer; resonant converter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-01-31","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Engineering","","Electrical Power Engineering","",""

(mentor); Eggers, A. (mentor); Wijker, J. (mentor)","2014","The design and development of a small unmanned aerial vehicle is proposed in order to provide more accurate hypersonic flight data. The outcomes could improve the current shortage of hypersonic flight data and serve to understand and predict how test conditions may be different from actual test flight. Furthermore, the response of the structure and materials due to hypersonic speed will be investigated and stability and control methods during flight will be enriched. To achieve these goals, further investigation of the current configuration of the drone needs to be addressed in order to determine if the proposed structure is feasible. The vehicle and its mission have been called Hypresearch. The Hypresearch vehicle will be launched at the initial flight conditions of Mach 6 and 42 km altitude and it will self-sustain the hypersonic flight by its own rocket engine, descent and land. Thermal-structural challenges can be quite severe on hypersonic vehicles. Aerodynamic loads (mechanical loads) and aerodynamic heating (thermal loads) can be identified for all the flight stages. Besides, since Hypresearch needs to be introduced at the designated initial flight conditions, a launch system needs be designed or selected. The liftoff phase impose extra challenges, since the aircraft will be launched on the side of a rocket booster and undergo launch loads, such as g-forces, vibration, interface loads, not presented during the straight and level flight. After the loads on the vehicle were identified and categorized, the primary and secondary structure was set up using the strength of material and elastic instability approach. The materials selected were MAX phases for the leading edge and nose section, and titanium alloy for the main body. Likewise, titanium alloy was the material preferred for the secondary structure and attachments, as it deals the best with the expected temperature gradients. The following step was the positioning of the internal structure in respect to the constraints set by the project (no-trimming conditions during level flight), and the attachments concepts between the airframe and internal units, were proposed. After the initial structural design, the finite element model for the vehicle was set up to be used for the proposed structure’s analyses. The undertaken finite element analyses consist of: static, modal, pressure distribution, random and shock effect. The results show that the vehicle’s structure is likely to withstand the selected loading environment of the launch vehicle. From this model, the final mass budget of the vehicle’s structure was obtained. It was concluded that the structure is considered feasible with regards to the liftoff loads and within the mass budget requirement of a maximum 35 kg. In a nutshell, the graduation project is focused on finding simple solutions to some structural design problems and providing an accurate analysis of the vehicle, in order to confirm the feasibility of the design under investigation.","structural design; hypersonic vehicle; FEM; FEA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Space Flight","","Space Engineering","",""

(mentor); Fosso, O.B. (mentor); Kirschneck, M. (mentor)","2014","With the ongoing developments in the offshore wind turbine industry, weight reduction is an important aspect. With these weight reduction, manufacturers are trying to increase the effciency and size of their turbines. An example of such a technique is a single bearing drive train. These designs use a special bearing which is extra stiff due to the support of axial raceways. Manufacturers are still proving the robustness of this promising design. At the moment, some manufacturers already constructed a prototype. An example of this prototype is the XD115 of XEMC Darwind. This turbine is permanently monitored with the use of a health monitoring system. This system mainly consists of accelerometers which are located throughout the whole turbine. This monitoring system can be extended by performing spectral analysis on the measured generator current. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate if it is possible to measure mechanical vibrations in the current output of a generator with full converter. The bearing is one of the most complex elements in this single bearing drive train. There- fore, the focus is put on monitoring the bearing. In order to investigate in this topic, two types of tests are performed, lab tests and full scale tests. During the lab tests, a small set-up is made and some bearings are tested. The full scale tests are performed on the XD115 prototype. During the tests in the lab most of the characteristic bearing frequen- cies could be measured. An increase in the amplitude of these frequencies was measured after damaging the bearing. In these lab tests, an increase in friction was also measurable. The characteristic bearing frequencies could be identied much easier in the frequency spectrum of the current than in the frequency spectrum of the accelerometer. The re- sults of the tests in the full scale turbine were less promising. Neither in the frequency spectrum of the accelerometer and current, a characteristic bearing frequency could be identied. However, when the rotational speed synchronisation algorithm is used, some mechanical vibrations could be identied. The shaft speed and each time a blade passes the tower were identied in the frequency spectrum of the current. This means that a mechanical vibration was measured in the generator current.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","EPP","","","",""

New energy agreements demand 40% of Dutch electricity to be produced by renewable sources. This will complicate the link between supply and demand. Where demand used to be the only unknown, also a large part of the electricity supply will become less certain. It is necessary to be able to store energy to keep the Dutch grid stable. Energy Storage This technology is currently very small. The only prosperous technology is that of Pumped Hydro Storage, which uses abundant electricity to pump water into a mountain basin and produces electricity by running this water through a turbine. The requirement of large height differences makes this technology impossible for use in the Netherlands. Pumped Hydro Storage: Pressure Cavern This feasibility study contains the conceptual design of a new energy storage alternative in the Netherlands. It stores water in a low-risk manner by combining the main points of Pumped Hydro Storage with Salt Caverns, which are large cavities left behind by Salt Solution Mining. This form of mining bores into salt domes (large, compressed salt layers) beneath the North-East of the country and leaves large cavities that be used for storage. However, this is impossible to combine with Pumped Hydro Storage, because low pressure will lead to rapid shrinkage of the cavern. The economical competitor There are several parties that will be interested in energy storage, which include energy companies and the National System Operator, TenneT. The yearly revenues are estimated to be 6 million euros. When comparing the market potential a payback period of roughly 8-9 years is expected. The large resemblance to Pumped Hydro Storage limits the risks in comparison to other alternatives. Technical and economic analyses have shown the potential of the Pressure Cavern-concept and conclude that it is definitely a business case worth investigating in order to provide the flexibility that the Dutch market is going to need so badly the coming decades.","energy storage; Salt Cavern; Salt Solution Mining; Pumped Hydro Storage; Netherlands; underground storage; Electricity Grid; water power; pump turbine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Structures","",""

(mentor); Van der Spek, S.C. (mentor); Nourian Ghadi Kolaee, P. (mentor)","2014","Indoor localization is a hot topic since the demand for Location Based Services (LBS) has increased, especially (semi) public places like museums, office buildings and congress halls would benefit from LBS. Outdoor localization and its applications like navigation systems are well implemented in society and used by many on a daily basis. Applications using indoor localization are underrepresented due to the lack of a robust and scalable indoor localization technique. Attempting to solve this problem, first, a suitable indoor localization technique (hardware) is selected and second, an indoor localization method (algorithm) is applied. For the localization technique two radio propagation techniques are tested in this research: first an established technique called Ultra High Frequency Radio Frequency Identification (UHF RFID) and second, a newly arrived technique called Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Both techniques use a sensor and tag. In the case of UHF RFID the person to be located carries a tag and is recorded by sensors on the ceiling. In the case of BLE the person to be located holds the sensor in hand and senses the tags on the ceiling. Results show that the UHF RFID is highly sensitive to environmental changes and water bodies (including the user itself). This makes the proximity indication of the technique unpredictable and the technique difficult to use in various locations with a large amount of users, which is often the case in (semi) public places. The BLE shows quite stable results in terms of its sensitivity to interferences and shows a clear correlation between distance and signal strength. The latter two characteristics make it a suitable technique for indoor localization. Two localization algorithms using BLE are proposed; first a dependent algorithm which takes into account the specific characteristics of the sensor, and second, an independent algorithm (referred to as PML) which functions independently from the type of sensor used. The latter is an advantage because the sensor is incorporated in the mobile phone of the user. Especially when there are potentially multiple users holding different types of mobile phones, the sensors can vary widely. The dependent algorithm is based on a probability function using a basic concept of trilateration dependent on the measurements of at least three beacons. PML is based on the ratio between measurements of at least three beacons. Results of both algorithms show in most cases a computed location within a meter of the actual location. Generally, the dependent algorithm shows slightly better results with regards to the PML method. However, the practical usability and scalability of the PML method makes it preferable over the dependent algorithm.","Bluetooth Low Energy; BLE; Radio Frequency Identification; Trilateration; RFID; LBS; Voronoi; Range free; Trilateration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Geomatics","","MSc Geomatics","",""

(mentor)","2014","The aim of the research was to develop conceptual model for determination of functional areas with abstract borders within indoor space and to illustrate how determined functional areas can be applied to facilitate wayfinding process in indoor environments. The objectives of the research were to define criteria for determination of functional areas of objects by adopting principles of human behaviour and human perception of the environment, to develop rules how to subdivide indoor space into navigable and non navigable areas and to incorporate functional areas in a navigation model. Based on literature review conceptual model for functional area determination was developed. The designed model suggests that functional areas of indoor objects depend on their characteristics such as attractiveness, necessity, limited capacity, closeness to central areas, possession of transition area. Additionally, the developed model introduces private space concept to delineate functional areas taking into account human behavioural rules. Mathematical expressions and rules to deal with special cases in order to delineate functional areas were established. The proposed model was implemented for two case studies: Rotterdam Central Station (for peak and off-peak hours) and Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment, TU Delft. The partition of indoor environment for wayfinding purposes was performed in two steps. Firstly, semantic indoor space partition was performed: separate functional areas were determined and the indoor space was partitioned into navigable and non-navigable areas using GIS tools (buffer, union, difference, aggregation). Secondly, geometric space subdivision was executed where navigable area was subdivided applying constrained Delaunay triangulation to generate navigation network in which functional areas were represented as dead-end nodes. The results derived applying the proposed model were verified using photographs and video records. Functional areas of objects were determined by measuring areas occupied by people around specific objects and distances that people keep between each other and objects. Measurements obtained from photographs were compared with the results obtained using the proposed model. Video records were inspected to examine people movement trajectories. The results of the image and video analysis indicate that the research successfully integrated findings of previous studies and new concepts introduced in this research in order to provide more realistic abstraction of the indoor environment and more accurate navigation path. Eight cases of determined functional areas were examined and the outcome of the validation showed that only one case was not supported. On the basis of the results of the validation, it was concluded that the selected criteria are appropriate measures to determine separate functional areas within indoor space and provide reliable results. In this research the determined functional areas were represented as dead-end nodes in the generated navigation networks. The results of the performed path computation tests showed that indication of these functional areas in computations of navigation paths allows generation of more realistic routes that adopt principles of human natural movement and avoidance of areas that are usually occupied. However, the findings of research showed that additional attention has to be paid while determining ranges of the criteria, analysis of object’s closeness to surrounding location has to be improved. Furthermore, the findings revealed that time impact on properties of objects has to be carefully evaluated taking into consideration different factors such as occurring events in the environment, total number of people within the environment, habits of people and other. Moreover, the research suggests that in the future studies different navigation models could be built such as navigation network based on a visibility graph or grid based navigation model, in order to investigate how functional areas can be indicated in these models and analyse which approach provides better path calculation results.","indoor navigation; space subdivision; functional areas; navigation network; navigation path","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Geomatics","","Geomatics","",""

(mentor)","2014","As projected air travel is expected to increase up till 2030, future airports are faced to deal with the impact of (rising) noise hinder within their environment and the resulting allowed attainable throughput capacity. To date, several proposed techniques are able to lower the noise contribution. This thesis study focusses on weather-adaptive trajectory optimization, in which departure trajectories - subjected to day-to-day meteorological variations - are reshaped in such a way that inhabited areas are (partly) avoided to exposed noise areas generated by the aircraft. Incorporating day-to-day meteorological variability into trajectory optimization leads to an enhancement over reference-day trajectory optimization. This enhancement allows for improved accuracy with respect to the aircraft performance- and noise footprint calculations. The accuracy increase can be used to generate opportunities to improve the reference-day optimized trajectories even further. This led to the following purpose statement: The aim of this thesis work is to accurately represent the noise footprint by means of quantifying the influence of meteorological variability of the effects in wind and temperature variations on the shape and extent of aircraft acoustic footprints and use this information to optimize aircraft trajectories for diverse objectives. For this purpose, the FORT reference-day optimization tool is extended with weather dependent effects in an accurate and computationally tractable manner. The enhanced, weather-adaptive, FORT tool is able to optimize flight trajectories with respect to time, fuel, emissions, and awakenings objectives at any given airport for several departure procedures. Within FORT, the noise submodel is based on the INM methodology and enhanced with daily varying excess attenuation. This day-to-day varying excess attenuation replaces the lateral attenuation correction, which represented average yearly excess attenuation. The day-to- day excess attenuation is accessed for various noise-observer distances by means of an EA-database. In this way, the noise submodel employs a table lookup approach for both its NPD- and EA-calculations, maintaining simple and fast lookup table calculations while allowing complex evaluation of atmospheric effects on noise contours. Aircraft and acoustic performance is significantly influenced by varying temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and wind direction layers. A positive temperature lapse rate distribution leads to upward ray path refraction, causing shadow zones, where a negative lapse rate results in downward refraction, causing caustics formation. Furthermore, the combination of temperature and relative humidity have a significant effect on the amount of acoustic absorption. Finally, the combination of temperature and wind layers induce greater speed of sound differences. This greater difference leads to a stronger presence of shadow zones and caustics phenomena, which can be used to eliminate noise at populated areas. Meteorological phenomena, which are seasonal dependent, cause the temperature, relative humidity, and wind profile distribution in the troposphere to vary, which results into different day-to-day aircraft and acoustic performance. The impact of weather-adaptive optimization is assessed by means of a case study in which two departure trajectories are optimized for multiple objectives, while being subjected to several atmospheric profiles. The two departures are based on standard instrument departures currently in use at AAS. The weather-adaptive trajectory optimization model complies with all the regulations and guidelines applicable to departure trajectories prescribed by PANSOPS and AAS in order to create a realistic and feasible trajectory. The atmospheric profiles incorporate temperature-, relative humidity-, wind speed-, and wind direction distribution differences to show the impact of seasonal effects on the optimization outcome. The weather-adaptive optimization results are compared to both reference-day optimization results and standard departure trajectories executed at AAS. For both cases, significant differences in aircraft- and acoustic performance are obtained for all objectives (time, fuel, emission, and awakenings). Firstly, when comparing the reference-day optimization to the results of the weather-adaptive optimization, it is concluded that the true impact of reference-day optimized trajectories on time, fuel, emission, and awakenings objectives differ significantly when subjected to a nonreference- day atmospheric profile. The time, fuel, and emission objectives are dependent on aircraft performance and are therefore affected by the varying wind speed and direction profile. The awakenings objective is both affected by the aircraft- and acoustic performance and therefore influenced by the full atmospheric profile. Secondly, for both standard AAS departure trajectories and reference-day optimized trajectories, it is concluded that the weather-adaptive optimization is able to generate an opportunity to further decrease the objectives. FORT utilizes the atmosphere in a positive manner, by means of aircraft performance advantages and acoustic focussing effects (e.g. directing shadow zones towards unpopulated areas). Finally, it can be concluded that the inclusion of meteorological variability into trajectory optimization leads to improved accuracy of the aircraft- and acoustic performance in general. These results create a better understanding about the atmospheric effects in terms of aircraft performance and subsequent noise contours. Furthermore, the weather-adaptive model is able to use the accuracy increase to further decrease the awakenings impact. For future work, the results can be further improved by analyzing different aircraft types on trajectory optimization output. Furthermore, the combination of multiple simultaneous optimized arrival- and departure trajectory optimizations could be researched in order to improve the feasibility of the current established trajectories with respect to separation requirements. Last but not least, societal costs play a major role when optimizing the awakenings objective. In certain cases, the total number of awakenings can be reduced significantly. This decrease however, may be at the expense of accompanying societal costs as new trajectories could induce complaints and other forthcoming societal costs when flying over different populated areas. The impact of changing the trajectories with respect to social aspects could be researched in more detail to establish societal feasibility of the optimized trajectories.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-11-07","Aerospace Engineering","Control and Simulation","","Air transport and Aerospace Operations","","52.309070, 4.763384"

(mentor); De Lille, C. (mentor)","2014","This thesis addresses technology development in SMEs and how a design oriented service can increase the output of successful innovations. Ultimately, from the research findings a designerly approach is developed, to guide SMEs though the most crucial development stages. The scope of the research was established because of personal interest and challenges that were encountered with a design consultancy. There was not a lot of information that could be found regarding designerly approaches towards the development of technologies. During my design engineering degree, there was an equally low focus. Since many great products stem from the development of new technologies, this thesis discusses exactly how designers can help tech savvy SMEs. This project consists of a research and analysis phase, concluded with a service design. The research phase consisted of a literature review, interviews with the participating companies, designers (working in SMEs) and design experts. In the analysis of the research, the findings were narrowed down to create main insights. These insights were primary overlooking themes across the findings. These same themes were then linked to the literature review and quotes from the interviews to extract the main problems in developing innovative technologies. Based on several issues, such as the knowledge gap between designers and engineers, the service will have an integral approach. The designers will aid the current development team of an SME, only the approach will be different. There are three themes that played a dominant role in categorizing the challenges experienced by SMEs and designers. Lack of knowledge, such as not knowing the kind of design tools that can be used. Isolated development processes, where specialists do their tasks in their own environment, without interaction with other specialists. Ability to guide designers, in which managers do not know which kind of designer to put where in the development process. Ultimately, the focus was put on three key actors. The most important key actors that this service focus on this service are: 1. Knowledge sharing 2. Utilize expertise 3. Channeling designerly skills These play an important role throughout the service approach, as they solve multiple problems throughout the early development process. The three phases that are targeted from the early stages of development are: 1. Patent or problem - A patent poses an opportunity, or a problem from a client, gives way to develop a new technology. 2. Problem based ideation - Development team bases the ideation phase around a specific context, ruling out other opportunities. 3. Product idea brainstorming - Development teams do not use the right techniques to brainstorm about products and ideas. These three early stages are changed in terms of the activities that take place in each phase, as well as the kind of development approach. The three abstraction levels, show the kinds of designers, design tools and the kinds of analysis that is done in each of the three phases.","Design thinking; SME; Managing technology; Technology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Van den Dobbelsteen, J.J. (mentor); Santos, A.L. (mentor)","2014","This master thesis describes a graduation project that is elaborated for Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) innovation project Sweden. MSF is an independent, international, medical humanitarian organization. The organization is specialized in providing humanitarian aid in (developing) countries. The goal of this project is to find a solution for the problems that occur during the sterilization processes of MSF in the context of humanitarian aid. Currently MSF uses the Robustex 90L autoclave to sterilize their instruments, however MSF is interested in a redesign or an improved version of the Robustex. Sterilization is the process that kills and removes micro-organisms from medical devices and is one of the most important contamination prevention steps in a hospital. Two sterilization departments, in the Netherlands, were visited to understand the sterilization process in developed countries. To understand the habits, needs and problems of the sterilization process and the staff of MSF. This project includes a research in which insiders from the organization are interviewed and product tests are done with the Robustex at the MSF training centre in Brussels. Next to MSF, the research phase includes insights from International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and Ministries of Health (MoH) from developing countries. This is done to enlarge the market for manufacturers of autoclaves. MSF purchases around 10 autoclaves a year, which an insufficient amount for manufacturers to make a profit off. These stakeholders all faces problems such as lack of resources (water, energy and sterilization knowledge) and poor maintenance capabilities. The results of the research show large differences in product requirements between MSF, ICRC and the MoH. MSF requires a robust autoclave with electrical functionalities such as a vacuum pump. ICRC requires a smaller autoclave with the ability to monitor the conditions inside the sterilization chamber during a cycle to validate the quality of the sterilized packages. And the MoH requires a larger autoclave as basic as possible with an easy control system. A product that fits all these requirements would be unrealistic, extremely expensive and completely unusable. Therefore this project focussed on the requirements that all stakeholders have in common, which is a water, energy and time efficient autoclave which is still easy to operate and is low in production cost. The design leaves the option open to improve the quality of sterilization by implementing add-ons such as the vacuum pump and condition monitor, nevertheless these electrical improvements will only work in conditions were all resources are available, which is seldom the case. In conclusion, this project successfully demonstrates a robust autoclave by separating the heating space from the sterilization chamber. The redesign consumes 75% less water, 23 - 38% less time and 30-50% less energy during a sterilization cycle. The production costs will be approximately 450 more than the Robustex. The operation costs however, will decrease with 3 per cycle, which is estimated to be 1000 per year. The increase in the amount of control valves is concerning, since uneducated people in emergency relief areas will use the product. The technical feasibility is validated with a thermodynamic study and the manufacturability has been confirmed by autoclave and engineering companies. The usability is tested with a full-scale mock-up and Dutch adult participants. More valuable tests should be done with real life tests in emergency settings, to evaluate local behaviour concerning the autoclave control.","Sterilization; MSF; Médecins Sans Frontières; Autoclave; Water efficient; Humanitarian aid","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

In general, the results of Mincomp are comparable with the results of other available programs, however the results on some samples differed in the calculated amount of Kaolinite and Illite, this is mainly caused by the allocation order of the program.

The tools are generic and could be applied to any city or building. City Accelerator uses different scale levels of the city of Rotterdam as case studies to test these tools. The main hypothesis of the City Accelerator is: the more adaptable the city, the lower the travel time. City Accelerator tests the impact of each tool and the impact of the level of adaptivity on travel time in the city. What would the accelerated city and life in the accelerated city look like? To enable adaptability, the City Accelerator tests the use of new construction technologies and specifies the requirements for vehicles in these cities.

Currently, the 25 Dutch wind cooperatives have a minor influence with the 4% wind energy capacity share they have installed. However, sufficient information on what influences their success is lacking. It is challenging to understand in what way wind cooperatives can be stimulated to play a more prominent role in achieving the objectives of the energy agreement without understanding the success of wind cooperatives. Therefore, the following main research question was defined: What are the key determinants of the success of Dutch onshore-wind cooperatives, and in what way do these determinants influence their success? An explorative research approach was designed, starting with a literature research. That research was followed by an empirical research, to identify what determinants are perceived to be important by actors in practice. Face-to-face semi-structured interviews with wind cooperative representatives and experts, were used as data collection method. The determinants were retrieved from the empirical data, via coding global interview transcripts. Data analysis resulted in a list of 74 validated determinants. The most important determinants and the relations between them were used as a basis for a tentative conceptual model. Determinants relating to collaboration, interaction with stakeholders and sharing knowledge and expertise prove to be most important. Wind cooperative are recommended to enhance knowledge and expertise sharing via the organisations that are already established. Besides that, wind cooperatives seem to have different perceptions regarding lobbying, therefore it is suggested that wind cooperatives discuss what approach is most appropriate in which situation. Policy makers are recommended to provide more specific guidelines for participation plans, and to raise awareness for the existence of (wind) energy cooperatives among citizens. If the government aims to let wind cooperatives play a more dominant role, the government should also think of measures to make land positions available for cooperatives. Further research is recommended to focus on validation of the determinants and the relations between them, towards a conceptual model.","Energy agreement; Wind energy cooperative; Key Performance Indicator; Success; Determinant; SES Framework","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy and Industry","","System Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management","",""

(mentor)","2014","Organs on chips are a novel set of devices whose aim is to mimic cellular in-vivo conditions of the human physiology within a microchip. The need of reliable disease models, particularly for the development of pharmaceutical drugs, has drawn increased attention as the current widespread models; static cell cultures and animal tests, have proven poor predictability, are costly and are increasingly ethically problematic. By providing physiologically relevant bio-chemical, mechanical and other relevant cues to the cells cultured, these in-vitro 'organs' develop similar characteristics to those observed in their in-vivo counterparts. To achieve this, these chips are carefully designed and fabricated with various micro-fabrication technologies, in particular soft-lithography, due to its extensive use for microfluidic devices and materials' proven biological compatibility. However, standard soft-lithography presents major drawbacks as a platform for mass-scale fabrication of complex devices, in particular the extensive use of manual processing which makes it un-reliable and promotes break of thin substrates. At the Eindhoven University of Technology, an Organ-on-chip is being developed to study cancer cell dissemination; cancer metastasis, and several design features have been identified. In particular, the need of a thin micro-porous substrate that allows multiple-cells to be cultured in close contact, bio-chemical and mechanical stimuli, and migration of cells through this layer. Though several soft-lithographic techniques have been reported for the fabrication of similar thin porous films, the manual handling problem has been assessed to be the major technical bottle-neck. In this thesis, a fabrication method based on soft-lithography was designed to make thin micro-porous elastomeric membranes and a brief evaluation of their characteristics to be used for a Cancer-on-Chip was done. By integrating a selective sacrificial layer approach in the soft-lithographic molding process of the membrane, we have addressed the manual handling problem. This enabled us to fabricate large area thin PDMS membranes with micro-pores of 7 to 10 micrometer diameter. The membranes were successfully integrated in micro-fluidic devices and tested for reliability, robustness and porosity by mass transport experiments. Validation for its compatibility for cancer cell culturing was done by seeding breast cancer cells and observing their adhesion on and migration through the membrane.","Organ-on-Chip; PDMS; microporous membrane; cancer; softlithography; sacrificial layer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomedical Engineering","","Instrumentation","",""

(mentor); Chao-Duivis, M.A.B. (mentor)","2014","Despite the fact that integration of supply chains within a construction project is preferred, we see that an integrated approach of various construction projects in the Netherlands is hampered due to diverse reasons. These projects are often multidisciplinary projects and are deliberately divided into multiple subprojects. Between these subprojects a phenomenon appears called interfaces. Most of the time these interfaces are inherent to characteristic risks where, up to present, a thorough academic research and a pragmatic approach to these interface risks is lacking. The reasons why projects are divided are diverse and up to present not clear. Besides that, it appears that there is a lack of an unambiguous understanding of the relation between the created interfaces due to the dividing of projects and the consequential interface risks. Therefore not all interface risks can be managed prior to the tender and contract phase. As a result it is up to the present unclear how interface risks by means of organisational and contractual measures can be best prevented in an earliest possible stage. The objective of this research is on the one hand to generate a deep and broad understanding in the relation between the causes and consequences of dividing projects. On the other hand, this research aims to develop generic solutions and measures in order to prevent interface risks between contracts in an early phase of the project. Since interface risks appear in a complex context and the aim of this research is to analyse the relation between causes and implications of interfaces, a broad and thorough case study research is an appropriate strategy to apply. The analysed case study projects are; OV-SAAL (Zuidtak), OV-Terminal Utrecht and Spoorzone Delft. Because of the multiple subprojects of these projects, the various created interfaces and the different applied contracts, the research results are extensively elaborated. The research has resulted in a list of 35 reasons why projects are divided, 10 generic causes of interface risks and 32 different identified interface risks. The reasons to divide projects that were found are of added value, as they support the decision making process during the initiation phase. Furthermore, these reasons provide insights into the consequences of dividing projects. Ranking the generic causes of interface risks provides an indication that causes should be emphasized when managing interfaces. Moreover, these generic causes are analysed in a legal context in order to provide contractual considerations when applying the UAV 2012, the UAV-gc 2005 (D&C) and the coordination agreement. The results altogether improve the understanding of the relation between the causes and consequences of interfaces. Subsequently, in order to develop generic solutions, 25 organisational, contractual and dividing measures and a comprehensive measure, the alliance-light model, were composed. When applying these measures, interface risks can be prevented in an early stage of a project. Finally, the research results are integrated into an advice model in order to make them operational for practical purposes. The academic substantiation of this research has bridged the gap between science and practice and it has set down a foundation in the context of interface management where future studies could be build upon.","constructionmanagement; interfacemanagement; contractmanagement; riskmanagement; sub-projects; interfaces; interface problems; interface risks; multi-disciplinary projects; interfacerisks; deelprojecten; deelcontracten; raakvlakken; aakvlakproblemen; raakvlakrisicos; raakvlakmanagement; nevenaanneming; Coördinatieovereenkomst; UAV-gc 2005; UAV 2012","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-11-06","Architecture and The Built Environment","Real Estate & Housing","","Design & Construction Management","",""

The business model (BM) for a start-up firm is also being developed (intrinsically or explicitly) along with these activities. This development of BM is gradual and continuous. Eventually when entrepreneurs claim to have defined the BM for their start-up, most of the time they have just identified the BM that is being intrinsically designed since the technology research stage. Entrepreneurs draft a business plan to authenticate the economic value of the technology at hand. This business plan represents a simple value creating and money earning logic. This logic is the first basic design of the start-up’s BM. Even though an initial draft of a BM is in place, actual maturity of each BM element happens in segments. This thesis tries to track the design of a BM in terms of BM elements, which form the start-up’s first efficient BM. To ensure a balanced growth, entrepreneurs should consider the designing of the BM synchronised with start-up development. Scholars have proposed many models for start-up growth, which don’t specifically focus on all BM elements but on overall start-up growth. A roadmap of BM elements using CANVAS and C-SOFT frameworks, in sync with start-up growth is the deliverable of this thesis. This roadmap will assist entrepreneurs to identify which BM elements to develop during specific phases of start-up growth. This guidance is more valuable to an upcoming industry with a great potential for small scale service providing start-ups. Geographical Information System (GIS) service providing industry is embarking on such an opportunity with the rise of open sourced GIS platforms for integrating urban planning services to manage the rising trend of smart cities. Additionally, academia will acquire a new perspective in the upcoming field of BM roadmapping for designing business models from scratch for ICT start-ups in GIS industry.","Business Model design Roadmap; GIS start-up Business model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-11-07","Technology, Policy and Management","Technology, Policy and Management","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor)","2014","Problem definition At the TU Delft there are not enough (easy to operate) tensile testers for students to be able to perform tensile tests. This type of tensile testers is commercially available, however they are very expensive. At the moment students IDE, in the bachelor phase they only get to observe a test, after which they have to analyze the results. The result is that most students, after only a couple of years, no longer remember anything about material testing, let alone remember how to calculate material characteristics like the Young’s modulus or the yield strength. The goal To design a desktop tensile tester, for first year students IDE, that can test plastic material specimens of up to 4 mm thick, with a working area of 200 mm and a force of up to 3 KN for less than 1000,- (material & shipping costs). The design The focus of this project was to build a cheap and simple tensile tester (TT) and not necessarily a very accurate one. The development was divided into two sub parts: the TT and the grips. The result was a low-end tensile tester(LETT). For the sake of simplicity and cost it was decided to design a simple vise grip using two butterfly nuts to open and close it. During the first tests with the grips it was found that they did not have enough grip on the plastic material specimens. To enlarge the grips’ friction an aluminum strip with a serrated surface was glued onto the grip’s surfaces. The TT features a linear actuator, rated up to 4 KN hung upside down in a frame, eliminating complicated and expensive transmissions. When testing the TT it was found that the actuator wobbles from side to side. The problem was decreased sufficiently by fixating the actuator. Two load cells (rated up to 500 Kg and 100 Kg) result in a measuring range of 10 to 400 Kg. The load cells are easily replaced and the extra load cell is stored in an easy to access compartment in the base of the TT. During evaluation of the TT it was determined that the load cell has been damaged in the testing phase. Data obtained during the testing phase does indicate that the accuracy is good enough to gain an estimate of material characteristics. The TT is controlled via a user interface (UI) on the computer. With the UI the user first has to indicate where on the computer he wants the program to save a text file with the results of each test. The user also has to set the speed of a test to three preset values of 10, 50 or 100 mm/min. The test speed is tightly regulated in the software and test have shown that it remains constant throughout a tensile test. During gripping of a material specimen the user can use buttons in the UI to move the top grip up or down to the desired height. When the user has set all parameters he can start the test and give it a name in the input box which pops up. When a test is finished the TT stops automatically, but in case of an emergency there is also a conspicuous “Stop” button in the UI. During a material test the UI plots a graph of the results, so the user can verify that the test was conducted properly. A short user manual of (4 pages) with lots of visual aides teaches the user how to operate the LETT. User research showed that, with only a few adjustments, this user manual alone should be enough to be able to operate the LETT. Depending on how much LETTs are built simultaneously the LETT can be manufactured for less than 500,- (material & shipping costs). Recommendations A new load cell needs to be purchased and research will need to be conducted to be able to make validated statements about load cell accuracy. Additional user research will need to be carried out to verify that the improved user manual is in fact able to sufficiently explain how the LETT works to a novice user. During testing it appeared that the electronic system is not yet very reliable so this has to be improved as well.","tensile tester; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Everts, H.J. (mentor); Lagendijk, P. (mentor); Tiggelman, L. (mentor)","2014","In this thesis different models are considered which can deal with the interaction between pile foundations and structures. This to find the most efficient way to model pile foundation structures whereby both the efficiency of the design as building process are taken into account. This are the models D-Pile (geotechnical), Scia Engineer (structural) and Plaxis (geotechnical). Therefore a study is done to the effects which play a role by pile foundation structures and or the different models can deal with this. The study focused on displacement piles which is the most used pile type in the Dutch building practice. The reference project which is used for this study is the foundation structure of a power pylon (as shown in figure 1) To get trust in the models after this study a verification is done for single piles which were subjected to an axial (compression and tension) and horizontal load on top. For piles loaded by axial compression the load-settlement behaviour is compared with the behaviour as one can determine according to NEN 9997-1 (EC7). Hereby one can see that the fact that the numerical model Plaxis does not take into account the installation effects (densification and displacement of the soil around the pile) leads to a deviating load-settlement behaviour in comparison with the behaviour of the other models which are based on empirical relationship (pile tests). This behaviour can be improved by additional tricks like volume expansions of the soil around the pile, but this is not taken into account in this thesis. So therefore Plaxis was not taken into account furthermore. After the verification of single piles, the verification was expanded for pile groups which was subjected to the same loading conditions. Hereby variations were made in the centre-to-centre distances of the piles and the thickness of the cap on top. Hereby can be noticed that the fact that D-Pile cannot take into account the bending stiffness of the pile cap can lead to an unrealistic distribution of pile forces in case of a thin plate with large centre-to-centre distances of the piles. On the other hand the additional settlement of a pile group in comparison with a single pile cannot be taken into account with the chose way of modeling in Scia Engineer, but only by D-Pile. The behaviour of pile groups loaded by tension can differ significant from single piles This effect has to be taken into account manually in both models. For a horizontally loaded group there is a significant difference in results in the bending moments in the pile heads and the displacement of the pile cap, which is caused by the different horizontal springs used in the models. Combining all these knowledge leads to the conclusion that Scia Engineer seems to be the best model for the design of the foundation structure of the power pylon. Hereby both the efficiency of the design process and the structure are taken into account. The reassons for this are:  Besides D-Foundation which is a tool to determine the bearing capacity only one model is needed to analyse the behaviour of the piles and the foundation structure. This model is also used by the structural engineer to determine the distribution of forces and the reinforcement in the structure.  The load-displacement behaviour of (tension) piles is governed by springs which are easy to adjust and it is easy to check if the behaviour is in line with the applicable standards. This is especially the case for tension piles, for which the bearing capacity is dependent on the pile-to-pile distance and the alternation between tensile and compressive loads.","Foundation piles; D-Pile; Plaxis; Scia Engineer; Soil-structure interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-11-17","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Schuttelaars, H.M. (mentor); Uittenbogaard, R.E. (mentor); Van Kester, J.A.T.M. (mentor)","2014","Numerical modelling for environmental flow applications, such as for rivers, lakes, estuaries and coastal flows, faces a trade-off between the numerical accuracy and the required computation time. This trade-off results in grids which typically contain 10 to 100 layers in the vertical direction. Such a grid resolution poses severe limitations to the numerical accuracy of the model. The turbulence model determines a significant part of this accuracy. This research therefore investigates an unexplored method of using transformations to improve the numerical accuracy of two-equation turbulence models at a low resolution. The k-epsilon model is used as starting point for this method. The equation for epsilon is transformed to equations for omega and tau. This results in three turbulence models, the k-epsilon, k-omega and k-tau models, which are physically equivalent, but possess different numerical properties. This research identifies these different numerical properties in order to explain when and why a certain transformation is beneficial to the numerical accuracy. The three turbulence models are tested in six cases of homogeneous and stratified flows in a one-dimensional vertical (1DV) numerical model, which is representative for the implementation in the 3D simulation system Delft 3D-FLOW. It is shown that the k-tau model yields more accurate results than the k-epsilon and k-omega models in boundary friction dominated flows, such as those found in rivers, partially stratified estuaries and along the coast. This improved performance is explained from the profile of tau, which is linear near the frictional boundary and therefore accurately approximated on a low resolution grid. The profiles of epsilon and omega are hyperbolic near the frictional boundary and therefore not accurately represented on such a grid. The boundary condition for tau is well-posed, while no natural boundary conditions for epsilon and omega exist. Dirichlet boundary conditions for epsilon and omega are therefore inaccurate. The Neumann boundary condition is found to be the most accurate alternative boundary condition for epsilon and omega. An adjusted Dirichlet conditions used in Delft 3D-FLOW improves on the result of the ordinary Dirchlet condition, but shows bad convergence behaviour, with results being significantly worse at 100 vertical layers than at 10 vertical layers. A new adjusted Dirichlet condition is developed, which has better convergence behaviour, but is still somewhat worse than the Neumann condition. The k-tau and k-omega models contain a number of diffusive terms, the implementation of which may introduce numerical diffusion in the model. Some of these diffusive terms are essential to the stability of the model. Others are optional. It is argued that the choice whether or not to include such optional diffusive terms should be based on both physical and numerical arguments, because the numerical diffusion associated with the implementation of the terms may have a significant desired or undesired effects on the model results. It is found in the cases in this research that convergence of the turbulence models with increasing grid resolution is typically found between 100 and 1000 grid cells in the vertical direction. One case of temperature modelling of a lake has been tested in which convergence did not occur up to 2000 grid cells. So converged results are generally beyond the range of generally used vertical resolution in 3D models. Within the feasible range of 10 to 100 layers it is found that the results of the turbulence models do not necessarily become more accurate if higher resolution grids are used. So monotonous convergence of the turbulence models is not guaranteed.","turbulence modelling; numerical accuracy; stratification; k-epsilon model; k-tau model; convergence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-11-06","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Environmental Fluid Mechanics","",""

(mentor)","2014","Moored vessels are subject to wave forces and moments at different frequencies, which induce motions of the body and can be transferred to the mooring lines and fenders. Under extreme forcing and vessel motions, dangerous line breaking accidents can occur or the ship movements can be simply too large to continue the on/off-loading process, causing downtime of the port. An accurate modelling of the waves in the harbour and the response of moored ships is of prime importance to determine the safety and workability of the berths. In this project the combination of the wave model SWASH and the 3D diffraction model Harberth to compute waves forces acting on moored ships is investigated. The proposed approach using the SWASH wave model come as a possible alternative to the current practice of Royal HaskoningDHV, who experienced a sequence of numerical issues while simulating extreme incident waves with an operational Boussinesq-type model. The objectives of the study lead to the following research question: To which extent can the SWASH wave model and the Harberth model be combined in order to accurately compute wave forces acting on moored ships? Each computational tool considered in the proposed approach (the wave model SWASH, the coupling procedure, and the diffraction model Harberth) can contribute to the (in)accuracy of the computed wave forces acting on a moored ship. A series of systematic tests with SWASH indicates that the dispersion errors are generally negligible, while amplitude errors remain small provided that: i) the number of vertical layers is sufficient (especially in relatively deep waters); ii) the horizontal resolution of the computational grid is sufficient; iii) important terms of the momentum equation are modelled with higher-order numerical schemes (especially for non-linear waves in relatively deep waters). The possible wave amplitude errors impact directly the predicted wave forces acting on the ship. The coupling tool developed to combine the SWASH and Harberth models proved to be consistent for the simplified tested conditions. The first-order forces computed using SWASH and Harberth are generally well predicted, while larger deviations can occur for the second-order forces. These are partially related to the simplification of motions made by Harberth in the computation of second-order forces. The proposed approach using the SWASH and Harberth models, combined with the developed coupling tool, is validated using model test data of waves and forces acting on a restrained ship. In general the performance is satisfactory, even for very energetic conditions, implying that the investigated modelling approach is a potential alternative for future applications. Finally, a list of recommendations is provided, including possible improvements in the SWASH model and Harberth model, and additional tests to consolidate the proposed modelling approach.","mooring; SWASH; Harberth; wave modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

Minimally Invasive Surgery usesmuch smaller incisions compared to the traditional open surgery. The procedure is less invasive than open surgery and there is minimal damage to biological tissues at the point of entrance of the instrument. This results in a quicker healing for the patients and a shorter hospital stay. The downside of these reusable MIS instruments is that they are more difficult to clean than conventional surgical instruments. MIS instruments consist ofmostly narrow channels and therefore they are also called hollow, or cannulated instruments. Narrow channels are ideal places for human tissues, residuals and bacteria to nestle. This offers a challenge to the Central Sterile Supply Department (CSSD) in cleaning these instruments on the outside as well as on the inside. During the automated cleaning process, hollow instruments are rinsed on the inside in a washer-disinfector. In order tomake this possible, these instruments have to be connected to the washer-disinfector. The aim of this study is to get more insight into the cleaning performance of several cleaning applications for hollow instruments based on their mechanical performances, expressed as flow and pressure through an instrument. A cleaning application is a device that connects a hollow instrument to the washer-disinfector. At present there are several applications and cleaning methods available without the knowledge for which instruments they are most suitable, and what their effect is on the cleanness of the instrument. In this study a comparative analysis is made of cleaning applications of hollowinstruments at the CSSD. The study is limited to the first phase of the decontamination process; the cleaning process. This study focuses on the mechanical performance (flow and pressure) of a cleaning application. The mechanical performance was recorded by a measurement system that was able to measure flow, pressure and temperature in eight separate channels at the same time.","holow instruments; lumen; cleaning process; CSSD; mechanical performance; minimally invasive surgery; medical instruments","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-11-05","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","bmd","",""

The city also has an important contribution to the economic growth of Colombia, because of its big port and its beneficial location towards the Panama Channel. However, Cartagena is suffering from problems with the accessibility of different parts of the city, due to factors as flooding and overtopping waves. A previous group of students from the university in Delft, The Netherlands, did a study on those problems in Cartagena in 2013 and came up with a solution, a tunnel to diminish the traffic congestion problems. This result is the start of this project. The main traffic problems are around the old city centre. Between the airport and the old city a new cut and cover tunnel is being constructed at this moment, but the traffic problems between the centre, Bocagrande and Manga will not benefit from this solution. To improve the traffic between those parts, a track has been designed from the city centre to Bocagrande and further on towards the island of Manga. In the design the new road will be constructed on a land elevation in the Caribbean Sea in front of the city. The internal bay of Cartagena will be crossed by an immersed tunnel. The connections between the new road and the existing traffic system are all designed with roundabouts. The dyke section of the new connection could have a great addition to the project, as it would be the main generator of money. The option to create new land behind the levee could attract a lot of investors who are willing to pay for the valuable surface near to the city centre and Bocagrande. With this dyke the coastal face will change a lot, including the changes of the Colombian coast in general. Those effects are left out of consideration, because of the scope and the focus of the project on the part of the tunnel. The design of the tunnel is built of three main parts, the abutment, the tunnel elements and the groundwork. The abutments on both sides of the tunnel are the transition between the current road system and the immersed tunnel. The abutment roughly contains three parts, at first an open part, which will be a tunnel without roof which is guiding the traffic into the ground. The second is a service building, which connects the open and closed tunnel. In the service building the main control room is situated, just as the flooding prevention. The joint with the immersed tunnel is made by a closed tunnel. The abutment will be built in the dry, the construction site is provided by a building pit made of sheet piles.","cartagena; tunnel; traffic congestion","en","student report","TU Delft, Department Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","10.413551, -75.545222"

(mentor)","2014","Without any form of compensation, atmospheric turbulence blurs the images obtained by ground-based telescopes. An Adaptive Optics (AO) system compensates for the optical wavefront distortions introduced in a light beam as it propagates through a turbulent medium. The wavefront phase errors are measured with a Wavefront Sensor (WFS) and corrected by adding the conjugated phase with an actuator such as a Deformable Mirror (DM). This graduation project focuses on the reconstruction of the wavefront using a Shack-Hartmann (SH) WFS, while taking its spatial and temporal dynamics into account. The recently introduced Spline based ABerration REconstruction (SABRE) is used to model the spatial dynamics using the approximated slopes. It has been shown that using the measured intensity pattern of the WFS, rather than the approximated slopes (which are obtained using a centroid algorithm), the WFR can be improved, because the intensity distribution contains more information than the approximated slopes. This, however, has been demonstrated using a Hartmann sensor. The first contribution of this thesis was to adapt the method for the SH WFS, which is the commonly used sensor in astronomy. This is achieved by using an additional image of a SH WFS under the same conditions, but with an additional known aberration. The prescribed algorithms are tested with the AO simulation tool Yao. It is shown that for small aberrations, SABRE with intensity measurements provides more accurate reconstructions of the wavefront. Because of a delay, caused by the WFS and WFR, an error is introduced resulting from the temporal dynamics of the wavefront. The second goal of this thesis is to predict the wavefront aberrations, such that the temporal dynamics are taken into account. Furthermore, the prediction should exploit the local nature of SABRE, such that it is applicable for parallel programming. Subspace Identification (SID) is employed for estimating the model of the temporal dynamics. The estimated model is used by a Kalman Filter (KF) to predict the wavefront aberration. The SID and KF are adapted to methods which are compliant with the local nature of SABRE and therefore, the presented SID and KF are suitable for parallel programming. The SID and KF are tested and tuned with both methods of SABRE, i.e. SABRE with the approximated slopes and SABRE with the measured intensities. It is demonstrated that the KF predicts the aberration significantly more accurate compared to the delayed reconstruction and at times even outperforms the reconstruction without delay.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","DCSC","","Systems & Control","",""

(mentor); Van der Duin, P. (mentor); Van der Bijl, W. (mentor)","2014","Our research is exploring how the computer network technology of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) can benefit an IT service provider. SDN is a novel technology that is capable of managing a whole network based on a single centralized entity. As a result an SDN enabled network becomes more flexible, automatable and programmable to satisfy users’ needs. SDN with its automation features can enhance cloud services, and mainly the well-known Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), as it can significantly reduce the services’ delivery time and the costs for their provisioning. More specifically, this thesis emphasizes on how the IT service provider’s datacenter services can be improved both for its own benefit and of course for the benefit of its customers as well. Our approach for the exploration and exploitation of the novel technology, is the design of a business model enabled by SDN technology. Primary stakeholder and user of the business model is the IT service provider. Additionally, we have to specify that this research is based on a single case study that is executed in collaboration with the Dutch branch of Capgemini. For the completion of our research we are making extensive literature review and interviews with experts of the field. In the next lines of this summary we are going to briefly mention the contents of each chapter as well as our findings, conclusions and recommendations for each one of them. The maser thesis consists of six chapters, which are interconnected as a logical continuation of each other. More specifically: Chapter 1 – Introduction. This is the chapter that is making a general reference to the contents of the master thesis, the issue stakeholder, the research objectives, and research questions. Issue stakeholder is the IT service provider, and our three research objectives are: “the identification of the current state and future trends of the SDN technology both in the market and the academia”, “the identification of the business model framework that supports the case of the SDN technology adoption from an IT service provider” and “the design of a business model for delivery of SDN enabled services”. These three research objectives are translated to three relevant research questions. All three research questions are giving answer to the main research question. Chapter 2 – State of the art of SDN - Current status and future trends. The second chapter is giving answer to the first research question: “What is the state of the art of SDN?”. It is related with the state of the art of SDN and its future trends. A brief summarized answer would be that SDN is currently still in its early adoption phase and OpenFlow is the dominant enabling protocol. Moreover, there are many different SDN controllers in the market and much more are the nonproprietary projects that big established infrastructure vendors support. Use cases of SDN are focusing on: network management and availability, security assurance and innovative wireless implementations. The diffusion of SDN technology for the entire market is yet to come. The future of the SDN technology is forecasted to be full of new developments that will be open source oriented. The SDN market is constantly growing and the academia is eager to keep exploring and exploiting the domain. The outcomes of chapter two are taken in consideration for the design of the business model in chapter five. Chapter 3 – Business Model Literature Review. In the third chapter of the master thesis is given answer to the second research question: “Which business model framework best supports the design of an SDN business model?”. For this answer an extensive comparison of three different business model frameworks is made. The STOF, VISOR and Canvas frameworks are compared and as the best fitting framework to the case of SDN is chosen to be the STOF framework. Chapter 4 – Research design methodology. In the fourth chapter the research design of the thesis is made explicit. Through the chapter is analyzed the research design methodology, the data collection methodology and the way that the chosen business model framework is used. We are making use of the design science research of (Vaishnavi & Kuechler, 2007) and the design cycle for the design oriented researches of (Verschuren & Hartog, 2005). Plus we are extracting all the necessary data for our research through interviews with experts. Chapter 5 – Business model design. The fifth chapter is the initiation of the second part of the thesis where the business model is designed and the third and last research question is answered: “Based on the selected business model framework, how does a viable business model that integrates SDN technology in an IT service provider’s datacenter infrastructure, looks like?”. Chapter 6 – Discussion and Conclusions. Conclusions, limitations as well as future research, in addition with some recommendations and reflection of the whole thesis, are included in this chapter. Much more the main research question is answered as well.","SDN; Software Defined Networking; Value creation; automation; IT service provider; business model; STOF; design science; computer networks; innovation; sourcing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-11-04","Technology, Policy and Management","Information and Communication Technology","","Management of Technology","",""

After decades of economic growth and decline, the labour force will decline as a result of the aging of the Dutch society. The decreasing labour force means a stop on the demand for office space. This is in itself not a problem, however the Netherlands has a heritage of vacant office space about four times the country of Monaco. In the meantime parts of the Netherlands are shrinking, on the borders of the country and in the South, and other parts are booming, especially the Randstad. In the Randstad this means a decline in labour force (apart from Amsterdam) and a higher demand in housing. In a land filled with vacant office space this could be the first chance to grow the city within it’s borders instead of ploughing acres of greenfield for a new VINEX-neighbourhood. The practice, is unfortunately, different. On the one hand companies, developers, architects and contracts are building new offices in the centres of the Randstad and on the other hand municipalities are still ploughing acres of land to house their inhabitants. Politics, money and land policy propels this process. This thesis proposes this system and tries to take advantage of the now useless vacant space. Furthermore it shows that with less investment than ploughing acres of green-fields, the Netherlands can house it’s inhabitants without loosing the quality of living in a new house with a garden. To analyse this current short-sightedness of planning in the Netherlands, the municipality of Rijswijk is selected as a case study. With the mono-functional business park the Plaspoelpolder and the plans to build a new neighbourhood for 3500 homes 1 km away from the business park, it gives a perfect example. Through a multi-disciplinary research a (spatial) strategy is applied that focuses on the rejection of Rijswijk-Zuid, the reuse of the vacant load-bearing structures and the quality of the dwelling within these vacant structures. The aim is to provide a different perspective on how Dutch municipalities cope with the question of housing and, if they are, with the (spatial) problems of vacancy in office space.","preserving space","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-11-04","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Design as Politics","",""

These water levels with a specified return period are used for the design of dikes and other flood protection measures along the river Meuse. Current practice is that these water levels are determined by hydrodynamic simulation of a standard design hydrograph at the upstream gauging station Borgharen. The peak discharge of this standard design hydrograph is based on a frequency analysis and its shape is determined by scaling and averaging all flood hydrographs in the dataset. Then it is assumed that the simulated water levels have the same return period as the peak discharge at Borgharen. Until now, this method was not validated. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the influence of hydrograph shape on design water levels on the river Meuse, and to evaluate current and alternative methods to take this shape into account. The five alternative methods are (1) hydrodynamic simulation of all floods in the dataset and apply frequency analysis afterwards on the simulated water levels (the reference), (2) the standard method extended with dependence between the hydrograph shape and the peak discharge, (3) vertical averaging, and two probabilistic methods which combine hydrograph shape statistics at Borgharen with a transformation function that relates local water levels to these hydrograph shape statistics. Within the probabilistic methods one can distinguish explicit (4), which expresses the statistics in probability distribution functions, and implicit (5), which does not use these functions. The influence of hydrograph shape variables on the downstream water level was investigated by means of a correlation analysis. To evaluate the different methods, all methods were applied to a GRADE dataset of 50,000 years of generated discharge at Borgharen, and the resulting design water levels compared to the reference. In addition to the ability to estimate design water levels, the methods were evaluated on the ability to estimate the design water level reduction of a retention basin (Lob van Gennep). Peak discharge combined with peak curvature were found to be good predictors of the downstream water levels, and were used in the probabilistic methods. The evaluation of methods shows that the currently used standard hydrograph method overestimates the design water levels up to 37 cm with respect to the reference. The present research shows that the current method to determine design water levels can be improved significantly. A simple improvement is to use the vertically averaged design hydrograph with a modified selection interval. More advanced probabilistic methods also improve the estimates, and are potentially valuable in case of retention basins, of which the effectiveness is sensitive to the hydrograph shape.","design water levels; hydrograph shape; probabilistic; Meuse; GRADE; retention basins","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

Those marketplaces in Warsaw tend to disappear nowadays especially due to increasing land value and investment perspectives. The current tendency is to completely liquidate bazaars or replace them with homogenous market halls that usually lack aesthetic and spatial quality. Yet the urban marketplaces proved to be important for local communities. They constitute a vibrant public space and they are embedded in the city’s history. Moreover, the farmer’s markets are important part of local food systems and they enhance urban economy. The aim of the project is to propose a solution for new type of structure housing indoor/outdoor marketplace, which would suite the needs of contemporary city of Warsaw.

(mentor); Van der Voordt, D.J.M. (mentor)","2014","Door een wetswijziging in de Algemene Wet Bijzondere Ziektekosten (AWBZ) worden zorginstellingen geconfronteerd met ingrijpende veranderingen voor hun vastgoed. Door de wetswijziging komen mensen pas in aanmerking voor opname in een verpleeghuis als ze een zwaardere zorgindicatie hebben dan voorheen het geval was. Dat betekent onder andere dat het zorgvastgoed geschikt moet worden gemaakt voor ouderen met ernstiger vormen van dementie (Pieter van Foreest, 2013). Omdat mensen met dementie geheugenproblemen hebben, is het voor hen lastiger om te wennen aan hun nieuwe woonsituatie. De fysieke omgeving van de woonvoorzieningen moet voorzien in de juiste prikkelbalans voor een fijne beleving van de leefomgeving (Lawton and Nahemow, 1973). Naast een fijne leefomgeving voor ouderen met dementie is het van belang dat er aandacht is voor de ontwerpkenmerken die het verpleeghuis voor mantelzorgers of personeel tot een aantrekkelijke of prettige verblijfsruimte of werkplek maken. Inzicht in de vormgevingsvoorkeuren van de verschillende gebruikers is hiervoor van belang. Vanuit wetenschappelijk oogpunt blijken er onvoldoende empirische gegevens beschikbaar over hoe het ontwerp en de inrichting van verpleeghuizen bijdraagt aan de mate waarin demente ouderen met een zware zorgindicatie zich thuis voelen in het verpleeghuis (Stroobants and Verhaest, 2012). Ook blijkt uit onderzoek dat behoeften van mantelzorg en personeel onvoldoende worden onderbouwd en geïntegreerd (Huisman et al., 2012). Doorgaans worden demente bewoners niet gehoord omdat men hen daartoe niet bekwaam acht. Toch blijkt een betrouwbaar en valide antwoord mogelijk op vragen over hun voorkeuren (Whitlatch, 2010). Uit onderzoek blijkt dat de kwaliteit van een ruimte slecht in woorden te vangen is (Zeisel, 2006). Uit interviews en site visits blijkt de noodzaak om te komen tot een beeldkwaliteitsplan om inzicht te geven in de fysieke verschijning van de vormgevingsvoorkeuren. Een beeldkwaliteitsplan kan het communicatieprobleem overbruggen. In het algemeen ontbreekt het aan een vragenlijst waarmee de vormgevingsaspecten op een beeldende wijze kunnen worden onderzocht. Daarom is voor het voeden van het beeldkwaliteitsplan gekozen voor een onderzoek met behulp van vignetten. De vignettenmethode leent zich als onderzoeksmethode omdat hiermee vorm- en inrichtingsvariabelen getoetst kunnen worden, de kwaliteit van de ruimte goed weergegeven kan worden en dit bovendien aan ouderen met dementie zélf de mogelijkheid biedt om de voorkeur te geven. Er hebben aan het vignettenonderzoek 100 respondenten meegewerkt.

The fault-tolerant capabilities of the designed controller are evaluated with a proof-of-concept flight simulation in the SIMONA Research Simulator. The results of this evaluation indicate that the designed multi-loop SB-NDI controller is not only capable of extending the survivability of the aircraft when compared with a conventional NDI attitude rate controller with a fixed aerodynamic model, it also indicates that it requires a similar physical effort for a post-failure aircraft as an aircraft without failures.","fault-tolerant; flight control; piloted simulation; model-independent; backstepping; nonlinear dynamic inversion; NDI; sensor-based","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-11-30","Aerospace Engineering","Control and Operations","","Control and Simulation; Guidance Navigation and Control","",""

(mentor); Strous, T.D. (mentor)","2014","As the need for electrical power from sustainable energy sources is continually increasing, electrical power generation from wind turbines continues to grow. A common type of electrical generators used in wind turbines is the Doubly Fed Induction Generator. However, this type of generator suffers from reliability issues associated with slip rings and brushes. The Brushless Doubly Fed Induction Generator (BDFIG) is an attractive choice to eliminate the drawbacks associated with slip rings and brushes. To commercialize the first BDFIG wind turbine a high performance control algorithm must be designed. This thesis focuses on the development of a control algorithm for a BDFIG based Wind Turbine Drivetrain (WTDT) system including sensorless position estimation. To explore the characteristics of the BDFIG, an equivalent circuit is developed to determine the machine steady state behavior. From the BDFIG equivalent circuit, a dynamic model of the machines is derived to form the basis for the control algorithm development. The control algorithm is based on a Field Orientated Control using a two cascaded control loops for control of active- and reactive power. WTDT reliability can be further improved by eliminating the rotor position sensor. In place of a position sensor, a method of estimating rotor position is required, such that a senorless control algorithm is achieved. Two methods for position estimation are investigated and theoretically validated. Indirect position estimation, though speed estimation, using Model Reference Adaptive System is developed and compared to direct position estimation through induced Back-Electromotive Force (B-EMF) in the stator windings. The developed sensorless control algorithm provides maximum wind power extraction during the expected operating range, where active- and reactive power control loops response are limited by mechanical inertia. The control algorithm uses the induced stator B-EMF for rotor position estimation. To test the validity of a sensorless control algorithm for a BDFIG, an experimental setup has been constructed. A sensorless current control of the Control Winding (CW) active- and reactive power has been experimentally validated, where the CW frequency is made to follow the CW stator flux. The experimental controller maintains synchronous mode of operation, for a limited speed range, due to presence of space harmonics.","BDFIG; Sensorless control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Power Engineering","","Electrical Power Processing","",""

(mentor); De Ridder, J. (mentor)","2014","Motivation: Identification and elucidation of eQTL has long been an active area of research. Finding cis-eQTL has been a manageable problem because of the limited number of candidates. Finding transeQTL has on the other hand been much more challenging because of the issue of multiple hypothesis testing. It has been suggested that additional information might alleviate this problem and although there has been some success using such methods no comprehensive data integration strategy has been developed. Approach: In order to comprehensively solve the issue of multiple hypothesis testing in the context of trans-eQTL discovery this research introduces MASSQTL: A comprehensive data integration method that makes use of a deep neural network (DNN) to prune the transeQTL candidate space to a desired size with the objective of finding more significantly associated trans-eQTL. Results: With MASSQTL many more trans-eQTL were found using a deep neural network filtering approach. The deep neural network outperformed other machine learning models showing that deep learning by use of complex hierarchical representations is able to model a diverse and sparse set of biological data. In addition to that the method provided new insight into the mechanisms underlying the regulatory architecture of gene expression.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Pattern Recognition and Bioinformatics group","","Computer Science","",""

(mentor)","2014","Hyperbody graduation studio was focused on the exploration of the concept of Climatic Ecologies, in which the climatic relationships between the building and its context are the main concern in order to establish a synergistic relation between the architectural space and the environment. Within the framework of the studio, my project explores the case of the Vistula River passing through the city center of Warsaw in what is called a para-natural state, the only such case in Europe. After years of the city turning back to the river and neglecting its banks, Warsaw is now highly focused on creating a strategy for the redevelopment of the river channel in order to bring back its proper hydrological and ecological functioning, as well as to re-establish the relationship between the river and the citizens. As opposed to the city’s strategy, based on distinguishing highly urbanized parts of the channel from its natural sections, inaccessible to humans, my project aims to propose a local strategy on how could architecture be introduced in the river channel in a way that doesn’t compromise its proper functioning and, at the same time, creates a valuable architectural space devoted to recreation and education about the importance of the river for the city and its ecosystem. In this context, the project seeks for a way to weave the natural and architectural landscape for the benefits of both and explores what kind of architectural qualities such approach could bring.","landscape; river; Warsaw; education & observation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architecture","","Hyperbody","",""

(mentor); Bekebrede, G. (mentor); Thissen, W.A.H. (mentor); Kempers, R. (mentor)","2014","As alternative to IWRM, the Negotiated Approach is proposed to involve communities in groundwater management. This should increase water security in peri-urban Khulna, in Bangladesh. A serious game is desired to make the approach more accessible and support its collective learning process. With interviews, different parts in the process that required support were identified. By linking different game functions to the process, the desired function of mediation support was selected. A review of existing alternatives confirmed the feasibility of such a tool. Analysis of the situation in Khulna showed that awareness of interdependency, influence on the problem and the benefits of cooperation are desired learning effects. Because these cannot be enhanced by existing applications, a paper-based, multi-level, format in which all players extract water from the same bucket in order to achieve objectives, is proposed. Evaluations with experts and playtests show that the prototype is adaptable and playable with different player types. The game did succeed in enhancing perspective change and creating a notion of interdependency, but still lacks a clear cooperative goal and is likely too difficult to be played by local users. Because the game is designed outside its intended context, further development in Khulna is necessary.","serious gaming; mediation; groundwater management; Negotiated Approach; water governance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Policy Analysis","","Engineering & Policy Analysis","",""
