IS can occur when there are local opportunities for the exchange of an underutilized resource, this means that the exchanged resource is often not a standard product. A non-standard product requires technical expertise and investments in processing equipment or other physical assets. Which in turn puts additional tension on the socio-economic decision making process, because of asset specificity. Thus systems with IS are complex systems, systems with an interplay between socio-economic behaviour and the technical network (Dijkema & Basson 2009). As a consequence, IS attracts scientists from multiple different disciplines. This might explain why there is not yet a widely shared understanding of self-organizing IS (Chertow & Ehrenfeld 2012). All big challenges society phases require inter-disciplinary collaboration. Finding a way to built inter-disciplinary knowledge without reducing the level of detail, is thus not only relevant to IS-research, but ever more important for society in general.","industrial symbiosis; semantic web; ontology design; case studies; collaboration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy and Industry","","","",""

(mentor); Van der Voort, H.G. (mentor); Vrancken, J.L.M. (mentor)","2014","VDL-ETG is a contract-manufacturing firm active in among others the high-tech mechatronics market. Due to developments at VDL-ETG and the market in which they are active, VDL-ETG decided that they needed a more structured product development process. Therefore VDL-ETG has designed a tailor-made product development process which they call the Product Generation Process (PGP). This thesis focusses on the best practices for implementing such a process, the research was done in collaboration with VDL-ETG. There are numerous views on what such a product development process should look like and which ones are most successful. Less attention is given to the fact that to a large part the success of a product development process is dependent on the correct implementation of a process that fits the specific company. As such this research focusses on the aspects which are important for the successful implementation of a product development process and specifically PGP at VDL-ETG. The approach taken to reach this goal consists of three parts on which this research focusses: 1. The first source of information is scarce literature that has been written on practical experience with the implementation of a product development process and which challenges were encountered. 2. Secondly literature on change processes is considered since implementing a product development process means bringing more structure for employees. This can be approached as a type of a change process and literature on this subject can be valuable in improving the success of implementation. 3. Thirdly interviews with employees of VDL-ETG have been conducted as to contribute a practice oriented view to the research. Also information gathered from the interviews can be used to tailor the recommendations to VDL-ETG. As a result of this research a list was compiled the of most important aspects to look into when considering to implement a product development process, the aspects are separated into three categories. The first category is about the planning phase before implementing the process, the second phase is about aspects important when introducing a product development process and the last phase is about what is important during the use of the process when pursuing successful implementation. Preparation 1) Motivation and agreement on the need for a product development process and what it should look like 2) Stakeholder identification; who are involved and what are their responsibilities 3) Commitment and involvement from the senior-management throughout the process 4) Commit resources to the development and introduction of the new product development process 5) Make use of the experience from other companies about what the process should look like but make sure to adapt to the specific needs of the company Introduction 6) A clear and properly communicated vision where everyone knows his or her role 7) Initiators are needed for using the process to get the newly introduced process going. Thus buy-in from key-employees 8) Make use of multi-disciplinary teams and promote concurrent activities 9) Provide as much help as possible while introducing the process 10) Deal with complications during implementation concurrently, before they become complex 11) Be aware that it is a change process; the process needs to be sold to the employees 12) Manage expectations; it takes time to see the positive effects of a product development process 13) Be aware that the structure of a product development process can be intimidating for companies used to a flexible way of working During use 14) Be flexible with the design of the process, experience in the organization can help improve the process 15) Eventually make sure that improvements are applied continuously and that the process keeps evolving according to the needs of the company For VDL-ETG specifically it was concluded that this list is too extensive and does not fit with the company. The list of aspects and the literature on the subject in general is largely focussed towards the centralization of organizations. This is not how VDL-ETG works and it is not something that they strive for, they are more of a market-oriented and externally focussed organization, therefore a sub-selection has been made of the most important aspects for VDL-ETG and to what extent they should be applied. For VDL-ETG aspects 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 11, 13 and 15 were found to be most important. The most important points of attention for VDL-ETG are as follows. - On the subject of everyone within the company knowing their role and responsibility it was concluded that although it is important, specifically naming everyone’s roles and responsibilities is not attainable, the good enough alternative would be to at least divide the tasks to the different departments. - Active involvement by the management, communicating that they find using the process important and show genuine interest in PGP, among others by planning regular meetings to discuss PGP progress of projects. - Alignment on what actually is the vision for which VDL-ETG is implementing PGP in order to prevent confusion. - Find the right people to start using the process and iron out the large hurdles of using PGP. - Keep an eye on the future as not to lose track on successful use of PGP once properly implemented.","Product Development Process; Organizational Change; Implementation; Phase-gate","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Systems Engineering","","Engineering & Policy Analysis","",""

(mentor); Annema, J.A. (mentor); Ravesteijn, W. (mentor); Mouter, N. (mentor)","2014","Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) is the most widely used tool for evaluating policy programs and capital expenditure. It involves estimating, where possible, the full direct and indirect private; and social costs and benefits associated with a policy action or potential project. The Netherlands is one of the countries that use CBA in transport project appraisal; and its practice is considered as state-of-the arts in transports sector. However, there are a number of issues in its practice, which can be categorized into content- and process- issues. On one hand, from the perspective of spatial-infrastructure appraisal process, content-related issues are those issues regarding all the estimations of effects and the way the effects are presented in the CBA report. On the other hand, process-related issues are those issues pertaining to the use of CBA as a supporting/supplementing tool. By comparing the way the Dutch CBA practice with the way another practice (the United States) deals with these issues, it is deemed that both countries can learn from each other. It is in the interest of the thesis to compare transport projects appraisal in several countries. However, by comparing many countries in one study through an in-depth analysis, one may struggle to analyze accordingly and make useful/practical recommendations to all the countries, due to various methods applied in these many countries. Furthermore, given the time allocated for this thesis projects, it is rather impractical to cover more than two countries in the project. Hence, the thesis is set to compare the transport projects appraisal between two countries for the purpose of improvements in both countries’ practices. The choice of a case study (country) - the United States - was made since there is long tradition of utilizing CBA in public sector decision-making; unavailability of comparative studies in this topic between the two countries; and cultural difference between the countries. Thus, the main research question is formulated as the following:- By comparing the similarities and differences in transport projects appraisal between the Netherlands and the United States, how can both countries learn from each other? The objectives of the thesis is to analyze differences and the similarities of the transport projects appraisal between the Netherlands and the United States which leads to reflections and recommendations, not just to the Dutch but also to the United States transports project appraisal. In order to achieve these goals, first, the methodology of ex-ante evaluation conducted in both countries was studied primarily through desk research, examining relevant formal reports, guidelines, legislation documents etc. These documents were put together in the frameworks of Social Cost-benefit Analysis or Combinatorial of Cost-Benefit Analysis and Multi-criteria Analysis for comparison purposes. Secondly, in order to confirm the utilization of those guidelines in transports projects appraisal, in-depth interview was conducted. Finally, comparison is made between the two countries. Regarding the methodology of analysis and with an exception of the inclusion of Reliability indicator in the Dutch CBA, the comparison shows that the main commonalities are the inclusion of the conventional transport indicators (Value of Time (VOT), Value-of-a-statistical life (VSL), Value of Injuries and air pollutant emissions), their methodological basis and degree of monetization. The differences occur at (1) the use of lower discount rate for irreversible effects in the Dutch CBA; (2) the appraisal horizon; (3) the inclusion of other plans and policies (for instance Land Use and Economy) in the American CBA/MCA practice. The main differences occur mainly regarding the use of the results in the decision-making which include (1) responsibility bodies conducting and reviewing the analysis; (2) disclosure of content of evaluation; (3) stakeholders’ involvement. Reflections and recommendations following the comparison for both countries are as the following: i. The de-briefing procedure between the technical review teams and unsuccessful applicants in the United States is an interesting procedure for the Dutch CBA practitioners as it could enhance the use of CBA in the decision-making process; and ii. Both nations can learn from each other in stakeholders’ involvement. The American practitioners can adopt the Effect Arena used in the Dutch CBA practice; and the Dutch practitioners can adopt the way the content of the evaluation is published (online) for stakeholders perusal/comments/inputs in the United States iii. For the Dutch CBA practice, it might be worth to think about adjusting the appraisal horizon project to justify the need to control uncertainties in the analysis; or at least, to ponder the reason ‘why’ it is currently set at 100 years; iv. There should be inclusion of any policies that are related/affected to/by the projects, explicitly in the Dutch CBA; v. The Dutch CBA inclusion of Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY) and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) is worthy of attention from the American practitioners; vi. The American practitioner may want to consider to include Reliability indicator in the ex-ante evaluation of transport projects appraisal as such an inclusion is suggested widely in the literature ; and vii. The American practitioners could look into the inclusion of indirect effects (agglomeration effects), such as employment, in the Dutch CBA as these effects have grown more attention in the United States nowadays.","Cost-benefit Analysis; Transports Projects Appraisal; Comparative Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Transports and Logistics","","Master of Science in Engineering & Policy Analysis","",""

(mentor); Van Geer, F.C. (mentor); Lourens, A. (mentor)","2014","Hydraulic head data is frequently used for the calibration of groundwater flow models, usually with the main objective to improve the model performance. The hydraulic parameters in a groundwater flow model depend on the underlying geometry of the subsurface and the permeability of the soil. In the current calibration routines, the geometry is considered known, such that all uncertainties of the hydraulic parameters are ascribed to the permeabilities. After calibration these permeabilities may have physically unreasonable values, indicating that the estimate of the geometry is likely to be wrong. In this thesis the roles are reversed. A calibration procedure that focuses on the uncertainty of the geometry is performed. This shift introduces a dependency between the hydraulic parameters that is not considered in the current calibration method. An EnKF and EnKF-GMM are applied to a synthetic test case where only the geometry of one aquitard is considered uncertain. The filters are performed with the objectives to 1) localise the extent of the aquitard, and 2) find a probability distribution function for the thickness of the aquitard. In a series of experiments it is shown that the EnKF is only suitable in situations where the exact extent of the aquitard is known. In other cases, the probability distribution function of the thickness is bimodal, resulting in an EnKF that performs poorly and produces physically unrealistic outputs. As a solution, the EnKF-GMM is proposed. This extension of the regular EnKF can be used in more general scenarios as it allows a multimodal distribution as posterior distribution. Roughly speaking, the EnKF-GMM is an application of two EnKFs simultaneously. For two separate populations (modes) an EnKF is performed, and after each iteration the inhabitants of the population have the possibility to cross over to the other population. The cross-over probabilities are based on the likelihood of each population. The results of the experiments show that the EnKF-GMM is able to define probabilities on the extent of the aquitard. However, it fails to find a proper probability distribution function of the thickness. Filter divergence occurs as a result of the insufficient amount of information that hydraulic head data contains.","data assimilation; EnKF; EnKF-GMM; uncertainty assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied mathematics","","","",""

This decrease is clearly visible at Coca-Cola Enterprises (CCE), the biggest bottler and distributor of the product portfolio of the Coca-Cola Company in Europe. The Dutch market is primarily supplied by the Dutch CCE branch plant located in Dongen. The annual sales volume of CCE in 2010 was around 50 million CCE cases, which is approximately 400 million liters of soda. The expected sales volume to retailers for 2014 is around 42 million CCE cases, a decrease in sales of approximately 15%. Next to the decrease in volume, retailers have become reticent in their communication around sales promotions, causing large fluctuations in the declining demand. CCE Dongen produces over 180 Stock Keeping Units (SKUs), differentiated by a wide variety of flavors (Coca-Cola, Fanta, Sprite etc.) and different types of packaging (glass bottles, PET-bottles and cans). In order to cope with the market demands, changeovers on the production lines take place regularly. The reduced sales and the demand fluctuations, in combination with an increase in the number of SKUs and a preferred reduction in lead-time has caused CCE Dongen, the commissioning company in this master thesis research, to rethink the way they manage their production processes in order to stay competitive...","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2020-10-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""

(mentor)","2014","Birds pose a serious threat to aviation industry due to the fact that birds and aircraft share the same aerospace and inevitably collisions between them cannot be avoided. These collisions can cause from minor dents to the aircraft's fuselage to catastrophic damages to the engines which can lead to multiple human loses. In order to prevent bird strikes, airports use various bird control management methods. One of these methods is Falconry. Falconers use birds of prey to scare the birds that populate the airport's vicinity and keep them away from approaching the runways where the aircraft traffic is. Falconry has been broadly used and had showed promising results. However, the same with all repelling methods used, it features limitations due to biological (hunger, molting, etc.) and exogenic parameters (rain, low visibility, etc.) that effect birds flight. Therefore, bird controllers are always in pursuit of alternative, and more efficient methods of repelling birds. FESTO, leading company in industrial control and automation, has established the Bionic Learning Network, a joint research of the company with universities, institutes and other technological companies, though which they developed the SmartBird. The SmartBird is a mechanical bird, able to simulate the natural flight of a herring gull. It was firstly presented in 2011 Hannover Messe and it was intended as a technology demonstrator. However the question has since been raised; can this prototype form the basis of a commercially available product against pest birds in airfields? This graduation project is a study of the possibilities of redesigning the SmartBird into an autonomous or semi-autonomous aerial bird repelling system inspired by falconry and the natural relationship and behavior between birds and predators. The methodology which has been followed is Nature Inspired Design, by which the development of the system will not only meet the functional requirements set for the fulfillment of its purpose, but also fit its context of use by establishing a win-win situation between the system and its context of use and leaving a positive footprint.","birdstrikes; drone; airport; birds; dock; smartbird; nature; inspired; design; aircraft","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","","51.992092, 4.366684"

The AM techniques are evolving the precision, repeatability and speed is being researched and will most probably improve over time. But one of the biggest thresholds for AM at Océ at this moment is the UL94 flammability certification, this requirement can currently only be matched by the material extrusion and the powder bed fusion AM techniques. Of which the second category offers the best material properties and most design freedom. An overview is made of the AM design opportunities with which engineers in the company were interviewed in the search for potential assemblies. The top carriage assembly (TCA) scored best on all set criteria. The current design of the TCA was analysed and all its stakeholders were interviewed from which the functions, requirements and wishes were derived for the new design. The TCA will have to consolidate all functions and will be optimised for individual and fool proof positioning and fixation of the PH, minimal underpressure and leakage for the cooling air flow towards the PH electronics and an easy accessible guidance and fixation of the connections to the PH, This whole construction will be optimised for lightweight and stiffness. The design should be inspirational and appealing to the Océ engineers. On the basis of the design brief ideas were generated and put into a morphological chart. With this chart three concepts were formulated out of which a merged concept was made. The merged concept was then further embodied according to the requirements and wishes. In the design of the TCA the PH is prepositioned with its fan duct in the U-profiles which makes placement easier. The positioning and fixation of the TPH’s is done with two hollow levers in and on the PH fan duct which simultaneously connects the TPH to the air cooling fan ducts. The underpressure can then be connected to the integrated underpressure divider and the flex cable to the lower carriage. The levers hinge in the body of the TCA which is fixated to the bottom carriage. This design is optimised, prototyped and iterated upon. Creep in PA is a big issue, the current positioning mechanism with a spring will not work because the stiffness of the material degrades too fast. Most features of the prototype worked, but there were also several inconsistencies with the CAD model and previous prototypes. The current design rules for SLS are a good start, but not everything is clear yet, therefore further research for design rules is recommended and the SLS production and finishing process should be made more consistent. The user test revealed that the current concept is user friendly but not yet fool proof. The configuration of the design was positively received and seemed to be clear. A fool proof design could be achieved by implementing more features as a better prepositioning and protection against wrong order of actions The comparison with the previous concept revealed that the AM design reduces the PH replacement time from 50 minutes for two PH’s to one minute for two PH’s. The AM concept costs 2 to 10 times as much as the previous sheet metal concept. But weighs 1,1kg which is 30%, less than the new sheet metal design.","Additive Manufacturing; Rapid Manufacturing; SLS; Printer carriage; Flow optimisation; Lightweight design; Positioning and fixation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2019-09-29","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Mahani, H. (mentor); Joekar Niasar, V. (mentor)","2014","Low salinity waterflooding (LSF) is a promising improved oil recovery (IOR) technique. The enhanced composition of injected water in LSF can change the wettability of the formation from oil-wet/ mixed-wet towards a more water-wet state. This leads to improved relative oil permeability (kro). The zeta potential, which is the electric potential at the shear plane, generally a couple of nanometers away from the rock/clay surface, can give an indication on rock wettability. Streaming potential measurements and electrophoretic (zetasizer) measurements give information on the zeta potential. Electrophoretic measurements can only be performed with crushed rock – brine or crushed rock – oil combinations. Streaming potential measurements are performed with sandstone cores. This allows for measurements with a full crude oil-brine-rock (COBR) system, which takes into account the proper ratio between rock/clay surface and bulk rock. In this thesis, we assess whether streaming potential measurements can give more information on rock wettability and wettability alteration for LSF. Therefore, we first compare the obtained experimental single-phase streaming potential data with bundle-of-tubes (BOT) models that use the zeta potential from electrophoretic measurements and the pore geometry from micro CT data as an input. Secondly, single-phase streaming potentialmeasurements are compared with two-phase streaming potential measurements. These two-phase measurements are then compared to specifically designed water-wet and oil-wet BOT models. The two-phase measurements are performed at residual oil saturation (Sor). The last objective is to see the qualitative streaming potential response of an aged COBR system, consisting of Dagang brine, Berea 700 sandstone and crude oil H. This thesis describes the streaming potential capabilities for single- and two-phase measurements that have been established at Delft University of Technology. Also, the results as obtained from streaming potential measurements and electrophoretic measurements are described in detail. Furthermore, a model (single- and two-phase (water-wet and oil-wet)) has been developed that contains both the overlapping of double layers and Stern layer conduction. The models use input from micro CT data (pore throat radius) and zetasizer measurements. This has not been done in literature before. A comparison of modeling data to experimental data shows that the models that include the overlapping of double layers and Stern layer conduction represent the laboratory data best. The Stern layer conduction can be used as a fitting parameter. The two-phase water-wet models show similar trends compared to the lab data. The three effects that have the largest influence on the coupling coefficient are Stern layer conduction, the overlapping of double layers and the effective flow (velocity) through the pores. At a higher salinity (10^-3 – 1 M), which coincides with the LSF region of interest (1500 – 5000 ppm), the coupling coefficients are geometry independent, not influenced by Stern layer conduction and more difficult to obtain, due to a high bulk conductivity of the liquid. It is hard to distinguish between measurements in this region; they all lie on the same line. Charge inversion in presence of Dagang brine in Berea 700 at 70 °C, indicates a flipped sign of the zeta potential. This might indicate that the positively charged system would like to bind negative oil components to it. This might influence the wettability of the rock. In final conclusion, streaming potential measurements should become standard practice in core flooding experiments. As this thesis shows, SP measurements give insight on surface processes occurring inside the core plug and therefore are a valuable addition to pressure drop measurements. This thesis provides valuable insights for continued research on IOR and EOR (enhanced oil recovery) topics. However, the continuation of streaming potential research for LSF should be assessed.","Low Salinity Waterflooding; EOR; IOR; Electrokinetics; Streaming potential; Electrophoresis; Zetasizer; Wettability; Bundle-of-tubes; Charge inversion; Stern layer conduction; Overlapping double layers; Electric double layer; Dagang brine","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

(mentor); Van Dooren, F. (mentor); Steenbergen, R. (mentor); Bijlaard, F. (mentor)","2014","Dutch national highway bridges have to cope with increasing traffic loads, causing steel bridges built in the 1970’s to suffer from fatigue problems. As a consequence there were assessments needed throughout the last decade to ensure safety. The resistance (strength) is relatively well understood compared to the loads that a bridge is subjected to. The use of the Eurocode is obligatory for the design, with additional national norms providing load reduction factors for existing structures. This results in costly refurbishments or even replacements, due to the fact that codes of practice are defined conservatively in order to be valid for a wide range of bridge types and loading conditions. The general load model is being reviewed here. An statistical analysis of highway bridge traffic loading is performed to determine if loads from the norm are realistic. Generally the objective is to assess the positive effect of influence lines/surfaces based on their shapes. This work focuses on longitudinal direction for theoretical single lane continuous spans of varying lengths over four supports, as well as existing bridges with multiple lanes and/or carriageways. Dynamic effects and interaction between vehicles and the structure are not considered. In this thesis 29 heavy vehicle types, with a unique statistical distribution established on WIM measurements are combined with a traffic micro-simulation model to obtain governing vehicle patterns. An extreme value analysis uses the results of dynamic simulations based on ten and one-year analysis to determine load effects during the lifetime of a bridge. The modified upper bound Gumbel distribution uses the monthly maximum load effects for extrapolation to the required exceedence probability. This method is applied to different span configurations. The study proves that the current standards are too conservative regarding influence line sensitive load effects. Factors that influence the load reduction were determined. The theoretical findings are complemented by assessments of existing bridges. Analysis of the transverse direction adds another dimension, increasing the load dependency on the influence lines. Although the findings are dependent on the structure and load effects, this study shows that load reduction based on the influence line shape is possible for crucial positions on a bridge. Theoretically this could lead to more economical bridge renovations.","bridges; traffic; loading; probabilistic; influence lines","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Concrete Structures","",""

Coastal engineering deals with sediment transport on a millisecond and micron scale, while geology deals with sequence stratigraphy on a millenary and 10-100 km scale. However, relatively less is known in between, and the effect of different processes cannot be separately analysed. The presented study is one way of understanding what effect would different processes, namely river discharge, tidal influence and sediment supply D50, have on the evolution, morphology and stratigraphy of a delta, on a decades and parasequence scale, by using Delft3D process-based modelling techniques. The approach adopted in the study is to setup a reference case with Delft3D based on literature study and Deltares/TU Delft expertise, to simulate the building out process of a delta. On top of that, 36 geologically and hydrodynamic realistic models were set up by systematically varying the tidal conditions, river discharge and sediment fractions in the supply. Upon their finishing, the area, rugosity, length to width ratio, dip magnitude, dip magnitude variance and dip azimuth angular dispersion, and sand fraction distribution have been measured for each of the numerical deltas. These results are then either plotted or visualized and compared with the reference case and also between each other. The study results suggest that (1) channel activity magnitude as indicated by the rugosity is positively related to mean river discharge and inversely proportional to the tidal influence; (2) the effect of tide and river discharge cannot be separated, since they interact with each other in a system. Higher combined strength of tidal and riverine forcing leads to larger mean foreset dip magnitudes, larger variance in dip magnitudes, and a lager dip azimuth angular dispersion. Sand body distribution is more continuous in low discharge and low tidal influenced situations; (3) The different dry bed densities of sediments supplied and their correspondent transport formula influences delta’s morphology in a significant way. With increasing D50, the deltas show: smaller area given the same mass of sediment, higher rugosity, more avulsions, lower length to width ratio, steeper foreset slopes, larger dip magnitude variance and less clean sand bodies.","finite element analysis; Delft3D process-based modelling; tidal influence; river discharge; sediment supply; rugosity; sand distribution","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-09-24","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering and Geosciences","",""

The work presented is the follow up of a sub-GHz UWB transceiver design for wireless, biomedical communication, of which the receiver aspect of the design was not completed. The primary goal in this work is the design of a suitable receiver architecture, thereby completing the transceiver design. A correlation receiver is presented, which can make use of a pulse generator (that was previously designed for the transmitter in the transceiver design) as its reference. The receiver is thoroughly tested in a test environment in Matlab, and compared with other UWB receiver designs. Research was done on negative influences on the communication link (such as noise and narrowband interference), in order to build a reliable test environment. Simulation results show that the correlation receiver performs better than other receiver architectures (such as an energy detector and a quadrature autocorrelation receiver). Finally, a MOS-only, four-quadrant, low power, 1 GHz multiplier circuit is designed using AustriaMicroSystems 0.18 µm High-Voltage CMOS technology. Its average power consumption is 153.2 uW on a 1.2 V power supply.

(mentor); Bierbooms, W.A.A.M. (mentor)","2014","The world’s energy consumption is rising, which will eventually result in the depletion of fossil fuels. A transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources as main energy supply has to be achieved to ensure the world’s energy supply on the long term [9]. To ensure the world’s energy supply, the European Commission adopted the climate and energy package with binding legislations, known as the 20-20-20 targets. To reach the targets set by the European Commission, renewable energy sources have to become less dependent on governmental subsidies and therefore the cost price of renewable energies has to be lowered. For wind turbines, this results in an reduction of the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCoE) by reducing the CAPEX (Capital Expenditures) and OPEX (Operational Expenditures). One way to do this is to take the Atmospheric Stability into account. More accurate load and power predictions can be executed, which could eventually lead in reduction of CAPEX and OPEX by increasing the accuracy of wind profiles and description of Turbulence Intensity. • Load calculations: More accurate load calculations could result in cost reductions of production, material etc. • Power calculations: More accurate power calculations could result in decrease of uncertainty of the power predictions leading to reduction of the OPEX through decrease of the interest rate. For the estimation of the atmospheric stability multiple classifications systems and methodologies can be used. In this master thesis, the focus will be on the classification of the atmospheric stability with the Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST) using multiple methodologies which are used in the industry and research. However, each methodology results to different values for the atmospheric stability. The goal of the project is to compare different methodologies, determine the best for each case and develop guidelines for atmospheric stability estimations.To achieve the goal, a comparison of multiple methodologies is executed using measurement campaigns on multiple levels at three locations. In the research significant differences in distribution, friction velocity and heat flux could be observed as a result of using different multiple methodologies and measurement heights. This is even noticed for the reference methodology, the Eddy Covariance Method, differences are found between different heights at the same site. Analysis of the atmospheric stability distributions, slope and correlation of both the friction velocity and heat flux showed that the Profile Method 2 gives the best approximation of the atmospheric stability conditions, due to the found high correlation and consistency using various measurements heights.The Profile Method 2 uses one wind speed measurement at the tower and two temperature measurements, at the surface and tower. A preference was found for tower measurements around a measurement height of 40-60 meters. At lower altitudes the sensory accuracy significantly influences the temperature difference and at higher altitudes it is often outside of the Surface Boundary Layer where MOST not any more is applicable. The research also showed that the methodologies based on the Richardson Number are strongly influenced by measurements outside the Surface Boundary Layer. Using the approximation of the Surface Boundary Layer height and filtering the timesteps where the measurement height is outside of the Surface Boundary Layer, results in a large data reduction. The resulting distribution can deviate with the local conditions, while equivalent load calculations require typical conditions of the Surface Boundary Layer. Translating various distributions found by different methodologies to the impact on the bending moment of the blade root of a wind turbine, by comparing the equivalent loads resulted in significant differences. The differences in equivalent load vary from 1-2% between the Eddy Covariance Methods at different heights up to around 15% for the Profile Method 1 and Gradient Richardson Number. Using the Profile Method 2, preferred methodology for onshore conditions, gave a difference of only 3% with the reference. Comparing this with the equivalent load found using the IEC guideline, where a 30% difference in equivalent load was found between the IEC guideline and the Eddy Covariance Method. This shows the impact and importance of the accurate determination of the atmospheric stability and possible reduction of LCoE which could be realized, by selecting the most suitable methodology. Finally resulting in the development of an appropriate guideline for atmospheric stability estimation.","Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Wind Energy","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

On the other side, Argentina holds permanent electricity importations from its neighboring countries, relying on these transactions to supply its demand. The Northern Interconnected System (SING) is one of the two major electrical isolated power systems in Chile with current surplus capacity and ongoing renewable energy developments. There is an existent not-operating, 345 kV transmission line between SING and the Interconnected Argentinian System (SADI), which in the past was completely dedicated to transmit power to Chile from a generation plant located in Argentina, without being fully interconnected to SADI. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in restarting the operation of the 345 kV transmission line. Therefore, this work performs a steady-state assessment based on load flow calculations with the computational tool DigSilent Power Factory, in order to evaluate the impact and capabilities of transmitting power from Chile to Argentina. This is done by simulating under-development wind projects that the German company, SoWiTec, has in Chile. The created scenarios also take into account that the exported capacity to Argentina might come from other renewables such as solar power as well as conventional technologies based on gas and coal. Permissible voltage levels and thermal loading are monitored throughout the work, paying especial attention to selected electrical nodes where the 345 kV transmission line is connected and to the wind projects´ points of common coupling with the power system. In the case of exceeding acceptable limits, solutions and measures are proposed and documented. This work also contains a commercial aspect in which the goal was to gain comprehension about the commercial structure that the interconnection SING-SADI will have. Ideas, being at the moment considered to be part of the policy framework to rule the transaction, have been gathered. Required regulation in Chile, possible commercialization modes, proposed scheme to manage the transaction and important features to be included at a regulatory level to empower renewable energies, were stated.","Steady-state; Load Flow; Chile; Argentina; Interconnection; Wind power","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","Master of Science in Electrical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Weltje, G.J. (mentor)","2014","A majority of the volume of alluvial sequences consists of fine-grained floodplain deposits (Kraus, 1987; Kraus & Gwinn, 1997). Traditionally, these deposits are seen as non-reservoir rock since their permeability is very low. This research shows that crevasse splay deposits that occur in these floodplain fines can comprise stacked complexes of splay channel sands and thin sheet sandstones. These crevasse splay deposits may provide additional production as secondary reservoirs in alluvial systems. Although much research on fluvial reservoir characteristics was carried out, this mainly focuses on properties of main river channel sandstones for primary production. Therefore, little is known about lateral characteristics of stacked crevasse splay deposits in floodplain fines. In order to gain more knowledge on depositional mechanisms and lateral reservoir properties of crevasse splay deposits, a fieldwork study and core description were carried out. During the fieldwork, crevasse splay features such as size, shape and grain sizes of ancient crevasse deposits were mapped. The outcropping sequence was captured in sedimentary logs. The fieldwork results were compared to two analogues: core descriptions of intervals at reservoir depth and a modern day crevasse splay. Both analogues have a similar depositional environment to the fieldwork area. With these results volume calculations were carried out on different scenarios, assuming crevasse splay deposits as a gas reservoir. This research shows that crevasse splay deposits have reservoir potential. Stacked crevasse complexes with a high (70%) net sand content were found to display typical thicknesses of 1-2,5m. These deposits are laterally extensive. This research presents a length of 1,5 km, but even larger examples are found in literature with lengths over 2 km. Grain sizes are decreasing with distance from river channel and crevasse channels. The correlation of grain size and distance is significantly better for distances to crevasse channels than for distances to the river channel. Depositional mechanisms that create lateral thickness variations create increased connectivity between crevasse sandstones. A possible further increase in connected area as a result of interfingering of different crevasse systems is described.","fluvial deposits; tough gas; crevasse splays","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Applied Geology","",""

The porosity and permeability of these reservoirs is low, but lateral amalgamation by compensational stacking can create extensive lobe-shaped sediment bodies with reservoir potential. The aim of this thesis is to characterize the development of crevasse complexes by describing lithology, morphology and grain size distribution of ancient fluvial systems in outcrop. A sequence stratigraphic interpretation of these systems is made. Crevasse splays in a lacustrine interval in the Cornudella Formation (M. Eocene, Tremp-Graus Basin, NE Spain) and crevasse splays in the Huesca fluvial fan (E. Miocene, Ebro Basin, NE Spain) were studied and sampled. Literature research, fieldwork, core study and grain size analysis are the main methods used for the research described in this thesis. The results are compared to contemporary crevasse splays in the Rio Colorado system, Altiplano Basin, Bolivia and to cores and wireline logs of a fluvial Triassic system in the West Netherlands Basin. These systems have similar depositional environments. In the Huesca fluvial fan system paleosol bound stratigraphic units consist of crevasse complexes, fluvial channels and overbank deposits. The crevasse complexes are coarsening upward and are interpreted as transitional avulsion stratigraphy coalescing along a feeder channel. The stacking patterns observed in the studied intervals can be self organising and need no allogenic forcing. Models relying on autogenic controls show similar stratigraphy. The vertical trends and gamma ray response in the Huesca fluvial system are similar to those of the cores from the West Netherlands Basin. The quantitative results of the 3-D outcrop studies can be used to make predictions from 1-D cores. Hydrocarbon production from these crevasse complexes may be possible, but is likely to need artificial enhancing due to low porosity and permeability. Connectivity with fluvial channels is common and is possibly beneficial to production. The studied outcrops may serve as an analogue to enhance 3-D reservoir architecture modelling and improve production of these reservoirs.","crevasse splay; tough gas; outcrop study; fluvial; reservoir geology; sequence stratigraphy; grain size analysis; stacking pattern","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Applied Geology","","42.157218, -0.349335"

(mentor); Oosterlee, C.W. (mentor)","2014","Two popular products on the interest rate market are Constant Maturity Swap (CMS) derivatives and CMS spread derivatives. This thesis focusses on the efficient pricing of CMS and CMS spread derivatives, in particular the pricing of CMS and CMS spread options. The notional values for these products are usually quite large, so even small errors when pricing these products can lead to substantial losses. Therefore, the pricing of these products has to be accurate. It is possible to use sophisticated models (e.g. Libor Market Model) to price these products, however the downside is that these models generally have high computational costs; they are not very efficient. To efficiently price CMS options the Terminal Swap Rate (TSR) approach can be used. From this approach TSR models are obtained, we will consider four different TSR models. Two of these TSR models are established in the literature, the other two TSR models are developed in this thesis. The main advantages of a TSR model is that the computational costs are low and that it has good numerical tractability. To price CMS spread options the copula approach is usually used. With the copula approach a pricing formula can be obtained for efficient valuations of CMS spread options. The copula that is considered in this thesis is the Gaussian copula. The TSR models are also a key component in the copula approach, because the marginal distributions are obtained with the help of a TSR model. Furthermore, an alternative approach is considered for the pricing of CMS spread options. The CMS spread options are priced with a relatively simple stochastic volatility model, the displaced diffusion SABR model. The displaced diffusion SABR model is obtained by applying the Markovian projection method to a modification of a two-dimensional version of the well-established SABR model. The calibration of the two-dimensional SABR model is performed with the help of the TSR approach.","CMS option; CMS spread option; TSR approach; copula approach; markovian projection; 2D SABR model; DD SABR model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied mathematics","","","",""

(mentor)","2014","This thesis will function as a graduation project of two departments of the Delft University of technology: Science Communication and Industrial Design Engineering. It is funded and supervised by TNO. Problem description Globally, more than one third of child deaths are attributable to malnutrition. Because malnourished children have a low resistance to infection they are more likely to die from common childhood ailments like diarrhoea and respiratory infections. “Frequent illness saps the nutritional status of those who survive, locking them into a vicious cycle of recurring sickness and faltering growth” (UNICEF, 2013). Malnutrition at a young age also leads to a decreased cognitive development. Because of these factors, malnutrition greatly impedes countries’ socio-economic development and the potential to reduce poverty. Indonesia has the fifth highest number of stunted children in the world—more than 7.8 million children. The number of wasted children is almost 3 million. (UNICEF, 2011). The cyanobacteria Arthrospira Platensis, better known as ‘Spirulina’ is one of the most nutritional and fastest growing organism on earth. With just a teaspoon of this supplement per day, children and pregnant women in developing countries like Indonesia can drastically reduce dietary deficiencies and malnourishment. For these reasons, the initial goal of this thesis is to develop of a product that allows local production of the cyanobacteria “Spirulina” in Indonesia. To be able to develop this product, information about the context of use needs to be gathered. It is difficult to get inspired, learn how Indonesian people think and behave, learn about what make products work, what does not and why that is, from a distance. Therefore, in order to design a product for the Indonesian market, data about this target group needs to be mined locally. However, when gathering this data in an inter-cultural context, the chance for communicational problems caused by cultural differences is high. Therefore, there is a need for a design methodology that integrates tailored, inter-cultural communication guidelines within the design process. Since no such thing exists, it needs to be created during this project as well. Solutions This rapport describes a product concept [PART III] that allows uneducated Indonesian fishermen to cultivate Spirulina in an economical, scalable and ecological manner. This is done by making use of the natural thermo-buffering and kinetic properties of the sea, the abundance of sunlight in Indonesia and by the creation of a modular solution. This allows for a portion of the Spirulina to be harvested every morning and consumed fresh to provide a maximal nutritional content at a minimal cost of resources. The socio-economical system that is presented advocates the plausibility of the concepts and illustrates how it could be integrated into local society. The design methodology that is proposed within this report [PART II] not only provided me with the required structure to be able to develop this product concept, it can also prove to be a very valuable tool for other designers that have to function in similar contexts. By linking guidelines to an existing framework of dimensions that describe culture objectively, future designers can adapt the methodology to the context of their project.","microorganisms; malnutrition; Indonesia; spirulina; micro-algae; micro algae; microalgae; BoP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","IDP","","","","-6.952820, 110.306231"

The project focuses on the design of a blade for low wind speed wind turbine applications, on sites with a mean wind speed of about 7 m/s. The project includes several stages. First an introduction to the blade design and blade optimisation methods are introduced. Afterwards, the provided site in China is assessed and key parameters are selected for the next project stages. The next step, involves the wind turbine design, provided by Ming Yang Wind Power. This one is reviewed by doing an aerodynamic and aero-elastic performance analysis. With a cost of energy approach, a new wind turbine blade, for a wind turbine with a rated power of 2MW, is designed. Finally, an aerodynamic and aero-elastic performance analysis of the new blade, under different wind conditions, is performed to assess its feasibility. The framework is carried out with HAWC2, developed by DTU, and compared to GH Bladed, at some of the design stages.","aeroelastic; aerodynamic; china; optimization; design; low wind; blade; windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","DUWIND","","European Wind Energy","",""

(mentor); Van Keulen, A. (mentor)","2014","The use of composite materials is of increasing importance over the past years. Especially unidirectional fibrous laminates are nowadays widely applied in industry. They provide mechanical advantages in terms of stiffness to weight ratios, strength and resistance against fatigue. These properties make them suitable for high-end applications as for example the aerospace industry. Topology optimization is a mathematical technique which has recently gained importance as well. As an optimization technique with a large design freedom, it is able to design complex structures with high performance beyond human abilities. Together with the latest improvements on manufacturing techniques, the application of topology optimized structures intensifies in various fields. This research focuses on topology optimization on unidirectional fibrous laminate structures. The problem of combined topology and fiber direction optimization is researched over the past years by a number of groups. The problem formulation where the fiber angles are directly used as design variables is highly non-convex and is likely destined to end up in a local optimum far from the global optimum. Two other alternatives are described in literature: a discrete and continuous problem formulation. In the discrete approach, called Discrete Material Optimization (DMO), a finite number of candidate materials per element represents the different fiber orientations and penalization is applied to end up with a clear distinction between the candidate materials. The discrete formulation has the drawback that the solution is limited to the predefined candidate materials and that the number of design variables easily becomes large. Furthermore, the global optimum could never be guaranteed due to the required penalization. The continuous approach uses lamination parameters as design variables and the optimization problem becomes convex. A shortest-distance approach is used to determine the closest realistic laminate configuration for the global optimal set of lamination parameters. Using this technique, continuous variable stiffness panels can be designed with a reasonable amount of design variables. However, the realistic laminate configuration to a set of lamination parameters is not known analytically for more complex problems. Therefore, the determination of a physically meaningful configuration may be a difficult task, and may go with a loss of performance. Given both the pro's and con's of the methods from literature, there seems to be a demand for a method that can provide detailed results (continuous variable stiffness), with a reasonable amount of design variables, which also directly provides a physically realistic laminate configuration. In this research a new method called the Adaptive Angle Set Method (AASM) is proposed. AASM solves a sequence of DMO-like subproblems for fiber angle optimization, but the associated design variables are not penalized. A separate set of density variables performs the topology optimization and the combined problem is solved simultaneously. Every subproblem in AASM is analogue to a non-penalized DMO problem with three candidate materials for every element, representing a set of three different fiber angfiles. In the initial subproblem, the angle set is equal for all elements and given by 60° 0° 60°, spanning the entire domain of 180° of possible fiber angles. This subproblem is solved to optimality and the subsolution is used to formulate the succeeding subproblem. Based on the subsolution of design variables, a combination of update functions estimates a new fiber angle for every element, which is defined as the middle angle of the element's new angle set. The two other angles are valued from this middle angle plus and minus a certain offset (range) and the new subproblem is again solved to optimality. However, the range between the three candidate materials is tightened with the formulation of every new subproblem, such that the sequence of problems converges to angle sets where the three candidate materials are close to each other. This can be as close as 1° difference in the final subproblem. At the final stage, penalization is applied to create a clear distinct solution between the candidate materials, but this only causes a minimal loss of performance due to the small range in the angle set. Using this approach, the number of design variables is constant for every subproblem, namely three fiber angle design variables and one density variable per element. In the final stage, a high angle resolution is obtained with a directly known laminate configuration. The way in which a new subproblem is formulated highly depends on the estimation of the new angle for every element. The determination of the optimal new angle using an optimization routine would be equal to solving the overall fiber angle problem, which can not be solved efficiently with a gradient based optimizer. Therefore, two heuristic update functions are introduced to estimate the new angle. The first update function makes a linear combination of the previous angle set with the corresponding optimal design vector. The second update function sets the new angle equal to the largest principal stress direction for that element. A number of test cases showed that a mixed application of both update functions yielded the best results. The final configuration was tested on a number of compliance minimization problems, which were kept planar and single loaded during this research. For small problems, the AASM results could be compared to brute force global optima of the underlying fiber angle integer problem. Results equal or close to the global optimum were obtained. For larger problems and multiple layer laminates, AASM provided promising results as well, which were obtained faster than a comparable DMO-formulation. The promising results obtained by AASM makes the method worthwhile for further investigation on larger and more complex problems, including other objective functions, bending elements and manufacturing constrained problems.","topology; optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-11-12","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

They have been proposed as an alternative for fossil fuels, a superfood for consumers, a potential CO2 absorber to reduce green house gas emission, feedstock for nutritional and chemical industry, a waste water treatment technique and more. However, the large scale implementation of algae in industry has not yet been realized. There is a bridge to be built between the biological work and the scale up to industrial size. In the scientific community there are a lot different approaches and visions for predicting algae growth. No common accepted engineering approach exists. The models found in literature vary from models which only account for illumination to models which account for more then 20 parameters. An effective model is required to close the gap between fundamental research and the scale up to industrial size. A modelling approach is chosen which divides the photobioreactor into zones of constant light intensity and predicts algae growth by the light intensity in that specific zone. First a basic model with only light as major dependent variable is built to get an understanding about the dynamics in a photobioreactor. This model is extended for nutrient limitations. A submodel is added to simulate the uptake and loss of CO2 by the algae and the medium. The model is made with Mathworks Matlab. The model has been validated using data from literature for 3 different photobioreactors with different types of algae. These photobioreactors are: a LED illuminated 0.8 m3 raceway pond using Chlorella sp., a sun illuminated 0.53 m3 circular pond using Nannochloropsis Salina and a sun illuminated 11.9 m3 raceway pond using Nannochloropsis Salina. A 1 litre photobioreactor has been constructed to validate the model with experiments, for this the algae specific parameters of the used algae are required. To determine these parameters a test arrangement is constructed. Experiments with the test arrangement and the photobioreactor have not yet been performed. Performing qualitative and founded tests require time and effort. This is for future work.","Algae; Algae growth; Photobioreactor; Light distribution; Chlorella; Nannchloropsis salina; effective process model; Micro algae; Scale up","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","Sustainable process and energy technology","",""

(mentor); Fisher, Q. (mentor); Harings, M. (mentor)","2014","During the last decade shale formations have been successfully explored in the United States and both oil and gas is currently produced from them. This successful development led to a global interest in shale formations. To assess the worldwide shale oil and gas potential, the Energy International Agency (EIA) investigated the shale formations of 43 different countries outside the U.S.. In this, the Netherlands are evaluated to contain 2.7 billion barrels (Bbbl) of Technically Recoverable oil Resources (TRR) in the Epen, Geverik and Posidonia formations. Based upon previous research, Energie Beheer Nederland (EBN) has identified shale formations as possible oil and gas plays. This study investigates the shale oil potential of the onshore Posidionia formation in the Netherlands and evaluates the assessment of the EIA report. Fourteen Posidonia samples from 7 wells were subjected to a number of measurements on both core plugs and chips. The samples experimental methods included TGA, NMR, SEM, GRI and steady-state flow to analyze the pore size and shape of the rock matrix, the Total Organic Carbon, the maturity, the porosity, the permeability, the pore content, the fluid storage and the flow mechanism of the samples. When combined these parameters can give a prediction of the shale oil potential of a rock. In addition, the samples were tested under three different sample conditions: drier, wetter or “as-received”. This was done because the in-situ conditions, dry, wet, of the samples may affect the measurement but are not known. The Posidionia formation is known to have generated oil and on the Van Krevelen diagram, based on maturity and TOC, samples are located in the oil generating region of the plot. From the TGA and NMR experiments it was proven that oil is present in the shale samples, although this is identified as bound or trapped oil. Based on evaluations with NMR and GRI it was found that the sample material was dried out during storage and that the samples are likely to contain movable hydrocarbons. The SEM and NMR data suggested that some samples contain pore sizes large enough to allow oil to flow through the rocks. The sample condition is shown to be a crucial parameter for the determination of porosity and permeability. Different conditions resulted in porosity differences of up to a factor of three, for the measured sample porosity. The GRI experiment has proven the molecular sieving effect, meaning that permeability decreases if a gas is used with a larger molecule size. The results were combined to assess the heterogeneity of the formation. based on the large spread of petrophysical properties of the samples it was found that the Posidonia shale is highly heterogeneous. Therefore it is concluded that a statement regarding the technically recoverable resources cannot be made at this stage. It is recommended to evaluate fresher sample material with the same methodology as used in this study.","Shale oil; Posidonia; EIA Report Evaluation; Potential of shale oil; Experiments","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-09-26","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

A continuous effort is made to make these sensors smaller, better and cheaper. This allowed for new applications that caused the market to grow exponentially in recent years. Pressure sensors have recently found implementation in the mobile sensor market, however they require lots of fabrication steps making them relatively expensive. Due to its exceptional properties, graphene can be used as both an electrical and mechanical element reducing the amount of fabrication steps needed to build a pressure sensor. Using this principle, concepts for an absolute (atmospheric) pressure sensor and pressure difference (gage) sensor were developed. Novel analytical solutions were developed and compared to existingmeasurements of similar devices or to numerical simulations. It is found that these devices will not only be smaller and cheaper, but also have a larger bandwidth and less sensitivity to mechanical disturbances. The thermal noise of these devices is orders of magnitude lower than similar silicon based devices, therefore it is expected that graphene based sensors will meet the demands on accuracy, resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of current high-precision pressure sensors. It is concluded that graphene based resonant pressure sensors have the potential to meet the future mobile market demands.","graphene; resonant pressure transduction; atomically thin materials","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-11-07","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

This study is potentially relevant for the Port Authorities of Rotterdam and Antwerp, for organisations inspired by Industrial Ecological solutions and for organisations in general that aim for effectiveness improvement. The Port of Rotterdam and Port of Antwerp are international seaports that are crucial for world economy; however both have a high potential for environmental impact. Over the recent years, the awareness about this impact and the number of related initiatives have been increasing within the Port Authorities. Meanwhile, dynamics of international trade drove the Port Authorities to expand their port capacity via respectively the Maasvlakte 2 and Deurganckdok. However, they experienced unfavourable but inescapable resistances, such as rejection(s) by the Council of State. Internal organisational changes took place within the Port Authorities to anticipate on the high level of project complexity and to further execute the project strategies. Specific focus was on environmental impact and stakeholder involvement. Better understanding about organisational characteristics might contribute to improvement of such anticipation in case of further port development and to the yielding of successes from internal organisational strengths. This research provides a methodological framework to identify these organisational characteristics (via typification of the organisational structure and -culture) and subsequently investigate the long-term effect of a large-scale development project on the organisational effectiveness (via analysing the change in organisational characteristics and in working approach, and the relation between them). This framework is conceived from a range of acknowledged methods, which are selected from a literature study performed within a prior determined scope. It is applied to the Port of Rotterdam and Port of Antwerp Authorities regarding respectively the Maasvlakte 2 and Deurganckdok project. Results show that the Maasvlakte 2 project had significant long-term effect in organisational structure, no apparent long-term effect in organisational culture and significant long-term effect in working approach. The Deurganckdok project had significant long-term effect in organisational structure, apparent long-term effect in organisational culture and clearly visible long-term effect in working approach. Recommendations with respect to performed research include improvement of the organisational typifications representativeness and further integration of the different framework elements. Those with respect to further research include the performance of further empirical testing of the framework usability, the integration of external factors able to influence organisational effectiveness and the investigation of framework potential as a tool along strategy development.","organisational structure; organisational culture; port authorities; Maasvlakte 2; Deurganckdok; organisational effectiveness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy and Industry","","Industrial Ecology","",""

(mentor)","2014","The Dutch Wadden Sea is consisting of 7 tidal inlet systems separated by sandy barrier islands. The general morphodynamics and hydrodynamics of tidal inlets are relatively well understood, but the detailed interactions remain a prominent research interest. In this study, process-based computer models are employed as a tool to investigate the medium term mechanisms of the Ameland Inlet. Ameland is selected as this inlet is fairly undisturbed from human intervention and the relative large morphodynamic changes are well-documented. The aim of this study is to improve existing Delft3D models of Ameland Inlet. The model used is based on Fockert (2008) and uses a ‘Mormerge’ approach to derive morphodynamic predictions over a 12 year time frame. The model-data comparison focusses on two key aspects. Firstly, channel stability is analyzed based on the measured bathymetry datasets from 1926 to 2011. This analysis shows that the morphodynamic changes over the last 22 years (1989-2011) are representative for the present-day developments. Over this time-frame, the main channel is relatively stable and experienced a lateral shift up to half channel width (about 500m) and a depth variation in the range of plus and minus 1 m. The volume changes are analyzed over a more recent bathymetry (1999-2011). During this timeframe the basin increased in volume (9.6 Million m3) and the ebb-tidal delta (including coast) lost 29.7 Million m3 of sediment. Through a rigorous sensitivity analysis the effects of the most important morphodynamic parameters: the morphological acceleration factor, bed-slope effects, sediment composition are investigated. The use of spatial varying bed sediment grain size, and the Van Rijn bed-roughness predictor for flow, is essential in controlling the depth (stabilizing) the main inlet channel. An important finding of this study was the effect of the island sediment transports on the inlet development. A sensitivity analysis of the SedTHr, minimum water depth for sediment computations, indicates that erosion of the island tips plays an important role in the formation of secondary inlet channels. Allowing more or less island tip erosion, results in the more or less pronounced formation of a secondary inlet channel. The size of this secondary channel starts to dominate the morphodynamic change of the inlet over longer time frames. The sensitivity of long-term morphodynamic change to the setting of SedThr indicates that the interaction of the adjacent barrier island with the inlet is very important. This interaction is poorly understood and it is recommended to study this in further detail. In addition, improvements in the model are made in the schematization of the model boundary conditions. A new morphological tide has been derived based on the principle of Latteux (1995). Sediment transport through selected (key) transects along the main channel are analyzed. Based on this analysis, seven morphological tides can be selected that show (approximately) equal skill in reproducing the sediment transport based on the full spring-neap cycle. As an additional step, the sediment transport through cross sections between two barriers and correlation factor between the sediment transport of spring-neap tide cycle and morphological tide are evaluated to derive the single, most optimum morphological tide. The final model is able to predict the erosion of the Bornrif (nearshore Ameland island), the sedimentation in the eastern ebb-tidal delta and along the Ameland coastline. But the magnitudes of them are 5 times lower than the measurement. For other areas, the model could not show identical morphological behavior with the measured data. The main problem is the tide overestimate the sediment transport from basin to offshore, lead to the sedimentation of the ebb-tidal delta.","Wadden Sea; Ameland; Delft3D; morphodynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-09-26","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","","53.438110, 5.590101"

One innovation “PeTje”, an outdoor recreational model, was assigned to be the thesis focus with an aim to identify the right customer groups in the Dutch market, and further propose strategic suggestions for positioning, product improvement, and product launch. The project was initiated with a literature review to evaluate the product development process of NoveFlex. It identifies one critical threat that could lead to product failure – scarce external input from both the market and the users. Therefore, the predefined USPs constructed by product-level comparison should be reconsidered again to see what the core benefits that Dutch customers perceive as product superiority are. In the market investigation phase, a few opportunities were identified on which PeTje’s market capability in relatively low attractive environment could rely. The most critical one is that younger generations are the latent and currently neglected potential fuel for the prosperity of the future market. Such insight is subsequently proven in the customer research that PeTje indeed has the inclination to be accepted by younger participants because its product novelty allows them to avoid negative stereotypes. With some similar traits and attitudes toward PeTje elicited from various interviewees, the student concludes three potential customer targets: Excursing urban yuppie, aged urchin, and outcast explorer. However, it is the product newness, its nature (experience good), and together with “tent trailer (vouwwagen)” association that customers cannot easily evaluate PeTje so that some false judgments occurred. Therefore, it is suggested to use a brand-focused attitude to set the future of the business and to be differentiated from those heavily product superiority focused competitors who might have potential to let our potential customers to link the product with. After analyzing how those competitors position the business and referring to the relevant importance resides in the defined target groups’ minds, the brand positioning with the highlight on three core differentiated values are obtained: effortless, dynamic, and exclusive. And the strategy suggests the company to bear in mind that this future brand offers a new outdoor recreational contour- a mobile glamping experience that is effortless and reflective to individual taste. Further, strategic suggestions on marketing mix are proposed. The product is suggested with points to improve which were obtained as concerns in the customer research. The price is suggested to remain as the same expected retail price to reinforce the exclusiveness and quality associations. A strategic distribution roadmap is proposed for the brand to grow step by step. Eventually, a product promotional plan in the year of product launch is conceptualized.","marketing strategy; product commercialization; branding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

The implementation of a haptic interface is a way to provide them with more information about obstacles in the environment in order to compensate for this. Research focused on systems that actively help the teleoperator to avoid collision at a last stage. The haptic interface as described in this paper guides the teleoperator in a more passive way, making him aware of unsafe trajectories in an earlier stage instead of actively trying to avoid collision. This new haptic interface changes the stiffness of the control device based on environmental constraints, leading to a changing non-linear force-displacement relationship for the control device. In order to explore the performance of this haptic interface, off-line simulations and a human-in-theloop experiment have been performed. The results of the off-line simulations showed the potential to prevent collisions at an early stage. However, the results of the human-in-the-loop experiment do not show the expected improvements for the haptic interface, no significant differences can be identified. The cause of this is hypothesized to be both due to a low task difficulty level and the boundaries of the feedback not corresponding to the physical dimensions of the UAV.

(mentor)","2014","Background Interferometers and capacitance sensors were used to measure the motion of the 6-DoF ferrofluid planar bearing positioning stage designed by Max Cafe who was the master student graduated in 2014. The sensor costs almost 30,000 euro to achieve nanometer scale accuracy. However, in some biology applications, such as observation of normal cells, the tens of micrometer scale accuracy and repeatability is good enough. That's why investigate a cost effective concept to measure the stage motion is needed. Objectives The first aim of this project is to design a 6D measurement concept. The second aim is using a normal microscope (3D) to demonstrate the performance of this measurement concept, finding back the interested cells under the microscope. The third goal is to prove the whole system can achieve 10 film repeatability, within 1000 euro. Methods After researching the position sensitive detector, the measurement concept is developed from 2D to 6D. The measurement system consists of LEDs, a pinhole, a 2D-PSD, the Arduino Uno or Due, National Instruments data acquisition box (NI) and a laptop. A test setup was built to show the 4D measurement concept. Finally, the sensor system including the electronics was built and validated on a microscope. Results and conclusions The result shows that based on theory (algorithm) the 6D motion measurement can be achieved in the future. Two microscope setups were built in the demonstration. The setup using NI proves the system can achieve 2 µm repeatability and 10 ~ 20 µm accuracy within 1800 euro cost and the setup using Arduino Due proves the measurement system can achieve 15 µm repeatability and 10 ~ 20 µm accuracy within 900 euro cost. In addition, the graphic user interface helps the users to find back the cells effectively.","6-DoF; position measurement; position sensitive detector; microscopy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-09-18","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Romero Herrera, N.A. (mentor)","2014","Healthcare systems in the Western world are facing a serious challenge. They have to keep improving therapy outcomes and, simultaneously, keep decreasing costs. These objectives cannot be achieved without engaging patients more in their own healthcare. Finding effective ways of engaging patients in their own health practices is the main ambition of the Patient Engagement project within the Healthcare Program of Philips Research. This project focuses on patients with chronic conditions, more specifically on patients that suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and aims to improve their therapy adherence and experienced quality of life. The vision of the project is that the therapy adherence can be improved by tailoring the instructions and feedback of the therapy, based on the patients’ individual motivational drivers and communication preferences. To enable a large scale tailored therapy Philips has identified five types of patients, and has described, among other things, principles for effective communication for each of the identified types. The resulting method, called BIG (Behavioural Influence Gear), became the main philosophy of the Patient Engagement project of Philips. In this thesis, the interaction principles towards the different profiles, identified by the Behavioural Influence Gear, are explored. In order to design the interaction for the different profiles identified by Philips, the aesthetics of interaction by Lenz, Diefenbach & Hassenzahl (2013) were used. These interaction aesthetics describe eleven dimensions on which an interaction could differ. In addition, Philips’ qualitative research indicates that patients could be more effectively motivated to adhere to their therapy if they would reflect on their emotional, mental, and physical condition on a regular basis, and if they would be able to recall changes in their condition over time. The challenge is, therefore, to find a way to stimulate the patients to reflect on a regular basis on their mental and physical condition (mood, emotion, well-being). The objective is to enable patients to capture these reflections in an intuitive way and to let them monitor and understand their progress over time. A literature study was conducted that looked at different products and theories about products that use reflection. This resulted into a model, used during the course of this project, that describes the project scope and the design scope of the project. The main phases of the design scope are collection, integration, reflection & action. This model was adjusted as the three different user researches contributed to this model. Related to reflection, Bloom’s taxonomy was implemented actively in the final product of this project.","aesthetics of interaction; patient profiles; reflection; interface; COPD","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

The general mission parameters are described and the critical requirements are flowed down to the Attitude Control System and subsequently the star tracker. Various influences on star tracker performance and availability are described, and different subsystems are analyzed in terms of system performance: optics, baffle, image sensor and on-board software. In addition, the verification process was present from the very beginning, including a verification plan and the calibration and validation activities to be performed on ground in the lab and during the commissioning phase. It is shown that a single aperture star tracker is well suited for a very limited set of operating conditions, namely a strictly nadir-pointing earth observation mission, however the flexibility and robustness of the multiple-aperture star tracker is generally required for missions with realistic operational requirements.","star tracker; verification; space systems engineering; CMOS sensor; centroiding; star detection; star sensor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-09-25","Aerospace Engineering","Space Systems Engineering","","","",""

The quality of the compressed signal is configurable, and the accuracy of the signal is maintained given a signal quality requirement. The algorithm is implemented in a software/hardware solution.

Using a fire curve which closely resembles a natural fire curve the temperatures occurring in the steel have been investigated using a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model. The model consists of the compartment which has been discussed in chapter three. As can be seen in chapter four the model which has been introduced in the CFD software closely mimics the actual compartment, including windows, roof openings and a large overhead door in the wall. After the model had been entered the fire curve must be given as well. The fire curve which has been used is based on a pool fire with a three meter diameter and a height of 2.5cm. Using the mass burning rate and rate of heat release the maximum power emitted by the liquid can be calculated. After having run the CFD calculation which took about four days per scenario the results of the temperatures in the steel had been formulated. Having used a CFD calculation the results of this calculation were to be checked by a reference tool. Arcelor Mittal has created a software package called Ozone. Having entered the same compartment and fire curve as had been done in the CFD simulation the results can be compared to each other. The results and the comparison of the two simulations have been evaluated in chapter 6.4. Focussing on the load bearing capacity of the column chapter seven investigates the maximum stress which the cross section can endure in a fire situation. Please note that this chapter only checks the strength of the column at raised temperature and omits any phenomena of instability. As the temperatures have been calculated by CFD and are thus known we can distinguish two cases. The first case is the temperature profile in the cross section of the column at which the highest temperature appears. Secondly the case in which the highest temperature difference occurs in the cross section. Having formulated a series of excel sheets an upperbound solution for the critical elastic buckling load can be calculated for columns with thermal gradients.","gradient; fire safety engineering; buckling; fire; steel; hydrocarbon; pool fire","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Steel and Timber Construction","",""

(mentor); Rudinac, M. (mentor); Chandarr, A. (mentor)","2014","The emerging of mobile robots in everyday life scenarios, such as in the case of domestic care robots, is highly anticipated. Much research has been carried out to make robots more capable of performing tasks in our everyday environments. Despite major progress over the last decades, many hurdles are still to be taken. In the field of robotic mapping, which studies how robots can generate a map (internal representation) of their environment, modern Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods allow robots to map their environment and be aware of where they are in that environment. Such maps can then be used for robot navigation, which allows a robot to travel from one place to another safely and autonomously. State of the art SLAM methods still show large limitations in their real world applicability. First and foremost, they are limited in the size of environment they can handle as maps grow inconsistent when environments get too large, or they cannot handle multi-story buildings for example because they are designed to only map in 2D. Performance even becomes significantly worse if one limits oneself to using affordable sensors. Secondly, modern SLAM algorithms still struggle with the tasks of building a map that is metrically consistent with the real world (that is, the map and a ground truth floor plan should align). Thirdly, the generated maps show obstacles (like walls), but do not give any other semantic details on them. For example, the map does not tell what places are rooms and what places are a corridor. In this thesis, it is investigated how robotic mapping and robot navigation could benefit from a human inspired approach to these tasks. Humans do not create floor plans, but remember their environments in terms of concepts. These concepts are then linked in a relative way, and places are connected by fuzzy, relative defined connections. The relatively new study of semantic mapping aims at integrating these concepts (semantics) into robotic mapping. However, so far these systems have been built on top of a traditional SLAM method. Parallel to this new development of semantic mapping, this thesis proposes an architecture, which we named LEMTOMap (Large Environment Metric TOpological Mapping system), that generates and handles maps in a relative way. It specifies mapping, localization and navigation in a way in which metric consistency of the map is no longer a requirement on a larger scale (e.g. that of a faculty building or larger). The main contributions of this thesis are captured by the LEMTOMap architecture. LEMTOMap introduces a new topological mapping paradigm that allows the robot to generate a map that is metrically consistent on a local scale, but does not require metric consistency on a larger scale. This way, the main challenge of modern SLAM - limiting metric inconsistency - is reduced to a challenge of subordinate importance. Additionally, a new grid map SLAM algorithm is introduced, named Rolling Window GMapping (RW-GMapping). To verify the expected performance enhancements of the LEMTOMap system architecture, LEMTOMap has been partially implemented and tested in simulated experiments. The experiments confirm the main benefits of LEMTOMap, mostly in terms of improved overall time and space complexity. The thesis concludes with a range of advices for future work. Part is aimed at the further implementation of LEMTOMap, and part at improving LEMTOMap beyond its current specification. Also, a performance issue of the original GMapping algorithm was detected and suggestions are made on how this should be improved.","SLAM; robotics; navigation; mapping; localization; artificial intelligence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","DCSC","","Systems & Control","",""

(mentor)","2014","Orifice plates are key components used for flow measurement and control in several industries. For instance, they find applications in gas and liquid circuits of lithography machines, nuclear power plants and aerospace propulsion systems. They are used typically either for measuring flow-rate or to introduce a pressure drop for purposes of flow balancing. The present study focuses on the latter application. It is widely acknowledged in literature, that the turbulent, unsteady nature of the flow issuing through an orifice can also be a source of structural vibration. In order to understand the nature of the vibration source, the present experimental investigations analyze the time-varying flow field by means of unsteady wall-pressure measurements and time resolved, planar, particle-image-velocimetry (PIV). In addition to understanding the dynamics of the flow through a single-hole orifice, this study has assessed the possibility of using multiple-hole orifices as an alternative. It is observed that the overall magnitude and extent of the disturbance levels in the flow are reduced with the multiple-hole orifices, while maintaining similar levels of pressure drop. It is hypothesized that these lower disturbances are a result of the small-scale flow structures associated with the multiple-hole orifice flow (multiple jets as opposed to one). The measurements give detailed insights into the flow behavior downstream of orifice plates. Results indicate a low frequency flapping motion of the single-hole orifice jet, which is sustained by the surrounding large recirculation regions. For the geometries of the sharp-edged single-hole orifices investigated, the flapping frequency was observed to increase with flow speed and is found to occur at a Strouhal number = 0.02 based on the orifice jet velocity and the difference in internal diameters of the pipe and orifice.","single hole orifice; multiple hole orifice; particle image velocimetry; flow induced vibrations; proper orthogonal decomposition; pressure drop; pressure fluctuations","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics","","","",""

(mentor); Schweckendiek, T. (mentor); Huber, M. (mentor); Arnold, P. (mentor)","2014","The traditional Dutch way to deal with piping for river levees is the implementation of piping berms. The disadvantage of such a measure is the inland space required, especially in urban areas. Relief wells, on the other hand, require less or no inland space and therefore represent an attractive solution as mitigation measure against piping. The aims of this research are first, to show how reliability analysis of relief wells systems can be carried out, and second to examine the costs required to achieve a reliability target for piping failure, as set in the Netherlands. The outcomes of this analysis will help comparing relief wells with piping berms in economic terms. To obtain these results, the statistical parameters of the influencing variables are studied using both, the collected data from existing projects in the Netherlands, and data from relevant literature. A reliability-based design approach is followed to estimate the reliability of relief wells systems. In order to establish the limit state functions, the assessment methods recommended by the Dutch flood defence regulations are used. Applying the probabilistic axioms it is possible to resemble piping failure as a parallel system assessing uplift and heave failure mechanisms. To estimate the hydraulic head in relief wells system, the United States Corps of Engineers method is applied, as well as the latest developments in flood risk analysis, achieved by the VNK project, which are used to determine the reliability target. To estimate the probability of failure and the system reliability, MCS and FORM methods are utilized. A tailor-made comprehensive tool is built in Matlab to compute the hydraulic head in relief wells system and to perform the probabilistic analysis. Subsequently, a LLC analysis is performed with the aim to account for the life cycle of relief wells. A comparison of the net present value of the two alternatives (relief wells and piping berms) is made. Finally, analysis of two case studies with different scenarios are performed to show the possible economic advantages of installing relief wells and sensitivity analysis is used to underpin the robustness of the conclusions. The results show that, using USACE method, the blanket and the aquifer permeability, as well as the hydraulic losses, are the dominant variables (from the 'load' side). The sensitivity factors show high discrepancy between partially and fully penetrated wells. Even when the entrance losses cannot be accurately predicted, a total clogging scenario of the filter can be neglected. One main limitation for the applicability of relief wells system, is that there is a maximum achievable head reduction. This maximum head reduction is limited to the minimum possible well spacing (a>D/4). Results from the case studies show that relief wells are a cost-effective as piping mitigation measure, outperforming piping berms. This advantage can be up to a factor of ten regarding initial investment. This allows accounting for a shorter life cycle for relief wells in order to equate the same LCC as piping berms.","reliability; piping berms; piping; probabilistic design; relief wells; life cycle cost","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risk","",""

(mentor); Tempelman, E. (mentor)","2014","About 40 per cent of the western population suffers from snoring which impacts the sleep quality and is associated with significant morbidity of other disease. In fact, more than 65% of snorer show the correlation with sleep position, mostly the supine position. For these position dependent snorers, positional therapy during the sleep has been proved to be effective. The sleep position trainer (SPT),which trains snorer’s sleep behavior to avoid the supine position by wearing the device around the chest just above the upper abdomen during sleep, has been developed by the medical technical company Night Balance. With the ambition of helping 500,000 people by 2020, the product requires innovation on many different levels including, it is expected, on new materials. Therefore, the company cooperates with the LTM project to develop a new generation of SPT that involves novel smart materials and new technology. The LTM project is an EU-funded project which aims to develop a completely new generation of smart materials that combine touch sensitivity with luminosity. The materials that the project is based on are polymeric composites and flexible OLEDs. This graduation project was a research and design exploration with the scope of smart materials and the future context. A unique method is used in this project. Two streams, the design stream and the material stream go in parallel and emerge in the final stages of the project. The design stream mainly addresses the question of who is the target user of the new SPT and what is the future vision of the new SPT. By a look at patient information, related product, literature resources, and interviews with physicians, people who snore were defined as a promising target group for further investigation. Through self-reflection diaries, observations and interviews, snorers’ sleep routines, concerns and needs were collected and analyzed, from which it was found that snorers do need a product that can help them solve their snoring problem. This product should be able to offer reliable treatment for snoring, have an attractive appearance with an energetic and healthy feeling and be a comfortable product where people feel pleasant and relaxed in using it. In addition, it was also found that sleep quality is not only determined by how people sleep, but also other phases around sleep, like bedtime routines, people’s state of mind before sleep and how people wake up in the morning, which would be an interesting field for the new SPT. The material stream is mainly focused on analyzing the usability and user experience problem with the current SPT and the search for suitable smart materials for the new product interface. By analyzing the subjective usability report from the company and literature resources on smart materials, the LTM materials were finally chosen for improving the product to make its interface more easy and understandable. The design goal was formulated based on the research results from both design stream and material stream. The Sleep Position Trainer was to be a tool that guides snorers in taking care of their whole sleep experience in a relaxing and intimate way. Through a meaningful form of interaction with the LTM material, people would experience the new SPT as being more pleasant, easy and intuitive to use. After a long and comprehensive conceptualization process, a concept was created and chosen for further development. The concept provides a complete sleep care service, except for its positional therapy during sleep. It also offers a personalized bedtime reminder, deep breathing practices for relaxation before sleep and a pleasant wake up alarm. In addition, a new form of interaction was formulated for each stage of use. Through two design iterations of demonstrating-building-testing cycles, different aspects of the concept, i.e. the light pattern for bedtime reminder, the interactions for the guiding before sleep and waking up in the morning, were tried out, evaluated and improved, leading to the final design decision “SLEEP.CARE”. “SLEEP.CARE” is a novel healthcare product for snorers. It not only mitigates user’s snoring problem, but also offers a whole set of sleep care services to improve their sleep quality. It consists of two parts: stimulation and detection. The stimulation part is a very small device that users can wear on their wrist like a bracelet. The detection part is a patch worn on the user’s torso for transmitting the sleep position signal to the bracelet. The user mainly interacts with the new SPT though the bracelet. A novel and smart interaction has been developed especially for the wristband based on the smart materials from the LTM project. The user would experience an easier and more pleasant to interaction with the new SPT with its holistic product interface. No physical button is on the new SPT as the whole product is sensible and users can interact with the product by easy and understandable hand gestures. In the end, recommendations were given to the LTM Project for further developing the interactions with materials and to the company for developing the next generation SPT.","smart material; smart interaction; sleep; snoring; product interface","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2015-09-24","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2014","The fast growing interest in nano-satellite development and the use of nano-satellite for complex missions has led to an increase in the downlink data-rate. The availability of free bands (amateur frequency bands: VHF and UHF) is getting limited and more challenging to do the frequency coordination. This can be attributed to the surge in number of nano-satellite being launched. There has been 430% increase in the number of satellites launched in 2013 compared to 2012. This trend has led the nano-satellite developers to start looking into higher frequency bands and S-band has been a popular choice. But, going by the trend, frequency coordination in the S-band can also get challenging. Thus, there is a need to develop a nano-satellite transmitter that uses spectrally efficient modulation scheme, at the same time it has to be power efficient and be compatible with some of the existing communication standards. This work deals with developing the requirements on a nano-satellite transmitter based on mission case study, look at the need for efficiency and linearity enhancement technique for the transmitter, select the most appropriate architecture for nano-satellite application and show a proof of concept using a prototype. Using system engineering approach the efficiency and linearity enhancement technique that was chosen was LINC architecture. ADS simulations were performed to understand different configurations of LINC and finally, measurements were performed on the chosen configuration to characterize its efficiency and linearity. 16-QAM, 16-APSK, 32-QAM, 32-APSK and 64-QAM modulation schemes were implemented and tested. The best EVM was obtained for 16-APSK with 20 degrees compensation stub in the Chireix combiner which was 0.27% and the best efficiency was obtained for 16-APSK modulation scheme which was implemented without any compensation stubs. Based on the lessons learnt during simulations and measurements, recommendations are provided to improve the LINC configuration and improve the reliability of the measurement setup.","nano-satellites; downlinks; high efficiency transmitters; LINC PA architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Electronics","",""

(mentor); Liu, D. (mentor)","2014","The total installed capacity of wind turbines is growing as society moves towards a more sustainable energy supply. With the integration of more wind turbines in the grid the price and reliability of future wind turbines are very important. One of the promising drive train topologies currently investigated is the direct drive superconducting wind turbine. This configuration allows for higher reliability, less top mass and nearly full independence of the volatile market of rare earth metals. However, the superconducting windings in such a generator operate only at cryogenic temperatures which is a challenge in the design of the machine. Since superconducting windings operate at a very low temperature it is important to estimate the heat generation in the windings. AC loss is the main cause of heat generation in a superconducting field winding. This thesis attempts to analyse the AC loss in two 10MW superconducting generator designs using analytical and numerical modeling. After introducing the problem description, the theory concerning AC loss in superconducting wires is treated. Then, the methods for both modeling techniques are established and partly validated. The results are then shown and discussed after which the conclusions are drawn. Both generators are designed for the same turbine and therefore have the same rotational speed and rated power which makes them comparable. The geometry however is different and as the results will show, these differences in design result in major differences in AC loss. Depending on machine geometry the analytically calculated AC loss is ranging from 22.2W to 283W in the Non Magnetic Teeth (NMT) design and 0.7kW to 2.9kW in the Iron Teeth (IT) design. The numerically calculated hysteresis loss is on average 154W in the NMT machine and 371W in the IT machine.","AC loss; Superconductivity; Wind turbine; Generator; Field winding; Modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Power Engineering","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor)","2014","The Microthrust project aims to deliver an efficient and scalable electric propulsion system for very small form factor satellites. For this aim, a thruster chip (THC) is being developed at EPFL, Switzerland, that uses a strong electric field to accelerate charged particles from hollow ‘needles’. The particles are emitted from the propellant, a liquid that consists of positive and negative ions. To propel these charged particles, both an ‘extraction voltage’ is needed that extract the particles from the liquid and an ‘accelerator voltage’ that accelerates and focuses the beam. A small form factor of 80x80x20mm is required for the power and control system (PCS) to generate these voltages and control the THC. The voltage of the accelerator plane is defined as 0V while a voltage is applied to the ‘particle emitter’, so in fact an emitter voltage and an extraction voltage are generated. The emitter voltage, which is typically between 3kV and 4kV, is generated using a Royer circuit combined with a voltage doubler. The Royer circuit generates an AC voltage from 12V DC input through a self-oscillating circuit that is fed in a transformer. A doubler circuit doubles and rectifies this output. To regulate the output voltage, the 12V supply of the Royer circuit is periodically interrupted using a 16kHz PWM signal, which is generated by a microcontroller. The controller continuously monitors the emitter voltage and adjusts the PWM signal accordingly based on PID control software. As efficiency was initially not good, a lot of effort has been spent to improve this circuit which eventually succeeded using a careful component selection Extraction voltage is generated from the emitter voltage by using a controllable resistor divider. This is possible since the extractor plane of the thruster chip should not draw a current. The control of this bypass is a similar, but not identical, to the PID control for the emitter voltage. As the spacecraft needs to remain electrically neutral, both a positive and negative stream of particles needs to be emitted simultaneously. Functionality was therefore split among two boards, one creating two opposite emitter voltages of up to 4kV and the other creating up to four extraction voltages. Communication between boards was done using a serial bus and a state machine as command parser. A graphical user interface on a PC allows user control of the PCS. The PCS is able to produce two opposite emitter voltages and four extractor voltages on two 80x80mm boards with an efficiency of >50% above 1W. The accuracy requirement (1%) and ripple regarding the emitter voltage has been met, but that of the extraction voltage (0.1%) not fully. We were able to successfully generate thrust using our PCS and the microthrust thruster chip.","embedded; royer; power supply; microthrust","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","Computer Engineering","",""

RF coils used at ultra-high ?elds are adapted from lower ?eld strengths but their performance is suboptimal. These coils are designed as near-?eld antennas; however, better signal penetration can be obtained using far-?eld concept, speci?cally in the case of prostate which is located deep in the body. In this project the optimization of an RF coil for prostate imaging at 7T Magnetic Resonance system is investigated. This RF coil was designed following far-?eld-based concept recently proposed by Raaijmakers et al., who has demonstrated that higher transmit B1+ at depth can be obtained; thus increasing the transmit performance necessary to acquire good images. The RF coil consists of a fractionated dipole antenna mounted on an acrylic substrate, and it is used as part of a surface array. The optimization is evaluated in terms of safety (local SAR), transmit performance (B1+), and coupling measurements. A parameters study was performed to improve the performance of the RF coil. Numerical simulations were used to evaluate new designs obtained from the parameters study. From the simulated results, three designs were constructed for validation purposes. Two different measurements were performed to validate the simulations: B1 measurements in the 7 Tesla MR scanner and coupling measurements with a network analyzer; these measurements were performed on a phantom with tissue electrical properties. Finally, an in vivo measurement using two identical sinusoidal-shaped snake antennas (s20) aligned on the pelvis was performed to image a healthy prostate. Both, simulations and measurements in the snake antennas demonstrated that despite the improvement gained in safety with lower levels of SAR, the radiation ?eld penetration pattern is less homogeneous affecting the imaging process. Therefore, these antennas might show more efficiency imaging regions of interest where safety has to be ensured such as the heart, but for prostate imaging the fractionated dipole is preferable.","Magnetic Resonance Imaging; 7T; Prostate Imaging; RF coilsu; ultra-high field MRI","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomedical Engineering","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

A site was located from which to approach this question. The DeltaWorks were created in the Netherlands between 1940-1971, The Haringvliet sluice, designed as a closed sluice, has come under discussion since the in 2000 the Netherlands decided to restore connections between river and sea as part of a European agreement, and partially open the Haringvliet sluice. Because of farmers’ outcry over the saltwater influx, the decision was withdrawn in 2010 and the sluices are now usually closed. Future scenarios are being proposed in the light of sea level rise and ‘room for the river’ projects, and one example shows an island on the outside of the more open sluice. This island was chosen to be designed in this research project. From this scenario comes the design question: How can we use the partial opening of the Haringvliet sluice to 1. fulfill the estuarine ecological landscape potential 2. protect the Dutch coast from excessive saltwater intake and storms and 3. offer landscape architectural qualities for the region - while working with the coastal natural processes?

For this purpose, servicer satellites need to be built. These satellites need to be able to interfere with “dead” satellites and deorbit defunct satellites. In order to be able to navigate around these types of objects, it is necessary for the servicer satellite to be able to determine its position around the object and the relative motion between the debris and the servicer. This thesis describes an algorithm that determines the trajectory of the servicer satellite based on a 3D reconstruction of a model of the target object. It takes 3D point clouds from a sensor and transform these point clouds into a 3D model that can be used by the servicer to navigate and determine its position around the target object. The approach uses a simulation of a LIDAR instrument to obtain the data which is then used as input for the algorithm to reconstruct the path of the servicer satellite. This thesis was done at Airbus Defense and Space as it is currently activley trying to develop the capability to interfere with space objects. The resulting algorithm can perform a 3D reconstruction of a target object in real-time if appropriate parameters are being used and it can also determine the position of the servicer around this model. Moreover, it can also reconstruct the trajectory for the observer around its target.","ICP; global iterative closest P\point; space debris detection; satellite vision; debris removal; Envisat; algorithm; point cloud; LIDAR; iterative closest point","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Space","","Engineering","",""

At the moment several methods are available to detect a fall, these are not accurate enough to be implemented into a robotic device.

Motion Capture is performed to track the posture changes and a sensor system is used to obtain input for the assistive device. It is analyzed that the output of the sensory system is in correspondence with the movements recorded by Motion Capture. Based on the Motion Capture the data is divided into stable and unstable phases. Six methods to design a classifier that is able to distinguish between stable and loss-of-balance are proposed. These methods are all trained and evaluated with the data sets obtained in the experiment. The main measures to evaluate the performance of the algorithms are sensitivity, i.e. detect all instances of loss of balance, and specificity, i.e. no false alarms. Although the sensory information is in correspondence with the actual body movement, the proposed classifiers do all result in sensitivity and specificity rates that are not high enough to implement into an assistive device.

The technique reduces memory access latency by up to 63.4% by avoiding allocation of memory in over-utilized cache banks. Furthermore, Cache Balancer incorporates a runtime task mapper that utilizes information on the execution characteristics of tasks and the structure of the system interconnect in determining a mapping solution that results in optimal memory throughput.

The flexible mould system relies on deformation of the concrete panels at very early age, when the tensile strength of the material has just started to develop and has not reached high values yet. Due to this physical deformation and the forced strains thus created in the material, a crack pattern can be formed on the surface of the element.

(mentor)","2014","The coastal area is a dynamic environment that suffers from human interventions and climate change. This requires extensive research and monitoring of the coastal areas. Measurement systems play a key role in the monitoring. Current velocities are for example often measured to investigate local hydrodynamics. At the moment the ADCP is often used to measure current velocities. The disadvantage of this measurement system is the lack of spatial information. New innovative measurement systems are developed to overcome this disadvantage. The X-Band radar is an example of such a measurement system. The X-Band radar can be used to survey water surfaces resulting in images with wave information. These images can be used to derive current, depth and wave information. The main advantage of the X-Band radar is the spatial extend. The radar images have a range over several kilometres. The aim of this study is to validate X-Band derived current velocities. SeaDarQ is an algorithm that can be used to process the X-Band radar images and derive depth, current and wave information. The technique used in the SeaDarQ algorithm was developed by (Young et al., 1985). A 3D Fourier Transformation is used to gain the wave information from the images. Subsequently the linear dispersion relation, which describes the fixed relation between wavenumber and wave frequency as a function of the depth and the current, is fitted through the obtained wave information to derive the depth and the current. The algorithm is analysed to find the valid depth for the derived currents. The analysis has revealed that the current is fitted using the short waves obtained from the images. The active depth of a wave depends on the ratio between the wave length and water depth. A long wave is active over a larger part of the water column than a short wave. The consequence of using the short waves for the current fit is therefore that the derived for the top part of the water column. A case study is done to validate the current output. A X-Band radar is installed near the Sand Motor, which is a large scale nourishment at the Dutch coast at ter Heijde. The velocity output from point of the SeaDarQ output field is compared with ADCP measurements during different metocean conditions. It can be concluded from the case study that the X-Band derived velocities are indeed valid for the top part of the water column. The measurement period includes calm periods as well as a severe storm. Wind from sea and from land is observed including wind speeds between zero and twenty meter per second. The wave height varied between 28 cm and 5 meters. The data comparison revealed that SeaDarQ is not able to derive current velocities with wind speeds lower than 2 m/s or heavy rain conditions. All other circumstances resulted in accurate velocity output. Also during stratified conditions, resulting from a fresh plume passing by, the SeaDarQ output is accurate. SeaDarQ can cope with the broad variety of conditions due to the current fitting procedure in which only the short waves are included. The short waves are less easily affected by the bottom than long waves due to their small active depth. The short waves follow therefor the linear dispersion relation very well. The same reasoning holds for the stratified conditions. The stratification does not affect the short waves that much due to the small active depth. The short waves follow the linear dispersion relation therefore very well during these conditions. This new measurement system can derive accurate current velocities and can therefor become a powerful measurement system in the future.","X-Band radar; remote sensing; SeaDarQ; Sand Motor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-02-01","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","","52.074711, 4.198401"

The total damage (in the USA and Caribbean) is in excess of 100 billion US$ with estimates ranging between 78 and 97 billion US$ for direct damage and over 10 to 16 billion US$ for indirect damage due to business interruption (M. Kunz et al., 2013). Modelling impact (e.g. damage, fatalities) in the coastal zone due to hazardous storm events is a hardly explored practice. It is difficult to predict damage correctly where damage observations are scarce and the physical processes causing the damage are complex, diverse and can differ from site to site and event to event. Moreover, an increasing interest exists in getting insights in the uncertainty of prediction. This report explores on the possibilities in coupling physics-based hydraulic and morphodynamic modelling to the practice of impact mapping by using Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN’s). Using BBN’s enables to look at the impact in a probabilistic context, which fits well to the highly unpredictable and rare nature of hurricanes. The morphodynamic storm impact model XBeach (Roelvink et al., 2009) is proposed as one of the process-based models, since Hurricane Sandy pointed out that morphodynamic aspects can be of great importance for the amount of damage.

A traffic loading model for short-span bridges is proposed, which is capable of simulating several 15-year periods of traffic. Site-specific weigh-in motion data is included in the model, making it representative of traffic loading conditions in the urban area. The output of the traffic loading model is a load-effect maxima distribution function that can be directly used in the probabilistic reliability analysis as a load variable. Applicability of probabilistic methods according to building regulations is studied. Structural reliability analysis of a steel- and concrete beam is carried out, using the load-effect maxima distribution function that results from the traffic load model. The reliability results are compared to that of an “optimal” beam designed according to the reliability requirements of Eurocode and the Dutch National Annex.","traffic; loading; reliabilty; Monte Carlo","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural and Building Engineering","",""

This project concerns the conception, design and evaluation of a prototype aimed at reducing the influence of room acoustics. The research phase started off with a look at the history of hifi, followed by an analysis of the current market, the typical clientele and their preferences in terms of audio equipment use and loudspeaker aesthetics, to act as a guideline for product development. After this, the physics and theory behind sound reproduction were investigated, especially where the interaction between loudspeaker, acoustic environment and listener is concerned. The most problematic aspects of acoustics were defined and suggestions on how these problems can be mitigated were made. Next, a process of experimentation started, preceding the development of the final prototype. Optimal geometries and configurations for the various parts were sought and converged upon. Finally, all the pieces were combined into a single prototype, which was then evaluated. Conclusions are drawn from the evaluation and some recommendations provided for the next steps on the way from idea to market.","sound; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2014","CMOS scaling over the years has brought great improvements in the computational speed, density and cost of microprocessors. However, scaling is approaching its limits owing to the difficulty in reducing the supply voltage with conventional MOSFETs having at best a subthreshold swing of 60mv/decade. A possible alternative is Tunnel FETs (TFETs) where carrier transport happens through band-to-band tunneling as opposed to thermal injection in MOSFETs. While silicon and III-V semiconductors have been investigated in this context, carbon-based and the large family of transition metal dichalcogenides offer more material flexibility and better electrostatic control. Bilayer Graphene (BLG) has the interesting property that an appreciable band gap can be induced electrostatically. Additionally, its low effective mass (0.05me), direct bandgap and ultra-thin body make it highly suitable for TFETs. Theoretical studies for BLG TFETs have shown promising results, although practical implementation requires several technical hurdles to be overcome. To address some of these, process modules for realization of BLG TFET have been developed in this dissertation. Channel-Length Scaling: To replace conventional Si MOSFETs, graphene and other 2D materials should demonstrate superior behavior in the short-channel devices. Thus, a recipe for fabricating devices with a channel length down to 40nm was developed and demonstrated in the lab. Also, MoS2 devices were fabricated with this recipe and their electrical properties were compared over a range of channel-lengths. Contact-doping on Single-Layer Graphene (SLG): BLG TFET architectures exploiting the effect of charge transfer between metal and graphene to realize abrupt P-i-N structure has been proposed in literature. An experimental study towards quantifying doping by metal on large area SLG was performed with Transfer Length method (TLM). Coupled with the scaling module, CVD graphene was used to obtain a statistical variation of various electrical parameters crucial for realization of logic devices. Also, an evaluation using a model based on Landauer-Buttiker formalism was performed to understand the electrostatic and geometric factors for designing P-N junctions. Further, suggestions regarding extending the results to BLG has been proposed. Gate-Stack on Graphene: Gate-dielectric scaling is very important for enabling overall device scaling. Due to weak Vander Waals’ interaction between graphene layers, growing a reliable oxide on graphene channel has been a challenge. In this work, a low temperature Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) recipe for high k-dielectrics - Aluminum oxide (Al2O3) - over graphene has been developed and investigated through physical and electrical characterization.","graphene; contact doping; Molybdenum Disulfide; gate-stack; short channel effects","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-02-28","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Electronic Components, Technology and Materials Group","",""

Chapter 2 is a literature review describing the physics behind the creation of PDs. The conditions necessary for the occurrence of PDs are covered in addition to an analysis of the different types of PD in GIS ranging from corona, internal, surface and discharges due to electrically floating components for both AC and DC voltage. Chapter 3 presents the equipment available at TUDelft HV laboratory to create the set-up used for applying AC and DC voltages to the test object. The PD monitoring configuration are covered categorizing conventional and unconventional methods. Chapter 4 deals with signal processing of the PD data for classification of PD sources. Some quantities on which the analysis can be based, are discussed. Furthermore a distinction of quantities which are directly measurable by detection systems as direct data and the quantities or derived data derived through combinations or data analysis, will be made. In chapter 5, PD measurements using the conventional method of created defects in the HV laboratory are discussed. The defects are used to simulate insulation defects and the measurements in DC are analysed resulting in recognition graphs used for differentiating between the possible defects. Chapter 6 discusses the results of simultaneous measurements of PDs using the conventional method and RF techniques. The combined PD measurements on multiple defects are used to create plots of RF quantities to apparent charge. These plots are used for quantification of the relationship between the different techniques. Lastly, chapter 7 concludes the study and suggests future research related to the measurement of PDs in HVDC GIS using electrical partial discharge detection.","HVDC; GIS; PD; RF; IEC 60270; Internal Discharges; Surface discharges; Floating components; partial discharge; PD recognition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","DC Systems and Storage Group","",""

(mentor); Ruijgh-van der Ploeg, M.P.M. (mentor); Steenhuisen, B.M. (mentor); Van den Berg, J. (mentor)","2014","In the Netherlands the goal of the government is to increase the amount of electricity produced from wind turbines on land to 6000 MW by 2020. This ambitious goal asks for a different approach for these projects, because with the classic approach the development is too slow and invokes too much resistance in the local community. The largest delays during the development of wind parks are caused by problems during the decision-making process. To increase the speed and keep all involved actors on board the decision-making process can be managed by a process manager. Because this is a very complex task, the process manager might need support during the process. Although different models are made that calculate the business case of a wind park, there is no tool available that sees a wind park project as a process in which all important actors are included. Existing models look at a wind park from the eye of the project developer, such as the business case model of Agentschap NL (Veghel, 2013). In this research we will not be looking at one actor, but we will take a multi-actor approach. Only financial aspects are included in the existing models, while the processes are including much more than only financial aspects. In these decision-making projects the influence of the park on the surroundings, the risk of participation options, and the development of the region are only a few of the issues present. Therefore in addition to the multi-actor character of the tool we will include more aspects to the tool than just the financial aspect. The absence of literature describing the causes of the slow progress in decision-making processes of wind-on-land projects in the Netherlands led to the following research question; How can the problematic aspects during the decision-making process of wind-on-land projects be managed? To answer this question we have to identify the problematic aspects, the requirements of good process management and the products of decision-making. After that we can look to the tool and therefore the following design question was developed; How can a process-support tool help the decision-making process of wind-on-land processes? To answer the research question we reviewed literature, conducted expert interviews and analyzed the cases of Deil, Houten, Dronten en Nijmegen. The Deil case has been extensively analyzed, because we participated in the process of decision-making in multiple rounds. To review the prototype of the tool we interviewed the actors involved in wind park Deil, including the two process managers. This gave us the input for revising and adding aspects of the tool. The Decision-Making Processes The slow progress of this decision-making process is caused by the lack of trust among the actors, the lack of available information of the actors and the different languages the actors speak. The negotiation rounds during this process are taking a lot of time, because, due to the problems mentioned, actors are not able to decide on the complex aspects of the three products of decision-making, namely; the municipal spatial plan, the business cases and the participation plan for civilians. These three products are linked in multiple ways, although these links are not known by all actors. Choices for one product affect the other products and in that way change the project. The tool shows what the effects of these choices on the project are, so the actors can see what their proposals do for the project. The WINST The designing phase of the thesis led to the WINST (Wind In Nederland Support Tool) in Excel based on the Agentschap NL model of (Veghel, 2013). Two additions were done to this model. First, all important actors were included; the project developer, the municipality, the province and the civilians. The existing model calculated the business case for the project developer and partly for the municipality, but neglected the civilians and the province involved. Moreover, the other goals except for the business case were added to the tool. A positive business case is just one of the goals of an actor and, as we wanted to include more than just financial aspects, we included the other goals per actor. This led to additional sheets to the existing model with a multi-criteria table for each actor is shown in which the criteria are the goals of the actor. The weights and scores in this multi-criteria table have to be given by the actors using the input provided partly by the existing model and partly by new input sheets, covering the spatial plan and the participation plan. In the tool the effects of different proposed options are clearly listed per goal, so the actor can assess the option based on the key variables. For the process manager an overview sheet was added, so the tool can easily be presented during the negotiation rounds. Usability of the WINST To test the preliminary assumption that the WINST could help during the decision-making process all actors involved in wind park Deil were interviewed, including the two process managers. These interviewees all stated that the WINST could help in the process by informing the inexperienced actors and checking proposals on their feasibility. The actors all saw the WINST being used at the earliest stages of the process, so the inexperienced actors could really participate in the discussion from the start. This helps to distribute the information among the actors. It can also increase the trust as the discussion about the goals of the different actors can create more clarity about the motives of the actors and in that way bring actors closer. At last the tool can help the actors to ask the right questions during the negotiation rounds and form a jargon with the tool as the basis for all actors. This can decrease the differences in languages among the actors. The WINST has become a large Excel file, which is not easily used by a process manager without a lot of knowledge about wind parks, as was remarked by the process managers during the interviews. Therefore we added a user guide to this thesis, in which the process manager will be led through the tool in several steps. The process manager will have to sit down with each actor separately to explain the tool and collect the weights and scores to reduce the chance on strategic behavior. Future works Before the tool is used in a real process, one improvement has to be made. A thorough verification and validation of the tool has to be conducted. Now we only roughly analyzed the outcomes of the tool by entering the default settings of the Agentschap NL model. In that way we could estimate during the development of the tool in an iterative process if the tool was producing values that were reasonable. Before the tool is used all factors and links have to be checked for accuracy and the tool as a whole should be checked for producing values and scores that are reasonable. In this check also a sensitivity analysis should be conducted to see if the tool is very sensitive for the input of certain variables. With the improvement mentioned above the tool could be used by a process manager, but further improvements can improve the usefulness of the tool even more. First, the tool can be expanded by adding more variables and links to make the tool more complete. In section 4.5 linked variables that were too complex were left out of the tool, but a separate study can try to incorporate these links. Second, a thorough guideline for the tool can be written. Although a user guide is comes with the report, a more thorough guideline can help clarifying the following points; when to use the tool and when not to use the tool, what can be negative effects of the tool, how can these negative effects be overcome, what can be strategic behavior and how can this be decreased? Third, a process (with place for the tool) can be designed. A process design from start to finish of the process can help as guidance for the process manager.","Wind Parks; Decision-Making Processes; Process-Support Tool; Participation Methods; Spatial Planning; Business Cases","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Policy Analysis","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management","",""

Lifting of the asphalt slab as a result of overpressure in the breakwater core was found to be the decisive failure mechanism. To determine the amount of overpressure, measurements were performed in both breakwater heads. A bigger favourable damping of wind waves was measured in the southern breakwater. Based on these measurements and other research outcomes RWS decided to change the maintenance strategy; armour units above the NPA – 2 m line will not be maintained in the future. The new strategy is based on the reasoning that the damping of wind waves reduces lifting forces and makes the weight of the armour layer redundant to prevent lifting. The mechanism(s) causing the larger damping in the southern breakwater are however unknown, this makes it hard to predict the amount of damping and therefore the magnitude of the loading of the asphalt during storm conditions. Aim of this thesis is to get insight in the stability of the asphalt slab during design storm conditions, and the necessity of an armour layer. Therefore the damping mechanism and the amount of damping during storm conditions need to be determined. Numerical modelling is performed to describe wave transmission through the breakwater and to evaluate the influence of different damping mechanisms. Most important mechanism causing additional damping is siltation of the toe structure of the southern breakwater. Along the Dutch coast the net longshore sediment transport is directed northwards. Therefore sediment passes the southern breakwater, part of the sand might settle in the toe and core of the breakwater. A sand layer with a height of 3.3 m reduces the flow of water enough to cause the measured damping. The stability of the sand during storm conditions is checked using open filter sediment transport formula. Erosion of the sand layer is expected, however the erosion is expected to be in the order of centimetres which is insignificant. The damping mechanism causing the measured damping in the southern breakwater is determined; hence loading of the asphalt slab during design storm conditions can be determined. The thickness and quality of the asphalt slab is uncertain and might vary significantly over the length of the breakwaters. In order to get insight in the quality of the asphalt two cores were drilled in 2004. One showed high quality cohesive asphalt, the other showed low quality with low cohesion. Lifting of the asphalt cannot be ruled out. The dead weight of the designed asphalt slab in combination with a partial armour layer is not sufficient to resist the upward pressures during a design storm. The additional resistance needed against lifting can be provided by the weight of a complete armour layer or bending strength of the asphalt slab. The bending strength of the asphalt slab depends on the quantity and quality of the asphalt present. In order for the asphalt slab to have sufficient bending strength a top layer of high quality cohesive asphalt is required. Concluding, without additional information concerning the asphalt quality and thickness lifting of the asphalt slab and thereby failure of the breakwaters cannot be ruled out in case the armour layer erodes above a level of NAP -2 m.","IJmuiden; VOF; wave damping; stability; porous flow; breakwaters","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","52.464778, 4.544884"

(mentor)","2014","The goal of this study was to dive into the novel techniques associated with the use of the available Third Generation DNA Sequencing (TGS) platform, PacBio. This 3-year old technology sounded promising right from the beginning but its groundbreaking attributes, like length and error content, required unconventional handling to yield worthwhile results. To date, only a handful of tools exist that operate on TGS datasets compared to the enormous mass of Second Generation Sequencing (SGS) assemblers out there. In order to efficiently utilize this innovative technology, we need to familiarize ourselves with its characteristics and study the mistakes the existing tools made. To achieve this, a simulated environment was created aiming to comprehensively evaluate two popular hybrid scaffolders (AHA, SSPACE-LongRead) and through that, gain knowledge on the impact of PacBio dataset properties on scaffolding. The evaluation was not limited to contiguity performance (N50/90, etc.) but also examined the accuracy of the results.Three different reference genomes (ecoli, arabidopsis and human) were used for the evaluation and multiple runs were executed for statistical purposes. Apart from the simulated experiments, the capabilities of both tools were also tested on a real dataset, cyprinus carpio (carp fish). Comparison-wise, each tool thrived in distinct situations with SSPACE-LongRead demonstrating better contiguity capabilities (~60% longer N50) and shorter execution time (3–14x faster) whereas AHA was the most accurate one (up to 4x less incorrect joins). PacBio dataset coverage and error rate displayed inconsiderable effect on the result on small genome scaffolding but more pronounced on complex ones. Surprisingly, random features of PacBio sequencing, like length distribution and position of error, had a dominant effect on the performance. Finally, on the carp dataset experiments, AHA achieved a 6x increase in N50 and maximum length while SSPACE-LongRead failed to finish the execution (scaffolded one fourth of the genome). It managed, nevertheless, to produce scaffolds with a maximum length of 646Kbp, compared to 501Kbp of AHA.","bioinformatics; DNA; scaffolding; PacBio; hybrid assembly; SMRT","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Department of Electrical Engineering","","Computer Engineering","",""

In particular for limit-cycle walkers, like the humanoid robot TUlip, robustness poses a problem. To improve the robustness of limit-cycle walking, an add-on control method is proposed, which adjusts step length. The control method tries to maintain a desired orbital energy. The control method is applied on two systems of very different complexity: the Simplest Walking Model and the humanoid robot TUlip. In simulation the control method achieves a significant increase in robustness, to the extent where the model can get into a limit cycle from stance. On TUlip the control method is implemented using a human-supported gait. This implementation does not provide results concerning robustness. However, the experiment does provide insight in implementation issues and applicability of the model. Overall, the control method is found to be a promising strategy to increase robustness of non-robust gaits.","limit-cycle walking; control design; robust; Simplest Walking Model; TUlip","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-12-31","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

The dependence of the algorithm on its input parameters is also tested by slightly varying the input parameters or by artificially creating missing input data and measuring its influence on the output solution. Applications of the methods discussed in this thesis to test the robustness of the specific algorithm mentioned comprehends the justification to measure the input data less accurate, which is both cheaper and faster, the necessity of a centerline to serve as an initial condition, and a technique to determine the most important parts along the centerline, that is the parts that have the greatest influence on the output solution.","level set; total variation; robustness","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Imaging Science & Technology","","","",""

(mentor)","2014","Despite preventive measures in hospitals through the control of environmental and personnel contamination and systemic administration of antibiotics, implant associated infections (IAIs) still remain a serious ongoing problem for hospitals and patients around the world. The main characteristic of IAIs is that bacteria colonizes the implants surface and forms hard to treat biofilm, which can lead to implant loosening and require expensive and often traumatic revision surgery. The demand for improved antibacterial technologies has never been higher with the rising usage of implants worldwide and the ever increasing bacterial resistance against modern day antibiotics. Currently, there are no clinical proven local antibacterial delivery options available for cementless bone implants. The aim of the master's thesis was the synthesis, characterization, in vitro and ex vivo antibacterial evaluation of the porous oxidized silver-bearing surfaces on titanium mouse implants. The synthesis of the antibacterial surfaces was performed on commercially pure (CP) titanium through a surface modification treatment, called plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO), in an aqueous electrolyte based on calcium acetate/calcium glycerophosphate bearing various concentrations of Ag nanoparticles. The characterization of the antibacterial surfaces involved surface morphology, chemical analyses and phase composition, performed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The in vitro and ex vivo evaluation of the antibacterial activity of the TiO2-Ag surfaces was carried out against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and S. aureus GFP (green fluorescent protein). The SEM micrographs and EDS analyses of the antibacterial layers revealed a porous interconnected TiO2 structure rich in Ag, Ca and P elements. Furthermore, the XRD patterns showed the presence of the biocompatible TiO2 surfaces composed of anatase and rutile phases. The TiO2-Ag layers demonstrated promising antibacterial activity against MRSA in vitro and against S. aureus GFP in ex vivo when in direct contact with the bacteria.","silver nanoparticles; plasma electrolytic oxidation; antibacterial surfaces; implant associated infections; cementless implants; MRSA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-09-16","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

(mentor); Bouwman, W.A.G.A. (mentor); Van der Duin, P.A. (mentor)","2014","This research deals with enterprise application integration with two new perspectives. The two perspectives are added value and information technology capabilities. Enterprise applications are a set of software packages that help organizations run their businesses. Enterprise applications have been used consistently in all industries. This wide usage resulted in new requirements from the users for functional specific and industry specific enterprise applications. This requirement made sure that the enterprise application market is filled with vendors who are developing many specialized enterprise applications. The result of the range of applications led to them becoming silo applications (applications that cannot communicate with other applications). Thus, the new problem came with respect to how to make sure these silo applications communicate with each other without changing the existing business and IT environment. This brought the concept of enterprise application integration (EAI). EAI is defined as the unlimited sharing and coordination of data and business process between any connected application and data source in an enterprise. The two perspectives that this research focuses on addressing the core problem that is existing in integration - users of enterprise applications are neither aware of the value of integration nor are they aware of the capabilities they need to make sure the integration is implementable. Software vendors are also facing stiff competition from the market and are interested in developing integrated solutions. But with a lack of knowledge of the adopter’s requirements, they lack a clear strategy for improving their product offerings. External consultants also face challenges from dealing with different applications and making them communicate as stand-alone systems. Thus, there is no clear focus on why EAI should be done and what capabilities are needed to do it. This research focuses on this knowledge gap by having the following objectives: ? Develop a framework that can be used to assess the added values of enterprise application integration. ? Identify the information technology capabilities needed to implement enterprise application integration. The three applications that form the focus of this research for EAI are Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Customer Relationship (CRM) and Multichannel commerce. The research also focuses on Fast Consumer Goods (FMCG) industry since the use of digital channels for shopping is increasing among customers. Another reason why FMCG is a fitting industry for this research is that the important processes in the industry such as logistics, supply chain, customer relations are dealt with by the three applications. These two factors make FMCG an ideal industry for this research. Two theoretical models were used to develop the added value framework namely, Enterprise Application Benefit Framework and Value Creation for E-Business Model. The added value framework developed can be positioned as a aggregation of these two models with the perspective of enterprise application integration in FMCG industry which has not been done before. The research operationalized enterprise application integration using three business processes namely Customer_Order_Online, Customer_Complaint_Call_Center and Marketing_Campaign_Management. All the business processes are developed loosely based on SAP ECC, SAP CRM, SAP-Hybris applications. The business processes were developed keeping in mind that all the three applications under the research have to be involved with each other and must include the stakeholders in the process flow. Information technology capabilities were measured using two dimensions namely human and hardware capabilities. Human capabilities refer to the technical and managerial skills needed and hardware capabilities refer to the hardware storage and speed of computation. Research Method The research technique used for the research is Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Likert Scale. Data was collected from four stakeholders namely software vendors, software adopters, external consultants and academic professionals through an online survey. Conclusions The developed framework determine added value from two dimensions derived from the two existing models. The two dimensions represent two constructs of added values. The first dimension which represents the importance of the added value is categorized as novelty, efficiency, lock-in and complementarities. The second dimension represents the intensity of the added values and is categorized as strategic, managerial and operational. Based on the framework and the business processes that were used to operationalize enterprise application integration, nine added values were identified namely, Improved Business Planning, Increased IT alignment with business, Better Customer Experience Increased Company Common Vision, Improved on time Delivery, Accurate Sales Forecasting, Streamlined business processes, Increased Data Quality, Increase in Sales. These added values were then fitted into the framework based on the business processes previously defined. The developed framework was then tested using the online survey. The results for the second objective indicate that the highest capability needed is cross departmental interaction between IT and business units. This capability is also related to the increase in business IT alignment added value. The need for IT technical employees to gain managerial skills was also the second highest capability needed. The capabilities that were not required were business managers learning IT technical details and more hardware storage for integration. Generalization of the research The framework was developed with the SAP applications and hence the business processes were developed from these applications’ modules. But using this framework for other business processes would not be an issue at all since the framework itself does not rely on the business processes and only the added values are dependent on the business processes. The information capabilities identified are applicable to any type of company irrespective of whether they treat IT as a support or a strategic tool. The framework can also be used to determine the added values of other industries based on the business processes. Future Research More research can be carried out for the validation of the framework and fill the empty slots for combinations of added values that are novel and operational. Other factors that affect the concept of capabilities apart from IT, such as organizational, financial and regulations have to be investigated. Future research must include another important stakeholder in the framework which is the end customers since they are important in the adopter’s strategy. And the framework must be tested in other industries and with other enterprise applications products apart from SAP to make the framework more robust. Limitations of the research The research has five limitations. First, the framework is developed based on business processes suitable for SAP applications. Although the framework is not dependent on the business processes, in order to improve the external validity, more research has to be done on how it changes to other vendor applications and business processes. Second, the list of added values is limited to nine since increasing added values will affect computation of Analytic Hierarchy Process and increases the survey length. Third, the list of business processes is also limited to only three but they are some of the most commonly used business processes. But future research can be done to see if the framework works for other business processes. Fourth, due to the small sample size, this research serves as exploration and first validation of the constructed framework and further research can be conducted to do more extensive validation by means of survey research, mainly through in depth interviews. Finally, the adopters’ size can maybe be a limiting factor for using the framework. Since it clearly distinguishes the organizational levels within a company, SMEs and other smaller companies may not be the most suitable firms to use this framework.","Enterprise Application Integration; added value; multichannel commerce; ERP; CRM; FMCG; information technology capabilities","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-09-02","Technology, Policy and Management","Information and Communication Technology (ICT)","","Management of Technology (MoT)","",""

Creating a foam with the injected gas can improve the sweep efficiency. For an efficient foam displacement process the foam films must remain stable in the presence of oil. Unfortunately, most foams are destabilised by oil. It is therefore important to select an foaming agent appropriate for the reservoir. To select this foaming agent a reliable screening procedure is necessary. In this thesis seven different surfactant solutions were screened using three experimental methods (Interfacial and surface tension measurements, bulk foam tests and core flooding experiments). The different experiments are performed both in the absence and presence of a paraffin oil, at a temperature of 50ºC and atmospheric pressure. The bulk foam experiments were carried out with the Foamscan apparatus. All the foams were destabilised by the the oil, as predicted by the stability criteria about foam oil interaction. The rate of destabilisation is not accurately predicted and therefore the criteria have only limited applicability. The core flood experiments were performed using a Lilliput core, which had a diameter of one centimetre. This Lilliput core flood set-up proved itself as a good surfactant screening tool. Bulk foam stability and the apparent viscosity in the core correlate well, in the absence of oil, this indicates that bulk foam experiments are a useful screening tool to predict the surfactant performance in a core flood experiment. In the presence of oil the behaviour in core floods was more complex and no good correlation was found with the bulk foam experiments.","foam-oil interaction; bulk foam; foam in porous media; lilliput core flood experiments","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

The GMRF method is implemented in different programming environments in order to evaluate the potential performance enhancements given varying levels of language abstraction. It is seen that the GMRF method can be used to generate Gaussian Fields with a Mat{\'e}rn type covariance function and reduces the computational requirements for large scale problems. Speedups of as much as 1000 can be observed when compared to the standard Cholesky Decomposition sample generation method, even for a relatively small problem size. The MLMC method was shown to be at least 6 times faster than the standard Monte Carlo method and the speedup increases with grid size. It is also seen that in any Monte Carlo type methods, a Krylov subspace type solver is almost always recommended together with a suitable preconditioner for robust sampling. This thesis also studies the ease of implementation of these methods in varying levels of programming abstraction. The methods are implemented in different languages ranging from the most common language used by mathematicians (MATLAB), to the more performance oriented language (C++-PETSc/MPI), and ends with one of the newest programming concept (ExaStencils).

(mentor); Bruining, H. (mentor); Hajibeygi, H. (mentor); Joekar-Niasar, V. (mentor)","2014","Low-salinity water flooding is a promising technique for the improvement of oil recovery. Despite intensive research, there are controversies about the pore-scale mechanisms behind the low-salinity effect (LSE). One of the proposed LSE mechanisms is wettability alteration, which is reflected in a decrease in contact angle. However, it is not known how a variation in contact angle affects the macroscopic transport properties such as capillary pressure and relative permeability. The effect of contact angle variation on the transport properties is investigated by simulating capillary dominated, two-phase flow with a quasi-static pore-scale modeling method. The simulations are performed with real rock samples and, therefore, the effects of heterogeneities in the rock are incorporated. We distinguish three levels of analysis: single pore throat, bundle of tubes and pore network model. The first two levels of analysis comprise microscopic effects of the contact angle, whereas the pore network also includes macroscopic effects due to the connectivity characteristics of the network. For this reason, percolation theory is used to enhance the understanding of the effect of the connectivity on the flow properties. The pore-scale fluid configuration is influenced by the wettability of the pore walls. However, previous research has not related the conventional wettability definition with the definition from an engineering perspective, which is based on the capillary pressure curve. Therefore, to include wettability effects on the transport properties, the definition of ""pore wettability"" has been revised such that the curvature of the fluid-fluid interface is consistent with the capillary pressure. As a result, the pore wettability is not solely dependent on the contact angle, but also on the pore geometry. The geometry now plays a crucial role, which implies that it is of high importance that the extraction algorithm provides accurate pore geometries. Modeling results reveal that the contact angle has a negative effect on transport properties in perfectly homogeneous media. However, real rock representations always have a certain degree of heterogeneity. Heterogeneity negatively affects the transport properties, because it decreases the connectivity and thus the conductivity of the network. In presence of permeability contrasts, variation in contact angle influences the pore filling sequence, which affects the transport properties. Snap-off displacements suppress the effect of permeability contrasts, which means that regards oil recovery water-wet systems are favoured over oil-wet systems. In contrast, in case of heterogeneity at pore-level, snap-off leads to oil entrapment and has a negative effect on the residual oil saturation. This implies that oil recovery improves at increasing oil-wetness. For this reason, maximum oil recovery is obtained under intermediate-wet conditions. Since heterogeneities play an important role in snap-off, the optimum wetting state is dependent on the network topology. When aging is taken into account, an opposite flow behaviour is observed. Transport properties are positively - instead of negatively - affected by an increasing contact angle. These conflicting results might be an explanation for the inconsistent experimental results. Since capillary dominated flow neglects differences in displacement rates, further research is required to investigate the effect of contact angle variation in the presence of dynamic forces. Furthermore, a dynamic model would allow mobilization of the trapped oil phase, which enhances the accuracy of the oil recovery predictions. The size of the oil clusters might provide an indication on the obilization of the oil entrapment.","Pore-scale; Physics; Modeling; Oil; Water; Two-phase; Rock; Network; Percolation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

(mentor); Kester, L. (mentor); Kroeger, M. (mentor)","2014","The ‘Stats’ page on Kickstarter.com claims a total of $1,221,791,199 pledged to 65,673 successfully funded projects by 6,613,502 supporters as of today (July 18th, 2014). The tenets of web 2.0 and crowd-based innovation platforms are enabling ordinary but motivated user-innovators to create and own disruptive innovations. This is also pushing industry leaders like Bosch to involve the crowd in an overall value chain of open and collaborative innovation. These developments are transforming the global innovation landscape. This graduation project explores strategies for mobilizing crowd intelligence to source actionable solutions for innovation challenges within Bosch. Conducted with the central User Experience team of Bosch, it begins with a phase of literature research that dives deep into the crowdsourcing phenomenon and an organizational perspective on it. It results in the confirmation of 5 key stakeholders (Innovators, Backers, Steering Team, Challenge Owners & Bosch) and an initial framework (System map) for a service that seems to fit the Bosch context best. Then follows a phase that focuses on understanding the Bosch context by researching two aspects that are foundational to the project’s context – innovation management within Bosch, and the needs and constraints of internal Bosch stakeholders (Challenge Owners). Exploratory design research with the Challenge Owners reveals insights that help choose specific types of innovation challenges within Bosch and target groups (Innovators, Backers) that the platform should target. This results in a concept direction that narrows the focus of the platform to sourcing disruptive solutions to challenges in new business/market/product development preferably in the Business-to-Consumer domain from external inventors and users. From here on, the focus of the project shifts to identifying the right mix of incentives that the platform must offer to motivate the external target groups (Innovators, Backers) to participate. In a phase of conceptualization, all findings and learnings from previous stages of research are consolidated to create four front-end scenarios for the platform, each offering a different mix of motivations and incentives with calculated shortcomings. These scenarios (service prototypes) serve as early-stage concepts which are tested with the external target groups to elicit a plethora of insights. These insights help shape the final service concept in the form of an ideal front-end scenario for the platform. The final concept is labeled ‘Enabled by Bosch’ or ‘Ebb’. Ebb sources actionable design solutions and their validation from inventors and supporters around the globe by offering them a fetching mix of extrinsic and intrinsic incentives. It creates an engaging experience by introducing inspiring innovation domains, offering a true meritocracy and employing tactics of social gamification that draw the target groups. As the name suggests, it leverages Bosch’s immense industrial expertise in product realization to enable inventions through all stages of the new product development process, hence differentiating itself from all other crowd-based innovation platforms that offer inventors just an initial incubatory boost. Most importantly, Ebb strengthens Bosch’s B2C foothold by projecting it as a revolutionary, future-oriented and consumer-driven brand. This concept is complemented with a detailed service blueprint that identifies and details all potential back-end functions and processes integral to the service. This involves all potential actions that the 5 stakeholders perform at various stages to facilitate the service. Keeping in mind that Ebb is a multi-sided platform that has to attract distinct and interdependent target groups of users simultaneously to create value, a business model is proposed. To conclude the conceptualization phase, the Ebb concept is tested with an external target group (Innovators, Backers) to identify weak points and generate recommendations for improvement. Lastly, an implementation plan is proposed keeping Bosch organizational factors in mind and recommendations for implementation and improvement are made. The hope is to offer a good starting point and impetus to pitch the concept to the decision makers and kick-start the implementation of Ebb.","crowdsourcing; open Innovation; crowd-based innovation platform; service design thinking; innovation strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2016-09-12","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

We will attempt to solve the problems to reduce the failover times on Ethernet IP networks with the application of active link monitoring and advanced capabilities of the OpenFlow protocol. To enable protection scheme, a routing algorithm is required that provides link-based protection. We propose a protection algorithm that guarantees protection, minimizes path cost on primary path and discovers protection paths for intermediate switches on the primary path with the main purpose to minimize failover times, optimize network traffic and reduce the need for crankback routing. In short, we provide a complete solution to increase the robustness of Ethernet IP networks to the level of carrier-grade and industrial networks with the application of a link-based protection scheme and optimal routing algorithm, combined into a Software Designed Networking solution.","Software-Defined Networks; robustness; recovery","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems","","Network Architectures and Services","",""

(mentor); Kuijpers, J. (mentor)","2014","In industrial environments robots are used for various tasks. At this moment it is not feasible for companies to deploy robots for productions with a limited batch size or for products with large variations. The use of robots for such environments can become feasible through a new generation of robots and software which can adapt quickly to new situations and learn from their mistakes while being programmable without needing an expert. A concept that can enable the transition to flexible robotics is the combination of imitation learning and reinforcement learning. The purpose of imitation learning is to learn a task by generalizing from observations. The power of imitation learning is that the robot is programmed in an intuitive way while the insight of the teacher is incorporated in the execution of the task. This research studies the combination of imitation and reinforcement learning, the research is applied to an industrial use-case. The research question of this study is: ""Can imitation learning be combined with reinforcement learning to achieve a successful application in an industrial robotic precision placement task?"" To imitate the demonstrated trajectories, Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) are used. The DMPs are used to encode the observed trajectories. DMPs can be seen as a spring-damper like system with a non-linear forcing term. The forcing term is a sum of Gaussian basis functions with each its corresponding weight. Reinforcement learning can be applied to these weights to alter the shape of the trajectory created by a DMP. Policy Gradients with Parameter based Exploration (PGPE) is used as reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize the recorded trajectories. Experiments done on a UR5 show that without the learning step, the DMPs are able to provide a trajectory that results in a successful execution of a robotic precision placement task. The experiments also show that the learning algorithm is not able to remove noise from a demonstrated trajectory or complete a partial demonstrated trajectory. Therefore it can be concluded that the PGPE algorithm is not suited for reinforcement learning in robotics in its current form. It is therefore recommended to apply a data-efficient version of the PGPE algorithm in order to achieve better learning results.","reinforcement learning; imitation learning; policy gradient; pgpe; dynamic movement primitives; precision placement; dmp; optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","Embedded Systems","",""

(mentor)","2014","With rapid development of digital devices with wireless services, communication networks play a significant role in our daily lives. The explosive data demand makes it urgent to extend the capacity of the existing networks. Cognitive Radio (CR), which can sense and use the frequency band dynamically, can provide an efficient radio frequency usage. IEEE 802.22 working group has developed several standards based on CR technology leading to Wireless Regional Area Networks (WRANs). However, WRANs adopt the cellular topology in which all communication is in a point-to-multi-point (P2M) manner. This P2M communication limits the network capacity because all messages need to be routed by the Base Station (BS) even for intra-cell communication. Therefore, Device-to-Device (D2D) WRAN (D2DWRAN) has been proposed, which employs D2D communication into the WRAN. A burst allocation is the allocation of resources for wireless communication to the users, and influences the network capacity significantly. With D2D communication, the burst allocation problem in D2DWRAN is different from it in WRAN. This thesis attempts to solve this new burst allocation problem. After introducing the progression from WRAN to D2DWRAN, the new burst allocation problem is stated and formulated mathematically in different scenarios. Then the existing optimization methods are studied and evaluated, such as Greedy Algorithm, Simulated Annealing Algorithm, Genetic Algorithm and Ant Colony Algorithm. Some modifications based on these algorithms are also proposed to solve the burst allocation problem in D2DWRAN. These modified algorithms are also simulated and the advantages and disadvantages of each of them are discussed and analysed.","D2DWRAN; IEEE 802.22; OFDMA; Heuristic Algorithm","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","","",""

(mentor)","2014","This research focuses on the analyze of the heterogeneity of the Groningen gas field, i.e. characterization of the reservoir rock and the sealing Zechstein salt on top of the reservoir, by modeling the rock properties of the formations. The aim of this study is twofold, namely to characterize the thickness, shale content and porosity of the reservoir rock and the sealing Zechstein salt. But also to set an geological framework of the Groningen gas field, which can serve as a basic input for subsidence studies and geomechanical modeling of the Groningen field. The Groningen gas field was first discovered in 1959 by well Slochteren 1 and has an horizontal extent of around 900 km2. The reservoir is situated at a depth of 2600-3200 m and the estimated recoverable volume is about 2700 billion m3. It lies within the Southern Permian Basin gas province, an extensive E-W stretched sedimentary basin. In order to analyze the heterogeneity of the sediments (this include the Ten Boer, Ameland and Slochteren member) and the salt rock, software named Quantumgis is used to obtain two dimensional interpolated plots of the three evaluated rock properties. The three rock properties evaluated are thicknesses, shale content and porosities. Well log data have been used to determine these properties. For the thicknesses, the penetration depth of the well bores are used. For the determination of the shale content, gamma-ray and spontaneous potential logs have been used. And eventually, the porosities are derived from density and neutron logs. The used data is obtained from NLOG, the Dutch gas and oil portal. The Zechstein member is a relative thick formation, and show a relative heterogeneous thickness pattern. The Ten Boer member has a relative homogeneous thickness pattern. It has a high shale content and low porosity. Both properties show a heterogeneous pattern. The Ameland member is relative thin and is only present in the northern half of the field, with a high shale content. The distribution of the shale content show a heterogeneous pattern. Finally, the Slochteren member, which is the main reservoir rock, has a heterogeneous thickness pattern. The porosities are high and the shale content is relative low. Both properties show a relative homogeneous pattern. In short, the evaluated formations show a relative heterogeneous pattern for the three rock properties. If one relates the obtained models in this research with the compaction models done by the NAM (NAM,2013), it is clear that production must be reduced or completely stopped in regions with high porosities, since at these regions subsidence values are the highest. This will lead to less compaction and a lower chance of seismic activities.","Groningen gas field; Heterogeneity; rock sections; rock parameters","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Applied Geophysics and Petrophysics","",""

(mentor); Bombois, X. (mentor)","2014","Large-scale systems have become more important in the last years and will probably continue to do so due to the increasing complexity of nowadays problems. One example of such a system is a clock distribution network consisting of several phase locked loop systems deployed in an array. It is possible to obtain a (nominal) linear model describing the dynamical behaviour of a phase locked loop system around an operating point and to design a controller such that desired performance is achieved for this model and the overall linear model of the large-scale system. Although the phase locked loop systems are produced on an industrial scale, they will never be exactly equivalent. These dispersions can be captured by including uncertainty blocks in the model which results in a set of models describing the large-scale system. It is interesting to check if after including uncertainty in the model, certain performance can still be ensured. Analysing performance for such a set of mathematical models is called analysis of the robust performance. A method to perform robust performance analysis called μ-analysis or the direct approach exists though is relatively time consuming. Since the time computation is significant and crucial when applying the direct approach, it is interesting to study another method which can decrease the computation effort. M. Dinh, A. Korniienko and G. Scorletti have, after an idea of M.G. Safonov, developed a frequency dependent method to perform robust performance analysis on a linear large-scale system in several steps which can reduce the computation time needed though can give more conservative results with respect to the direct method. This new method is called the hierarchical approach. In this thesis we will explain the hierarchical approach and compare the robust performance analysis results obtained with the direct approach and with the hierarchical approach. We will also illustrate that the latter approach contains a trade-off between computation time and conservatism. We then introduce the two contributions of this thesis. First, an additional mathematical tool will be presented which can be used in the hierarchical approach to reduce the conservatism in the results. Then we will introduce a method which allows us to perform analysis of the robust performance not only for one specific frequency but also for a range around this frequency.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","Systems and Control","",""

There is however a small community of scientists and engineers who are exploring these technologies. “Aerial vehicles used in planetary exploration bridge the scale and resolution measurement gaps between orbiters, which have global perspective with limited spatial resolution, and landers which have local perspective with high spatial resolution, thus complementing and extending orbital and landed measurements.” This indicates that an aerobot can provide a substantial scientific return far beyond the alternatives like an orbiter, lander or surface rover. Here on Earth buoyant aerobot technology is flown daily by meteorological institutes. A buoyant aerobot is nothing else than a type of balloon filled with a buoyant gas lighter than air. For the simple release of an atmospheric balloon however, a certain expertise is required. Researching atmospheric balloons lead to the exploration of these balloons, airships and alike for planetary missions. Understanding the behavior of a scientific balloon here on Earth definitely increases the insight of balloon behavior on another planet. Organizations across the world have been working on vertical flight simulation programs to estimate the balloon’s time of ascend and floating altitude. Over the years improvements were made and extensive programs were developed which included; planetary atmospheric models, 3D trajectory planning, buoyant gas selection, balloon envelope materials selection, propelled flights, etc. This thesis presents the Buoyant Aerobot Design and Simulation tool BADS. The tool has been modeled as much as possible towards the current professional aerobot flight simulation programs. The program makes use of Matlab coding for the aerobot design and trajectory simulation and includes the following databases and parameters to specify the aerobot’s design and flight; 4 atmospheric models (Earth, Mars, Venus and Titan), 4 balloon shapes (Sphere, Oblate Pumpkin, Prolate, Prolate Airship), 4 balloon pressure types (Zero-Pressure, Super-Pressure, Over-Pressurized Zero-Pressure, Montgolfier), 15 envelope materials, 71 envelope coatings. The validation of the tool has been achieved through thorough testing and comparison against existing flight simulation tools and specific aerobot design data. A sensitivity study proved that the assumptions made in BADS are similar to those in other programs and that any discrepancy effect, if present, can be minimized.","Aerobot; Buoyant; Simulation; BADS; Design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","Space Systems Engineering","",""

In the case of sectorial operators, the topologically extended holomorphic functional calculus serves several benefits. The Hirsch calculus for non-negative operators can be incorporated into this holomorphic approach. The resolvent of the logarithm can be defined without the requirement of the injectivity of the operator. Furthermore, this approach can be used in order to obtain convergence rates for the Euler's approximations for bounded semigroups.

(mentor); Doubrovski, E.L. (mentor); Van der Velden, N.M. (mentor)","2014","This master thesis is the result of a graduation project for the master Integrated Product Design the faculty of Industrial Design Engineering, Delft University of Technology. The title of this thesis is Designing [with] 3D Printed Textiles. The main assignment is to design a meaningful garment using 3D-printed textiles. The approach that was adopted for this project is a recently developed method on Material Driven Design (MDD), which suggests a number of steps to design meaningful products when a material is the departure point. As this method has not yet been applied on a project involving AM, another goal is to explore how the MDD method can be used in a project where AM is the primary production method. 3D-printed textiles as a material category are influenced by material, structure and process (MSP), which cannot be seen apart from each other and influence each other. In order to gain an understanding of the MSP, a number of samples of 3D Printed textiles were obtained. Some samples were collected from AM service providers, designers, and open-source design databases, while others were specifically designed and 3D Printed for this project. It was found that different combinations of MSP result in different materials that can have different, meaningful applications in different contexts. An analysis of traditional textiles found that flexibility is the most important property for textiles, since without flexibility no wearable garment can be produced. It is possible to divide textiles into four levels: garment, textile, yarn and fiber. Each level has a main structure, which results in a hierarchical structure for the overall material. This hierarchical structure is responsible for most of the mentioned properties that are desirable in textiles, such as flexibility, warmth, softness, and absorption. In order to obtain the same structure for 3D-printed textiles, it is important to find a way to mimic this structure. Since flexibility was found to be the most important property for textiles, a classification for 3D-printed textiles is proposed based on the main source of the flexibility, i.e. the structure or the material. Structure-based refers to the fact that the flexibility is obtained purely by the application of an appropriate structure, regardless of the material used. This kind of flexibility is obtained by means of multiple assemblies. Material-based refers to the fact that the flexibility is obtained purely due to the characteristics of the material, by the use of flexible materials such as elastomers. Finally, an overlapping category can be distinguished which uses both material- and structure-based principles, named thin structures. The experiential characteristics of 3D-printed textiles were examined by means of a number fo samples. The samples elicited movement in order to explore the flexibility of the material, by means of shaking, throwing and caressing the samples. ‘Playfulness’ and ‘surprising’ were found as pre-settled meanings, for which the flexibility of the material and the fact that they were 3D Printed contributed most. The latter also elicited a positive reaction, since the 3D Printing process is still perceived as new, exciting, and innovative. A vision statement was created that described the interaction with the material. It was formulated as: I want people to have an attachment to their 3D Printed garment in order to extend its life span, by creating a personally engaging experience, like the act of blowing bubbles. ‘Blowing bubbles’ is used as a metaphor, illustrating a simple, engaging act that is familiar to everyone. Making the biggest bubbles is a challenge, and watching the light react on them is a pleasure; they are engaging to make and engaging to watch. Two meanings were distilled from this metaphor: intriguing and familiar, The meaning intriguing is related to the engaging experience, which will keep being interesting and surprising over time, while the meaning familiar can be described as ‘a friendly relationship based on frequent association’, comparable to a favourite jeans that has been worn many times. These meanings were translated to material qualities, which form the requirements for the new material together with the requirements found from the context analysis. On a material level, the 3D Printed textile should be suitable for use in garments, and thereby withstand a number of technical requirements, such as flexibility, tear resistance, breathability and water resistance. There are also a number of experiential qualities for the material that are related to creating a textile that is comfortable to use. Softness, smoothness, warmth, lustre and coarseness are examples of these qualities. One of the tested MSP’s was thought to be most suitable for use as a textile and its fit to the vision. However, for this MSP the structure and process were found appropriate, the material was not suited for use as a textile. Therefore, a number of experiments were conducted with different materials. The material that showed the best results and had the best fit with the intended vision was a mixture of cellulose fibers with a flexible acrylic. Although this material is not suitable for 3D-printing yet, it does give an impression of what the material should be like in the future. A concept was developed using this MSP. In order to do so, the unique properties of the MSP were analysed: its aesthetics are most prevalent, most notably the pattern that resembles lace and is somewhat prevailing. It is also very suitable to produce property gradients (i.e. making the pattern smaller and higher decreases the flexibility of the material), therefore it makes sense to use it for applications where this quality could be used to the fullest. By means of several brainstorm sessions, the most valuable product direction was found to be bras, since they have a combination of supportive and comfort functions. The choice was made to design a corselet, in order to demonstrate the versatility of the selected MSP. The fact that 3D Printing significantly reduces the number of process steps necessary and the amount of waste material, means it has the potential to contribute to environmental sustainability. The total impact of the product was evaluated by means of a Life Cycle Analysis (LCA), and compared to traditional manufactured textiles for 1 kg of textile. The results of the analysis were compared to those of traditional textiles, and it was found that the environmental impact of the 3D Printed textile is comparable to those of woven textiles with a yarn thickness of 300 dtex.","additive manufacturing; textiles; 3D printed textiles; garments; material driven design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

The TAGS is located in a N-S oriented anticline, with faults part of a flower structure acting as hydrocarbon migration paths, and consists of two distinct formations based on facies. The fluvial TAGS Sandy, which consists of 4 different units, has compartmentalization in especially the meander deposited Sandy 2 and Sandy 4 units whilst Sandy 1 and 3, deposited coastal sabkha and by a braided river system respectively, show excellent connectivity. The coastal sabkha Upper TAGS, consisting of 7 units, shows excellent connectivity for Upper 1, 3, 5 and 7 in its sheet sands except for the deltaic deposited Upper 2 which is highly compartmentalized. The Upper 4 and 6 claystones might act as additional hydrocarbon seals to the overlying Liassic evaporites. A conceptual static reservoir model was created in Petrel to learn more about the size, shape and spatial distribution of the compartments. This was done by creating correlation panels parallel and perpendicular to the SW-NE orientation of the TAGS channel belt. Stratigraphic interpretation based on gamma ray, density and sonic logs as well as core photographs was used to divide the TAGS formation into separate units which were linked by reoccurring claystone intervals. This provided an insight into local fluvial channel belt shifts, mean sea level change and humidity levels. A 3D model was created of these units which was consequently used to estimate the Gas Initially In Place (GIIP) volume.","TAGS; TAGI; Berkine; Ghadames; Toual","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Applied Geology","","30.1700, 6.6750"

The use of FRP in lift gates can be really attractive to optimize lift gates drive mechanisms by limiting the gates dead weight.

To investigated the dynamic behaviour of a lift gate made in FRP a case study was conducted regarding a renovation project for a guard lock located in the Juliana channel in Maastricht, the Netherlands. This guard lock serves not only as a guard lock to regulate the water level in the channel preventing floodings but it also serves as a navigation lock, that provides passage for ships using the Juliana channel. To come to a design first seven different design alternatives for the gate were drafted. From these alternatives, the Lens gate and the Arched gate were chosen for further analysis. The dynamic analysis was carried out using both a mass-spring model and a beam model. The resulting eigen frequencies were then compared to the ones obtained from a 3D-numerical model made with ANSYS. To be able to answer the question of which gate design is less susceptible to hydrodynamic loading the excitation frequencies, due to the flow underneath the gate and the waves, that could cause the gate to vibrate where determined. This was done for both vertical and horizontal vibrations. From this investigation it was concluded that both gate designs can be excited by (stationary) waves and that the Arched gate is susceptible to vertical vibrations due to flow. Therefore the choice which gate design would be best has been for the Lens gate. However some changes to the gate dimensions could improve the dynamic behaviour of the Arched gate. And because other aspects of the design should be taken into account, e.g. the integration of the gate within the lock system, no definitive conclusion can be drawn.","FRP; Composite; Hydraulic Structures; Dynamics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Hydraulic Structures","",""

(mentor); Rozendaal, M.C. (mentor)","2014","In this graduation assignment a smart textile is designed. In order to do so, first the context is researched: What is there already? What technologies are there? What applications are there currently? What requirements are there? Next, an ideation phase took place to come up with directions for the smart textile. A few ideas were selected out of all the sketches and were developed into small concepts, of which one is chosen. To design a smart piece of clothing which cools down women having a hot flash is the final concept. The development of this concept consist of several researches as well. Literature about the menopause is read and a menopause consulent is visited. Menopause is the time in a woman’s life when the body stops producing estrogen and the body has to find a whole new hormonal balance. It starts around the age of 45 and can take up to 10 years time. Next to hot flashes a lot of other symptoms are explained. Four women are asked to share experiences in a user interview. The applied technology in this smart textile is the Peltier-effect. When an electronic current is applied to a Peltier-device, one side of the device turns cold, while the other side turns hot. Tests are done to measure which voltage applied to the Peltier-device will lead to which temperatures. Peltier-devices stacked on top of each other and Peltier-devices next to each other applied with pulses of current are configurations that are possible as well, in order to create the most efficient cooling effect. Next to this, a simple prototype is build, to test the feeling of the Peltier-devices on the skin of the women. The results of both tests were combined and a conclusion could be made: The Peltier-devices would be double stacked and a voltage of 4,5 V would be applied. As a last phase the final prototype was build. Step by step is explained how this final design was established. All the aspects and its decisions are explained. For example: what components are used to make a working circuit, what code is use? In what way the aesthetics and the interaction of the final design are developed? After finishing this final design it was evaluated, again with the participants from the previous user tests. Final recommendations are made to specify what needs to be done to take this product to the next step, such as: The Peltier devices need to be researched, the behavior of the bodies temperature during a hot flash needs to be researched, the power supply need to be developed and the product needs to be developed into being water resistant.","Smart clothing; Textiles; Menopause; Peltier effect","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Alvarez-Grima, M. (mentor); Van Paassen, L.A. (mentor)","2014","This research aims to provide an understanding of the behaviour of co-disposed coarse (sand) and fine (clay and silt) tailings when discharged into an onshore dredge pond, and the dependence of that behaviour on the sediment composition. This understanding contributes to the ultimate goal of finding a method by which fine tailings can be discharged back into the original dredge pond, while preventing these fines from recirculating through the production process. This would eliminate any need for external tailings dams, thus avoiding the risks traditionally associated with these dams. This study is part of an effort by Royal IHC to make dredge mining a competitive method for mining a wide variety of mineral deposits. To describe the behaviour of co-disposed coarse and fine tailings, an analogue is found in debris flows. From this analogue, four key behavioural aspects of mud in water are defined: erosion of sediment or entrainment of water, hydroplaning, segregation of coarse and fines particles in a slurry, and the strength increase of the material after deposition. Literature on debris flows suggested that the cohesion of the material, in the description of debris flows usually captured in a yield stress, is instrumental in determining if any of the first three behaviours are to be expected. The fourth characteristic, strength increase, depends mainly on material specific relations between void ratio on one hand, and permeability and effective stress supporting capacity of the material on the other. The concept of yield stress shows many similarities with that of the undrained shear strength. Therefore it is investigated if the yield stress can be calculated as a function of a material’s Atterberg limits – as is possible with the undrained shear strength – and thus provide a method of predicting the slurry flow behaviour. This removes the need for relationships between the less easily captured quantities as particle size distribution and clay mineralogy, and the yield stress. Experiments are performed on modelling clay and three mixtures of this modelling clay with a silica flour to determine the relationships of both undrained shear strength and yield stress with the liquidity index. Testing is done on soils with different Atterberg limits to confirm dependence on liquidity index only. The undrained shear strength is measured using a fall cone test. The yield stress is measured using a viscometer. To determine the yield stress, a full rheogram is measured for each sample. A Bingham type rheological model, of which the yield stress is a parameter, is then fitted to this rheogram. The yield stress and the undrained shear strength are plotted together as a function of liquidity index and proved to fit to the same curve, which thus describes the strength of a soil from a liquidity index of 0 up to 4. The relationship between the yield stress and clay content of the tested samples is also investigated. It is found that the concentration of the clay-sized fraction in water correlated well to both the yield stress and undrained shear strength. Hence it is concluded that yield stress is primarily determined by the clay content, and that any other size fraction has negligible effect on the yield stress of slurries. This changes when sand is added to diluted soil, as is suggested with the co-disposal method. At low sand concentrations, the effect of sand on the yield stress is still minor or even negligible. At higher concentration however, the sand noticeably increases the yield stress of the overall fluid. At a certain sand concentration, the sand grains form a network throughout the material, at which point it can no longer be considered a fluid. Silt is found to have a similar influence as sand on the slurry yield stress. The yield stress of the modelling clay in the experiments is plotted as a function of both the fines concentration in water and the sand concentration in the overall mixture. An optimum mixture range is identified based on earlier identified limits: As a minimum, the yield stress should be 35 Pa for a slurry to remain coherent at low slope angles. As a maximum, the pumpability with a centrifugal pump is used. This can be guaranteed up to a value of 200 Pa. However, for different pumps different values apply. It is concluded that the clay fraction of a sediment is the critical mixture component for providing yield stress in when the material is slurried. Sand and silt sized material only have noticeable effects when their concentrations reach such levels that they form the main structure of the mixture. However, as the relationship between the carrier fluid’s clay content and yield stress is heavily dependent on the clay mineralogy, a more convenient method of estimating a slurry’s yield stress, and thus suitability for deposition, uses the liquidity index of the fines fraction.","Atterberg; yield stress; strength; clay; mud; tailings","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Section Resource Engineering","",""

(mentor); Laine, L. (mentor); Nilsson, P. (mentor)","2014","The so-called A-double long heavy vehicle combination is a 32 meter long and up to 80 tonnes heavy double-trailer truck widely used in Canada and Australia today, and will be more abundant on the road also in Europe in the near future. They have the potential to decrease road transport cost, traffic congestion and generate lower emissions than current road freight transport. However, an undesired effect of the added towed units is the increase in difficulty to maneuver truck on roads and in busy traffic. The increasing complexity for truck drivers to handle trivial tasks like lane changing call for advanced driver assistance functions. The development of advanced assistance systems or potentially autonomous functioning trucks can improve traffic safety, allowing for further increase in use of long combination trucks. This thesis work focuses on one crucial element of such driver assistance systems, the ability to plan a safe and smooth trajectory and generate control signals for the low level actuators. Based on the measured vehicle-state, the road curvature and measurements of surrounding vehicles, a (sub)optimal steering action and cruise control reference velocity ought to be generated. A receding horizon optimal control problem (OCP) is formulated, with a nonlinear single-track vehicle prediction model for the A-double combination. The OCP is designed to capture the main highway driving tasks of lane keeping, lane changing and collision avoidance. A direct multiple-shooting solution strategy to this OCP is implemented using the automatic code-generation functionality of the ACADO toolkit. Results of closed-loop simulations are presented for the control of both the vehicle prediction model and a high-fidelity vehicle model, developed and validated by Volvo Group Truck Technology. Because of the computational performance advantages of the Real-Time Iteration algorithm and the automatic code-generation for the solution scheme, real-time performance is achieved for the optimization-based receding horizon trajectory generator for the A-double combination.","model predictive control; mpc; receding horizon; rhc; real-time; trajectory generation; trajectory generator; long combination; truck; driver assistance; collision avoidance; highway; volvo; nonlinear programming; optimal control; A-double","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","Systems & Control","",""

As a result, technologies that reduce this energy consumption are in high demand. Theoretical models of heat flows in greenhouses can be used as a tool to increase the efficiency of these developments. This work seeks to improve such a tool by modeling the effects of various window opening angles and wind directions on the ventilation boundary condition for a greenhouse climate model. Using OpenFOAM, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of various window opening angles and wind directions were run for both external and internal flow of a Venlo-type greenhouse. A thorough verification of the simulation results examined spatial convergence, temporal convergence, model implementation, iterative convergence, and consistency. The results of these simulations were deemed insufficient for a boundary analysis due to initial flow field errors. While the variable results could not be applied to a boundary condition analysis, the constant case (with 30 degree window openings and a zero degree azimuth angle) was used to reproduce the internal flow field of the greenhouse. The resulting model contained concentrated error at windows where fixed velocity values are not prescribed, correcting for continuity. This boundary condition is a first step towards more accurate internal greenhouse flow simulations of ventilation. Further, methods for generating a ventilation boundary condition using verified variable simulation results are discussed for future use.","greenhouse; computational fluid dynamics; ventilation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","","",""

(mentor); French, P. (mentor)","2014","Stenosis is the main reason of the failure of a vascular access in haemodialysis. Its presence engenders an increase of the morbidity and an increase of the hospitalization for hemodialysed patients and its early detection consists thus in an important issue. Digital phonoangiography or digital acoustical analysis is an alternative to the current techniques combining the advantage of its low-cost, its easy implementation as well as its user- and skill-independency. This technique, automated version of the auscultatory technique used by the practitioners with their stethoscope, is based on the idea that the stenosis engenders modifications of the hemodynamic in the vascular access at the origin of sounds or “bruits”. This study proposed to assess the influence of different parameters on the acoustics by mean of an in vitro model system that allows controlling independently each of these parameters. Assessed parameters included the severity or degree of the stenosis, the flow, the pressures, the viscosity and the velocity. Results indicated that the essential parameter was the velocity at the stenosis which determines the appearance of spectral features, starting from a value of about 1.4 m/s while a value around 2.6m/s could be almost always associated with certitude to their presence. Spectral features were found in the frequency bandwidth from 70 to 800Hz with three main regions located at 180-300Hz, 310-390Hz and 440-700Hz. Moreover results indicated that a minimum severity of the stenosis was required, corresponding to an obstruction of the lumen of the vessel of at least 44%. These results suggested that the underlying reason was the modification of the type of flow from the transitional or laminar to the turbulent state confirmed by the Reynolds number. This study also further investigated the possibility of detection of sounds directly on the extracorporeal blood circuit by transmission through the needle.","phonoangiography; stenosis; acoustic; analysis; frequency; spectral features; model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomedical Engineering","","Biomedical Engineering Specialization Medical Physics","",""

(mentor); Bouwman, H. (mentor); Broekhans, B. (mentor); Schonewille, J. (mentor)","2014","Social media have become a representative part of people’s lives. Nowadays, companies rely on the information on the web to study customer behavior and offer products that fit the needs of their customers. This situation is also valid for hospitality providers, who structure their holiday packages and offers based on reviews and feedback. The main research question is how social media can be used as a channel of communication between hospitality providers and customers, in synergy with other channels. To answer this question, the study will focus on how customer-relationship management is already handled by hospitality providers, as well as what the existent channels of communication between providers and customers are, and how social media is already used as a channel. The main observation will be on how people interested in choosing a holiday destination make use of social media technologies. This practical problem has a broader interest and is framed as a project to research how hospitality providers can support customers in their whole transaction process of deciding on a holiday destination, by making use of social media combined with other channels. The practical research for this thesis is conducted for a hospitality provider, VierVakantie, which is a camping startup concerned with increasing its number of customers, as well as maintaining a constant group of clients. The methods used to conduct this study are literature research on existing customer-provider channels, with the main focus on social media and electronic word-of-mouth, as well as a structured survey on how families from five European countries use social media when deciding on a holiday destination, from searching for a location, to booking and reviewing it. The results from the survey stand as the basis for several strategies that will be suggested to hospitality providers – camping agencies from the Netherlands, in particular - to establish a solid customer database. Moreover, a great deal of questions from the survey focus on whether people are interested in the type of holiday VierVakantie is offering, thus the answers will help in designing a solution for this camping startup to enhance communication with customers. This solution is represented by a social media platform that allows customers to book a vacation, post reviews, photos and videos from their trips, as well as interact with other travelers and, perhaps, establish a travel community, where people not only discuss online, but also travel together. A social media platform is the desired alternative, since it will be connected to the most common social media websites, and will extract all the information in one place. The social media platform is, however, at the design stage, so, as future work, it should be implemented and tested. The natural step is to implement a prototype to test the basic functionalities and analyze how users interact on it. This social media platform is believed to help customers to find all the information they need about their holiday in one place, in a timely manner, as well as to ensure that VierVakantie, as a hospitality provider, has access to most of the online information about their customers and services, hence it is the most holistic channel of communication.","customer relationship management; social media; online tourism; travel community; multichannel theory; hospitality agency; word-of-mouth; social media platform","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Management","","ICT Management and Design","",""

The pressure to efficiently produce and maintain gas assets has thus also increased. On top of these external trends, ONEgas strives to be in the top quartile companies in the gas market. The integrated contractor of ONEgas, AJS, is stimulated to continuously improve their performance. Currently projects are evaluated separately on changing aspects. A comparison of projects based on their performance assessment is thus not reliable. This research proposes a benchmark tool for AJS to compare and signal performance. The corresponding analysis provides arguments in discussions around the performance of AJS. It was found that performance can be monitored by using the Project Management Triangle and controlled by acting on the comparison of the different projects with regard to the size of a project. The Project Management Triangle consists of Cost, Schedule, Scope and Quality as universal performance indicators. It is used to ensure comparability among projects in the Benchmark. The provided method for the selection of appropriate data can be used for the creation of a benchmark of other (unrelated) projects. The AJS benchmark is created in such a way that time, effort and required knowledge are reduced to a minimum. The required data is however only available after the project has completely been finished. It is therefore advised to incorporate the benchmark as one of the very last actions in the close out process. When monitoring and acting on the measured and compared performance it is important to keep the seven paradoxes in mind. When these are disregarded the action may very well have the opposite effect. It is thus advised to only use the benchmark as a signaling tool and have a separate study on how to improve a specific situation.","benchmarking; benchmark; performance indicator; offshore; complexity; success factor","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-09-03","Technology, Policy and Management","POLG","","SEPAM","",""

This thesis aims to investigate into how the collective identity of the biohacker in the Do-it-Yourself Biology (DIYbio) movement mobilizes collective action to achieve social change. The collective identity of a movement is the “we” that influences how biohackers give meaning to the collectivity and make sense of their actions and the goals they pursue based on shared beliefs, values, critiques and visions of the world. The biohacker can be understood as the bio subgenre of the hacker, whose ethic and practices of free and open-source software and hackerspaces—or in other words practices of Commons- Based Peer-Production—are adapted to the life sciences and technologies. To research how the collective identity is constructed I analyzed the practices and discourses of the DIYbio movement. I performed participant observation in movement areas where they carry out collective action; an online discussion forum and in a biohackerspace. I also performed documentary analysis of popular media articles and discourse analysis of in-depth interviews with biohackers from around the world. To understand the dynamics of how biohackers mobilize collective action I proposed a framework in which biohackers define problems and solutions based on their communal values of openness, freedom, and collaboration. The DIYbio movement coordinates collective action for social change on a political level as it aims to democratize biology and create a commons of the means of production, and on a cultural level by promoting a work ethic of freedom of inquiry and sharing under a collaborative commons.","social movement; collective identity; DIYbio; biohackers; hackers; commons-based peer-production; open-source","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Biotechnology","","Biotechnology and Society Group","",""

In this thesis work, classical molecular dynamics is used to study the mechanical behavior of silicon cantilever under neutral Ar bombardment. Initially, a single crystal silicon cantilever is set in a simulation box using molecular dynamics simulation. Thermal vibration of the cantilever without any bombardment is studied using Euler-Bernoulli model. Then the cantilever is bombarded under neutral Ar atoms, with different bombarding energy and bombarding angle. The results shown that Ar bombardment can make significant plastic deformation (around 6 nm) comparing with the thickness of the cantilever (1.5 nm). The low energy bombardment, with its high efficiency and quite low sputtering, is potentially to be applied for 3D nano architecture of Si.","nanotechnology; molecular dynamics simulation; nano fabrication; 3D nano architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Material Science & Engineering","","Material Science & Engineering","",""
