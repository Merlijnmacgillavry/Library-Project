(mentor)","2012","Scour formation at the toe of a rubble mound breakwater can lead to abrupt failure. Nowadays, counteraction of scour via geometrically closed filter rules, geotextiles or combinations is the common practice. Alternatively, in specific cases the use of geometrically open filters can save significant amount of time and decrease constructional costs. As a primary step towards this direction, the prediction of scour formation through a geometrically open filter can provide important information. Nevertheless, at this moment the knowledge upon this issue is insufficient and limited. A variety of recommendations occurs in literature, separately for toe design/scour protection and for the application of open filter criteria; however none of the studies treats these subjects combined. Therefore the objective of the present thesis is to get insight into scour formation and development through a breakwater toe lying upon sand and designed as a geometrically open filter. Thereby the research aims in drawing the link between scour characteristics with wave loading and filter configuration properties. In order to accomplish the research objective 2D physical model tests were conducted in the 25m long, 1m deep and 0.6m wide wave flume of DMC, installed in the company’s laboratory. In total, 23 tests were executed with irregular waves (Jonswap spectrum) and by varying wave loading and filter configuration properties. In particular, 5 different filter/base layer combinations were examined and 3 different wave conditions were used to investigate the effects of relative grain diameter, relative filter thickness, grading of filter layer, base layer stability Number and storm duration. Quantification of damage magnitude was accomplished via laser profile measurements of filter and base layer prior and after the execution of each test. Furthermore, wave particle velocity climate was determined via the use of an Electromagnetic Flow Meter (EMS) placed at the center of the toe. Finally, temporal evolution scour was captured through the side glass and was examined by digitizing and analyzing snap-shots from predefined time steps. Test results and observations have revealed the highly spatial character of scour formation. Nevertheless, tests with identical boundary conditions showed a surprising convergence in averaged maximum scour depth magnitude. In addition, in the majority of tests an S-curve erosion/deposition pattern was shaped while erosion started immediately at the downstream side of the box threatening breakwater stability. Equilibrium maximum scour depth was reached for less than half the data set; thus erosion process was still in progress. Based on this, two approaches were developed to investigate temporal evolution of scour. Furthermore, dimensional analysis and literature review have revealed the most important parameters that have significant effect in scour formation; their combination has led to the formation of a prediction tool. However, combination of the results from tests with different base materials would not be possible without the introduction of the base material stability Number (critical Shields’ Number). The derived tool is an empirical expression with limited physical background and range of validity. Additionally, it overestimates maximum scour depth due to a serious model effect; the different buoyancy between filter and base layer that was causing initial damage and damage exaggeration. Nevertheless, it is capable of delineating the relative contribution of each parameter in scour depth formation. For an overall view of scour formation, further research will be needed to provide a more accurate quantification of the interrelation between parameters that play a role in scour formation and development, and to implement the effect of missing parameters. Consequently the use of the derived expression as a scour prediction tool in real life is not yet recommended.","scour; rubble mound breakwaters; geometrically open filters; toe protection; lightweight tracer model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2012","Static analyses and transformations are an important part of programming and domain specific languages. For example; integrated development environments analyze programs for semantic errors such as incorrect names or types to warn the programmer about these errors. Compilers translate high-level programs into programs of another language or machine code, with the purpose of executing the program. Programmers make frequent and small edits to code fragments during development, making it infeasible to do analysis of the entire program for every change. To cope with this, each change must only trigger re-analysis of the changed fragment and its dependencies while keeping a consistent knowledge base of the program. In other words, the analysis must be incremental. Most computers today have multiple CPU cores and the trend is that CPU performance will scale in the number of cores, not in the performance of the core itself. To make use of these cores, the analyses must also be executable in parallel. Traditionally, an incremental and/or parallel analysis is handcrafted for each language, requiring substantial effort. In this thesis, we present a framework for performing incremental and parallel static program analyses and transformations based on a name binding specification. If such a specification is given and the framework is used, the analyses and transformations are executed incrementally and in parallel. Additionally, name resolution is also derived from a name binding specification, reducing the implementation effort even more. To specify name binding, we present the Spoofax Name Binding Language, a declarative meta-language for the specification of name binding and scope rules, which departs from the programmatic encodings of name binding provided by regular approaches. The specification is implemented using a symbol table infrastructure that automatically traces dependencies, and a language-parametric name resolution algorithm that performs name resolution and incremental scheduling of analyses. The framework is integrated in the Spoofax Language Workbench. Several case studies have been conducted to evaluate the approach.","Spoofax; name resolution; incremental; Parallel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-11-30","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","SERG","",""

It is assumed that such a time series is generated by one of the autoregressive and moving average models, with optional deterministic and/or stochastic trends. The problem subjected here, will be to characterize if this stochastic process is stationary or non-stationary. To answer this, different known hypothesis tests under various assumptions are introduced. In particular, the Dickey-Fuller and Phillips-Perron tests, that test for a unit root under the null hypothesis, are compared in performance by experiments using simulated data. From the results of these experiments, it will be shown that the augmented Dickey-Fuller test with specified parameter k12 for the lag length performs best. Following this conclusion, an automated testing procedure is developed where this unit root test is applied complementary to the KPSS stationarity test. Next, this procedure is applied to different physical and financial data to show that most realizations are I(1) level-stationary. That is, the data will become stationary around a non zero mean when the unit root is removed by differencing once.","time series analysis; ARMA model; unit root; stationarity; hypothesis testing; Dickey-Fuller; KPSS","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","Bachelor of Science Applied Physics","",""

Creating usable agent-based models is thus an important aspect to consider while constructing agent-based models. However, an ABM modelling approach that explicitly addresses usability does until this point not exist. This thesis proposes an ABM usability modelling approach, which is designed and applied for an ABM of gas desulphurization technologies that is developed in collaboration with Shell P&T. The approach is based on dividing usability for ABM into three aspects: (1) experience, (2) functionality and (3) interaction. By defining layers of usability and put them into perspective, an actionable ABM usability modelling approach is obtained. Continued use of this modelling approach would enable the development of this approach into a generic usability modelling approach. Besides future research for the usability modelling approach, future research is defined for modelling process technology in socio-technical systems using ABM.","usability; agent-based modelling; socio-technical systems; modelling approach","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy & Infrastructure","","SEPAM","",""

(mentor); Thissen, W. (mentor); Bouwmans, I. (mentor)","2012","This research deals with identifying policies that can stimulate the transition of private combustion vehicles to electric vehicles in Amsterdam, the Netherlands by 2040. As the problem owner, the Municipality of Amsterdam is responsible for improving the air quality of the city. Since road traffic has the largest share in pollution (i.e. 68%), the Municipality has defined short and long term objectives to switch from combustion to electric vehicles (e.g. by 2015, 2020 and 2040) and has set aside a budget of 20 million Euros to subsidize the transition until 2015. This study suggests that the public is most sensitive to the driving range, the recharging time and the price of a vehicle when they make a purchasing decision. The study also suggests that the availability of infrastructure is necessary for the transition but does not ensure the acceptance of electric vehicles by the consumers. To identify and quantify the factors that can influence the transition, system dynamics method is used to construct a model. The model is built with a simulation software, named Vensim. These factors are identified using the literature, questionnaires with 130 residents of Amsterdam and by interviews with the Municipality of Amsterdam and a private electricity supplier. The model -as a base case- shows the causal relationships between three sub-systems; required infrastructure, consumers’ choice and the flow of vehicles (i.e. from combustion to electric vehicles or vice versa) between 2009 and 2040. Uncertainty analysis and dominance analysis are performed to check whether the parameters influence the system behavior and to understand how the feedback loops influence the observed behavior. The model also shows the potential influence of the external factors on various policies under different contextual scenarios (e.g. optimistic, pessimistic, average etc.). Nine individual policies are identified and classified in three groups: (1) capital intensive policies, (2) low capital intensive policies and (3) a promising policy combination, which is further improved by taking into account the time factor (e.g. as opposed to introducing all policies at the same time). Overall, the model suggests that reaching the 2015 objective is not likely and the objectives for 2020 and 2040 are ambitious, unless there are significant technical developments in the battery technology for the electric vehicles. Technical developments between now and 2040 can lead to recharging vehicles faster (e.g. 5 times) and/or increasing the driving range (e.g. from 130 km to 350 km) and/or lowering the price of electric vehicles (e.g. by one third). This can make it more attractive for the consumers in their choices and help reaching the short and long term objectives. The model suggests that the transition takes place in three stages: slow increase in number of electric vehicles, fast increase in number of electric vehicles and slow increase in number of electric vehicles. The promising policy combination obtained from the model suggests that subsidizing the purchasing price of the electric vehicles at the end of the second stage leads to a higher number of electric vehicles in the system. Until that time it is suggested for the Municipality to continuously invest in creating public awareness and trust while making sure that there is sufficient capacity of infrastructure -whether with fast or slow recharging units. Another implication for the Municipality is to be ready to implement a large number of recharging units in a relatively short time in the second stage. This may have additional cost implications such as planning where to install the recharging units, the ability to produce and install these units and arranging sufficient logistics and human resources for the installation. Last but not least, the Municipality can monitor the consumer preferences against changes over time and regularly review the effectiveness of implemented policies.","System Dynamics; Electric vehicles; Contextual Scenarios; Dominance Analysis; Transition; Attributes; Electric Infrastructure; Consumer Choice","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-11-17","Technology, Policy and Management","Multi-Actor Systems","","Policy Analysis","",""

This creates several interesting opportunities, mainly between bol.com and the Albert Heijn. One of the suggestions, not only internally but also externally by the media, is the possibility of picking up the bol.com order at the local Albert Heijn. Multiple studies point out in the direction of a physical pickup location for the online store. Albert Heijn has several different store concepts with each there own possibilities and limitations. With the rapid increase of the mobile devices and the large amount of customer data both companies own there are interesting possibilities for implementation in the design of a physical touchpoint. From the multiple suggestions of possible directions a bol.com branded self-service environment with a fun element and a possible implementation of the boxes they use for shipping was chosen. After these concept directions and some further analysis a final design was created in the shape of a multi touch environment, which uses a natural user interface. With the use of three different ways of interaction with the design everybody should be able to make use of it. The use of the customers’ mobile device is stimulated in order to make the pickup easy and to make it an omnichannel experience. The design has a bol.com look with a fun element for which bol.com is known. In addition to the physical look there are many possibilities to create an interface that fits the brand and enhance to entire experience. Finally a prototype of the design has been build, which can be used for testing touch interfaces, it can be extended to recognize codes and it can be extended to work with the mobile BT communication. No new set-up is needed for any of these options; they are all possible within the current technique. Future development in the direction of natural user interface will automatically increase when it is more widely adapted.","Clicks; Bricks; Natural User Interface; Multi touch","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-11-29","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

Figuring out if Chinese building automation market will be valuable for Priva to enter in now and what product and marketing strategy should be designed was the main objective of this project. Six research questions are designed to guide the research process, which will be answered in the six chapters in this report. Chapter one gives on overview of the building management system industry background knowledge. It is known that the building management system products have intimate relationship with the building market and is part of the intelligent building system which is very dependent on system integrators. In the building value chain in China, there are six stakeholders, four of which have certain influences on the decision making of building automation facilities—the project investor/building owner, Facility managers, designers, building end users. Chapter two introduces the current product portfolio and business strategy of Priva and analyzed the core competence of the company. Currently Priva is very dependent on partners which provide sales channels for the company and integrate product components into an entire building energy management system for the building owner. The core technology competence of Priva is the good quality of the hardware products and outstanding design and user experience of the software products. Chapter three describes the situation of Chinese building management system market, segments the building market as the future building management market, and selects the hospital vertical market for Priva as the niche market segment. A market entry decision is suggested and a new product design is required to meet the market demands. Chapter four shows the new product concept generation process. The hesitant customer group in the Chinese hospitals is selected as the target customer group of Priva. Product functions and working principles are designed according to the user needs research and previous results of company analysis and market analysis. The design is a combination of a software product and a set of simple physical modules. The product is independent on the system integrators and used to create the awareness of the connection between the comfort management and the energy management. Chapter five provides future recommendations on the business model of the new product and a licensee strategy is suggested. How to design the product details and user experiences and how to find a new partner in the Chinese market are the future research fields.","Building management system; Chinese market; Vertical market; Intelligent building; Product concept design; Business model; Market entry decision making","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-11-29","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

EASY (Electronic Archiving SYstem) is het online archiveringssysteem dat hiertoe dient. EASY bevat veel datasets met data en metadata die op dit moment alleen toegankelijk zijn via de webinterface. De opdracht voor deze BSc-­stage was om een API te ontwikkelen (op basis van REST principes) die het voor externe applicaties mogelijk maakt te communiceren met EASY. Tevens moest een demonstrator app gebouwd worden die de mogelijkheden van API demonstreert. We begonnen het project met een oriëntatie fase, waarin we onderzochten wat mogelijke oplossingen konden zijn en welke tools we het beste konden gebruiken. Hierna volgde het ontwerp proces. De eerste stap in het ontwerp proces was het verzamelen en prioriteren van de requirements. Hiertoe hebben we verschillende stakeholders van het project benaderd en Requirements Analysis Documents (voor de server en voor de demonstrator) opgesteld. We hebben tevens gekeken of een op REST (Representational State Transfer) gebaseerde oplossing inderdaad de meest efficiënte was, dit bleek het geval te zijn. We hebben het REST principe verder geëxtrapoleerd en ons gecommiteerd aan het ROA (Resource Oriented Architecture) principe. We hebben de API als een zelfstandige module geimplementeerd die slechts communiceert met de business laag van EASY. De demonstrator is in staat te communiceren met de API en (meta)data daaruit op te vragen. Wij hebben veel tijd besteed aan het onderhoudbaar houden van het systeem. Dit deden we onder andere door veel tests te schrijven, gebruik te maken van standaarden en veel gebruikte frameworks/tools. Gedurende het project zijn er een aantal tegenslagen geweest die wij moesten overwinnen. Sommige tegenslagen waren van technische aard, zoals het configureren van de Spring context en de Maven dependencies of security overwegingen die ons parten speelden. Andere tegenslagen waren van juridische aard en slechts te verhelpen door toezeggingen van de jurist van DANS. Wij hebben naar ons gevoel het doel van de opdracht bereikt. De API is in staat om applicaties en toepassingen van derden te serveren met data uit EASY en de demonstrator is in staat om de potentie van een dergelijke API aan te tonen en de functies te valideren. DANS zou op de ingeslagen weg door moeten gaan en de API verder valideren en uitbouwen.

(mentor); Romero Herrera, N. (mentor)","2012","Due to the demographic shift and aging population, the number of the seniors with cognitive impairments is increasing. In taking care of these seniors, caregivers experience both financial and emotional burdens. This project studies three care parties of this special group of people, who take care of the seniors with a mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in home settings at an early stage of disease, including case managers, home nurses and family caregivers. Main goal of this project is to design a tool to improve the communication and collaboration between them. The insights of how caregivers experience the MCI was gained through three steps of researches: literature research, field research and in-depth research. The field research is extensively carried out in different care settings to get to know the care system and involved people. And in-depth research is further studied the needs and wishes of people in experiencing MCI. Through visiting and interviewing a lot of people, I found the three care parties are differently involved in the cooperative work. Their needs and preferences have much variation in coping with caregiving. The shared information among them is divided into common information and non-common information. To satisfied all the three parties needs as much as possible, the design starts from solving the problem in the current situation: caregivers have miscommunication in informing caregiving activities and updating senior’s conditions using notebook. The design challenge is: To better support the communication and collaboration between caregivers by using an engaging tool. Three features are set as the design visions: in-control, friendly and connected. After exploring four design directions, I found it is crucial to develop a solution that provides immediate benefit to all stakeholders, the design direction focusing on the common information requirements is selected as the start of the design. With the information framework, the interface development was started by placing the information components of the main interface. The chosen idea is with no particular emphasis on certain information, which applies for three care parties. Following the design visions, the visualization of the final interfaces was discussed to achieve the design challenge of making it easy to use and elaborated eventually. The final design is elaborated into a prototype made by power point and tested with seven users of both professional caregivers and family caregivers. Generally they like the concept and the design. Also gives suggestions in terms of several aspects of design and information customize. Due to time constraints, only three points on the main interface, history interface and settings are refined. And the other suggestions are left for recommendation for the further study.","caregiving; CSCW; communication tool design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Human Information Communication","","","",""

(mentor); San Segundo Bello, D. (mentor)","2012","Glucose sensors are useful for monitoring and control of blood-sugar concentration for diabetic patients. There are many challenges in their wide-spread use and effectiveness in control of the disease. This work is a step towards achieving in vivo continuous long-term glucose monitoring using the optical near-infrared based glucose sensing principle. The thesis investigates and arrives at an architecture for the readout circuitry of such a sensor system. The goal is that the realized CMOS chip together with the optical sensing devices realized in Silicon-on-Insulator technology will form a single-implantable solution. The advantage is the long-term monitoring due to non-usage of chemical reagents. The thesis work addresses the read-out circuit requirements for a photodiode as part of such a sensor. The design of a high-resolution current-input sigma-delta ADC is discussed which targets to achieve 16-bit resolution for a photo-diode signal in the range of 100nA-10?A. Various optimizations for specifications such as noise, accuracy and energy-efficiency both at circuit and system level are addressed. The chip has been realized in a TSMC 0.18?m process. The initial measurements show the functionality of the ADC and its performance using the test set-up developed. A proof of concept of the optical-electrical interface with a photodiode shows the application of the circuit.","glucose sensor; incremental Sigma-Delta; current input ADC; dynamic reference; wide-dynamic range; sensor adaptable ADC","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-01-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electronic Instrumentation Laboratory","","Microelectronics","",""

(mentor)","2012","Mangrove forests have been proven to be an efficient system in attenuation of the wave energy. Therefore, they may be incorporated in the construction of coastal dikes and contribute to decreasing the total cost of such a project. This may be achieved by lowering the dike crest, lesser usage of the land or applying softer revetments. Each location where a coastal dike is to be constructed is characterized by its specific, bathymetric and met-ocean conditions. Different mangrove vegetation fields also affect the extent of wave height decay and have an impact on the total costs of a dike construction. Prior to making the decision about including mangroves in a costal dike project, a question must be answered whether or what magnitude of these savings will be made. Vietnam is one of the countries, where low-lying and deltaic regions are often flooded during extreme typhoon events and therefore the construction of flood defenses takes place on a large scale. Furthermore, the climate and conditions at the most of the Vietnamese coastline are favorable for plantation and growth of the mangroves. For that reason, Vietnam is chosen in this study as a case location for which the generic results of this study will apply. These results allow assessing the total cost savings of a coastal dike construction by incorporating mangrove vegetation for a given location, regardless of its site specific conditions. The analysis made in this study showed that the costs of a coastal dike construction in Vietnam can be effectively reduced by incorporating mangrove vegetation in the design. The extent of this reduction is subjected to the vegetation pattern, which is a function of various parameters i.e. growth stage of the trees, length of the forest, as well as the met-ocean conditions such as tidal amplitudes and storm surge levels. A 0.25m reduction in wave height leads to the total savings of around 0.25mln Euro per one running kilometer of a 3m high dike, when utilizing a hard revetment. If the 0.25m wave height reduction results in the possibility of applying soft revetment such as the Vetiver grass, these savings dramatically increase to the value of 0.9mln Euro per kilometer of a dike. These construction cost savings can already be achieved by planting 200m mangrove vegetation, where the sparsely distributed mangrove trunks (0.2-0.6 unit/m2) of varying diameters from 0.2 to 0.7m will be the elements obstructing wave propagation. Hydrodynamic simulations have proven that the emergent mangrove canopy is the most effective in attenuating wave height. In such scenarios, when the water levels are higher, the 400m long mangrove patch reduces wave height up to 0.70m. As a result, the cost of constructing 1km of a 6m high dike, can be reduced up to 1mln and 2.3mln Euro in cases where concrete blocks or reinforced grass are used respectively. The graphs and formulas developed in this research may serve as a first approximation during feasibility studies or conceptual designs of a coastal dike incorporating mangrove vegetation. They allow calculating the design wave height attenuated by a site specific or planned for the restoration mangrove forests for different design met-ocean conditions. Calculated wave reduction coefficient can be later on translated to the cost savings of a “Vietnamese” coastal dike raised behind the mangrove forest.","mangroves; coastal dikes; cost","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2012","Already for some time, electronic enhancements regarding vehicle behavior has made its way into the aviation and automotive industry by the term ""by-wire"" technology. Electronic sensors and actuators are used to replace traditional mechanical systems in which software is used to operate the actuators in a way that is not possible with traditional mechanical systems. The use of steer-by-wire technology can also offer great opportunities on single-track vehicles like motorcycles, scooters and bicycles. Single-track vehicles can be highly unstable, especially at low forward speeds and they require a relative high amount of rider control. By replacing the mechanical connection between the handlebar- and steering-assembly with electronic actuators, a controller can be used to control the dynamic behavior of the bicycle based on additional sensor information. This research has focused on the modeling and simulation of a steer-by-wire control strategy to modify and enhance the lateral stability of a bicycle at low forward speeds. Case studies show additional capabilities of a steer-by-wire system on bicycles to influence its dynamic behavior, by providing a dynamic response comparable to a bicycle with a virtually different geometry or even the ability to stabilize an inherently unstable bicycle. A steer-by-wire bicycle prototype was designed and build by replacement of the mechanical connection between handlebarand steering-assembly by electronic actuators and a custom digital controller. The steer-bywire bicycle prototype equipped with sensors, measuring the forward speed- and roll-rate is subsequently used to experimentally evaluate the proposed control algorithms. Test results obtained from experiments conducted by the steer-by-wire bicycle prototype equipped with a stabilizing controller algorithm, show the ability to stabilize the lateral motion of the bicycle-rider combination at low forward speeds as predicted by numerical simulations. Rider steer effort is reduced which makes the bicycle more easy to ride and could lead to future implementation on bicycles tailored for elderly or those physically impaired. The importance of steer torque feedback is indicated by comparison of steer effort measurement results between experiments with and without steer torque feedback at the handlebar.","Steer-by-Wire; single-track vehicle; bicycle; dynamics; control; lateral stability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-03-24","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

They also transmit the external forces, acting on the superstructure, to the foundation. In the past years the traffic loads and intensity on the European traffic system has continuously increased. Bridge bearings are therefore more subjected to the wear. Structural bearings are not only designed and fabricated according to the European standards NENEN 1337, but they are also tested according to these standards. The bearings are however not tested with the forces, translations and rotations which occur in practice. To make a critical judgement regarding these standards, the wear behaviour of a large arch bridge, the first Van Brienenoord Bridge, is analysed. The analysis is performed by means of a linear elastic, finite element model. The bridge model is then subjected to a modified fatigue load model based on the European standards for traffic loads NEN-EN 1991-2 and traffic measurements at the Moerdijk Bridge. Translations and rotation were consequently found along with the simultaneously occurring reaction forces. These results are compared to the qualification tests included in parts 2 (Sliding elements) and 5 (pot bearings) of the European standards for structural bearings.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-01-31","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Steel and Timber Structures","",""

Failures are classified between soft and hard to identify the impact on the system. Equations are introduced to show the failure probabilities based on packet arrival probabilities. Experiments show the impact of interference on the failure rate with an increased failure rate during office hours, and a ratio between hard and soft failures ranging from 1:5 to 1:25 for single hops depending on the link quality. A setpoint based heartbeat solution is proposed that solves hard failures and copes with soft failures. Equations show the impact of different heartbeat properties on the performance of the heartbeat solution. The solution is implemented and experiments show that it meets the robust properties required by WSANs. To make a WSAN predictable and adaptive to its environment, future implementations could monitor the environment and reconsider timing properties, based on gathered data and hopcount.","WSANs; Robustness; interference; IEEE 802.15.4; heartbeat; setpoint; building automation; failures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-11-19","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Embedded Software","","Embedded Systems","",""

In Africa, more than 75% of the households have limited access to electricity. The predominant means of lighting are kerosene, firewood and cheap torches powered by not-rechargeable batteries. The current lighting solutions are unfavorable because they are dangerous and unhealthy for users and the environment. Therefore, Ndassie, a company specified in sustainable electrification, would like to provide a better lighting system that helps people get out of the darkness and precarity in a sustainable way. The lighting system consists of a docking station (DS) and rechargeable LED lamps. The DS recharges the lamp in about 5 hours by solar energy. The pilot country is Cameroon in Central Africa. The DS is the product that will be designed in this project. The main focus is on the manufacturability. This aspect is important because it can reduce several costs that are related to production. Therefore, a methodology called Design for Manufacturability (DfM) is applied. Furthermore, a low-cost product is important be able to enter the BOP market. Four concepts were developed based on the requirements and one was chosen to be the final concept. After communication with the manufacturers, the final design is detailed according to the requirements of the manufacturer and the design requirements. A sample was then produced by the manufacturer in China and transported to the Netherlands to evaluate. After the evaluation on the sample, there were points that were improved and implemented into a redesign. The cost of the redesign was reduced and the redesign became more manufacturable because the number of parts, assembly handlings and assembly time was reduced. Furthermore, the design has more parts that have the same shape to reduce the assembly time and machine settings.","manufacturability; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-11-26","Industrial Design Engineering","Integrated Product Design","","","",""

(mentor)","2012","In spring 2010, Zilver Innovation initiated a project called “Design The New Business” . The aim of this project was to investigate how designers and business people are working together in new ways to solve the complex problems that businesses are facing today. The outcome of the project was a documentary that included interviews from design consultancies, education experts and business that have incorporated design as a part of their core approach. Throughout the project, I observed with detail the consultancies interviewed and started to feel curious what was the reason that Zilver was so different. What is so unique about Zilver? Which is Zilver considerably smaller than other consultancies? With those questions in mind and aiming to understand the uniqueness of Zilver, this graduation project was born. Zilver is a creative consultancy located in Rotterdam. Founded in 2006 by Erik Roscam Abbing, who is also the motor, brain and heart of the company. Zilver specializes in “Brand Driven Innovation” for turning vision into value. This approach is based on the understanding that in order to innovate, organizations need a deep and shared vision of themselves and their customers. This shared vision then drives the process of innovation, helping understand what will bring value to the customer and value to the company. After six years in the market, with a diverse portfolio of successful projects, Zilver is positioned as an industry leader for the topics of branding, design, management, innovation and strategy. “Zilver Reflection” analyses the company using the “Brand Driven Innovation” methodology and recommends steps that should be taken to achieve growth and to trace the roadmap to the year 2018. The project deconstructs Zilver and summarizes the findings through five themes: Brand, Culture, Stakeholders (Internal – External), Tools and Processes. The solution to achieve growth will be rooted in these themes and how they form a structure for Zilver as an organization. The project builds up Zilver from the core to its outside, articulating the themes into a coherent plan that can be approached and understood by all the stakeholders. This clear understanding of the company by the stakeholders will allow Erik to collaborate and communicate with them, and will help ensure they follow the same goals and vision with their clients and their projects. The solution is presented as a Booklet and a Canvas. The booklet (Zilver Manual) will be a boundary object between Erik and any other party involved with Zilver. It defines the Zilver brand, its structure, the ideal stakeholders (internal and external), the process for projects inside and outside Zilver and codifies it into understandable themes. The canvas is a visual aid to be used during a project in order to keep a clear perspective of the tasks that need to be taken during each stage and to plan the activities for the next one.","creative consultancy; innovation; strategy; brand; brand driven innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-11-26","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

Cooperative building societies are getting requirements from the European Union which they have to meet in a few years (Action Plan for Energy Efficiency: Realising the Potential). The target is to reduce the current energy consumption (heating and electricity) of buildings with 20% in 2020.The hypothesis is that with the correctly selected type of heat pump, with or without the combination with a CHP in the right proportions, a heating unit configuration exists with which mid to high temperature heating can be achieved in existing apartment buildings in the Netherlands, in a sustainable and cost effective way. Three heat pumps types were highlighted and explained, the Vapor Compression Heat Pump (VCHP), the Gas Absorption Heat Pump (GAHP) and the Compression Absorption Heat Pump (CAHP). Based on the yearly average temperature and the required temperature gain for the central heating water, the CAHP was the most economical option according to data from literature. The CAHP was investigated in more detail. When the heat pump was only able to deliver 336 kWth, the best investment and annual savings relation was obtained. With this configuration the heat pump is able to fully cover the 30-50ºC temperature range only. At higher required temperature ranges the heat pump would only deliver a part (336 kWth) of the total heating demand, up to 400 kWth would be delivered by a CHP and the remaining heating demand would be provided by conventional boilers. Despite that the Net Present Value (NPV) for the CAHP is 13% higher than the NPV for VCHP configuration, the latter is preferred. Since the CAHP is a rather new technology entering the market, more research is required in order to decrease the involved risk and uncertainties of the system.","heat pump; compression absorption heat pump; mini channel heat exchangers; old apartment buildings","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Sustainable Process & Energy Technologies","","Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Mink, A. (mentor); Van Sandick, E.H.D. (mentor)","2012","In many developing countries governments are not able to provide energy access to its inhabitants, especially those living in rural areas and with the lowest incomes. For these 4-5 million people around the world, who live with less than $2 a day, often referred to as the Base of the Pyramid (BoP), electricity is deficient and unreliable. According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), 1.5 billion people worldwide do not have access to electricity. Of these people, nearly 80% live in the least developed countries of South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. In Rwanda for example, only 7% of the population has access to electricity from the grid, therefore the other 93% mainly, must use other alternatives such as candles, batteries and kerosene. Those alternatives represent an average of 9% of the overall household expenditure, which is excessive for these families. Expanding access to energy is necessary to reduce poverty, but includes a broader scope. To promote better engagement in educational activities, make domestic work easier and more efficient as well as enable new activities that can generate additional incomes. In rural areas worldwide, especially in Asia, biogas producing systems at household level are being implemented as an alternative cooking fuel over wood, dung and charcoal. However, in Africa no large-scale programs have yet been established. SNV, the Netherlands Development Organization (formerly Stichting Nederlandse Vrijwilligers), plans to roll out 2 million biodigester plants in the year 2020. This project aims to give access to electricity to rural families that own or can afford a biodigester. It is possible to anticipate that with the increasing biogas penetration, in combination with programmes like the one mentioned above, there are very good perspectives for this technology. TNO, the Dutch Organization for Applied Scientific Research, has started up the Bio-Socket project and is committed to empower poor people by developing sustainable products and services. This project has been running for around three years. It is focused on the effort to provide modern, clean, safe, and decentralized energy to the poorest people in developing countries. The technology seeks a solution to address the need for energy access in rural areas together with the problem of possible harmful emissions caused by an access of biogas. Therefore TNO developed an innovative technology called ‘the Biogas Socket’, which can transfer leftovers of biogas into electricity on a small scale. Consequently users of biogas household systems will not only to be able to cook with the produced biogas but they will also have access to low voltage electricity. They can use this electricity for lighting purposes, radio, charging mobile phones and other small appliances. For the implementation of the project TNO has teamed up with SNV and the BoP Innovation Center to co-create, develop and launch the Bio-Socket in African and Asian markets. Students from the TU Delft also contributed to the development of the project during some of its stages. TNO has started by developing an initial working prototype at a laboratory scale (TNO Eindhoven) to demonstrate the working principle. The next step was to find some possible partners with support from SNV, the local expert. They visited them, exchanged knowledge and gave demonstrations of the technology. Later TNO decided with whom (Rwandan Local Consortium) to partner up for further development and production of a local prototype that must be responsive to the real needs and conditions of the community. The main objective of the Bio-Socket project is the production of electricity out of biogas from biodigesters. TNO in collaboration with SNV and the BoP Innovation Center have been working mainly on developing an initial working prototype at a laboratory scale. The prototype has been designed and developed in TNO ?s laboratory in Eindhoven, with a focus on mainly technological aspects. In this next stage, the prototype that is still a proof of principle must be transferred for its further development, experimentation, design optimization and production. In this case to Rwanda, to assure that it will be responsive to the user and context needs and validate possibilities for local development and production. The general aims of this project are four folded. Firstly, to propose a comprehensive research protocol for early stages of product and business development on ¨how to translate, develop, test and evaluate technical innovations into developing countries¨. Secondly, to investigate opportunities for local or non-local development and production. Thirdly, to identify and describe the potential target group and accordingly provide suggestions for changes in the product (service) system to fit their needs. And finally to propose a business model that leads to a successful market introduction of the Bio-Socket in Rwanda. The strategic design perspective will support TNO to understand developing, production and market possibilities and challenges for the Bio-Socket in Rwanda, as well as to give a first approach for a business plan which target would be the BoP consumers in Rwanda. In order to develop this business plan it is necessary to answer the following research questions: 1. How can TNO transfer technical innovations to be developed, tested and produced by partners (developers and manufacturers) in developing countries? 2. How are the production infrastructure facilities and what are the capabilities of local producers? 3. What is the viability and are the market opportunities for the Bio-Socket in Rwanda?","BoP; biogas; energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Strategic Product Design","",""

I performed a literature research to find out more about game design and computer vision methods. Some subjects covered were the psychological background of pranks and social games. My technology research focused on varieties of computer vision to be able to recognise players in uploaded photos. Furthermore, I used the outcomes of a context mapping session with four potential users to develop an interaction vision and define requirements for a successful game. My main conclusions were that social gameplay especially was a major opportunity to include in my game, and that many different computer vision methods have different benefits and disadvantages that should be further explored before incorporating one in my design. This exploration was executed using an evolutionary design method and a design framework based on several elements of game design. Brainstorming sessions and a morphological chart led to game mechanisms that explored the idea scenarios regarding social play and the fulfilment of quests, and a technological development based on QR codes and face recognition. The final design combined both idea scenarios by offering social quests, and used face recognition as identification method. The game was developed and explained in more detail using the game design framework and various diagrams: a function diagram explaining the input, output, and processes of player, website, and servers; and a system diagram to connect the functions and interactions to form a player-friendly interface. Because of technological limitations regarding player identification found in the game development, the final user test focused on the gameplay and user experience compared to my vision and expectations. I tested the enjoyment level, balance, player retention, and tourist reactions. I found that my test persons were reluctant to cross social boundaries for more elaborate photo-bombing quests. They felt that, in theory, the game sounded like an amazing way to spend some spare time on holiday, almost like a treasure hunt. In practice, however, they hardly got round to playing it. My final recommendations were to review the choice of a broad target group and to pay a lot of attention to the implementation of the game, so it becomes socially accepted. More importantly, the success of the game depends heavily on future computer vision developments: as it stands right now, the methods I explored are not reliable enough.","photobombing; computer vision; web application","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2012","Pairtrading is een financieel instrument waarvan beurshandelaren gebruik kunnen maken. Dit instrument kenmerkt zich door het openen of het sluiten van een aandelenpositie waarbij een tweetal aandelentransacties tegelijkertijd worden uitgevoerd. Deze transacties zijn tegengesteld in die zin dat het ene aandeel wordt gekocht en het (equivalent van het) andere aandeel wordt verkocht. In dit bacheloreindwerk doen we verslag van ons onderzoek naar de vraag of het mogelijk is om voor beurshandelaren een strategie te ontwikkelen waarmee zij met behulp van pairtrading winsten kunnen realiseren. Om deze vraag te beantwoorden hebben we een wiskundig model ontwikkeld. Dit model hebben we gebaseerd op de zogenoemde Brownse brug omdat deze brug bepaalde eigenschappen heeft die vergelijkbaar zijn met de verschilkoers van pairtrading. Vervolgens hebben we uit dit model een strategie afgeleid. Deze strategie hebben we tenslotte met beursdata getest. Bij de verificatietesten van ons model zijn we ervan uitgegaan dat de diverse essenti¨ele aannamen geldig zijn. Deze testen wijzen uit dat ons model goed werkt. Dat betekent dat onze strategie kan worden toegepast. Bij de validatietesten van ons model echter mogen we er a priori niet vanuit gaan dat deze aannamen geldig zijn. Die geldigheid moeten we - middels verantwoorde testen - vaststellen. Daarin zijn wel onvoldoende geslaagd. Daaruit mogen we echter niet de conclusie trekken dat deze aannamen niet geldig zijn. We hebben ze immers in overleg zorgvuldig en met overtuiging gekozen. Toch brengt die onzekerheid mee dat ons model en onze strategie nog niet succesvol door beurshandelaren kunnen worden ingezet. Daartoe zouden we methoden moeten ontwikkelen waarmee we onze aannamen kunnen testen op hun geldigheid. Daarnaast zouden we ook gebruik moeten kunnen maken van meer gecoïntegreerde paren. Tevens zouden we in staat moeten zijn over een langere periode testen uit te voeren. Tenslotte zouden we de schattingen van de variabelen a, ?, ?0 en ?1, moeten verbeteren.

(mentor); Zadpoor, A. (mentor)","2012","The elastic strain limit of the tendon appears to be an omnipresent parameter in the literature in many of the problems described related to its pathologic conditions, which are often related to the repetitive loading tendons undergo during life. In other words, the study of the fatigue resistance of the tendons may provide information about the etiology of these pathologies. The elastic strain limit corresponds to the point after which micro-damage in the tendon starts. Thus, the prediction of this limit and its use in the design of fatigue loading protocols, may benefit the understanding of the onset and evolution of damage which is intimately related to the repair capacity of the cells. The variability of the elastic strain limit between different individuals makes it difficult to choose the applied load in these tests. This thesis shows a possible approach to predict the elastic strain limit based on a point-wise comparison of the sample’s stress- strain curve to a set of N number of failure curves from a database that was constructed for this purpose. The accuracy of the method proved to be statistically significantly (p <0.05) higher than other methods that were evaluated. It was also shown that it could be applied to predict the elastic strain limit of other species such as the horse’s superficial digital flexor tendon which together to the human Achilles tendon are the most injured between species. The main advantage of this method is that the higher accuracy comes along with a certainty that every prediction will be carried out, in contrast to other methods where some obstacles may render missing predictions. Finally, the smallest strain percentage up to which the sample’s stress-strain curve was used for the prediction, proved to be sufficient for obtaining similar accuracy as that with the highest strain percentage tested, with the only requirement of a moderately higher number of failure curves against to which it should be compared.","elastic limit; tendon","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-11-22","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

The construction of the experimental setup include modifications to the acquired rheometer to obtain reliable batch rheology measurements within the typical viscosity range of a shear-thinning drilling fluid ([0.02-0.15]Pas). A model-based control approach is taken to control the drilling fluid pH. With help of a static model we have defined a new scaling method which enables us to get an estimate of the required control fluid to shift the pH up to a mud volume of 32L. Implementation of the model shows that the pH can be maintained within the desired operating window if the quantity of control fluid is adjusted properly. The right quantity of control fluid is achieved by adjusting the estimated quantity of control fluid with help of a tuning parameter a. Results of this thesis show that to be able to control the pH at rig-scale, which is a dynamic process, closed-loop pH control based on the flux in and out of the mud tank should be implemented. The closed-loop pH control utilizes two pH sensors, the new scaling method and the signal from the Coriolis flow meter to add the right quantity of control fluid to stabilize the pH of the drilling fluid into the well. Based on the results that show the advantages of measuring both incoming and outgoing fluid properties at the active mud tank, a twin skid construction for rig-scale implementation is proposed. ?","pH; control; fluid; drilling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-08-20","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

The reason behind this is that, unfortunately, the power coefficient obtained at the rated wind speed is all but constant. The combination of low wind speeds and the small scale of the device leads to very low Reynolds numbers; well in the order of < 105. The lift production and stall behavior of the airfoils aggravates in these conditions, with low starting torque as a result. The design case revolved around Turby – a small 1.6 kW, 2.20 m diameter vawt with a projected cut-in wind speed of 3 m/s.

(mentor)","2012","Light is attenuated by materials present in the water column by scattering and absorption. The knowledge of light attenuation and its contributing factors influencing visibility/turbidity is unknown in Singapore waters. This MSc thesis consists of field measurement, laboratory experiment and numerical modelling in 3 parts; parameterisation of light attenuation coefficient? K?_d, numerical modelling of underwater light field and visibility. The objectives of this thesis are; a) to determine the dynamics of optical properties in Singapore waters, b) to investigate factors contributing to light attenuation in Singapore waters and c) to model underwater light field and visibility using Hydrolight and Delft3D WAQ. This first part addresses the dynamics of light attenuation (in relation to low/high tide), the spectral nature of optically significant constituents (water, CDOM, phytoplankton and sediment) as well as the effects of particle size distribution (PSD) to light scattering. For PSD with a higher slope j in N(D) = ?KD?^(-j), the d50 ranges from 7.11 to 9.90 ?m in Singapore Strait representing sediment dominated environment. Higher TSS during low tide is advection dominated while lower TSS during high tide is suspension dominated. Relative contributions of CDOM, chlorophyll and sediment to light attenuation coefficient? K?_d is 1.4 – 6.5 % (average of 3.3 %), 1.3 – 62 % (average of 24 %) and 31.3 – 95.2 % (average of 70 %) respectively. Four (4) empirical equations to predict ? K?_d was developed depending on its optical and physical characteristics. Underwater light field modelling shows that light attenuation depend mostly on the concentration of optically significant constituents and only weakly dependent on light structure, cloud cover and fluorescence. The modelled ? K?_d from Hydrolight ranges from 1.2 to 2.3 m-1 with lower ? K?_d in chlorophyll dominated waters while the empirical estimations underestimate K_(d(PAR)) compared to the modelled ? K?_d from Hydrolight. The modelled Secchi depth, S_d ranges from 0.6 – 1.4m corresponding to euphotic depth z_eu of 2.0 – 3.8 m with deeper z_eu for chlorophyll dominated waters. The modelled visibility is generally lowest during Northeast (NE) followed by Southwest (SW) monsoon and Inter monsoon (IM) period with evidence of spatial homogeneity for all monsoons. The visibility model reproduces the recorded? S?_d reasonably well except for Johor Strait and sheltered areas in WCP due to the fact that some processes are not unaccounted in the model. The ? K?_d variation coincides with SSC variation with no phase difference; the visibility is lowest during spring low tide and highest during neap high tide. Convective interaction between the diurnal and semidiurnal components is important in offshore locations while the non-linearity of tidal propagation contributes in the shallow water of Johor estuary. The residual turbidity in Singapore waters is due to tides (semi diurnal and diurnal spring neap interactions) and non-tides (monsoonal effect) in approximately equal magnitude during monsoons. The results from this thesis are applicable in coastal engineering, ecological and remote sensing.","sediment dynamics; optical properties; water quality model; visibility; turbidity","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-12-11","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Aprile, W.A. (mentor)","2012","Sanitation is a taken for granted theme in most of the Western Country, but it is a serious issue nowadays. We can count on modern water supply systems and efficient sewage systems but only few of us know what is happening in remote areas of the underdeveloped countries. Sanitation is a central matter for people living in rural areas, where the scarcity of water and sanitary facilities afflicts millions people. The contact with fresh faeces kills every years millions of people worldwide. Especially for a country like Bolivia, in which almost half of the population lives in rural areas, lack of sanitation is one of the first causes of people’s death. Those communities are marginalized and lack of the most basic services, above all health care. Indigenous people living in these areas are exposed to a number of diseases connected to their improper daily sanitary practice; the unhealthiest one is the open defecation. Those people usually live with 10 dollars a month, so they cannot afford a personal sanitary facility. The ethnic fragmentation of Bolivian population does not help to solve this problem even if every population has an ethnic organization that provides them help. Despite the effort of their organizations, the Bolivian Government and the NGOs present in the field, the current situation is far to be under control. Solutions like pit or VIP latrine do not reach all the family of the community and they are polluting the ground. Other more environmental friendly solution have been tried in the past years, (such as dehydration toilet made out of concrete), but they are too expensive and the construction requires time. These were the reason why rural Bolivia extremely needs a new solution on this side. The goal of this graduation is to give to people living in Bolivian rural communities a safe alternative to open defecation. This project was run in collaboration with an important Bolivian company: Plaxburg S.R.L. Plaxburg is a growing and dynamic company focused on the production of plastic containers of all dimensions and for every use (especially for water), industrial reservoirs, waste containers and plastic roofs. They are leaders of the market and they want to enlarge their selling with an innovative new product suitable for their production line and able to solve the sanitary need of the Bolivian population. The starting point of the project was a deep literature research conducted in the Netherlands, in order to gain preliminary information about the country and the rural situation. In this part of the process the designer created a set of Research Questions and techniques to be tested and run with the people living in Bolivian communities. All the people range, ages and genders were taken into account in order to make the future product suitable for the entire community. In order to reach a solution to the above-mentioned problems, a user and context research was conducted in the Bolivian Chaco, one of the poorest parts of the country. Here the ethnic group of Guaraní people struggle to live in a very difficult environment. During the research the designer received help from the mission of Padre Tarcisio (an Italian priest) and from Dr. Fabio Ammar an NGO operator working for OXFAM Italia on health care with local people. Thanks to their help it was possible to gain rich information about users’ need and expectations as well as the social/environmental context. It was also possible to understand which relationship they have with the sanitary products and what is their perception about personal hygiene. The research pictured a situation in which people are aware about the importance of having a personal sanitary facility but they can not afford it. The communities are quite often far from the cities and the connections are not adequate. The only basic supply they have is the water system, which is quite vulnerable against the environment. As matter of fact entire community can remain isolated because of a rainy day. So the most important problem is the lack of water supply (as well as the absence of electricity and sewage system). The designer understood also the dynamics inside the rural communities: the average of family members, materials available, distance of the houses and social status of the people. With these data gathered was possible to have a complete overview of the current situation and to visualize the Future Scenario and the Design Goal. After that the designer involved part of the major stakeholders into the Idea Generation through a Brainstorming session. The participants were: the NGO operator (representing the point o view of the people working directly with the communities), the manager of the company (for the financial part) and the engineer of the company (manufacturing part). On the basis of the data obtained from the Brainstorming, the information from the research the designer was able to come up with three concepts. These concepts were previously evaluated with the Company mentor and the NGO operator. From these three concepts, they selected the one that was fulfilling the needs of the users as well as the requirement of the company. The last design is a prefabricated polyethylene double-vault toilet, working with dehydration system with urine diversion and an inner switching system. The faeces will drop directly into one of the two vaults and a switching system under the toilet sit will enable the user to easily switch the chamber when one is full. A solar heater will increase the dehydration process. The product is meant to be integrated inside a house or for a separated cabin. Since it is prefabricated it can easily reach the communities and be mounted rapidly. The system is half grounded instead of being totally grounded in order to facilitate the extraction of the dried material. The product can be easily manufactured with the current company’s technology. The merchandising strategy has to aim to the organizations that work with them: the ethnic organizations, the NGOs and the local Governments present in the field. Since they manage and receive money from the central Government and from investor abroad, they can invest in this project. To convince them about the necessity of this product in Bolivian rural areas represent a great occasion for Plaxburg to widely sell the new product, in a still untouched market; increasing the selling and helping the communities at the same time.","sanitation; toilet; BoP; rural areas Bolivia; prefabricated","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-11-16","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor); Klein, S. (mentor)","2012","Every year fifteen million infants are born prematurely in the whole world. The maturation of the brain occurs mainly during the third trimester (24-40 weeks of gestational age). Therefore extremely preterm infants (infants born before 25 weeks of gestational age) are vulnerable to brain injuries (perinatal asphyxia and perinatal stroke being the most common) and are more likely to develop behavioral problems, learning disabilities or functional consequences later in life. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has good spatial resolution and soft-tissue contrast, providing a highly detailed anatomical image of the developing brain. Additionaly, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) allows visualization and quantification of the micro-architecture of brain structures in vivo. Abnormal values of diffusion tensor measures in preterm infants can indicate abnormal brain development caused by e.g. haemorrhage. To use MRI and DTI effectively in clinical practice, it is necessary to have an atlas of the neonatal brain, consisting of a structural MRI template segmented in anatomically relevant regions and providing reference values for diffusion parameters in healthy preterms (showing normal development). Most existing atlases either include only a structural MRI template, without DTI information, or, when they do include a DTI atlas, they are based on term infants rather than preterm infants. Therefore, we conclude that there is no atlas that can be used as a reference for the diffusion parameters in the preterm developing brain. We constructed an atlas consiting of a structural template and a diffusion template encoding mean and standard deviation of DTI parameters in a population of healthy preterms. The method to construct such a template is explained. For the construction of the structural template we performed intersubject pair-wise image registration and for the construction of the diffusion template intra-subject registration was additionally used. Image registration depends on several settings and parameters. Those parameters were optimized to minimize registration errors. Manual segmentation is used to segment several areas of the brain, to allow for region-based analysis. In addition, we present an example of how the template can be used in clinical practice. The parameter optimization was performed using 9 preterm infants without evidence of focal lesions on conventional magnetic resonance imaging. The template is based on 19 preterm infants without evident brain abnormalities. An independent set of 16 premature born infants (12 with evident abnormalities and 4 without evident abnormalities) is used for evaluation. Based on the results, we conclude that the proposed interactive atlas of diffusion MR parameters may aid in early recognition of subjects with a high risk of abnormal development.","atlas; preterm; diffusion; brain","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-02-15","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

(mentor); Guo, X.T. (mentor)","2012","Microblog service has been becoming popular all over the world. The number of people owning a microblog account has been exponentially increasing during the last few years. With the development of microblog, more and more enterprises, media and political organizations open the microblog accounts. They make full use of the microblog platform to promote the new products or political opinions. Identifying the influencers can help them target the specific users. Though much research has been done about quantifying the user influence in Twitter, there is little research in Sina Weibo, which is the most popular microblog in China. Based on this scene, we formulate our research question as follows: What approach can be used to quantify the user influence so as to identify the top influential users in Sina Weibo, according to the features of users’ behaviours in Sina Weibo? In this thesis we define the influence as the potential to disproportionately impact the likelihood that information will spread broadly in a certain social circle by influencing others to engage in further action. According to the classification of the further actions, we get two kinds of influence: conversation based influence and content based influence. Firstly, we moved the existing methods in Twitter, PageRank and SNA, into Sina Weibo directly. However, these methods have many shortcomings. It is mainly because that this kind of methods only considered the following relationships. However, in Sina Weibo, the limitation for the number of followers for ordinary users and the privilege for the special users cause that the users without the privilege cannot get a higher rank. Besides, in Sina Weibo, there are a huge number of users, especially the media and celebrities, who own a great number of followers, but seldom contact with them. Thus only the following relationship is not sufficient in Sina Weibo to quantify the users’ influence. Secondly, through the detailed analysis of the users’ behaviours and the correlation analysis for the various indicators in Sina Weibo, we found the users are used to limiting their conversations into the sparse friend network, in which they post mentions rather than retweets. Thus for the conversation based network, we can research the sparse friend network and mention actions. In contract, for the content based influence, the dense follow network and retweet actions are used to quantify the users influence. Then, based on the former analysis, we put forward an improved algorithm “ObjectRank” to quantify the users’ influence, in which both the relationship and the actions (retweet and mention) are considered. The experiments prove that the ObjectRank outperforms both PageRank and FollowNum in that only follow relations are considered.

Finally, the influencers in a certain field are not necessary to own a high influence in another field. Besides, generally speaking, the users tend to find the top influencers in a certain field, such as media field, sports media or NLP research field.

This event was previously seen as a 1 in a 100 year event by the authorities. These conditions, however, are calculated to have a return period of about 20 years instead, which increases the urgency of this project. Meanwhile no precautions are taken whatsoever. The objective of this research is to provide an adequate strategy, to avoid floods as previously happened in 2006. An extensive data analysis on discharge volumes is carried out. With this analysis and bathymetrical data of the river bed, a model is built in HEC-RAS in order to study the behaviour of the river and its reaction on different measures. Increasing the levee height for different locations of the area, which is indicated by the local authorities as undesired, appears inevitable. Use of the hydropower dam reservoirs upstream of Concepción as a buffer for flood waves and lowering of the roughness of the floodplains by cutting vegetation may reduce the design height of the levees. These measures are economically favourable and technically realizable; a significant risk reduction can be accomplished with their implementation.","flood; defense; Chile; Concepción; Concepcion; biobio; river; strategy","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","-36.7845117, -73.0755753"

(mentor); Kuipers, H. (mentor); Van den Berg-Weitzel, L. (mentor)","2012","This report describes a graduation project for the master programme Integrated Product Design of the faculty Industrial Design Engineering of Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands. The report describes a research concerning the influence of buyers’ gender differences on appealing packaging design and a redesign of whisky bottles based on the results of research. This project was conducted for CARTILS, a branding and packaging design consultancy with offices close to Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and in London, England. Starting point The reason for this project was a publication with the fact that women are responsible for 80% of the purchase decisions in the western world (Nummerdor, 2011). CARTILS wondered, “How should spirits packaging design be adapted to convince these female buyers?” Findings At the start of the project the context of the project was explored. The focus on marketing aspects of packaging, and differences between genders were explained. An online questionnaire was held to explore the consumer context. The outcomes showed that packaging design plays an important role in purchase decisions, when a consumer stands clueless in the store, without a servant to give advice. A small research showed that in the case of spirits, the purchase decisions are almost equally divided between men and women. Hence, it became relevant to focus on the differences in appealing packaging design between genders, instead of solely focussing on the feminine aspect. Another relevant question rose: should the packaging design be adapted to the buyer’s gender, when the buyer’s and the consumer’s gender are not similar? Taken into account was the probable outcome that the purchase decision are almost equally divided between genders. In literature was found that a product appeals to a consumer when the product personality matches the self-concept of the consumer. The product personality is based on evaluation of aesthetics. In case the buyer is not the final consumer, it is unclear to what buyer matches the product personality. Proposed is that the buyer matches the product personality to the ideal personification of the product concept, named the prototypical product personality. It has been researched whether the ideal personifications of gender specific products differ between men and women. This was done by discussing a masculine spirit category (whisky) and a feminine spirit category (cream liqueur) in gender specific focus groups. Clear differences in the prototypical product personality appeared between genders, while the stereotypical consumers were comparable. Both the male and female personifications of whisky were translated into three bottles of The Famous Grouse brand, varying in strength of expressing the personification. The designed packages were used in testing whether the difference in product personality was reflected in the buying decision. The results of the test could not indicate significant relations between gender and the purchase decision based on packaging design. Neither a relation could be found between the expressed personifications and purchase decision in general. Limitations A number of limitations need to be taken into account regarding the presented study. The study is conducted with the typical masculine spirit whisky, from which the packaging design generally is not a key element in the purchase decision. Secondly, one should always take into account the consistency controversy (Liska, 1975) stating a discrepancy between what people say and their actual acting. Thirdly, the participants of the research were relatively young; more than half of the participants was aged between 18 and 25, almost a fifth was aged between 26 and 35. Fourthly, the discussions were lead by a female facilitator. This might have influenced the outcomes, since genders do react and communicate differently compared to a situation wherein the opposite gender is present. Finally, apparently cream liqueur is not popular among the chosen focus groups. The image of cream liqueur was clearly less strong compared to whisky’s image. This makes the prototypical product personalities described in this report for whisky more reliable than for cream liqueur. Implications CARTILS is advised not to consider gender differences between the buyer and the actual consumer. They could better continue focussing on reflecting the actual consumer’s personality to make the package appealing, until research shows new factors affecting the purchase choice based on packaging. For similar research, is advised to conduct multiple focus groups per variable. Next to that is advised to simulate a more realistic situation in either an online questionnaire or real life. This would request a higher amount of participants Designers, who want to represent a personality in their design, are advised to translate the personality into design terms and create inspirational collages based on these. The collages help to create a common understanding among people. This is useful for discussing the designs with colleagues. And since the design terms are not one-to-one translatable into design, advised is to first explore widely the directions, before choosing a basis design with boundaries to elaborate. Recommendations Recommended for further research is to conduct a similar test to research the effect in purchase decision of these differences on a typical feminine spirit. Next to that, advised is to research in what way the gender differences in prototypical product personalities are reflected in purchase decisions, taking into account it might not have significant effect.","gender differences; whisky bottles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

In order to be able to cover this stimulation voltage range the converter needs to convert the 3.3V battery voltage up to a variable output voltage with a maximum voltage of 18V. This needs to be done with a power efficiency of at least 80%. Also the converter must not be sensitive to input/output variations and temperature changes.

Also the controller circuit is designed so that the converter works always in the discontinuous current mode.

The plan set goals to reclaim 21 areas in the Jiangsu coastal zone with main objective to achieve an economical impulse for the Jiangsu province. The Tiaozini reclamation acted as a pilot project and was assigned a priority area due to its size and strategic position between Lianyungang and Shanghai. The proposed occupation guidelines for Tiaozini hardly met the objective of giving an economical impulse and revision of the area was required. The northern part of Tiaozini was still under construction and was further assessed in this study. The Dutch layer approach was explicitly used as an analyzing tool to make a top-down preliminary design for the Tiaozini port area using Dutch norms and standards. This tool allowed the study to be divided in three conditioning layers; occupation, network and base layer allowed for a multidisciplinary and iterative process. The most suitable occupation was determined using macroeconomic, industry-specific and port analysis. Due to the favorable investment climate ensuring future potential, lack of competitors and presence of partners, an efficiently organized public-private petrochemical port area was determined as preliminary occupation for the northern part of Tiaozini. The supporting transport network should take the following criteria into account: modal split, flexibility, sustainability and capacity. These criteria were determined by the characteristics of the petrochemical industry. The connection between the network and base layer was made by the use of the main enabling road connection. The embankment settlement for the required six-lane highway was calculated using D-Settlement numerical program in combination with NEN-Bjerrum calculation method and checked using analytical NEN-Koppejan method. A 4.5m high surcharge preload in combination with vertical drains was required for six months in order to fulfill the residual settlement requirements. PLAXIS was used to evaluate the stability of the newly designed dike with a design return period of 1.000 years, allowing safety for the petrochemical port area. With a safety factor of 1.8 leading to multiple simultaneous slip surfaces, the new dike design is capable of ensuring safety for the petrochemical port area.

As the central part of ‘ParkStad’ in South Limburg, Heerlen is a city developed on the basis of mining industry which has witnessed the prosperity and decline of the Dutch mining industry. The city is going through a depression since the mining industry was over. The project aims at reactivating the post-industrial city with an approach of landscape, which deals with both of recalling the old energy landscape as identity of the city and creating new energy landscape. To achieve this goal, the infrastructure lines will be used as a design instrument not only to invite people to perceive the new landscape, but also to work as the new structure for urban development. Thus, new life will be injected to the city with a new green heart transformed from an integration of the post-industrial sites, existing landscape and shrinking area.","landscape and renewable energy; landscape of infrastructure; urban network; shrinking city","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-12-06","Architecture","Landscape Architecture","","Energy landscape","",""

(mentor); Kok, M. (mentor); Van der Meer, M.T. (mentor); Wojciechowska, K. (mentor)","2012","Introduction The popularity of monitoring dikes with sensor techniques is rising. It is claimed that sensor techniques lead to significant cost savings and can predict an upcoming dike collapse. But a technical foundation to use the sensor monitoring information in flood safety assessment is lacking. This research investigates the contribution of sensor monitoring information to flood safety and the cost-effectiveness of sensor monitoring. Sensor techniques have been tested in full-scale dike failure experiments at the IJkdijk, trying to predict an upcoming dike collapse. The sensor techniques are capable of monitoring deformation, temperature, water pressure, vibrations and moisture. The state of the sensor techniques is doubtful due to subjective analyses, controlled test conditions and a wide variety in failure prediction times: from 1,5 to 102 hours. Implementation of sensor information Water pressure is the only variable that constitutes an input for dike safety assessment models. Monitoring water pressures affects the epistemic uncertainty of the water pressure schematization which is caused by the translation from the hydraulic load to water pressures. One must be aware that sensor monitoring either leads to an increased assessment of flood safety if the prior schematization turns out to be done conservatively or a decrease in flood safety if the prior schematization turns out too optimistic. One would expect an increased assessed flood safety due the intended conservative approach. But prior schematization mistakes imply a decreased assessed flood safety. Moreover, monitoring water pressures has minimum impact on the flood safety assessment if other uncertainty aspects dominate the stability assessment. A case study of the canal of Nauerna denotes that the water pressure has resulted in a higher assessed flood safety, but the uncertainties regarding the soil conditions dominate the stability assessment. However, sensor monitoring on itself does not affect the real flood safety: only physical measures affect the real risk of flooding. Important information is obtained from monitoring high water events such that water pressure models can be calibrated to determine design loading conditions for the periodic safety assessment. Also, an additional application is to identify unforeseen risks. Cost-benefit analysis Conceptual cost-benefit models have been set up to determine the cost-effectiveness of sensor monitoring over the long-term. The monitoring costs consist of installation, maintenance and operational costs. The benefit from permanent dike reinforcements is gained from specifying the long-term optimal investment strategy based on the minimum sum of flood risk and reinforcements costs. The monitoring information from relevant high water events affects the assessed flooding probability. If the sensor monitoring reduces the assessed flooding probability, the assessed flood risk lowers and savings on permanent dike reinforcements. If a higher flooding probability is obtained by sensor monitoring, this financially leads to additional investments and negative benefits. But the value of knowing this higher flood risk is rationally beneficial. The benefit from temporary measures is gained from timely execution of emergency measures based on the early warning of the sensor system. This benefit depends on the prediction time of the sensor monitoring system and the reaction time to execute the emergency measure. Additional costs for executing the emergency measure must be incorporated. The cost-benefit models have been worked out in case studies for dike-ring 48 and 14. Conclusion The conclusion of this research is that sensor monitoring can be implemented in the flood safety, by specifying dike reinforcements in both the periodic safety assessment, as well as the operational situation. However, the investments in sensor monitoring have to be made while a long waiting time is expected before benefits turn out. Then these benefits can financially be disappointing, but do have a certain value of information.","sensor monitoring; cost-benefit analysis; macro instability; flood risk; probabilistic design; flood defence","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-11-09","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Structures & Flood Risk","",""

Urban flooding has become more frequent due to a number of factors including climate change, urban growth and an increase in paved surfaces. Pluvial flooding results from heavy rainfall when water that does not infiltrate into the ground ponds in hollows or flows over the ground. In flood damage estimation, the concept of damage curves or damage functions is applied. Such functions give the building damage due to inundation. Most damage assessment models have in common that the direct monetary damage is obtained from the type of the element at risk and the inundation depth. Problem definition Flood damage assessment models do not focus solely on pluvial flood damage estimation. In addition, the existing flood damage models and developed depth-damage curves have not been tested for application of pluvial flood events. Research This study is carried out with the main objective to test the flood damage assessment model HOWAD-PREVENT in a case study in Rotterdam and to evaluate the uncertainty and sensitivity of this model.

As one of the major tasks in the project, to explore possibilities for new energy has been taken into consideration, which makes the area as a test field for the graduation lab of energy landscape. South Limburg is the Dutch part in region of Green metropolis which gathers all of the mining sites in Netherlands. As the central part of ‘ParkStad’ in South Limburg, Heerlen is a city developed on the basis of mining industry which has witnessed the prosperity and decline of the Dutch mining industry. The city is going through a depression since the mining industry was over. The project aims at reactivating the post-industrial city with an approach of landscape, which deals with both of recalling the old energy landscape as identity of the city and creating new energy landscape. To achieve this goal, the infrastructure lines will be used as a design instrument not only to invite people to perceive the new landscape, but also to work as the new structure for urban development. Thus, new life will be injected to the city with a new green heart transformed from an integration of the post-industrial sites, existing landscape and shrinking area.","Landscape and renewable energy; Landscape of infrastructure; Urban network; Shrinking city","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-12-10","Architecture","Landscape Architecture","","Energy landscape","",""

To improve a structure’s (short-time) response to thermal loading the cooling layout can be modified, but this problem is not suitable for traditional optimising techniques. Thermal modes can be used to describe the transient response of a structure to an applied heat load analogous to responses to mechanical structures in structural dynamics. In this work, new measures for the significance of thermal modes to the optimisation problem have been identified. These measures are useful indicators in modal reduction techniques and for the optimisation algorithm. The information hidden in thermal modes has shown great potential in a newly developed heuristic sensitivity analysis worthy of further research.","thermal modes; optimisation; transient; eigen-sensitivities; modal analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-12-07","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

Since sustainability can not be confined and even more so the future interpretation of sustainability is entirely unknown, this design proposal focuses on the integration of environmental resources in the architectural appearance of the building. This will always be relevant as well that it increases the observers awareness and will lead to a gradual change of attitude with regard sustainability. An environmental approach has a significant effect of the aesthetics and functionality of the building. The building is optimized towards the sun positions in summer and winter, the prevalent wind directions in winter and summer, daylighting conditions and natural ventilation. Furthermore the building employs environmental resources (passively and actively), using wind turbines, algae cultivation, thermal solar panels, hydro storage, PV cells, river heat rejection and solar chimneys, which all have a determining effect on the appearance of the building. The extraordinary interior derives from the four themed towers (wind, algae, solar, hydro). Due to the slender tower, and small footprint, vertical chained spaces emerge, making use of the concept of the spiral: Vertical auditoria, vertical library and vertical offices, all are chained belong to the same space using spiraling ramps. The outline of the towers is visible in all interior spaces, occupying a significant factor is the atmosphere in the towers, making one feel the part of the tower. In the public hall, the encounters between various user groups occur. Spaces for short stay are created to stimulate encounters and lobby. With the coulisse-effect of the column one can withdraw oneself from the openness of the hall to a more secluded space, while still be part of the hall full of activities. The natural obstacle of height is used to separate several occupancy paces of various user groups. This allows for a very transparent organization, and signifies the accessibility. The construction of the hall, (north truss and roof beams are determinant) for the atmosphere in the hall. The rotation of the roof beam derives from the tower shape. The presence of the towers and the significance these bear can be felt throughout the whole interior, but also at the exterior of the building.","SADD; sustainability; UNEC; United Nations; environmental resources; building integrated sustainability; towers","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-11-24","Architecture","Materialisation","","Strategic Architectural Design Development","",""

Almost all crematoria build in the Netherlands are situated outside the borders of the city it belongs to, losing the connection with its city. In an era of urbanisation, cities grow stronger and the relation between the individual and the city too. Some people are born and raised in a city, they live there their entire lives, work there, find love, build a home and eventually pass away in that same city. The city has become an inextricably part of their life. Being such an important element, this relation with the city should therefore not be evaded, but it should be embraced, even in the parting. ‘Het Stenen Hoofd’ is a crematorium in the heart of the city of Amsterdam, placed in the river ‘t IJ next to an outstretched vacant lot. Originating from the end of the 19th century, this place breaths out memories. Isolated by water of constant movement, it has become a place for remembrance. Strengthened by remembrance, the place for mourning is set in the water. Like a memorial stone it appears to rise from the water and emphasizes the movement towards the sky. The building reaches a height of 126 meters and consists of a parking space, an entrance hall, a columbarium and a crematorium, located on the upper levels. Reaching for the top, the sounds dominating the ground floor gradually exchange their life for an environment in which peace is undisturbed. Standing high above ground, the green peripheral view is now an urban view over the city that extends towards the horizon.","crematorium; Amsterdam; Stenen Hoofd; ExploreLab; mourning; remembrance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-02-22","Architecture","Architecture","","Explorelab","",""

Het rapport vangt aan met de opzet van het afstuderen en verloopt volgens het stramien van het houden van een literatuuronderzoek, het onderzoeken van casestudies, het bepalen van de conclusies en het geven van aanbevelingen voor toekomstig onderzoek. Onderdeel van het onderzoek was het vinden van factoren waar de waarderingen van bewoners door konden worden bepaald. Vervolgens zijn verschillende energiereducerende installaties en hun waarderingen onderzocht via zowel een literatuurstudie als een casestudie. Bij het onderzoek van de casestudies zijn de betrokken professionals en bewoners geïnterviewd over de installaties en deels de renovatie. Uit de getrokken conclusies blijkt voornamelijk dat het niet de vraag is welke installaties kunnen worden toegepast om te zorgen voor energiereductie, maar dat toepassing afhankelijk is van de omringende factoren. Iedere energiereducerende installatie is toepasbaar in ieder type woning. Het is echter aan de opdrachtgever hoever hij wil gaan met energiereductie, de grootte van de ingreep in de woning en of de toepassing van de installatie in bewoonde staat plaatsvindt. Gesteld kan worden dat de onderzochte energiereducerende installaties verschillen in de reductie van CO2, maar dat veelal een hogere CO2-reductie ook een intensievere installatie kan betekenen voor bewoners. Zo kan een zonnepaneel overlast geven tijdens plaatsing, maar kan deze installatie hoger worden gewaardeerd door bewoners doordat de installatie zich grotendeels op het dak bevindt. Waarderingen van bewoners voor installaties komen voort uit de werking van de installatie en onderdelen van de installatie waarmee een bewoner direct mee te maken heeft, zoals regelbaarheid van de installatie en ruimtebeslag. De waarderingen van bewoners zijn bepaald via gehouden bewonersonderzoeken. Wel bleek dat er niet genoeg bekend was over de waarderingen waardoor deze zijn bepaald via de kennis opgedaan tijdens de literatuurstudie en de casestudies.

(mentor); Zadpoor, A.A. (mentor)","2012","Worldwide yearly 800.000-1.000.000 people receive a total artificial hip. 8-9% Of all patients requires a second surgery to correct the primary arthroplasty. In more than 70% of cases, aseptic loosening is the cause for implant failure. Possible pathways leading to aseptic loosening are stress shielding and micro-motions. Stress shielding can be reduced by less stiff implant material in the susceptible areas and micro-motions can be minimized by a stable fixation in the bone, e.g. due to bone ingrowth into the implant. Three dimensional (3D) printing techniques provide the possibility to combine solid metal with metal foam in one implant. The apparent density (AD) of the foam is in direct relation with the Young’s modulus, so the stiffness of the foam can be tailored with the AD. The printing does entail imperfections in the foam, such as irregular cross-sections of the struts and porosity within the struts. Analytical models are based on the perfectly regular situation and therefore do not satisfy in the prediction of the foam stiffness. A custom-made finite element (FE) modeling tool was developed to generate models of metal foams that do include these irregularities. The struts were all composed of several beam elements to which different cross-section sizes were assigned based on a Gaussian distribution. In addition, porosity within the struts was modelled by assigning a void percentage to the matrix material, which was also Gaussian distributed. In this study, the predicted bulk mechanical properties of models generated with the modeling tool were compared to analytical models and to experimental results in order to validate the FE results. It was shown that FE modeling is a promising method to predict the stiffness of 3D printed metal foams. Especially the stiffness of foams with a low AD was properly predicted by the FE model. Further development is required to optimize the accuracy of the outcome. It is recommended to include non axial alignment of the beam elements. In the future, FE modeling can be used to optimize the geometrical and mechanical properties of patient specific implants.","metal foam; bulk mechanical properties; finite element method; additive manufacturing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-11-08","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

(mentor)","2012","My design of ‘The Hamer’ is aimed at the improvement of the qualities that can be made in the transformation of an industrial area into a mixed working living area. The different actors are: the owners of the land and its properties, the municipality and its responsibility for the public space, the current inhabitants, and of course the possible new inhabitants. In this transformation, I tried to attribute the Hamerstraat area a prominent place on the map of Amsterdam and to provide it with abundant values for the area and its close surroundings by taking a multidisciplinary perspective, integrating insights from architecture and urbanism. In my project, I started out with a pilot study on the location in order to arrive at a well-articulated problem definition. This resulted in the idea to regenerate the old industrial area of the Hamerstraat into a work living community. As a next step, I conducted a problem analysis to define basic principles which would enable me to translate the optimal transformation of the Hamerstraat area into a proposal for urban design and another one for architectural design. By continuously formulating and testing hypotheses, I tried to come up with the design of the region that would give the most suitable answer to the analysis. The design of the Hamer is directed in the first place to improve the accessibility of the whole area. In my plan for urban design, the East- West connections string together the different neighborhoods and the park whereas the North-South connections make the waterfront accessible. The strip can be seen as a place where public programs can be implemented while taking into account the historical morphological structures and monumental buildings and give them new meaning. In this way it integrates the existing industries with possible new developments on the waterfront. My plan for architectural design resulted in the construction of a ROC Plaza with opportunities for student housing and public facilities while focusing on the transformation of urban morphology and changes in building typology.","urban regeneration; industrial area; catalyst","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-11-08","Architecture","Hybrid Building","","","",""

However, at the same time the natural features and materials provided by the territory, conditioned the development of a particular kind of vernacular and rural fabrications.

We moeten zuiniger en effectiever met ons geld en dus ook gebouwen omgaan. Radicaal slopen is in deze tijden niet meer de enige optie. Renovatie en duurzame nieuwbouw heeft de toekomst. Bij duurzaam bouwen wordt echter vaak gedacht aan zonnepanelen of windmolens op de daken, maar het is zoveel meer. Duurzaam bouwen is bouwen voor de toekomst. Ervoor zorgen dat een gebouw niet alleen voldoet aan de huidige vraag, maar ook aan die van de toekomst. Maar hoe kan een gebouw voldoen aan een vraag die nog niet bestaat? Zeker op waardevolle locaties aan het water is het wenselijk om gebouwen te ontwerpen die voor langere tijd kunnen bestaan. Deze locaties waren tot enkele jaren terug alleen bestemd voor scheepsbouwers en andere industrie, maar hun potentieel begint nu ook tot ontwikkelaars door te dringen. Amsterdam-Noord is hier het perfecte voorbeeld van: Wegtrekkende industrie en een goede verbinding met het centrum door zowel autowegen als watertaxi`s. De “Architecture & Dwelling” afstudeerstudio “At home in the city” van de faculteit Bouwkunde in Delft gaf de mogelijkheid een plan te maken voor één van deze waardevolle waterlocaties: Nieuwendammerham. Om deze locatie maximaal te benutten en te kunnen blijven benutten is bouwen voor de toekomst het hoofdthema. Het gebouw moet daarbij ruimte bieden aan functieveranderingen zonder dat daarvoor grote architectonische en constructieve aanpassingen nodig zijn. De maten van één constructieve beuk zijn hierbij bepalend. Deze beuk, ook wel een “pixel” genoemd, is 10 meter diep; 6 meter breed en 6 meter hoog. De pixel kan worden aangevuld met een tussenverdieping; een gang of scheidingswanden wat leidt tot een grote variëteit in indelingen en functiemogelijkheden. De afwerking van de stalen kolommen en liggers dient tevens als leidingschacht. Dit maakt de plaatsing van natte cellen in elk gedeelte van het gebouw mogelijk. Deze visie wordt doorgetrokken in het woningontwerp. Er bestaat geen standaard type woning voor elk soort bewoner. Wij, als architecten, kunnen slechts een geheel ontwerpen waaraan elke bewoner zijn eigen identiteit kan geven. De architect maakt het doek, de bewoner kleurt het in. Toch is de indeling niet volledig vrij te laten. De architect dient de mogelijkheden van zo`n pixel te onderzoeken en de verschillende indelingen daarvan vast te leggen. Eén van de woningtypes bevat een kern en ondersteunende kastenwanden. De kern, met daarin de trap en natte cellen, verdeeld de woning in twee gelijke ruimtes en de ingebrachte tussenvloer zorgt dat dit op de verdieping wordt herhaald. De indeling van de vier ontstane ruimtes wordt vervolgens bepaald door de visie en achtergrond van de bewoner. Bij een ander woningtype zijn de trap en natte cellen in de wanden geïntegreerd, hetgeen een volledig vrij indeelbare plattegrond oplevert. Door deze variatie in pixels kan de architect bepalen in welke mate de invulling van de bewoner meeweegt. Door deze visie lijkt de rol van de architect in de toekomst beperkt. Niets is echter minder waar. Het is onze taak, bijna onze verplichting, een gebouw te ontwerpen dat aansluit op de locatie. Het is tevens onze taak om plaats te bieden aan al die verschillende functies; identiteiten en meningen en toch de eenheid te behouden. Om terug te komen op de beginvraag: Hoe kan een gebouw voldoen aan een vraag die nog niet bestaat? Ontwerp een kader, geef de mogelijkheden weer, en laat de veelzijdigheid en identiteit van de bewoners het invullen, dan maakt het niet uit in welke tijd het gebouw staat!","routing; waterfront; sustainable; flexible; future","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-11-22","Architecture","Architecture & Dwelling","","Gradiation Studio: At home in the city","",""

The objective was to undertake group and fieldwork through a real-world project with an external organization. In association with Laboratoire des Sciences de L'Image Informatique et Teledetection (LSIIT) at the University of Strasbourg, the 2012 GSP explored the impact of 3D geometry complexity on the accuracy of simulating radiative, convective and conductive fluxes in an urban canyon. The research involved the collection of meteorological data near the urban canyon in Strasbourg, France, for input into a model called LAtent, SEnsible, Radiation Fluxes (LASER/F), which simulates the aforementioned fluxes. The preparation of seven geometry scenarios with different complexities was completed and test run in LASER/F. The results were validated with thermal images of two facades collected during the field campaign in Strasbourg. The results show that LASER/F systematically underestimates facade surface temperatures due to various model assumptions. One of those is the oversimplified 1D parametrization of the wind and was demonstrated by comparing it with a vertical wind profile extracted from a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model. Nevertheless, it was concluded that the most complex 3D geometry does not necessarily improve simulation accuracy, especially during warming periods of the day. The inclusion of balconies on the facades is influential and should be used for future simulation experiments when it is a signifcant feature of the facade. Further research is required to better understand canyon geometry effects such as canyon orientation, aspect ratio and the volumetric influence on internal heat storage in buildings.","3D Geometry; Urban heat island; Level of detail; thermal imaging; Geomatics Synthesis Project","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Architecture and The Built Environment","OTB Research Institute for the Built Environment","","Geomatics for the Built Environment","",""

Numerous automatic grading programs, aim- ing to alleviate this problem, have been developed since 1960. These, however, only support fixed programming languages and fixed assessment methods, thus prohibiting their reuse throughout different programming curricula. Educators investigating new grading methods either have to accept the engineering burden of creating a complete grading system or revert to manual grading. This thesis presents LabBack - a reusable automatic grading platform that is extendible with language- and assessment-specific functionality by means of plugins. LabBack provides the necessary infrastructure for building and hosting automatic grading functionality, eliminating the need to consider the issues of scalability and security against malicious programs. LabBack can be hosted in the cloud and provides immediate student feedback. Plugins providing automatic assessment for Scala, JavaScript and C have been implemented and LabBack has been validated in a university-level course with over 100 students.","automatic grading; scalability; cloud; plugin; plugin framework; load distribution; load packing; education; programming education","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","Software Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2012","The invention of the computer opened new research fields in physics and engineering. One of the developments is the Finite Element Method (FEM). It has matured over the last decades, resulting in complex applications with many Degrees Of Freedom (dofs). The large number of dofs made the finite element problems expensive to solve. To make Finite Element Analysis (FEA) less expensive, Model Order Reduction (MOR)-techniques have been developed. These techniques approximate the original full order problem by a system of lower dimension. This is done by writing the displacement field in terms of a set of reduced coordinates. For linear problems, this can considerably reduce the amount of computations required. However, the number of computations for nonlinear problems can not be reduced in the same way. This thesis focusses on a special type of nonlinear problems, namely geometrically nonlinear problems. In general, the internal force of such systems consists of both linear and nonlinear contributions. Whereas the linear contribution can be reduced with the reduced coordinates, the evaluation of the nonlinear term requires the full order displacement field to be known. This forms a bottleneck in the computations in terms of computation time. A solution to the bottleneck of the nonlinear term is found in the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (DEIM). The DEIM is used in combination with a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), yielding the POD-DEIM reduction of the nonlinear part of the internal force. The POD-DEIM reduction approximates the space of the nonlinear part of the internal forces by a POD. The resulting reduced subspace is then interpolated with DEIM. In practice, the POD-DEIM reduction bores down to an approximation of the nonlinear part of the internal force that requires only a few components (dofs) of the nonlinear internal force vector. Using these few components, the remaining components are approximated through interpolation. The advantage of DEIM over other reduction methods that are able to reduce nonlinear terms in systems of equations, is that the DEIM is able to select its components or collocation points from the full set of dofs automatically. This has the advantage that no user input is required in the reduction of the nonlinear finite element model. The DEIM has been tested on several load case examples, using mass-spring systems and geometrically nonlinear bar and beam elements. Two different approaches have been successfully applied to bar elements. The direct approach applies the POD-DEIM reduction directly on the nonlinear term in the system of equations that results from the finite element model. The unassembled approach applies POD-DEIM to the nonlinear terms before the finite element model is assembled. Both methods showed that accurate results can be obtained while using the nonlinear response of only a limited number of dofs. Although the potential of DEIM for geometrically nonlinear finite elements has been shown, some difficulties will have to be overcome before DEIM can be used on general problems. First of all, both the direct and the unassembled approach have some inherent inefficiencies that limit the computational savings. The direct approach generally selects a high number of finite elements, because the selected dofs are often shared by many elements. This problem is solved using the unassembled approach. However, the subspace of unassembled nonlinear internal forces used in the unassembled approach is generally of a high dimension. This makes the POD-DEIM reduction in itself computationally intensive, which is undesired. A second problem is that instability occurred in some of the POD-DEIM reduced responses. The reason for this instability is still unknown, but it is suspected to be related to the fact that the reductions done on the displacement field and the nonlinear part of the internal force are independent and thus have no common optimality criterion. The third important issue involves the application of POD-DEIM on finite elements that describe a combination of different types of internal forces and or moments. Snapshots of these so-called heterogeneous internal forces will have to be weighted before they can be used as an input to the POD.","order reduction; discrete; empirical; interpolation method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-12-07","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Gonçalves, M.G. (mentor); Houssian, A.R. (mentor)","2012","Researchers often obtain rich insights from their studies and generate ideas based on the research results. To keep the project going, it is essential for them to convey the results and ideas to stakeholders insides the organization, but outside their team, for example, the sales people. However, their stakeholders are often sceptical or doubtful based on their professionals or disciplinary experience. It causes difficulties and misunderstandings in communication between the two sides. This graduation project aims to develop a deep understanding of the way that researchers communicate with their stakeholders, which the author approaches via qualitative research. Based on the research results, concepts and prototypes are developed to improve the information sharing between researchers and their stakeholders. This graduation project is supported by The Human Interaction & Experience group at Philips Research in Eindhoven, which provides the opportunities for observations and interviews. The literature study consists of two topics that are essential in this assignment: information sharing and organization stakeholders. Information sharing between different departments brings difficulties to problem solving process, which is identified as knowledge boundary. The knowledge boundary is classified into three levels: syntactic, semantic and pragmatic. Based on the knowledge boundary theory, objects can be designed to assist information sharing between different functions. As to the organization stakeholders, the literature describes three attributes (power, legitimacy and urgency) of stakeholders and RASIC model to identify stakeholders' responsibilities. Furthermore, when this project comes into the design phase, existing examples of workshop design are studied from literature. To obtain an understanding of communication between research team and their stakeholders, the author executed a case study, supported by a research team in Philips. In the case study, the author conducted a client meeting observation and two rounds interviews. Objects from the client meeting to assist information sharing are photographed and used in the second round interviews to facilitate retrospection for participants. The transcriptions from the interviews were analysed and eight infographics were generated to illustrate the case study results. At the same time, insights were extracted and grouped into ""demands"" and ""wishes"", which helped to formulate eight design directions. The author mapped the eight directions according to two axes: relevance to case study insights and access to resources. The direction which was both relevant to the case study results and easy to resource access was selected to be developed further. The design direction is to design a tool to support information transfer by improving the researchers' awareness of stakeholder relationships and the differences between them. The differences exist among expectations, preferences on communication and knowledge backgrounds. At the same time, several design criteria were formulated. Based on the design direction, the author conducted self brainstorming and executed a creative session with a group of students to generate ideas. The ideas were evaluated by three researchers in Philips and generated into four concepts. Then, the concepts were discussed with superiors in Philips and TU Delft and integrated an initial concept. It is described as follows: To improve researchers' awareness of stakeholder relationships, expectation differences, preferences on communication and knowledge backgrounds, a kick-off workshop with three main tasks (structuring, brainstorming and sharing) is developed. Correspondently, three tools (movie, inspiration cards and guidance) are designed to support the workshop. In addition to the initial concept, design criteria at the feasibility aspects were generated. To make the final design more practical, the author involved insights from researchers and clients into the concept, through user-centred iterations. The author developed draft prototypes and evaluated them with about twenty researchers and fived clients through three rounds interviews. After each round, the draft prototypes were upgraded based on the comments from participants. The final design consists of three parts: a stop motion introduction movie to structure the four aspects (stakeholder relationships, preferences on communication, expectation differences, and knowledge backgrounds) in researchers and clients' minds, a set of magnet inspiration cards to assist the their brainstorming and workshop guidance (booklets and video clips) to facilitate the kick-off workshop. The final design was evaluated with a research team in a workshop. The team members watched the introduction movie, selected two topics out of the four and mapped the information out together. The feedback from the evaluation was concluded as suggestions for future development. The design outcomes can be evaluated with several teams in the future, and if the design is proved to be beneficial to team communication, they can be promoted within Philips in the future.","kick-off workshop; communication; project management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

The site is fragmented into 5 sectors; however, in terms of building typology, atmosphere, and culture, it is much more diverse in each of the sections. With the filter of ornamentation as my individual topic, i investigated this strip. ornamentation has a rich historical background in architecture and the impulse of ornamentation not only leads to enhancing the formal and structural qualities, but also fills the need of visual and sensual pleasure, which helps the viewer to communicate with the space. The strip was quite divers in terms of typology, materialisation and ornamentation. as a viewer of the space one not only communicates with the space itself but also with its visual aspect. There are various vectors based on which space can be perceived differently. ornamentation is capable of creating uncommon feelings and impressions due to composing common elements. The combination of ordinary elements of a building such as walls and floor and blocks can be read as an ornament only because of an uncommon combination; ornament is neutral in its language but it is playful in its form. layered and in-between spaces, combination of different fragments, and the relation of different characteristics as the main ideas i took from the mapping led me to the idea of a bridge as an architectural space. This bridge is the combination of different characteristics in one, while itself is positioned as a pause between two spaces, uniting them. The program inside is not fixed and can change based on the needs. Because the variety of the characteristics in architectural aspect, the program also is diverse. In this bridge, everyone can have their own pathway, they can wander around narrow and small spaces inside and explore their own spatial interpretation of the bridge. ?","spatial ornamentation; Canada real","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2014-01-04","Architecture and The Built Environment","Public building","","Border Conditions and territories","",""

(mentor); Rommens, O. (mentor); Schoonderbeek, M. (mentor)","2012","Recording & projecting architecture A project for the city of Rome The research empirically explores the semantic value of images and the potential of image-based communication in respect to new-media culture, computation and to the ongoing process of dematerialization, focusing on how these processes affect current interpretation of the City and imagining possible architectural propositions. Dematerialization is seen here as the current stage of what Martin Heidegger defines in his assay “The Age of the World Picture”, as the modern ambition to measure, quantify and digitalise the world, translating it into its image. The practise of imagining the world is intimately related to the invention of the notion of space as we know it, this word coming from the Greek “stadion”, which generally means “standard measure” and particularly indicates a metrical unit equivalent to 200 meters. The relevance of investigating processes of digitisation and dematerialization in relation to our understandings of the City lays on the one hand in the prominence and proliferation of images which together constitute the multeplical aesthetics of contemporary built environment and, on the other, in the related phenomena of codification, displacement and concealing the driving dynamics and fundamental processes affecting the physical space of the City, which appears unreadable. In the presentation I will consider the polysemous nature of the notion of image, extending its relevance beyond the domain of visuality and considering its similarities with the related notions of imprint, numerical image, record and projection. From a realist perspective, which implies believing the wold as being subsistent autonomously from human interpretation, an image can be defined more generally as any recordings of reality which implies a process of translation of a certain subject or data into its virtual version and corresponds to a degree of detachment from what is recorded. This distance from the subject allows images to be interpreted as an autonomous systems of signs. In the case of Rome`s periphery the interpretative potentials of translation processes and the distance between the City and its image is embodied in Pier Paolo Pasolini`s critical readings over the rhetorical ambition of social progress which guided post-war reconstruction program, expressed through his poetic representation of misery and disillusion in Roman suburbs. Pasolini`s movie trilogy on Rome contributes to construct the shared image of Rome`s periphery and ultimately its actual conditions, and it can be read in turn as part of the cultural context of the City. In that case, the virtual and potential evil and the moral corruption represented in the movies seams to have prevented its realisation. Beside Pasolini`s authorial position, this example shows the interpretative potential of translation processes between different languages, media, dimensions, domains and their effectiveness in manipulating (reverting when necessary) the meaning of the ontological, moral and social reference system underlying a given work. From these considerations, this research investigates the moment of translation between the physical space of Roman peripheries and the virtual space of its image, by means of three photographic devices used for recordings on field as well as conceptual and design instruments. They explore three modalities of imprinting photographic images while addressing different cultural aspects as well as historical stages, which are found to be present in contemporary culture and therefore relevant for interpreting urban conditions. Furthermore the recorders query the distinction between interpretation and automation in the production of contemporary images. The First device is a four pin-holes camera obscura imprinting one multiple image on five projection planes. The pin holes measure 0.55 mm and the focal lenght is 150 mm on the central plane. It outputs one singular set of images, picturing space from four slightly diverging points of view. The optical alchemy of the camera obscura has been understood and noted by Aristotle in the IV century before Christ, and thousand years later it has been used by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti to establishing the mathematical rules of one point perspective. The Second device is a slow-rate dolly camera which shots a split picture pour 7.5 meters. It expresses the logic of mechanical production of images, repetition and linear sequencing picturing urban space in four strips of images by means of two oblique mirrors. The Third device is the simulation of a cinematic walk-through an iconic apartment building in the Tuscolano_II peripheral district. The third recorder addresses the notion of non-linear editing and it is based on a combinatorial matrix that links representation techniques and degrees of privacy in the building. It is meant to be composed by 16 perspective scenographies representing space at different scales and by four webcams. It outputs a four-windows cinematic image which corresponds to as many navigation paths through the building, showing multiple footage of various interior spaces at the same time. It is inspired to certain works of combinatorial literature such as Cent Mille Milliards de Poèmes by Raymond Queneau or The Garden of forking Paths by Jorge Luis Borges. Because of their specific modalities of imprinting the recorders challenge the structural correspondence between recording and recorded object allowing the interpretation of photographic imprint as autonomous flat spaces. The resulting images are seen as Imprint bearers collecting superimposed traces of various photographic imprint. This quality of the recordings has been used as a base for further speculations which aim to represent an inverse process of translation_that from the flat space of the image into architectural space, as being a third dimension in-between image and physical space. This drawing is obtained by extracting the different layers of traces collected on the recordings in a quasi-spatial dimension that shares its qualities with both bi-dimensional and tri-dimensional space. The drawing has been sampled and recombined to explore its formal characteristics which depend by different densities of intersecting, oblique paths composing an intricate field of lines. To summarise: This last phase of the research investigates the re-translation from image to physical space by envisioning a third dimension of becoming between the first two, which is represented through speculative drawing. The notion of imprint bearer has been further interpreted and translated into the architectural idea of a library which collects and expresses in space the image of written culture: a self-writing machine which records the translation of physical books into virtual and numerical images. The conditions of the ongoing process of dematerialization of physical culture lead to a profound redefinition of the programmatic aspects, the urban role and the spatial characteristics of a contemporary library. Specifically, the conventional organisation of a public library, with books repository and reading hall is ineffective in a scenario where immaterial information can be displaced and hosted somewhere else, still remaining individually accessible from every point of the network. This architecture project envisions the limit of the process of dematerialization of physical culture in the case of a blinds library: an set of apparata whose agency is that of evoking in blind readers the mental image of an infinite reading space. The blinds library of Rome is a soft structure which opens to multiple interpretations, absorbing and reflecting definitions. It is indeed a library for blinds, but it is even a maze-like sensuous garden or an architectural game-field for viewers, and it is globally recognised as an architectural attraction comparable to the London Eye. The blinds library is situated in Parco di Villa Borghese, next to Valle Giulia faculty of architecture and well connected to Piazza del Popolo and the Central Library of Rome. The park has been interpreted as a Campo (field) of intensities and programmatic islands, between which the library forms an open-air pavilion similar to a dense architectural garden, which blinds reach following a path of lavender and other aromatic plants unfolding in the wood. Other buildings in the parc house cinema, art and leisure related programs between which are The Globe Theatre and The Caffe dell`Arte. Blinds readers navigate the library by means of their innate sense of number, their enhanced kinesthetic cognition, touch and hearing. The architecture of the library borrows from Braille language its peculiar relations between number, sign and significant. The unstable field of knowledge constituting the library is organised and indexed in an hypertextual network of relations linking different topics and establishing their relations of proximity, contiguity and interconnection in space. Topics are expressed in keywords associated to three numbers: the first two indicates rows and columns scanning the ground floor, while the third number correspond to a singular cable in the field. Cables are numbered from 1 to 2013 and their trajectories are numerically controlled. The numbering of the cables and the directions of the galleries are crossed in such a way that the reader will encounter numbered cables arranged in non-consecutive couples (as they were pages of a book browsed randomly or non-linearly). This numerical displacement evokes in the blind reader the mental image of a space whose architecture remains mysterious, enigmatic, unintelligible and infinite. In the library, the sense of infinite and the experience of the hypertext which are normally grasped only through vision, are translated into spatial experience and conveyed through the association of spatial elements with displaced and non-consecutive numbers. Beside the universal sense of number, the library engages blind sensing through the instability of its architecture. Due to its peculiar distribution of forces and delicate balancing of weight, every intersection and branch of the mobile network slightly vibrate and swing at same for the atmospheric flows and for the movement of human bodies in space. Instability creates peculiar connections between readers introducing another form of sociality which looks beyond the rethorics of the Public Building and which is based upon mutual awareness and shared intents in the community of the library, translating in architectural space some virtual potential of network theories. Blind readers access information in lecterns disseminated within the field. Each of these lectern can host and display one or more interrelated topics by means of a reading-&-writing Braille desk and it is connected or clustered with other lecterns hosting related topics. These platform are individual reading spaces reinterpreting some of spatial characteristics of libraries before Gutenberg`s invention of typography and the establishment of Free Public Library as building type and programmatic institution. The evolution of the idea of public library can be described as a slow movement of emancipation of a bookshelf (armarium), normally grouped with a desk and a chair, into a institutionalised space programmed to host books and readers and which has become crucial for sharing, producing and preserving knowledge. Lecterns are quasi-hermetic spaces in between a piece of furniture and an intimate study-room which are structurally more stable then the mobile galleries and the staircases, finished in pine wood, black rubber and textiles. Furthermore, the reading-&-writing Braille desk allow blinds readers to interpret and contribute to the heritage of the library by proposing compilings, editings and original interrelations between texts belonging to different times, languages and subjects. The hypertextual association proposed by any reader is evaluated by the community of the library and, when accepted, it is translated in a new gallery connecting two sectors of the library and crossing many others along the path. The community of the library challenges the structural relation between author, librarian and readers by introducing the role of the plural librarian, a multeplical reader echoing the nature of the Urbe, that of embodying the general idea and the conceptual origin of urbanity while being a specific place, at same. Proposing their interpretation, blinds perpetrate the movement of self-writing and the becoming of architecture, shifting the urban role of the library from a dimension of contemplation, collection and preservation of physical books to that of interpreting and indexing the global text. The kinetics of the library is based on the incalculable possibilities of assembling two different kind of spatial elements: the lectern and the mobile unit which are shifted in the field by a system of pulleys and chains. Together they constitute the topography of the library and weave the pattern of cables with their movement. The mobile unite is a narrow tactile environment capable of assuming various forms. Blinds walk on metal meshes beating the rhythmic sound of their walk while holding on the handrail rope with their hand. Each of these unit displays two consecutive numbers engraved in Braille scripts and hosts sensor activators connected to the numerical system of the library.","blind; reading; writing; border condition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Architecture","","PUBLIC BUILDING_BORDER CONDITION","",""

(mentor); Everts, H.J. (mentor); Bakker, K.J. (mentor); Hoefsloot, F.J.M. (mentor)","2012","In 2010 design guidelines for piles that are subjected to lateral loads by soils were published in CUR-report 228. The design guidelines are developed by a committee who did several case studies. A few recommendations were made from these case studies. To complement the case studies a long term field test on time dependent soil behavior and a study of the shell factor to take account for 3D pile-soil interaction in a 2D model are desired. Two previous students made their master thesis on these recommendations. This master thesis is a follow-up of the previous studies. A long term field test to investigate both time dependent behavior and lateral pile loads by soils is situated in the Bloemendalerpolder. It consists of a 3 m height embankment made of sand on a 3.6 m thick peat layer, see figure. In the embankment a number of measurement devices are installed. Like casings to measure lateral soil deformation with an inclinometer and two HEA300 piles, which are also equipped with a casing for measurements. From this field test a previous thesis student developed a FEM 3D model in Plaxis 3D. Results of the site investigation and laboratory tests are used for parameter determination for this model. Validation was done in Plaxis 2D with available measurements of deformations and pore pressures. The field test was still ongoing when the 3D Plaxis model was ready. A comparison of the modeled piles and more recent field data shows a good resemblance at depth. However the soil and water pressures are falsely simulated in the model and the modeled embankment shows too stiff pile-soil interaction. The falsely simulated pressures can be solved by using the updated water pressure function in Plaxis 3D, which isn’t available yet. One can cope with the stiff pile-soil interaction by using a more advanced soil model for the embankment sand. The use of the Hardening Soil Model instead of the used Mohr-Coulomb Model may offer a solution. For more insight in the lateral behavior of pile and soil the stress development around the pile in the 3D simulation is looked into. Three depths spread over the peat layer are looked at. In the stress points in front of the pile lateral soil pressure increases and the soil relaxes behind the pile. The difference in lateral soil pressures around the pile increases mainly in the beginning of the consolidation phase. Lateral pile displacements also show the fastest build-up in this phase. During the creep phase the soil pressure around the pile do not change significantly. This is also seen for the bending moments of the pile, which do not change or even decreases in the creep phase. The decrease of bending moments is due to the pile head displacement, as the rest of the pile doesn’t move. The pile head displacement causes the upper part of the pile to stretch, whereby the bending moments decrease. With 2D FEM one models a cross section, whereby piles are modeled as walls. The shell factor translates the pile stiffness to a wall stiffness. A 2D simulation of the 3D model is made. Only one of the piles is modeled in this 2D model to avoid inclusion of the soil between the wall elements. A high and low shell factor is applied and results of the lateral pile behavior are compared with the 3D model and the field test. On the short term a higher shell factor shows the best results. On the long term the high and the low shell factor show insignificant differences in pile displacements, however the higher shell factor shows better results for the bending moments in the pile.","Bloemendalerpolder; horizontaal belaste funderingspalen; kruip; plaxis; CUR-rapport 228","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geoscience & Engineering","","Geotechnical Engineering","",""

Nine seated subjects were perturbed in lateral direction on a motion platform while GVS was simultaneously applied. Both the mechanical and galvanic input signals consisted of multisine signals and were designed to be mathematically uncorrelated. For the motion perturbations, two direction and two amplitude variations were included. The GVS signal was applied in a bilateral bipolar configuration at 4 mA. During trials subjects had their eyes closed and were asked to perform a natural stabilization task. Displacements of the head, torso and platform were recorded using a motion capture system. System identification techniques were used to identify the relationship between respectively inputs GVS and torso motion and output head motion. Results show that it is feasible to apply low-level torso perturbations together with continuous galvanic stimulation in studying the head-neck system as high coherencies and consistent behavior are found for the transfer functions from mechanical and galvanic inputs to head motion over all subjects. It is concluded that superposition principle does not hold as gain, phase and coherence modulations were found with the addition of GVS.","galvanic vestibular stimulation; mechanical torso perturbations; head stabilization; system identification; sensory integration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-11-20","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

About when the built environment becomes out of tune with experienced and desired reality. Accumulating to the point of large scale vacancy and crisis. The focus of the project will be the case of the Kleiburg flat, the last untouched piece of Bijlmer ideology. The project was done in the graduation lab 'Design as Politics' with the underlying theme 'In the Ghetto', in which a personal view on the definition of a ghetto was encouraged. In this project the ghetto is described as an urban area that resonates with negative associations, as a segregated area often associated with the social-economic-weaker section. Due to the unpopularity of the urban area, real-estate values drop, investors and project-developers stay away. Conditions deteriorate. For those who want to leave the ghetto but can not afford to do so, the ghetto becomes an urban prison. The title of the project plays with the idea of architecture's ability to manifest dreams and desires. As the exodus took place and people moved towards the better, they left behind the old. The exodus was for those who could afford to leave; those unable to escape the undesired urban conditions where left behind. Post-Exodus focuses on these deprived areas, on these places of undesired architecture. It searches how to become a desired place once again, even when the means are limited. The research investigates a South-American Prison situated in Bolivia, in the capital city of La Paz. In the old city center, on the old colonial spanish grid the prison of San Pedro stands. Hidden behind the stucco walls, upon passing the guarded gate, a unexpected vivid community is revealed; the self-regulating inmate population of San Pedro. The prison was inspired by the panopticon model (Pentonville, London) of Jeremy Bentham. Built around the nineteen hundreds, this ideological prison model proved to be one of unrealistic utopia. The penitentiary system could not live up to the build expectations. The conditions of the inmate population deteriorated inside the prison walls. Without a welfare state or governmental subsidies the prisoners where appointed to their own ability to take matters into their own hands. Escape was not an option, the solution had to come from within... The do-it-yourself attitude of the prisoners resulted in an unique bottom-up transformation of the old prison model. Over time the prisoners slowly adapted the building to fit their basic needs, constantly fighting for their rights and defending every square inch. They held no nostalgia of the past, adapting to the new reality of their needs, adapting the build environment at best to survive. Over time San Pedro Prison developed its own logic, a mini-society with its own micro-economy, micro-policies, democratic elections, a prison real-estate market, cafes, restaurants, fitness area, sauna's, pool halls, tv corners, shops, dentist, churches, ceremony square, football competitions, tourism, workplaces, jobs and even more.. The San Pedro Prison inspires to look in a different way at the built environment we inhabit. It inspires to think in a different way about our attitude towards buildings. It inspires to think in a different way about architecture. It inspires to see how in the worst conceivable conditions, the prisoners of San Pedro where able to transform their built environment into a more favorable condition, to suit their lives and needs better. Transformation as a continues process, attuning to the ever changing times. Kleiburg is dead, it's ideology faded in the face of reality. Time has changed, Kleiburg stood still. If Kleiburg is not to parish in irrelevance it must once more become a part of our dreams and desires. Emergent societal trends and changes must then form the basis of its transformation. In times of financial crisis, unpredictability and uncertainty the means are limited. The answers must not be sought in the top-down financial power of big project developers but in the power of the ordinary people; the power of the people dwelling and working in and around Kleiburg. The design investigates a bottom-up approach, a do-it-yourself attitude, a gradual growth towards a new future. To clarify such a development a scenario was written in which the existing local social and urban fabric where extrapolated into the Kleiburg building. The initial conditions are dictated by the structural possibilities of the Kleiburg flat itself. The installation of the 'Gate' marks the presence of an underlying democratic process. Spatial hierarchy determines the relationship of space and influence of individuals/collectives on the built environment. In a set of projects possibilities are designed, each design telling a different story, each story exploring a new theme, each theme adding to a bigger scale. By the time we look back at all the different designs we will witness the emergence of museum. A Bottom-Up-Museum symbolizing the deconstruction of the prestigious 'starchitect' object, reconstructed by ordinary people.","design as politics; in the ghetto; getto; getho; gheto; utopia; dystopia; bijlmer; bijlmermeer; amsterdam; zuidoost; kleiburg; flat; herontwikkeling; redevelopment; scenario; groeimodel; gefaseerd; gradual growth; do-it-yourself; do it yourself; diy; bottom-up; bottom up; people; local; context; bottom up museum; kunsthal; art; arthouse; sustainability; reuse material; hergebruik materiaal; south america; bolivia; la paz; san pedro; san pedro prison; prison; panopticon; panopticum; model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-11-17","Architecture","Architecture","","Design as Politics","",""

The location is enclosed by the ringbahn and two branching tracks that give the site a characteristic triangular shape. For a long time the area has been uninteresting for investors and a lack of integral vision has made various unrelated functions accumulate in the area. The opening of the new Berlin-Brandenburg Airport and the introduction of the A100 highway extension through the area, however, will change its position within the city. It can be expected that this new position will lead to new development within the location. Berlin has however plenty of open space, so the pressure for development will be low and it is hard to predict what type of development will occur and over which time span. This thesis therefore strategically explores the potentials and weaknesses of the area, in order to guide mostly unknown future development, and to understand the nature of the location before real pressure on the area arises.","Berlin; In-Between Space; Open Planning process","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-12-31","Architecture","Urbanism","","Master Gaduation Studio Urban Regeneration in the European Context","",""

Over the past few years, the extent of congestion is decreasing, though still very significant. Road authorities therefore show interest in traffic congestion forecasting. In this way they can inform road users or undertake other strategic actions. This thesis is therefore dedicated to the variability of traffic in congestion forecasting. The main objective is to develop a methodology operationalized in a model, which is able to predict congestion on motorways without knowledge of the actual traffic conditions. The model takes the variability of traffic into account and is substantiated with a solid theoretical framework relating the predictability of factors and their effects to traffic supply and demand. To fulfill this objective, a literature research has been conducted on traffic flow theory, factors and effects influencing traffic demand and traffic supply, model approaches and probabilistic methods. The identified influence factors are listed below: regular pattern of variation in human travel behavior over the day, over the days of the week and over the periods of the year; public holidays / vacation periods; events; weather conditions; road works; incidents; variations in vehicle population; variations in driver population; luminance; ‘intrinsic’ variations in driving behavior and in human travel behavior. Using the acquired knowledge a research methodology is developed. The model approach makes use of the basic principles of traffic flow theory based on the conservation of vehicles and first order traffic flow theory. To take the variability of influence factors into account, an intelligent sampling technique is used: Latin Hypercube Sampling. Before the model is constructed, the predictabilities and the effects of the various influence factors on traffic demand and traffic supply are described and explained through a theoretical framework. Some of them are always predictable (e.g. public holidays, luminance), while the predictability of others depend on data (e.g. road works or weather conditions). Incidents are considered not very predictable. The occurrence and therefore the effects of the identified influence factors can be continuously present or only on certain moments in time. They can also be on every cell of the motorway corridor or only on a selection of cells of the motorway corridor. The developed model makes use of traffic demand profiles and traffic supply variables. These are processed by a first order traffic model using a Godunov scheme. Traffic is numerically sent through the model subject to the defined boundary conditions. When the flow exceeds the capacity, congestion sets in and propagates backwards in space according to the first order traffic theory. From the modeled data, travel times and other performance indicators can be derived. A trajectory method is used to calculate the actual travel times. Before the model processes the traffic demand profile and traffic supply variables, these are corrected for the identified influence factors. The occurrence of these influence factors can be defined manually. However, to be able to incorporate the variability of traffic, a sampling component is added to the model. In this way the occurrence of the influence factors can be determined through a probability function. After multiple runs, the output indicators are collected. The model is calibrated and evaluated using data from the A27 motorway between Hooipolder and Gorinchem. The data was recorded over the year 2011. First the calibration of the traffic supply variables is performed. The calibration results showed a good likeness to the recorded travel times. Congestion in the model also sets in at similar moments in time and space as in the recorded data. Next the intrinsic variability of traffic is calibrated, the recorded travel time distribution over the year 2011 was very well approximated by the model. The research shows that the developed methodology is suitable for predicting travel times or other performance indicators. Producing traffic demand profiles is achievable, however the effects of some influence factors (road works, weather conditions) are not trivial. The estimation of the traffic supply variables from data showed to be a tougher task. The model results show relatively large uncertainties in the travel times as congestion was probable to set in (i.e. peak periods). When the traffic demand and traffic supply are close to each other, the probability on congestion increases. However, the difference in travel times when congestion sets in, compared to travel times where congestion remains absent, is relatively large. Hence, the large uncertainties in the peak periods. This implies that, even though the occurrence and effects of the identified influence factors are very accurately available, uncertainties in travel times can still be significant. Using the developed methodology, it is important to have reliable data sources regarding the identified influence factors. Especially for the influence factors that have significant effects on the traffic conditions (road works, adverse weather conditions, events), the availability of accurate data is highly needed. Predictions made with help of unreliable or incomplete data is deemed to be inaccurate. The case study results also lead to some recommendations. For operational use of the methodology, further analysis of the possibilities for extension of the model to larger networks (e.g. the Dutch motorway network) is recommended. The effects of the identified influence factors can then not be only adopted from theory. The prediction of the traffic conditions produced by the model shows less certainty as traffic demand and traffic supply values are close to each other, even though the influence factors are fully predictable and accounted for. Further research on this topic is also advised.","congestion; variability; forecasting; probabilistic; traffic flow; modeling; predicting; latin hypercube; sampling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-11-06","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","Transport & Planning","",""

The goal is to investigate an alternative way to deal with the densification process in complex scenarios, where the traditional approach of simply substituting existing buildings for denser ones is not possible: historical city centers constitute local cultural heritage and for this reason need to be preserved, establishing huge constraints for this inner growth process. The central question raised is ""how to accommodate the future city within the existing one"", in a necessarily intimate relation between present and future buildings, improving the original quality of the space. In other words, the quest is how to promote an architectonic symbiosis able to provide positive outcomes to all the parties involved, or, in biological terms: a ""Mutualitic relation"". Exchanges of services and nutrients that define each kind of symbiosis in nature are translated into the architecttural field, defining relations of parasitism, amensalism, commensalism, neutralism, composite organism, evolution, mutual predation, competition and, finally, mutualism in architecture. A catalog explores 80 existing “symbiotic relations” between buildings in the current urban scene and between buildings and the city. Nowadays, incorrectly put together under the expression “parasitic architecture”, each example analysed was re-labeled according to proper analogies with the biological field. The outcomes of that analysis work as inputs for the “densification plan” for Amsterdam presented in a project complementary to this thesis, where two examples – under and above the heritage urban fabric – explore how to achieve a “Mutualistic Architecture”, with good outcomes to all parties involved.","mutualistic architecture; preservative densification; parasitic architecture; preservation; densification; future","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-11-05","Architecture","Explore Lab","","Urban planning/ experimental","",""

In order to use these low power design methods, strict requirements for both libraries and tools are needed. An additional challenge is the introduction of more accurate characterization models for newer technologies (current source models like ECSM and CCS). This has made the task of library checking a serious issue that needs to be automated. The main part of this thesis presents a checker tool that is used to verify the consistency of the different library formats (views) in standard cell libraries. The layout consistency checker in our tool checks the consistency of the layout of pins between GDSII and LEF library views; we devised a new algorithm,Grid Formation and Centre Inclusion, for this checker. The tool also verifies the pin consistency and availability of cells across other library formats, such as: Verilog and Liberty. The tool was tested using different technology libraries (such as 90nm and 40nm), provided by different vendors (such as GLOBALFOUNDRIES); multiple interfacing errors were caught using our library checker tool. A second part at the end of the thesis shows experiments with some of the low-power design techniques used during the design of a digital block, using -for implementation- standard cells from one of the libraries that have been checked with the library checker tool. Benefits of using these techniques are evaluated and trade-offs are discussed. Power-Shut Off (PSO) design technique proved to be the most effective in reducing power consumption, with power savings that reached 20%.","low-power; Standard Cell Libraries; Interface Checker; digital design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-10-10","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Circuits and Systems","","","",""

(mentor)","2012","Either when called the “small urban spaces” (Whyte, 2001), or the “spaces between buildings” (Gehl, 1987) or the “public domain” (Müller, 2002), evident is that all various theories about low intensity social contacts (Gehl, 1987) emphasise on the role of the public spaces of the city. In this thesis, the public spaces are defined as the outdoor, accessible spaces of the city, where people are socially accessible for each other. According to theorists like Richard Schechner, and Erving Goffman, these are the places where we perform. In this thesis, the fragile state of social performance in modern Northwest-European city centres, and the even so uncertain future of aesthetic performance in times of large culture cutbacks formed basis of a two-sided problem statement: Cities miss out in enhancing the social life of cities, by not facilitating social performance optimally, while the performing arts sector misses out by creating aesthetic performances that are withdrawn from city life. In the main question, the issue is raised how these two kinds of performance can be enhanced. The research focuses on the physical conditions that enhance these two, resulting in a single mutual enhancement strategy: public theatricality. The strategy aims to change the public spaces of the city into places where art performances, derived from local art institutions, and the social performances of everyday life together result in lively, exciting city life. Apart from academic literature, this project uses the outcome of the design project as input for answering the research questions. In that way, the design project functions as a case study. The location of this design project is the city centre of Liverpool. As part of the application of the strategy, three squares in Liverpool are redesigned. The outcome of three designs formed the input basis for the formulation of the main urban design criteria, as a ‘toolbox’for the urban designer. These criteria, in combination with the strategy, offer a generic solution for the enhancement of social and aesthetic performance in Northwest-European cities. This thesis Theatrical City is the result of a project of Thomas Galesloot, as the graduation project of the Master Urbanism at the faculty of Architecture, TU Delft, The Netherlands.","Theatrical City; urban design; theatre; performance; liverpool","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-11-12","Architecture","Urbanism","","Explorelab","",""

(mentor); Van den Bos, J. (mentor); Van den Berg, B. (mentor); Zijlema, M. (mentor)","2012","The design formula for rubble mound breakwaters by Van der Meer has an unclear Notional Permeability term. This term causes a lot of confusion for designers. In the past many people have tried to derive a better formulation for that term by experimental and analytical research. The goal of this study was to obtain a better formulation along a numerical way. This study explores the numerical possibilities and tries to define which direction has to be taken in future research. As a first step, a very simplified case is taken with a vertical homogeneous breakwater which interact with monochromatic waves. In total six different blocks were made of epoxy and elastocoast. Only 4 out of the 6 blocks were tested. Also the porosity (n), laminar friction (?) and turbulent friction constant (?) of the blocks were determined experimentally. This way the experimental results could be compared with computations. These experiments have been done in the large flume of the Environmental Fluid Mechanics Laboratory of the TU Delft. Two types of data were collected: pore pressures and water levels in front and behind the block. The water levels seemed to be the most reliable data. The main deficit of the setup was the wave absorber at the end of the flume. The wave absorber is not able to sufficiently absorb long waves. So the dataset had to be corrected for that effect. The created dataset was in line with results from earlier experiments. Results were compared with an analytical solution and the numerical SWASH model. Comparisons with the analytical solution showed a reasonable fit without any calibration. The SWASH model showed in first instance large deviations using the same dataset. By calibrating the turbulent flow resistance ?, it was possible to generate a decent fit. However, the used ? constants are 6-10 times higher than the measured ? constants. This is physically unrealistic high. Therefore the most likely explanation is an error in the transition between the water and the porous medium. During the experiment discontinuities can occur on this transition while SWASH uses an continuity requirement. Numerical tests were performed on some multi-layered combinations of the different blocks in order to derive a ""Vertical P"" value in a similar way as Van der Meer determined his P=0.4 structure. The results showed, nevertheless, quite some different patterns as the computations done by Van der Meer. However, taking into account all the problems with calibrating the SWASH model the results for the notional permeability seemed very promising. This numerical method shows the possibility of numerically calculating a notional permeability and should be investigated further in the future.","porous flow; notional permeability; SWASH; reflection and transmission; Van der Meer formula","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Enviromental Fluid Mechanics","",""

There was a long time I couldn’t find my way, however, in the end, everything seems coming together, and I learnt a lot through designing this project.

It’s both modern and traditional. It’s a design for the local people, connected to their lifestyle. In this project, the diversity of typology is what gave the project richness and made it unique. Moreover, the idea to bring back the very nature of a bazaar - 'the craftsmanship', which has already replaced with tourism nowadays, is the key factor to organise the whole project. This idea of 'craftsmanship' also connects to the Utopia of the State Farm - 'a place to learn'. For the final presentation of the project, different ways of presentation are used as I never tried before, such as telling a story happened in the Bazaar and making a box for the overall model, which contains everything.

River cities displayed an intimate and complex relationship with water, which was never considered as a limit but rather as an extension of the urban fabric. However during the industrialization the waterway network lost its monopoly in infrastructure. Ever since the lost of the river in the ‘battle of infrastructure’, river cities have seen a weakening of their functional relationship with water. The riverfront in today’s global cities is a legacy of industrialization and maritime commerce and typically a city’s most contested zone. The original functions of a river and its riverfront become obsolete resulting in the weakening of relationships between the city and its river. Instead of a communication axe the river transformed in a physical boarder dividing the city and its public realm into pieces. The river needs to be redefined in today’s river cities; it requires a radical restructuring of its meaning, use and its occupants.

The Dutch office market is facing a structural vacancy of 4.2 million square meter, that will even increase in the coming decades due to new ways of organizing labour, such as: flex working. The Dutch housing market on the other hand has to deal with a shortage of housings for students and starters in the run to 2025, due to a population growth of 6.6%. Transformation is a solution for both problems. It involves the rezoning of structural vacant office buildings to residential buildings. The Dutch government established in 2008 a climate agreement ‘Lenteakkoord 2008’, in which sustainable developments should lead mid-2020 to energy neutral buildings. This target is unlikely to be achieved for transformation developments. This is mainly due to the lack of knowledge in the field of transformations from structural vacant office buildings to energy-neutral residential buildings. In this graduation research are the possibilities explored to see if it is possible to transform vacant office buildings to energy neutral residential buildings. In order to ensure the feasibility of this graduation thesis there is searched for a practical case that meets the current problems and characteristics on the office market, so the boundary conditions are set.

(mentor)","2012","Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) is the process of transferring power from one circuit onto another without passing through any manmade conductive elements interconnecting them. Several schemes for wireless power transfer exist – Inductive, Capacitive, Laser, Microwave etc. Of these, Inductive Power Transfer (IPT) is the most popular and is being extensively studied particularly from the last two decades. The first part of this thesis is dedicated to an extensive theoretical study of the basic compensation topologies so as to understand their operation and hence aid the design of a generic IPT system depending on the criteria to be optimized. The idea of resonance so developed can also be used to characterize any complex resonant circuit from an engineering approach. This understanding later evolved into a search for understanding the physics of magnetic fields, inductances etc. The state-of-art for IPT in E-mobility is the powering while driving scenario or dynamic charging. The second part of this thesis is dedicated to enhancing the understanding of the fundamentals of dynamic charging. This scheme is characterized by a major limitation apart from its inherent poor coupling, that being -“Misalignment”. Misalignment hampers effective power transfer as the mutual inductance would fall badly as a result of the same. To tackle the issue of misalignment, modifications can be made to both the secondary as well as the primary of the IPT. Modifications to the secondary in the form of introducing a new set of inductors referred to as “Quadrature Coils” has been studied. Also, a novel primary that could yield potentially higher power transfer, referred to as “Double Lane Model” has been proposed.","Wireless Power Transfer; Inductive Power Transfer; Misalignment; Quadrature coils","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","","",""

Applications of these methods are, among others, radiology (CT-, MRI- and PET scans), geophysics and material science. The tomographic problems can be formulated as a system of linear equations. Unfortunately, these systems are not symmetric nor positive (semi)definite, rank deficient and not square. In material science one is often presented with very small objects (like crystals or nano-structures) that consist of one or a small number of different materials, each with its own density. Scanning these small objects can cause damage to the structure and thus one can only take a very limited amount of projections. Fortunately, one can use the prior knowledge about the object to arrive at a reconstruction of the original object. How to arrive at this reconstruction is studied by the field of discrete tomography (DT). With every kind of tomography, and thus also with DT, one is faced with noisy data. Because of this noise the reconstruction process becomes more difficult since the system of linear equations becomes inconsistent. The DART (Discrete Algebraic Reconstruction Method) algorithm was developed to solve DT problems. This algorithm deals with noise in a very heuristic method. The goal of this project is to investigate how the problem can be regularized such that it deals with the noise in a more efficient and robust manner.","tomography; discrete; DART; numerical linear algebra; noise; reconstruction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-10-28","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied Mathematics","","","",""

(contributor); Timmer, H. (contributor); Vreeburg, J.H.G. (contributor)","2012","Oasen is een drinkwaterbedrijf gevestigd in Zuid-Holland. Rond 1990 zijn verschillende winningen in het noordelijke leveringsgebied gesloten omdat het grondwater te zout werd. Nu wordt vanuit het zuiden water naar het noorden getransporteerd. Als de winningen in het zuiden grotendeels uitvallen of de transportleiding breekt, wordt nauwelijks voldaan aan de wettelijk vereiste minimum leveringszekerheid. Productiecapaciteitsvergroting in het noordelijk leveringsgebied is dus gewenst. Met membraanfiltratie is ontzouting inmiddels financieel haalbaar. Oasen is gestart met een onderzoeksproject waarbij de membraanfiltratie plaatsvindt in de winput zelf, wat de naam ‘PUt met RO’ (PURO) draagt. Om de productiecapaciteit in het noordelijke gebied te vergroten is een haalbaarheidsstudie uitgevoerd voor heropening van de voormalige winningen, waar het PURO-concept wordt toegepast. In deze studie is zowel geïnventariseerd wat schaalvoordelen (productie van 1.5 M m3/a of 3 M m3/a) betekenen als wat de combinatie met conventionele zuivering oplevert. Daarnaast is onderzocht of Oasen een industriële klant van industriewater kan voorzien, waarbij industriewater wordt geproduceerd m.b.v. het PURO-concept. De verschillende scenario’s zijn zuiveringstechnisch en financieel ontworpen/doorgerekend. Daarnaast zijn de vergunningvoorwaarden geïnventariseerd en is onderzocht of de huidige locaties nog geschikt zijn voor winning en productie. Voor de diverse manieren van drinkwater productie zijn de volgende zuiveringsschema’s gehanteerd. Na onttrekking is voor het PURO permeaat nog dolomietfiltratie, beluchting en zandfiltratie vereist. Als de productie wordt gecombineerd met conventionele zuivering, is alleen permeaat beluchting voldoende. De conventionele zuivering bestaat uit torenbeluchting, droogfiltratie, pellet-ontharding, Carry-over-filtratie, aktief koolfiltratie en UV desinfectie. Industriewaterproductie is ook mogelijk met implementatie van het PURO-concept. Als nabehandeling is alleen beluchting en zandfiltratie voldoende. De productieprijs voor industriewater bedraagt 0,75/m3, drinkwaterproductie is mogelijk voor 0,56/m3 tot 0,87/m3. Laatstgenoemde prijs geldt als membraanfiltratie wordt gecombineerd met conventionele zuivering op kleine schaal. Een grootschalige productiefaciliteit heeft de voorkeur voor vergunningverlening, omdat zo de hoeveelheid waterwingebieden beperkt blijft. Daarnaast moet de strategische zoetgrondwatervoorraad gehandhaafd blijven. Een nadeel van conventionele zuivering is dat veel grondoppervlak voor de zuivering vereist is.Op basis van de resultaten in deze scriptie is het advies om een heropening van de zuiveringen in Oasen noord te heroverwegen. De opgedane praktijkervaring met de PURO pilot op Ridderkerk dient hiervoor ingezet te worden. Een heropening betreft dan een winning met een productiecapaciteit van omstreeks 3 M m3/a, waarbij zowel alleen PURO winputten als de combinatie met conventionele zuiveringverder uitgewerkt moet worden. De industriewaterproductie is financieel gezien het meest aantrekkelijk, maar is ook het meest risicovol. Een gelijkblijvende afname gedurende 17 jaar is vereist voor dekking van de investeringskosten.","omgekeerde osmose; PURO; Oasen; drinkwater","en","student report","","","","","","","","2013-08-03","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Sanitary Engineering","",""

Besides this, the new Panama locks will be finished in 2015. Seeing as the current shipping standard is largely determined by the Panama locks, the general expectation is that the vessel dimensions will increase to a standard size that complies with the new locks. It is evident that the increase in maximum draft of these vessels makes the depth restrictions in the Rio de la Plata cut into their efficiency even harder. It is a reasonable assumption that something has to be done in order to keep the Rio Paraná system from collapsing. There are numerous types of solutions that could be applied for this problem. The chosen solution in this case is the construction of a new port somewhere in the Rio de la Plata. This port would serve as a transhipment station where inland vessels deliver the cargo from ports along Rio Paraná and where it gets transhipped into ocean going vessels with a New Panamax size, which have a maximum draft of 54 feet, for shipment across the ocean. This solution means that the ocean going vessels can fully utilise their maximum draft for the entire duration of their trip. Furthermore it means that, as far as the grain industry is concerned, the requirement for maintaining an artificial depth of 34 feet in the Rio de la Plata past the port is no longer required. The final design of the previously described port consists of an artificial island on Banco Chico off the coast of Magdalena in the Rio de la Plata. This location has been chosen due to political, environmental and cost related motivations and is located right next to the already existing shipping channel, making the required access channel for the port’s ocean basin shorter. The port is designed to be capable of receiving anything up to fully loaded New Panamax sized vessels and partially loaded Capesize vessels. On the river side of the port the system is designed to make use of tug/barge combinations with a loading capacity of 5600 tons and a draft of 14 feet. This draft means they can freely sail on most of the Rio de la Plata and do not necessarily require the maintained channels. The island itself gives room for (temporary) storage of commodities in between unloading and loading to ensure a constant supply of grain to load the ocean vessels and thus reduces the service time. All in all the construction of a transhipment port on an artificial island in the Rio de la Plata is a preliminarily feasible solution to the described problem. This does, however, mean that all the assumptions that have been made in the design phase will either have to be true, or false in a non-critical fashion. On top of that there are still numerous risks that could harm the operational feasibility of the port and make sure it will never exist. As long as sufficient research is done into the more critical aspects of these risks and assumptions, a lot of economic benefit could be gained from embarking on a new system.","Rio de la Plata; port planning; artificial island; Argentina; Uruguay; bulk terminal; grain termminal","en","student report","TU Delft, Section Hydraulic engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2012","Rush-hour lanes and pluslanes have been operational in the Netherlands since 1996. They are intended as a measure to increase capacity without the need to add an extra lane to the cross section. Individually, rush-hour lanes and pluslanes have been evaluated. However, not much research, however, compares rush-hour lane or pluslane designs with each other. In this research, long-term data will be used to get detailed information about the performance of different rush-hour lane and pluslane designs. Also, a driving simulator study is performed to gain insight in the underlying behavioral factors and to analyze the performance of changes in rush-hour lane designs. The main question for the research is: What is the performance of rush-hour lanes and pluslanes, what are the behavioral factors and design factors causing differences in performance and what changes can be made to the design of rush-hour lanes to improve the performance? In the ex-post evaluation of performance, data is used for a period of 120 days of 5 highway sections with a rush-hour lane and 5 highway sections with a pluslane. The sections are compared using lane flow distributions that show the occupation of the lanes and intensity-speed relations that show the differences in free-flow speeds driven on the sections. In the first analysis, rush-hour lanes are compared with regular right lanes and pluslanes are compared with regular left lanes. The rush-hour lane section at the A50 between junction Ewijk and junction Valburg is designed in the driving simulator to analyze the behavioral factors that underlie the results from this first comparison. Also, a comparison is made between the occupation of different locations at rush-hour lanes and pluslanes. For this purpose, the start section and the end section are compared with a turbulence-free section. As a final analysis, the design factors that are researched for their influence on performance are: the lane width, the speed limit and the total number of lanes. A lot of variation in these design factors can be found on the rush-hour lane and pluslane sections that have been implemented today. However, some designs have not been implemented yet. The driving simulator provided the perfect opportunity to test new designs of rush-hour lanes. The simulator is used to test the influence of reducing the signaling by 50% and the influence of changing the markings from continuous to broken on the occupation of rush-hour lanes. Regarding the design factors, it can be concluded from this research that a high speed limit of 120 km/h has a negative effect on the occupation of rush-hour lanes and also on the speeds driven at rush-hour lane sections. The car-following behavior of vehicles on a rush-hour lane section with such speed limit is researched in the driving simulator study. It shows that the incentive of using the rush-hour lane at this speed limit is low. Changing the markings from continuous to broken in the driving simulator does not affect the occupation of the rush-hour lane at 120 km/h. Also, reducing the signaling by half does not affect the occupation. Further research needs to show if these design factors have an influence on the occupation of rush-hour lanes at lower speed limits. The models that are implemented in the simulator at the Delft University of Technology are not realistic enough for this kind of research, as the behavior of virtual traffic influences the results too much. Smaller lane widths appear to have a negative effect on the occupation of rush-hour lanes and on the speeds driven at rush-hour lane sections. This could, however, not be concluded from this research alone. At pluslane sections with a combination between a high speed limit (100 km/h) and a small lane width (< 2,80 m) the occupation of the pluslane becomes significantly less. Adding an extra lane to the section (making it 3+1) lowers the intensity shares at low intensity levels for that section for both rush-hour lanes and pluslanes. At higher intensity levels, no significant differences were found. Quantifying the influence of the design factors on the performance of rush-hour lanes and pluslanes is an interesting subject for further research. The performance of managed lanes to be implemented in the future can then be predicted by a model before realization. The differences between start sections and end sections also need to be analyzed in more detail for this purpose. The combination between an ex-post evaluation and a driving simulator study as is used in this research can also be well-suited for that new research.","rush-hour lanes; pluslanes; managed lanes","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-11-09","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

(mentor)","2012","ProRail Traffic Control would like to have examined what the performance of crossovers for rescheduling is in case of partial obstructions. The need for quantitative information about the performance of crossovers in The Netherlands has grown. The research is intended to fill this knowledge gap by investigating the performance of crossovers in The Netherlands in a quantitative manner for two typical corridors. Therefore, the main research question is stated as follows: What is the performance of crossovers with respect to reliability (benefits) and life-cycle costs when rescheduling takes place? The focus in this research is on IVO switches (crossovers in between stations) that are only used for rescheduling. A crossover is a pair of switches that connects two parallel tracks and enables transfer from one track to the other track. The research question has been explored on two typical corridors in the Dutch railway network: corridor Amsterdam: Amsterdam Riekerpolder aansluiting (Asra) – Amsterdam Bijlmer ArenA (Asb)/Diemen Zuid (Dmnz) and corridor Rotterdam: Rotterdam Centraal (Rtd) – Gouda (Gd). Several methods and tools have been used. First, a disruption analysis of the applied partial rescheduling (VSM: VerSperringsMaatregel) in 2011 has been done. The microscopic application TOON has been used to analyze disrupted train operations. Database MUIS contains manually added reports about rescheduling inputted by traffic controllers. With these two tools, similarities and differences between the applied VSM and the real processes and reports from traffic control have been analyzed. Furthermore, insight into the usage of crossovers during rescheduling has been obtained. To get insight into delays and the propagation, data from the Monitoringsystem has been used. The Monitoringsystem generates couplings between train delays. Second, a simulation study of case study Rotterdam has been performed. The microscopic simulation tool OpenTrack has been used to analyze the rescheduling and crossover usage during partial obstruction between Rotterdam Noord Goederen (Rtng) and Nieuwerkerk a/d IJssel (Nwk) (VSM 25.070). Three scenarios have been analyzed: the reference situation: maintaining crossovers at Nieuwerkerk IVO wissels (Nwki) and Moordrecht overloopwissels (Mdo), scenario 1: a crossover at Capelle Schollevaar overloopwissels (Cpso) instead Nwki and scenario 2: both crossovers at Nwki and Mdo are removed. The scenarios have been evaluated through estimations of passenger-, operator- and infra manager costs. Important conclusions that could be drawn from the analyses are that most disruptions that needed partial VSM were caused by defect trains rather than infrastructure related defects. Furthermore, the largest part of the rescheduling went according to the VSM. Although, some disruptions were too short and therefore rescheduling was partly executed according to the VSM. In both case studies crossovers were frequently used during rescheduling. Especially during the first phase–when trains are trapped–crossovers are needed to quickly remove and prevent trains to enter. This will speed up the implementation of the VSM either if partial or complete VSM is used. Moreover, crossovers were also frequently used to couple and abduct ‘defect’ trains to stations/yards and allow implementation of a VSM at once which is the case of delayed anticipated maintenance. With regard to disturbance of crossovers, crossovers do influence the performance of the railway system i.e. according to ProRail’s Asset Management database crossovers lead to a small number of TAOs. Delays and its propagation depend on the severity of disruption. When disruption was shorter (< 3 hours) no other trains on other corridors within the area of Rotterdam and Utrecht were affected. When disruption took longer (> 3 hours) delays were propagated, affecting other trains on other corridors within the area. Furthermore, it can be concluded from the simulation study that scenario 1: crossover at Cpso instead of Nwki resulted in shorter delays of the still operable SPR 4000-series. However, the simulation showed that adding an additional IC 2800-series did not improve the performance of rescheduling. In case of one disruption per year scenario 2: removing the crossovers by removing the tongue and frog has the lowest total costs (210,557). Removing both crossovers is more expensive (214,909) as well as maintaining the crossovers at Nwki and Mdo (240,422) or replacing the one at Nwki by a new one at Cpso (> 240,422). When more than one disruption per year occurs, remaining crossovers at Nwki and Mdo results in lower costs than removing them. Therefore, it can be concluded that with regard to corridor Rotterdam (six disruptions in 2011) maintaining the crossovers at Nwki and Mdo is the most cost-effective. Finally, some recommendations are given with respect to further research. To get reliable data about the performance of crossovers that are applicable to the whole railway network more case studies should be done and different disruptions should be simulated. Moreover, a network-wide analysis of costs and benefits needs to be done to get reliable results for decision making. With respect to ProRail’s new rescheduling philosophy it is questionable whether it is still sufficient in the long term. New technologies in the railway system such as decision support systems that give optimal rescheduling based on real-time delays are promising. Perhaps this could be explored in advance. Also some recommendations are given with respect to the tools that have been used. Reporting the rescheduling process is arbitrarily done in MUIS if compared with the eventually executed rescheduling process obtained from TOON. This makes analyzing disruptions more complex. Therefore, it might be useful to integrate these two systems. With regard to disturbances of crossovers, data of ProRail Asset Management database did not always match with data of TOON and MUIS reports. It could be beneficial for research purposes to couple these databases. A disadvantage of the Monitoringsystem is that not all couplings are being made. A comparable system, TNV-Conflict would be recommended for follow-up studies since it has very accurate data (to the nearest second) about delays and its propagation. Finally, with the help of user-friendly applications such as a convertor that automatically imports the Infra Atlas in OpenTrack, simulation studies become less time-consuming and therefore more accessible.","railway network; crossover; train operations; rescheduling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","Transport and Planning","",""

Particularly, for wing-ap configurations, the enhancement of high lift performance, is of great interest and growing research at Delft University of Technology. Typically, the main approach with respect to delivering higher lift forces is by deecting the ap to higher angles of attack. However, the higher this angle is, the larger the curvature of the ow. As a result, separated ow dominates most of the ap's contour and significant part of the lift force might be lost. This problem is known to engineers for years and in order to overcome this lift loss, additional ow control techniques seem to be essential. Thus, with the goal of lift improvement in mind, the effect of drooped spoiler application was investigated experimentally, for a wing- Fowler ap model, at critical flight conditions i.e. high ap deection angle of 50o and Re = 1:6 _ 106 (40 m/s).","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering | Aerodynamics and Wind Energy","",""

(mentor)","2012","Cargo transport is important for supplies of goods and food worldwide. The goods and food are transported by inland transport modes, like road, railway and inland waterway transport. Due to a growth in world population the demand of goods and food increase, which results in an increase in cargo transport. More transport leads to more traffic on roads, railway and inland waterways. Roads and railways are at their limits of capacity, while inland waterways have the ability for an increase of waterway traffic. The European waterway network for inland transport is wide and connects sea ports and the European hinterland with each other. While inland waterway transport is cheaper and slower compared to road and railway transport, it is also less reliable than the other transport modes. The reliability is the ability to perform and maintain the agreements made between actors involved in the cargo transport during normal circumstances, as well as during unexpected circumstances, like delays. A disadvantage for inland waterway navigation is the locks in the waterway network. Locks maintain the water on a certain level, so that inland vessels can navigate without the risk of grounding. Locks also cause congestions when the lock capacity is lower than the amount of vessels that want to pass the lock during a certain time. These congestions cause delays for the vessels, which do not increase the reliability of the waterway transport mode. To stimulate the inland waterway transport, so that cargo transport over water will become more compatible with road and railway transport, the reliability for inland waterway transport must be increased. This can be done by decreasing the waiting times at the locks in the waterways. The interarrival times of inland vessels have an influence on the waiting times for vessels at locks. So when the arrival times of vessels at a lock are controlled, the waiting times can be controlled. A simulation model is designed to simulate what the effect of controlled arrivals of vessels is on the waiting time at locks. The simulation model is able to adjust the velocities of all vessels that navigate on the waterway towards the lock. With the adjustments in velocity of a vessels, the arrival time of that vessel is controlled by the model. The adjustment in velocity can let the vessel navigate faster and slower. When a vessel slows down it´s travel time on the waterway increases. A lower velocity and a longer travel time means that the fuel costs decrease and the operation time increases. That could result in a higher total travel costs. Therefore the simulation model can minimize the waiting times or the travel costs. With the minimization of costs the waiting time is minimized as well, due to the fixed operating costs a vessel has, which are the travel costs without fuel costs. Variables in the simulation model are the length of the controlled waterway, the service time of the lock and the lock capacity. The length of the controlled waterway determines the size of the system and the area where the vessels are controlled, the service time is the time it takes to pass the lock and the lock capacity determines the maximum number of vessels that can enter the lock chamber during one service run. As an input for the simulation model each vessel has its own entering velocity and entering time during a day. The entering velocities of the vessel are between 10 and 20 km/h and can be adjusted between 5 km/h and 110% of the entering velocity of the vessel. The entering time is distributed by a Weibull distribution. Since inland waterway transport is not yet a full 24/7 industry, the distribution is in such way that the majority of the daily vessels that pass the lock will enter the system between 06:00 and 20:00 hour. The settings used for the variables in the simulations are based on situations at four locks between the two largest sea ports in Europe, which are Rotterdam and Antwerp. The locks are the Volkerak, Krammer, Hansweert and Kreekrak lock and the waiting times at those lock are expected to be as long as 3 hours in the next decade. The output of the simulation model are waiting times at the lock and the total travel costs for each vessel in an optimized situation, which is a situation with minimized waiting time or travel costs. Optimized results of the simulation model are compared with the simulations that represent the four locks with the expected waiting times. The simulation model shows a reduction in waiting times of more than 80% compared to the expected waiting times for the next decade. If this can be achieved in reality the inland waterway transport mode can be stimulated due to smaller unexpected delays and an increased reliability.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine and Transport Technology","","Transport Engineering and Logistics","",""
