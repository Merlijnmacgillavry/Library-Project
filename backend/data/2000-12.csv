Internet provides a platform to distribute geographical data. However, most of the current geographic sites are atlases and not GIS products, because they are short of possibilities for analysis, query and visualisation. A new development in internet GIS is the use of distributed sources: the user can make his choice between diverse datasources. Geographic data is currently delivered as the data itself and meta-data like format, projection, attribute-definition, actuality and accuracy (quality of the data). The metainformation enables the user to decide whether the data is suitable for the use in a GIS. The OpenGIS Consortium (OGC) is developing standards for interoperability of geographic data. In the case when multiple sources are used, the visualisation of the datasets can cause conflicts for there is no standard or direction for the graphical presentation of the data. Therefore, it's useful to make a distinction between the Digital Landscape Model (DLM) where the data itself is present, and the Digital Cartographic Model (DCM, in Dutch DKM) where the graphical presentation is described. For the use of an internet GIS, it is important that not only the DLM, but also the DKM is provided by the data source. When a combination of several DLM's is made, the use of an expert system is needed, which uses cartographic rules to determine the optimal presentation of this set of data, given the user's task and preferences. This Cartographic Expert System (CES, in Dutch KES) is aimed to accompany and advise the user in producing a cartographic decent product.","kadaster; gis-technologie, kartografie","nl","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Geo-Database Management Center","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","GIS technology","","","",""

(mentor); Rijsenbrij, J.C. (mentor); Groenveld, R. (mentor)","2000","The container traffic growth worldwide continues to increase. To keep up with the growth, shipping companies keep enlarging container ship size. The handling speed of the terminal will especially be a critical factor for the largest vessels. Terminals have to be able to serve these ships as best as possible. To keep the dwell time of the ships visiting a terminal to a minimum, the handling capacities on the terminal must get bigger. To achieve a maximum effectiveness of portainer productivity in relation to the land side of the terminal, the horizontal transportation and the stacking of the containers must be optimised. The amount of land available for expanding an existing terminal or creating a new terminal is scarce. When designing a terminal this is a very important factor to take into account. To minimise operating costs and maximise efficiency, automation of the terminal also is a factor to take into account. The goal of this study has been to design a container transhipment terminal capable of handling mega container vessels and analysing the logistic processes that take place on this terminal. The analysis will be performed by a computer simulation in the simulation language PROSIM. The designed transhipment terminal consists of three berths, two feeder berths and one mega vessel berth. The ship to shore container handling takes place by using portainers. The horizontal transportation takes place by rail mounted automated guided vehicles (rgv's) that use linear motor based transfer technology as their source of propulsion. The rgv's take corners by having their wheels rotated by four disks integrated in the rail system. Container storage takes place by stacking containers in racks placed in warehouses. This allows random access to the containers eliminating the time consuming shuffling. With these components a terminal layout has been designed. Based on this layout a computer simulation has been carried out in order to analyse the logistic processes on the terminal. Having assumed an average portainer capacity of 1 move per minute the achieved handling rates lie between 194 moves per hour and the 236 moves per hour for the feeder vessel berths, where the handling takes place by four portainers. The handling rates on the mega vessel berth lie between the 300 moves per hour and the 352 moves per hour. Here the vessel handling takes place by 6 portainers. Portainer occupancy rates of 95-98% have been achieved during the unloading process of the container vessels.","transhipment terminal; logistic processes","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor)","2000","When designing a new port it is important to predict the operation efficiency of the port. In this respect, it is desirable to predict the possible downtime of a new port in an early phase of the design process. Downtime depends strongly on the moored ship motions. In the past decades several numerical models were developed to predict the behaviour of moored ships in waves. They are referred to as Six Degree of Freedom (SDF) models. These models, such as TERMSIM and BAS, are complex and require quite detailed input data. This detailed information is not available in the planning phase of a new port. Consequently, it is desirable to estimate possible downtime by means of a simple model that estimates the ship's behaviour without detailed input data. With this in mind Delft University of Technology started a research programme that consists of a number ofMSc- projects possibly leading to a PhD-project. The research objective of the programme is to investigate the possibilities of simplification of the models used nowadays. In this respect the aim is to find straightforward relationships to describe the behaviour of moored ships subjected to incident waves. It is emphasized that this simplified model is not meant to replace the Six Degree of Freedom models. The simple model is a valuable design tool, to be used in an early stage of the port development process. This report covers one of the MSc-projects defined as ""The analysis of model measurements concerning the behaviour ofmoored ships in long wave "". It concerns the model tests of the planned ""Coega Harbour"" in South Africa. Part of this project is carried out in South Africa, at CSIR (Council for Scientific and Industrial Research), where data of the model tests are available. The aim of the project is to gain insight in the importance of the various parameters and their mutual relations. An important issue is the validation of relationships mentioned in the literature. The main objective is to derive straightforward relations between motions of a moored ship and the wave field near the ship. Hypotheses with regard to the surge, sway and roll motion are derived from the theory of a moored ship. These hypotheses are verified using the data measured in the physical model. This data is limited to one type of ship moored with one type of mooring system inside one specific harbour. Consequently, the conclusions do not contain general validity. Nonetheless, the results present tools that contribute to the understanding of the response of a moored ship to incident waves.","harbour; model test","en","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

For the planning phase of a port or an offshore facility, a need has grown for a model which estimates the ship's behaviour and possible downtime without detailed input data, which is usually not available in this phase. With this in mind Delft University of Technology started a project, of which the part described in this MScproject is defined as ""The analysis of prototype measurements concerning the behaviour of moored ships in long waves."" The data, which are used, are generated in the port of Saldanha Bay in South Africa, where accidents with broken mooring lines had occurred. Part of the research was carried out in Stellenbosch, South Africa, where data are available. A literature study was executed in which was decided to use a one dimensional mass spring system for the calculation of the ship motions in the frequency domain. Also, a semiempirical formula for the calculation of the surge motion [Mol et aI., 1986] was decided to validate using the Saldanha Bay prototype data. Of two ships, respectively 142000 and 224000 DWT, the horizontal ship motions (surge, sway and yaw) were digitised. Digitising was necessary because all digital data of the measurements, executed in the 1980' s, were lost. The choice to use the information about just the horizontal motions was twofold. On the one hand vertical motions (heave, roll and pitch) were hardly measured and on the other hand it is known that long wave energy creates a response which can be found in the range of the natural frequencies of the horizontal motions. The ID mass spring model was executed for the Saldanha Bay data. Most important uncertainties are the stiffness of the mooring system and the character of the excitation. A significant conclusion is the fact that the damping is negligible for the sway motion, while it is clearly present for the surge motion. The cause of the latter is the sheer stress yielded by the fenders. Considering the order of magnitude, the results of the prototype measurements follow the semi-empirical formula for surge reasonably well, although it has to be mentioned that some assumptions regarding the layout of the mooring system were made. The influence of the wave angle remains an important issue in the prediction of ship motions. Because of the mooring system all ship motions are coupled, of which the effect is that for instance head waves can create sway motion. An important recommendation is to execute prototype measurements without the extreme conditions, which occurred in Saldanha Bay. The absence of mooring accidents creates more reliable information about the stiffness of the mooring system.","ship movement; swell; mooring forces; saldanha bay; South Africa","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

Versteiling is het fenomeen, waarbij het profiel zich niet gedraagt als een vormvast evenwichtsprofiel, maar zich ontwikkelt naar een steiler profiel. Dit kenmerkt zich voor de diepe vooroever van de Hollandse kust in dieptelijnen die zich richting de kust begeven, waarbij de dieper gelegen dieptelijnen sneller verschuiven dan de minder diep gelegen dieptelijnen. Voor het onderzoek is er gebruik gemaakt van de doorlodingsgegevens afkomstig van het Rijksinstituut voor Kust en Zee. Deze basisgegevens zijn als kilometer raai beschikbaar voor 8 meetjaren tussen '65 en '97. Allereerst zijn 118 raaien (van Den Helder tot Hoek van Holland), waar tot 3000 meter uit de kust doorlodingen zijn verricht, beschouwd (zie figuur 1.1). Deze doorlodingen beslaan het meest kustwaarts gelegen gedeelte van de diepe vooroever, die loopt van de NAP-8m tot de NAP-20m. Het onderzoek spitst zich vooral toe op de bewegingen van de NAP-8m, NAP-lOm en NAP-l2m dieptelijnen. Eerst wordt er begonnen met het ordenen van de gegevens. Vervolgens worden deze geanalyseerd. Deze analyse gebeurt met behulp van de kleinste kwadraten-methode. Er wordt van uit gegaan dat de ontwikkeling van de diepte van een bepaald punt van de diepe vooroever, kan worden omschreven door een lineaire trendlijn. Per raai wordt er geprobeerd, door middel van het fitten van een rechte lijn door de maximaal 8 geregistreerde diepten van een bepaald punt, de bodembeweging van dat punt, gelegen rond een bepaalde dieptelijn, te beschrijven. De hellingshoek van deze lijn, de trend, geeft de morfologische eigenschappen van het punt weer. Einddoel van dit onderzoek is, om de betrouwbaarheidsintervallen van de gevonden trends aan te geven, zodat de zekerheid van een bepaalde trend bekend is of zodat men weet wanneer een bepaalde zekerheid bereikt gaat worden. Een hogere zekerheid omtrent deze trend is nuttig, om zo afdoende maatregelen te kunnen nemen in het kader van het beleid van 'dynamisch handhaven'. Met het bepalen van de trends en de standaardafwijkingen van de trends is de basis gelegd voor de rest van het onderzoek. Hiema wordt namelijk de afname van de afwijkingen ten opzichte van de trendlijn per meetjaar getoetst. De verwachting is, dat de afwijkingen af zullen nemen met het voortschrijden van de meettechniek in de tijd. Vervolgens is er onderzocht, of het nuttig is de geanalyseerde meetpunten te corrigeren naar de gemiddelen van een hele reeks doorlodingspunten in een strook van 200 meter rond een dieptelijn. Dit zal een afvlakkend effect kunnen hebben op eventuele aanwezige uitschieters.","beach processes; foreshore; coastal morphology","nl","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

Deze introductie is noodzakelijk omdat de politiek, op basis van de eerder genoemde aanbevelingen van de TAW, in een tijdsbestek van twee jaar vraagt om een landelijk beeld van de overstromingskansen. Hetgeen inhoudt dat in een kort tijdsbestek, grote hoeveelheden overstromingskansberekeningen (voor alle 53 dijkringgebieden) uitgevoerd moeten gaan worden, onvermijdelijk deels door personen die geen of nauwelijks ervaring hebben met de methode. Met behulp van de nieuwe methode (in het vervolg aangeduid als PC_RING) en de resultaten uit het SPRINT onderzoek naar de grootte van de 'actuele' overstromingskansen, kan bepaald worden hoe groot de investeringskosten zouden moeten zijn, om de overstromingskans van een dijkringgebied te reduceren tot een bepaald (maatschappelijk/politiek gewenst) veiligheidsniveau (normstelling). Voor zo'n benadering is het echter noodzakelijk te beschikken over een gevoeligheidsanalyse van de invloed van de verschillende ontwerpparameters op de faalkans van een dijkvak. De huidige versie van PC_RING is op dit moment (nog) niet in staat om op een snelle en efficiente manier deze zogenaamde ontwerpparameter invloeden te bepalen, zodat een beeld van de grootte van de investeringskosten dan ook nog ontbreekt. Doelstellingen (1) Het ontwikkelen van een rekenprocedure waarmee de invloed van investeringskosten van verschillende soorten verbeteringsmaatregelen op de overstromingskans van een dijkringgebied zichtbaar kan worden gemaakt om vervolgens een voorstel te doen om op een optimale manier de overstromingskans van een dijkringgebied te reduceren tot een bepaald veiligheidsniveau.

(mentor)","2000","Breakwaters can be divided into two maintypes: the classic (rubblemound) type breakwater and the vertical (caisson) type breakwater. In general it is assumed that vertical type breakwaters are more economic than classic type breakwaters, due to the quadratic increase of volume of material needed for the classic type breakwater as a function of the waterdepth. In addition to the vertical (composed) type breakwater which has a linear increase. In this study an inquiry has been made to determine the influence of other factors (besides waterdepth) on the economic choice between a classic type breakwater or a vertical type breakwater. To make a fair comparison between the two breakwater types, the influence of the factors on the economic optimal crossection design has been determined. In order to generate economically optimal crossections of both classic and vertical breakwaters an economic optimization model has been made. This model generates, after input of locally dependent hydraulic, geotechnical and economic boundary conditions and material properties, economically optimal crossections for both types of breakwaters. Apart from this the model generates (also for non-economically optimal crossections) total lifetime cost (construction cost and risk), (optimal) chances of failure and material quantities. The model also generates the contribution (in percentage) ofthe different stochastic variables towards the total chance of failure. To determine the risk three scenarios of failure have been taken into account: 1) Transmitted waves behind the breakwater are too high resulting in a disturbance of the transshipment operation (SLS). 2) Transmitted waves behind the breakwater are too high so that entrance to the harbour will be prevented (SLS). 3) Collapsing ofthe breakwater which also leads to a decrease of the protection of the harbour from scenarios 1 and 2 (ULS). In this study the model is applied to an existing case: the Noorderdam breakwater belonging to the project of extension of Maasvlakte 2, near Hook of Holland. It appears that the totallifetome cost of the classic type breakwater is 18% higher than the vertical type breakwater. For both types of breakwaters the total lifetime cost exists of +//-90% construction cost and +/-10% risk. Because of this the economic choice between both types of breakwaters is mainly determined by factors which influence this construction cost. The construction cost for the classic type breakwater is determined for 50% by the cost ofrubblemound in the core. The construction cost for the vertical type breakwater is determined for 75% by the cost ofthe concrete in the caisson. The risk of the classic type breakwater is mainly determined by the occurrence of scenario 1 and for the vertical type breakwater only by the occurrence of scenario 3. The risk for both types of breakwaters is mainly determined by the uncertainty in the hydraulic boundary conditions. For the Noorderdam breakwater a sensitivity analysis has been carried out to determine the influence of certain factors on the optimal choice of breakwater type, which shows that the waterdepth indeed influences greatly the choice of breakwater type. Other factors which greatly influence the economic choice are the unit price ofconcrete and rubblemound. If these are not known with an accuracy of +1-25%, nothing definite can be said about the choice. The scenario 3 damage cost, the percentage ofconcrete ofthe caisson, the length and the planned lifetime of the breakwater can't influence this choice. In this study only 7 factors have been analysed. However, with the designed economic optimization model the sensitivity of more factors can be analysed. Certain factors can be changed at the same time also.","breakwater; optimisation","nl","master thesis","TU Delft, Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Hydraulic Engineering","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","","","","",""

(mentor); van der Kooi, H.J. (mentor)","2000","In general the food industry shows much awareness of sustainability. In my point of view progress towards a sustainable food production chain will become more and more important on the following levels: Consumers become more critical about the safety of food, they notice special marks to food products like biological food and they care more about the environment than in the past; Food companies are asking for more detailed information (like production conditions, genetic modification) from their suppliers. On the other hand, food processing companies are always requested to decrease the environmental pressure by lowering emissions, recycling waste materials etc, like in the petrochemical industry. Most companies also perform LCA to take a closer look in terms of the environment at their production processes; The primary sector (agriculture) has shown the highest and broadest impact on the environment within the food production chain and focuses on good social working conditions. By performing a more sustainable tillage, the agricultural sector is able to distinguish itself from others. Sustainability is very subjective subject: each company has its own opinion (ecological, social or economic focus) and thinks to act sustainable by following their own guidelines. However, I am of the opinion that applying one. general program on sustainability in different countries with different cultures and on a short term and long term base will not be effective. A better solution would be the development of general guidelines by authorities that can be applied as a check for actions taken in agriculture and food processing industry. Here a quantification of sustainability can result in a more objective answer. Also company activities to support a sustainable chain should be rewarded like it has been the case with biological agriculture. Because a company is part of the total production chain, it depends on and influences sustainable development of others. In my opinion, a sustainable food chain can only be reached if the single parts are more transparent, cooperate with each other and show responsibility. This can only be done if there is an objective check by for example the authorities. Performing in this way will not only result in an ecological environment which is usually seen as the most important aspect of sustainability, but also will create better social circumstances as well as a good economic situation. For example, poor labor conditions can not be 'hidden' anymore resulting in an honest price paid from suppliers to clients…","","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Scheikundige Technologie en der Materiaalkunde","","Applied Thermodynamics and Phase Equilibria","",""
