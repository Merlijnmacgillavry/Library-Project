(mentor); Tromp, N. (mentor)","2012","Using Mekel Park, the unfrequented green area of TUDelft as a study-case, the project provides both theoretical foundation and practical application to increase and foster the use of public space involving its community. Few years ago the central public space of TUDelft campus was completely renovated with the creation of a green area called Mekel Park. Nowadays, even if it offer a pleasant environment, the park is not frequently experienced by the TUDelft community. With the aim to transform Mekel Park into an attractive destination for the TUDelft community, different in-filed researches were conducted to gain a better understanding of the site and to help establish the problem definition of the project. Due to the fact that the park is located in an academic environment, an extensive literature study regarding public interventions in campuses and community creation was conducted. The insides highlighted that promoting sense of community and supporting recreational activities were the key elements to create a lively environment within the academic setting. The everyday experience people had with the park was included as a defining element for the formulation of the design statement that aimed to improve the current use of Mekel Park providing an explorative experience that would involve and keep the TUDelft community coming to the place and return again . To define the characteristics of the public intervention in the park, a “place oriented approach” called Placemaking was introduced in which community are encouraged to actively participate to the creation of a common vision of the public space. Adopting participatory techniques, the Placemaking approach was applied to Mekel Park. The vision of the TUDelft students helped framing the design direction of the project, that combined with the insides of the research phase of the project led to the creation of a community of readers at TUDelft. The final concept Blove is a pavilion for a shared library in which people can lend, borrow, donate and suggest books to friends, colleagues and fellow students of the university. The community platform is supported by a smartphone application. Inspired by the spatial qualities of second hand marked, the design of the pavilion combined to the fact that the library will always have new books aims to enhance the explorative experience that will keep people coming back to the park. The project has been tested with an experience prototype, face to face interviews and paper prototype (smartphone application). The success of the one week trial and the request to extend for a longer period the experiment showed a high interest and participation from the Industrial Design Ingeneering community. However, to understand the real potential of the project, the Blove library should be tested in its real context of use.","public space; service design; community creation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor)","2012","Het onderhouden van printers is een complexe taak waar service monteurs speciaal voor opgeleid moeten worden. De technicus heeft een heel scala aan software tools tot zijn beschikking om deze taak beter uitvoerbaar te maken. Onder andere de Software Engineering 1 (SE1) afdeling binnen het Research & Development departement van Océ Technologies B.V. in Venlo werkt aan het verbeteren van deze software tools. Voor het repareren en onderhouden van printers staan er drie grote software pakketten tot de monteur zijn beschikking, zogenaamde service software tools. Dit zijn het Service Diagnostic System (SDS), de Star tool suite en het Technical Service Manual (TSM). Alle drie deze software pakketten zijn aan vernieuwing toe en onder andere SE1 is druk bezig de nodige software aan te pakken. In de huidige organisatie binnen Océ is het niet de taak van SE1 om bepaalde delen van de service software tools aan te pakken. Het doel van onze opdracht is daarom te kijken naar delen van de software pakketten waar bedrijfstakken binnen Océ goed samen kunnen werken (waar dat nu nog niet gebeurd) en te onderzoeken waar verbeteringen mogelijk zijn. Dit hebben we gedaan door ons eerst op de service tooling te oriënteren, waarna wij onszelf het beste zagen werken aan het TSM. Het TSM is een documentatie systeem waarin alle kennis die Océ heeft over zijn printers gepresenteerd wordt. Plannen voor ons nieuwe TSM systeem, genaamd DynamicTSM, zijn hierna uitgewerkt en deels geïmplementeerd. Het uiteindelijke product is een prototype van het DynamicTSM systeem dat wij ontworpen hebben aan de hand van 5 verschillende ‘entry-points’. Dit zijn Diagnose door Error Codes, Diagnose door Symptomen, Preventive Maintenance, Modification en Installation. De 5 entry-points voor het DynamicTSM zijn ook de 5 redenen waarom een monteur bij een klant op bezoek gaat. Voor elk van de entry-points hebben wij ‘documentatie pagina’s’ ontworpen, waarvan alleen de Diagnose door error codes pagina’s geïmplementeerd zijn. De informatie die nodig is om de pagina’s te vullen wordt uit de bron XML bestanden van het huidige TSM gehaald. Uiteindelijk is gebleken dat er geen 1 op 1 conversie mogelijk is van het normale TSM naar het DynamicTSM, omdat de bron XML niet goed gestructureerd is. Hierom hebben wij een aantal aanbevelingen gedaan die de structuur van de bron XML verbeteren. Ten einde onze aanbevelingen te implementeren zullen er wijzigingen in de bron TSM aangebracht moete worden. Dit kan stapsgewijs gebeuren, bepaalde wijzigingen in de bron zullen bepaalde aanbevelingen mogelijk maken. Uiteindelijk zal er wel een redelijk deel van het TSM op de schop moeten om alle functionaliteit van ons DynamicTSM te kunnen benutten. Dit heeft als voordeel dat er, naast het implementeren van het DynamicTSM, nog veel meer gedaan kan worden met het TSM door de computer. Zeer waarschijnlijk ook functies waar wij niet eens aan gedacht hebben.","","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","","","","",""

Chopper amplifiers are attractive in applications where high DC precision is required, due to their low offset, drift & 1/f noise. They are generally used in the analog signal chain to boost weak sensor signals and buffer them to an analog-to-digital converter. Till recent years, research related to chopper amplifiers has focused on techniques to reduce their low frequency voltage errors and exploring effective techniques to suppress chopper-ripple. A superior performance on both these fronts has been achieved. However, at the cost of significantly large input currents (>100pA) and input current noise (>100fA/ Hz), thus limiting their usage to sensors with low source impedance (<10k?). In this work, a novel input-chopper architecture is proposed, implemented and measured. It achieves a 2.5X improvement in input-current compared to the state-of-the-art in chopper amplifiers with a singlepoint trim. The proposed technique also reduces the common mode variation of the input current to 4.5pA/V, which is an indication of a high common mode rejection ratio in a high source impedance (>1M?) application.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-07-19","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2012","In 2009, Department of Water Management (DWM) at TU Delft conceptualized the design of a low-cost disdrometer suitable for large scale, remote deployment. But, being a novel idea, its electrical characteristics were not well researched. Also, the system was not sensitive enough to measure the raindrops of diameter less than 0.9mm. Furthermore, it was found that the proposed disdrometer suffers from the edge effect i.e. when a raindrop hits on the edge of the disdrometer; the size of the raindrop is underestimated. All the aforementioned issues have been addressed in this research. The presented work discusses the electrical characteristics of the disdrometer. A readout circuit has been designed to improve the performance of the disdrometer and an innovative technique has been developed to solve the problem of edge effect. The impedance response of the disdrometer has been analyzed and an equivalent electrical model of the proposed disdrometer has been developed and characterized. Furthermore, an elaborative analysis of the edge effect has been presented. Based on this analysis, an innovative technique has been proposed for reducing the edge-effect. This technique uses the envelope of the transducer’s output to determine if the drop hit on edge. Also, a low-power (17.8mA@5V), low-noise (7.8µVrms) readout circuit has been designed. This readout circuit is able to measure the drops of size as low as 0.4mm. Because of the achieved results, this disdrometer is attracting a lot of attention of various groups from industry as well as from academia. A group of researchers from the DWM, TU Delft is looking forward to turn it in to a commercial product.","Disdrometer; Piezoelectric; Rainguage; Piezoceramic Modelling; Rainfall; Rainrate; Trans-African Hydro-Meteorological Observatory; TAHMO; Edge Effect; Acoustic Disdrometer; Low Cost Disdrometer; Piezoelectric Diaphragm; Piezoelectric Diaphragm Modelling; Edge Detection","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Electronic Instrumentation","",""

(mentor)","2012","The Cryosat-2 mission is an European Space Agency mission with the main objective to measure and monitor the variation in sea-ice and main ice sheets on Earth, located at Greenland and Antarctic. The satellite's main instrument is a state of the art altimeter, which can measure the distance between the satellite and the ice surface with extreme accuracy. To extract the variation in height of the ice surfaces from these measurements, it is important to know where the satellite was at the time of the measurements. The method that is used to obtain this is called Precise Orbit Determination (POD). POD combines accurate measurements together with physical models related to the satellite, in such a way that it can determine accurate orbit solutions for the satellite. This report is a discussion about the validation and improvement of the orbit determination of the Cryosat-2 mission. The current orbit determination process that is available is validated on three different subjects. First, a new data format for Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) measurements was investigated, which is called the Consolidated Ranging Data format. SLR measurements are accurate range measurements that are used to validate the orbit of Cryosat-2. A converter is written that could convert the new data format, in such a way that the current orbit determination software could use it. Several features of the new data format were examined, for potential improvements. The second investigation was about the generation of the Doris beacon coordinates and their effect on the POD. The Doris system is the main orbit determination system onboard the satellite. Due to different abrupt and slow motions of the Earth surface, the Doris beacons moves with respect to the defined reference frame. A new definition of the Doris beacon coordinates, called DPOD2008, is used in the Cryosat-2 orbit estimation. The solution of the coordinates sets were validated and other coordinate sets were used, to conclude that DPOD2008 was generating the best orbit solution for Cryosat-2. The final investigation was on the solar radiation pressure modeling of Cryosat-2. Currently, a 6-panel box model is used as defined by ESA. In the empirical residual accelerations a signal is visible which has correlation with the solar radiation pressure. It was decided to use micro models generated by the University College London at the research group of Prof. Marek Ziebart for the solar radiation pressure computations. Two micro models are constructed, although the implementation of the UCL models in the GEODYN software is delivering unsuspected results. Several bugs are fixed or bypassed in the implementation of the models, but still clear differences between the internal GEODYN model and the UCL model implementation are visible. Recommendations are given for further research in the micro model investigation for the solar radiation pressure computation.","Precise orbit determination; Cryosat; Satellite Laser Ranging","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-04-11","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","Astrodynamics & Space Missions","",""

The model developed is intended to serve as an ex-ante assessment tool that policy makers or researchers can use to assess how desired policies and initiatives will affect an urban freight system. The strength of Repast Simphony is its object orientated nature, the protocols it contains to support agent-based modeling and its GIS-based visualization capabilities. Its object orientated nature allows for flexibility in adding and modifying individual agents or agent groups. Protocols it provides are contexts, watchers and schedulers. Contexts can contain agents or other agent-contexts that specify how agents or agent-groups are related to each other. Watcher is the protocol that enables agents to interact with each other and the scheduler-protocol can be used to enable agents to behave independent of the actions of other agents.","City logistics; Agent-based modeling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-03-30","Technology, Policy and Management","TLO","","","",""

(mentor); Scholten, V.E. (mentor); Van der Voort, H.G. (mentor); Hulsink, W. (mentor)","2012","Over the last decades, biotechnology has become a very promising industry and is seen as a key area for thriving innovation in the future. In order to realize this potential for their economies, many countries including the Netherlands have made special policies containing governmental subsidies and credits aimed to increase the number of biotechnology startups and help them in becoming a success. This report has as goal to measure the impact of one of these credits, namely governmental subsidized hire-purchase facilities for biotechnology startups. If such a startup is in need of specialized equipment or facility they can apply for a hire-purchase investment. The foundation which governs the funds, called Mibiton checks this application and if it is granted the machinery is bought by them and hired to the applicant, who has to pay a representative monthly fee for its use. Beforehand a period is determined in which the company pays for the total value of the machine and when the period is finished the ownership is converted to them. With regard to the measurement of the impact of such a fund an interesting discussion applies. It is argued in the literature that governmental sponsorship can be positive or negative for a starting company, depending whether the investments are helping to strengthen the company’s initial strategic and competitive advantages or are creating an extra advantage with the extra resources. In the last case there is the risk that a company can become too dependent on the sponsorship in order to compete with its competitor, which leads to big problems when the sponsorship finished and ultimately the company can go bankrupt if it is not able to turn around to a more sustainable situation. There is however no tool available that can easily show both the financial and strategically impact of a hire-purchase investment for the companies, the fund and the sector as a whole. So in this report a special measurement protocol is developed based on three sub instruments. First of all a multiplier is used which expresses the social-economical revenues directly for the company, indirectly for its customers and suppliers and as induced effects for the society as a whole. Not only the financial data is included in the revenues, but also estimates are included of the revenues by employee growth, knowledge increase, etc. The problem with the multiplier is that it neglects the induced investments effects, which are the extra revenues caused by a shorter development time or time-to-market. In order to capture these effects the second sub instrument is the accelerator which expresses the decrease on a time-scale. However both instruments are still not measuring whether the investments are giving strategically or competitive advantages and therefore the impact effect is introduced which divides the investments into four categories ranging from no advantage to major advantages. In the background interviews done for this research another interesting problem was mentioned. It was said to be very hard to get a private hire-purchase investment because the equipment in the biotechnology sector has a fast depreciation period and as there are no second-hand market investors see it as a too risky investment and certainly at startups that are also lacking a track record. However there is very little research done in the literature to either confirm or dismiss this claims. Therefore this report is aiming to fill this gap. In order to measure the impact managers and directors of nineteen companies are interviewed. With the data gathered from these interviews there is tried to find the multiplier revenues, the acceleration and the impact effect for each of the companies. Also there is tried to look into the importance of equipment for these companies and the problems with financing them. Finally there is looked to the trends represented by the figures and conclusions are drawn upon them. After looking into the results it can be concluded that Mibiton investments in general have a strategically effect on the companies and the fund can therefore be put in the category of credits giving a strategically and competitive advantage for companies. This is illustrated by the fact that 17 of the 19 companies have experienced a decrease in development time and 12 of them where in the highest two categories of the impact effect. Also the average direct effect multiplier of 3.11 and the average acceleration of 10.7 months are relatively high and are therefore confirming this picture. There should be noted that it was not possible to get solid figures for the indirect and induced effect multiplier as only very 5 companied could make an estimate of the effects for their suppliers and customers and only 1 company could say something about the effects for the sector and society. Also many of the interviewed companies affirmed that equipment and facilities are very important for the Life Sciences sector and that it was very difficult to finance them. So also the extra claim is confirmed in this report. Finally the main contribution of this report lies in the developed tool to measure the impact, including the multiplier, accelerator and impact effect. For further research it could be very interesting to develop this tool even more and check its range and shortcomings. Also it would be interesting to check the impact of other governmental credits to determine what the best tool is.","Impact measurement; Biotech equipment; Hire-purchase fund; Biotech startups; Government credit","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-03-29","Technology, Policy and Management","Management of Technology","","Technology, Strategy & Entrepreneurship","",""

(mentor)","2012","A lack of cohesion is often associated with bad software quality, and could lead to more changes and bugs in software. In this thesis the impact of cohesion on the change-proneness of Java interfaces is investigated. Showing the existence of a relation between these concepts can lead to better change prediction models that can support software developers in defect prediction and prevention tasks. An empirical study is performed on several open source projects to test three hypotheses. The first hypothesis investigates whether cohesion metrics correlate with the number of fine-grained source code changes. The results of the correlation analysis show a correlation between two cohesion metrics and the number of changes in Java interfaces. The confounding effect of class size is a possible explanation for the correlation between the cohesion metrics and the number of fine-grained changes. This idea is investigated through the second hypothesis, which studies the correlation between the cohesion metrics and interface size metrics. The hypothesis is accepted for the same two metrics. The third hypothesis of this thesis tries to answer whether cohesion metrics can improve change prediction models based on size. By performing three different experiments with multiple classification algorithms, we have found no evidence that supports the final hypothesis. Concluding, cohesion metrics can be used to predict changes in source code. However, they are not better predictors than size metrics, and we have found no evidence to support the idea that they can improve change prediction models based on size.","cohesion; interfaces; change prediction; change-proneness; source code metrics; software quality; Java","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-04-03","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Engineering","","","",""

Therefore this research is interested in a quality improvement method which can be applied in a multi-department setting, whereby different departments have their own goals, own working methods and incentives which may be conflicting. This lead to the main research question: How to improve the performance of an organization within the process industry by implementing improvement measures in different sub-systems with their individual objects and working methods?","Lean Six Sigma; Quality improvement method; Organization structures","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-03-13","Technology, Policy and Management","Infrastructure Systems & Services","","Energie & Industrie","",""

(mentor); Rook, L. (mentor); Kwee, Z. (mentor)","2012","Introduction of a new product in the market brings new opportunities to a company but also involves many risks. Many companies cease to exist in this turbulent period, even before the technology reaches mass-diffusion. In this study we look at the processes in the period of pre-diffusion and in particular in the market adaptation phase. With this thesis, we try to identify the set of most important variables at play and use this set to model these processes. We use this to provide an answer on how to successfully predict the length of the market adaptation phase, with the data available at/or prior to the start of the phase. Three different approaches were tried: the simple audit, extended audit and Monte Carlo simulation. Our findings indicate that there is no single/basic, minimum and universal set of variables suitable for prediction/modeling. Rather, the minimum set of variables depends on the type of model, type of industry, complexity and the number of available data. Furthermore, we show that the performance of the models heavily depends on the amount of the data available. The main conclusion of this thesis is that a successful prediction of the length of the market adaptation phase is indeed possible but that it requires a careful consideration of quality and availability of the data, the choice of variables for modeling, initial conditions of the model and the choice of the model itself. In our case, the implementation of the Monte Carlo algorithm in the simulation of the process proved to provide the best results.","pre-diffusion; high-tech; simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-03-01","Technology, Policy and Management","Technology, Strategy and Entrepreneurship","","","",""

(mentor)","2012","In this project a challenge in the field of minimally invasive surgery is addressed. Contemporary minimally invasive instruments usually consist of a rigid beam with an end effector on one side and a controlling mechanism on the other. These instruments work well for cases when the body can be entered in such a way that the target, on which to operate, is reachable in a straight line. When it is not possible to reach the target in a straight line, a new solution is necessary. This thesis proposes to replace the rigid beam with a robotic tentacle. The tentacle considered in this thesis is modeled after an Ionic Polymer-Metal Composite (IPMC) which is an Electro-Active Polymer (EAP), a material which mechanically deforms once put in an electric field. Electromechanical properties of the IPMC are combined with a layered geometric configuration of strips of IPMC to construct the tentacle. An electromechanical simulation model is constructed followed by the design of a curvature controller. The performance of the controller is analyzed in simulation. The results obtained from the simulation prove the concept of the robotic tentacle made of strips of IPMC as a possible solution to improve reaching capabilities of contemporary minimally invasive surgical instruments.","System & Control; Mechanical Engineering; Modelling principles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-05-25","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Centre for Systems and Control","","","",""

(mentor); Jongbloed, G. (mentor); Loog, M. (mentor)","2012","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a type of dementia which is difficult to diagnose based on clinical observations. Many automated classification algorithms are being developed to aid in the diagnosis. In such algorithms, principal components analysis (PCA) is a popular tool to reduce the dimension of data, get rid of noise and redundancy and thereby improve the classification. As PCA is a form of unsupervised learning, i.e. it relies entirely on the input data itself without reference to the corresponding target data, it does not make use of any available information about group structure. Applying PCA to data containing high within-group inter-subject variability, and possibly only subtle differences between the groups, as is the case for people with stable mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and people with MCI which will convert to being diagnosed with AD, might not improve classification results much since the outcome of PCA will be spoiled by the high variance between the subjects. In this study new methods will be introduced that take into account the available information on group structure to select features or principal components. One approach is based on minimizing the similarity between the principal components of two groups using the concept of computing angles between subspaces generated by these principal components, while the other is based on logistic regression. These novel methods are evaluated and compared to the conventional methods by their classification performance on data consisting of brain volumes, which were extracted from MRI data obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), using logistic regression classification, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), and support vector machines (SVMs). Given only 10-15% of subjects with MCI convert to AD each year, it is necessary to correct for imbalance in the data. This is done for logistic regression by optimizing the threshold and in SVM by optimizing a cost parameter that assigns different costs to each class. Compared to using all features as well as to the conventional application of PCA, where the dimension is reduced by selecting the first principal components accounting for a certain percentage of the variance in the data, application of several of these supervised dimension reduction methods to the ADNI data shows improved classification results.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics","","","",""

(mentor); Van den Dobbelsteen, J.J. (mentor); Van Gerwen, D. (mentor)","2012","Epidural anesthesia is a commonly used anesthesia method during surgery or giving birth to a child. During the insertion of the needle in the back of the patient, the anesthetist has to interpret the different forces which requires extensive skills. To obtain these skills the residents train on patients, which is not without risk. Due to a lot of variation in anatomy of the human body, the identification of the tissues can be very difficult. An epidural anesthesia simulator can reduce this risk by offering anesthetists the opportunity to experience the differences in force and pressure feedback of the different tissues before moving on to patients. In literature only very little is available about needle-tissue interation around the epidural space. To collect data about tissue resistance during the insertion of an epidural needle, tests were done on living piglets. These animal tests were done at Erasmus MC, Rotterdam. During needle insertion, the position of the needle was captured along with the force on the needle and the pressure in the needle. Pressure measurements were used for the epidural space identification. The most important force feedback during the insertion is a force-peak which occurs by puncturing the ligamentum flavum. At the moment the needle tip enters the epidural space, a pressure-drop in the needle occurs which is the most important pressure feedback. The measured force-peak with a 18G epidural needle can be described by an lognormal distribution and lies in the 68.3% confidence interval of 5.45 till 11.03 N and has an geometric mean of 7.754 N. The distance between the force-peak event and the pressure-drop event can be described with a normal distribution with a mean of 1.17 mm (s=1.217), where a positive value means that the force event occurs before the pressure-drop. The experimental results showed that there is no systematic difference in force peaks between piglets and neither between vertebrea. The measured pressure data showed that the pressure gradient is time-dependent when using a constant flow of liquid. Since it is unknown if an eventually ’tissue absorption’ ratio of the ligamentum flavum is velocity dependent, no valid statements can be done based on this data. Another observation was that the force-peaks measured in deceased tissue (1-5h) are in the same range as the force-peaks in living tissue.","epidural; medical simulation; force feedback","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-09-23","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

Design of the Volans Coastal","Van Schaijk, A.","Jansen, A.J. (mentor); Keuning, J.A. (mentor)","2012","In July 2011, the Volans2 was introduced on the market. It is a single skull, recreational rowing boat designed for a wide public to make the rowing sport more accessible. The design is compact and light, challenging for rowers of variable levels. The implementation of a sliding rigger system (in which the rigger slides instead of the seat) creates advantages for balance and speed. As the company is willing to extend their product portfolio, the development of a recreational coastal rowing boat is the next step. This coastal rowing boat will be used up to a kilometer from the shore. The analysis starts with research in the field of rowing and naval architecture. This information is used to investigate the context and the competition of the Volans Coastal. It seems there is a lot of competition in the market that can be classified in open water shells, coastal rowing shells and other crafts like kayaks, surf skis and wave skis. All combine sport and leisure in the same environment. The classification of the rowing shells is based on design. The open water shells look very similar to recreational coastal rowing shells like the Volans2. They are symmetrical, more stable than race rowing shells and aim to prevent the boat from catching water. Coastal rowing shells have asymmetrical hull shapes, are self bailing, and are even more stable. They are designed for one of two purposes: speed or touring on the head seas. To stand out when competing in the existing market, the Volans Coastal needs some unique selling points. A specified assignment describes what the design should be like, based on the results of the research. First, the boat has to be practical. Meaning that it should be lighter than its competitors and easy in transport and installation so the focus will be on the actual row. The design should fit the company’s looks and feel, being stable but still fast and challenging. Most important, the design should distinguish itself by offering an unique experience of play and fun in surf. The design should function in the headseas as well without concessions in speed and performance. A coastal rowing test was done with the Volans2 and the Virus Turbo skiff which can be said to be the biggest competitor of the Volans Coastal. These boats are repeatedly used as reference during the development of the Volans Coastal. After a process of idea generation and concept development, three possible concepts are presented. Each of them offers a solution from another perspective. A selection is made using the optimalisation criteria based on the reference boats. From there on, the hull design is finished and optimized. To function in both situations, the final hull shape is designed initially for maneuverability and positioning in the surf. To optimize the hull shape for the head seas, a skeg is implemented in the hull providing directional stability. The wave piercing characteristics of the bow and the specific shape of the stern contribute to the desirable sailing and surfing characteristics attaining high speeds. The shell is equipped with hatches, carrier straps, and a carry handle to improve the user friendliness. An integrated bailing system discharges surplus water while the deck design fits the typical looks of company. The evaluation of the design is executed theoretically, since a full scale model is not yet finished. So far, the design fulfils its requirements. However, testing in real life will evaluate the design thoroughly and will probably show some points for improvement for further design stages.","design; rowing; boat","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

An increment of the range of motion is desired to expand the field of applications. The goal of this paper is to develop a compact one degree of freedom mechanical gravity equilibrator that can statically balance a rotating pendulum over an unlimited range of motion. Static balance over an unlimited range of motion is achieved by a coaxial gear train that uses non circular gears. These gears convert the continuous rotation of the pendulum into a reciprocating rotation of the torsion bars. The shape of these gears are specifically designed to balance a rotating pendulum. Our gear train design and the method to calculate the parameters and the shape of the non circular gears are presented. A prototype is designed and built to validate that the presented method can balance a pendulum over an unlimited range of motion.

(mentor)","2012","A study is performed analyzing the behavioral adaptation of pilots in skill based ramp tracking tasks performed with pursuit display. From data analyses of previous ramp tracking experiments an indication is found that pilots who repeatedly perform the same ramp tracking task show a high level of adaptation to characteristics of the control task in their behavior. From the theory of Successive Organization of Perception it is expected that this development progresses towards precognitive behavior. To get to a better understanding of the transition between pursuit behavior and precognitive behavior, a pursuit ramp tracking and disturbance rejection experiment is performed to further study this. For this four conditions with a different ramp steepness are used in blocks of ten runs, with eight similar ramps in each run. Two sessions are performed, one ordered session where the same condition is performed ten times consecutively and a random session, where conditions are presented in random order. After each block of ten ordered runs also a surprise run with a different condition is presented. The behavior is analyzed using performance metrics and by performing a time-domain parametric identification of a combined compensatory and feedforward pilot model. The behavior is analyzed in three ways: first by using the averaged data of the final five runs as steady-state behavior, then by using the data per run to investigate the development over the runs and finally the data per ramp is analyzed to investigate developments within a run. The surprise runs are analyzed over the entire run and per ramp. From performance and behavioral metrics no difference in ramp tracking behavior is shown when conditions are presented consecutively as opposed to randomly. From the model parameters though, it was found that the difference in behavior is predominantly visible in the feedforward pilot gain, and it is shown that the difference in behavior is mostly apparent in the first ramps of each tracking run. After the first two ramps, the pilots are found to already have adjusted their behavior towards their optimal control setting. From the surprise runs strong indications were found that pilots need more time to adjust after being conditioned in the previous ten runs to a different condition. This suggests that pilots use precognitive control strategies when they are more experienced in the task performed and think they know what to expect.

A method introduced to produce wormlike micelles is the ‘emulsification and solvent evaporation’ method, but the formation mechanism behind this method is not yet fully understood. The aim of this work is to study whether the lengths of the wormlike micelles formed depends on the size of the droplets in the emulsion. Wormlike micelles were formed by dissolving polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene oxide), or PS-PEO, in chloroform, and mixing this into an emulsion with water containing NaCl through vigorous stirring. Interfacial instabilities between the water and chloroform phase caused by increased concentrations of polymer lead to the formation of wormlike micelles. Effects of varying stirring rates and times on the size of the chloroform droplets in the emulsion as well as the lengths of wormlike micelle sizes were studied by analysis through optical and fluorescence microscopy. The droplets were found to be polydisperse and stable for timescales up to a few minutes, but the diameters decrease during the course of mixing the emulsion. Wormlike micelles start to form directly when the chloroform and water phases are brought in contact. When mixing occurs more vigorously the average length of wormlike micelles increases and their distributions becomes broader. Interestingly, wormlike micelles produced using this method grow to lengths up to 1 mm.","wormlike micelles; self-assembly; emulsification and solvent evaporation; polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene oxide)","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Chemical Engineering","","Product and Process Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2012","Nowadays, Monte Carlo integration is a popular tool for estimating high-dimensional, complex integrals. Its scope of application can be widened if ways can be found to produce estimates with smaller variance at the same computational cost. Variance reduction techniques aim to accomplish this. In particular, using importance sampling with the so-called zero-variance distribution would result in a simulation procedure with variance zero. Unfortunately the zero-variance distribution cannot be constructed in practice, as it requires knowledge of the value to be estimated. In this thesis we look at how iterative approximation of the zero-variance distribution can be exploited to yield more efficient Monte Carlo simulations, a technique called adaptive importance sampling. We will explore the characteristics of existing methods for adaptive importance sampling, and prove some generic limit theorems for such methods. Based on the methods by Ping Zhang, which use kernel density estimation to approximate the zero-variance distribution, we then propose Maximally Adaptive Nonparametric Importance Sampling. This variation aims to make better use of the information available by updating its approximation to the zero-variance distribution after every generated sample. We will show that the method (when using n samples) yields an estimator with an asymptotic variance of O(ln(n)n^{-7/6}), faster than methods (eventually) based on i.i.d. replicates. We illustrate the empirical convergence of the method with a simulation experiment, and briefly discuss the issues and considerations related to application of the method in practice.","Monte Carlo; Importance Sampling; variance reduction; Adaptive Importance Sampling; nonparametric; kernel density estimator; zero-variance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied mathematics","","Probability","",""

Extrusion results in block shaped buildings. The main problem with these 3D models is that they do not represent height differences within a building. This thesis presents a method to improve building footprints by subdivision into parts describing height differences and roof shapes. These improved building footprints are used for creating 3D models by separate extrusion of each of these parts. Applying this method results in 3D building models with multiple heights. Several subjects are discussed in this thesis: generalization, decomposition, segmentation, 3D geometry reconstruction and their validation. This research is based on the combination of two existing methods, one for generalization and decomposition of building footprints, and one for segmentation of point clouds. These methods are extended and problems are solved by including: (1) direction of lines, (2) best fitting line, (3) adjacent buildings, (4) preservation of holes, (5) handling of slant lines, (6) quality statistics and (7) validation. The existing generalization method creates topology errors which are reduced by including knowledge from adjacent buildings. Decomposed building footprints are merged based on the segmented point cloud. The resulting decomposition is a subdivision describing multiple roof shapes and height jumps, based on linear features in the building footprint. Reconstruction of the actual 3D geometry is performed by extrusion of the decomposition cells. The resulting reconstruction is a Level of Detail 1 (LoD) model with height differences. To test the usability of the improved footprints for reconstruction of a LoD2 model, parametric shape fitting is applied. These tests are executed using a small set of roof shapes proving the usability. All reconstructed 3D building geometries are validated using Oracle Spatial 11g. In order to analyze, test and improve the developed algorithms, a prototype is implemented in C++. This prototype is tested intensively with several real-world data sets. Results from these tests are proving proper functioning of the developed method and support the conclusions.","building footprint; point cloud; generalization; decomposition; segmentation; 3D geometry reconstruction; 3D geometry validation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","OTB Research Institute for the Built Environment","GIS Technology","","Geomatics","",""

They focus on the economic and social benefits that ICTs will bring Europe. In the Netherlands, national and local governments are working on the implementation of 2015.eu’s agenda (2010-2015). As it is difficult to satisfy all stakeholders, the implementation process of former European Digital Agenda’s in EU Member States did not go smoothly. TNO, one of Europe’s largest Research and Technology Organizations, is taking a role with realizing 2015.eu agenda’s objectives. The difficulties with EDAs’ implementation provide an opportunity for TNO to prove its added value with realizing European level initiatives. This research wishes to contribute to structuring the implementation process of 2015.eu agenda’s objectives. To do so, a systematic approach for establishing innovation systems in the Dutch e-health domain is provided. The e-health domain is selected as urgency for change is enormous due to rising costs of treatments, a rising demand for healthcare, and a reducing active population. Innovation systems can develop service innovations for the future e-health domain by 2020, to which 2015.eu agenda’s objectives can contribute. 4th generation innovation systems have proven their usability to map complex systems of stakeholders. The main research question is: How to develop innovation systems in the Dutch e-health domain, based upon 2015.eu’s agenda? The analysis shows that innovation systems for the Dutch e-health domain can be developed by means of the following counterclockwise order of steps at CIM level 1: (1) Vision development, (2) Cyclic process model development, and (3) Transition path development. Recommendations for TNO are to aim for the roles advised to it at the different development stages of innovation processes, as well as its recommended role with establishing innovation systems, and with lifting the implementation obstacles of European Digital Agendas. Further research is recommended to improve the CIM innovation system theory, since criteria like to consider institutional factors, prescribing best practices, and paying attention to money flows, were not considered.","European Digital Agenda; service innovation; innovation process; innovation model; cyclic innovation model; implementation; strategic positioning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-03-21","Technology, Policy and Management","Technology, Strategy and Entrepreneurship","","","",""

(mentor); Lopes, G. (mentor)","2012","Passivity-based control (PBC) is a control methodology that achieves its control objective by rendering a system passive with respect to a desired storage function. A key feature of PBC is that it exploits structural properties of the system. In this thesis, the PBC of systems endowed with a special structure, called port-Hamiltonian (PH) systems, has been investigated. The geometric structure of PH systems allows reformulating the PBC problem in terms of solving a generally complex partial differential equation (PDE). Reinforcement learning (RL), on the other hand, is a learning control method that can solve complex nonlinear (stochastic) control problems without the need for a process model or explicitly solving a set of equations. In RL the controller receives an immediate numerical reward as a function of the process state and possibly control action. The goal is to find an optimal control policy that maximizes the cumulative long-term rewards, which corresponds to maximizing a value function. In this thesis, actor-critic techniques have been used, which are a class of RL methods in which a separate actor (the control law) and critic (a ""memory"") function are learned. A disadvantage of RL is that without having a process model it can be slow at learning and computationally expensive. In this thesis, the goal was to design a theoretical framework using PBC techniques subject to control saturation that incorporates knowledge about the PH system and learns (optimal) control policies using actor-critic reinforcement learning. Therefore, actor-critic reinforcement learning methods have been combined with different types of PBC, e.g. EB-PBC and IDA-PBC. The combination of EB-PBC with an actor-critic method, energy-balancing actor-critic (EBAC), showed its effectiveness in the pendulum swing-up problem, which was used as a benchmark test. The advantages of the method from a PBC perspective are that no PDE has to be explicitly solved, control saturation can be incorporated, the geometric structure of the PH system is preserved, (numerical) stability can be assessed using passivity theory and the learned controllers can be interpreted in terms of energy-shaping strategies. From a RL perspective, the learning is speeded up because model knowledge is available.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

(mentor); Ishihara, R. (mentor)","2012","Flexible electronics is a fast emerging market and includes electronics fabricated on flexible substrates, large area displays, low cost and disposable electronics. Both research and commercial institutions around the world have been trying to develop low temperature processes which will enable fabrication of electronic devices on arbitrary substrates including glass and plastic. While most of these technologies are still in the research phase, many approaches have shown promising results. One such technology is being developed in DIMES, TU Delft which uses single grain silicon crystals to fabricate Single Grain Thin Film Transistors (SG-TFTs) at plastic compatible temperatures. SG-TFTs and other similar technologies can potentially enable fabricating electronics directly on arbitrary substrates. This would further enable integration of embedded intelligence in devices that would enhance the current functionalists of displays. This thesis is an effort in this direction as it undertakes a study to design a flexible display with an integrated graphics rasterizor unit. The thesis introduces the novel idea to move parts of the graphics pipeline from the CPU/GPU to the display. This will add intelligence to the display so as to realize a smart-display. The thesis proposes several architectures for implementing a rasterizor unit on smart-display, conceptually fabricated on a flexible substrate using SG-TFT technology. While the transistors fabricated with SG-TFT and similar technologies are relatively slower than the standard CMOS, this thesis proposes that a tile based system design can potentially result into enhanced system performance.","computer graphics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-02-28","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","Master Embedded Systems","",""

This breach of the ebb-delta is observed not long after a severe storm that afflicted the Charente-Maritime region in February 2010; Xynthia. A strong link between the breach and the Xynthia storm is expected: a storm event driven breach. In order to assess this hypothesis the impact of the Xynthia storm and the breaching process is investigated by use of a process-based numerical model, Delft3D. Two possible options for the breach are initiated, namely event-driven or a long-term development where the flow through the inlet becomes inefficient. In order to assess the two time scales, two scenarios are introduced for the numerical model; long (10 years) and short term (Xynthia storm). Hardly any input reduction is applied to the short-term scenario while the long-term scenario suffers extensive wave input reduction and the use of a morphological acceleration factor in the view of computational efficiency. Following the qualitative analysis; the results are in the line of expectations. The impact of the Xynthia storm turns out to be rather limited. During the long-term development of the ebb-delta (deflection of the main channel and elongation of the bypassing bar) the impact of the Xynthia storm event increases. When spill channels form and the ebb-delta is tending to breach, the impact of the Xynthia storm drops relatively rapid. In the long-term scenario, deflection of the main channel southwards is observed and simultaneously the bypassing bar elongated in the same direction. Finally, the flow through the inlet becomes inefficient and spill channels start to develop. The location of the new main channel is betrayed by the ebb and flood-tidal flows, making the bypassing bar relatively narrow on a specific location. Breaching of the ebb-delta at the Maumusson inlet is not caused by the 2010 storm driven event but was part of cyclic behaviour with an expected turnaround time in the order of decades. As a result, the littoral drift is significantly reduced by the new orientation of the main channel.","inlet; ebb-delta; breach; Maumusson; Civil Engineering; Coastal Engineering; long-term; modelling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

Due to the use of basic materials and tools for the production, home built wind turbines are one of the most promising alternatives in these regions. The wind turbine designs by Hugh Piggott are famous for this. Although there is a lot of knowledge by many home wind turbine builders about this type of wind turbines, there is a lack of good performance measurements that is required for the further improvement of these machines.

(mentor); Beella, S.K. (mentor); Van den Boogaard, G.A. (mentor)","2012","Rotterdam is in the middle of its ‘second rebuilding’. Its modernist and car-friendly character that was so successful in the first rebuilding after the second world war are now blamed for a number of social and economical problems Rotterdam is faced with. The Rotterdam of 2021 is denser than today. Its centre houses more residents and is starting to shake of its car-friendly character to make way for cyclists and pedestrians. By 2021, Rotterdam’s population exists of more than 50% immigrants. Many public spaces and services are privatized and liberalized, offering citizens more, but fragmented choices. Crosslinks between the randstad cities become abundant, expanding the mobility range of citizens. Citizens may react to these developments in two different ways; be overwhelmed by the increasingly complex city and retreat(individual) or welcome the opportunities and diversity it provides (communal). Next to the developments of the city there are also developments within the citizens. On the one hand, there is an ever stronger need for consumption and comfort and a sense of ‘being a client of the city’ (conservative) while on the other hand collaborative consumption is starting to develop and citizens are increasingly participants in the city rather than consumers or clients (progressive). Two concepts were developed to facilitate the individual-conservative and communal-progressive paradigms in public transport. The individual-conservative paradigm can be characterized by a need for being in their comfort-zone while mobile, an anxiety free state of mind. The busy urban environment threatens to take them out of this zone. Therefore, a concept was developed to allow people to stay in their comfort zone in public transport by being able to detach themselves from the busy urban streets. This concept features a double-decker tram, stops that provide good overview over the city and private seats that clearly demarcate personal space. The first floor of the stops is designed as a small ‘park’, providing the individual-conservative with small oases at regular intervals in the city. The communal progressive paradigm enjoys being mobile, likes to discover new places and meet new people and is willing to take responsibility for the livability of the city. The concept developed for this paradigm aims at allowing people to take responsibility for each other, meet new people and travel more efficiently by establishing synergy between users of public transport. The concept consists of a smartphone application that allows users to add requests to public transport lines, stops or vehicles. Other users can respond to the request and further arrangements are made. An example could be that a user requests another user to share doing groceries with, saving both users valuable time.","mobility; sustainable; Masters that Matter","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2012","When high strength steels are applicated in dynamically loaded structures, fatigue problems can arise. In most current design codes, the fatigue strength of high strength steels is either not discussed or determined as similar to mild steels. This assumption can be related to the dominance of the crack propagation life during in the total fatigue life when considering welded connections. Weld improvements can increase the length of the crack initiation life and thus increase the total fatigue life and may lead to a difference in fatigue strength between high strength steel and mild steels. This study focuses on the the effects of TIG-dressing on the weld toe geometry and the fatigue strength of TIG-dressed specimens. First a literature study is presented which summarizes earlier researches into the effect of TIG-dressing on fatigue strength and the behaviour of high strength steel in fatigue conditions, both in an as welded situation as after TIG-dressing. The weld toe geometry before and after TIG-dressing is determined. This leads to a extensive data set containing the geometry of the complete weld. The weld toe is then described with the aid of four parameters: weld toe radius, weld toe angle, weld height and undercut. Any influence of the static strength of the material, or any differences between rolled and cast steel are investigated. A comparison is made between the as welded specimens and TIG-dressed specimens. This changed geometry has been coupled to a changed fatigue strength with the aid of the notch stress approach. FEM analyses of the weld toe, based on measured geometries, have been carried out to determine stress concentration factors. Adjustments of the fatigue strength to account for loading mode, thickness, residual stress and mean stress have been derived from literature. A small reduction in residual stress, caused by the TIG-dressing procedure, has also been derived from literature. Fatigue tests have been carried out on 24 specimens ranging from S460 to S1100, made from both cast and rolled steels. The specimens are also adjusted for loading mode, thickness, residual stress and mean stress and compared with the developed model and a larger dataset of comparable as welded specimens. Due to the relatively small number of specimens per steel grade, a reliable quantitative fatigue strength improvement cannot be specified. A extensive qualitative analysis gives insight in the overall trends. From all used plates, hardness measurements are available, which have not been thoroughly analyzed. During the fatigue tests, crack dimensions have been determined during the crack propagation life. These measurements also have not been analyzed. Both data sets are added in annexes and are digitally available at the author or one of the members of the graduation committee.","TIG-dressing; geometry; tests; fatigue; radius; angle; improvement; butt; weld; high; strength; steel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Steel Structures","",""

Resources are provisioned from the cloud as Virtual Machines (VMs), many of which can be deployed on a single computing node, realizing a multi-tenancy model. While virtualization and multi-tenancy are two sources of workload-execution overhead that have been studied in the past, we still need a thorough, empirical investigation of the joint impact of these overheads, on workload execution. Additionally, commercial and private IaaS providers offer mechanisms that facilitate the lease and use of single infrastructure resources, but to execute multi-job workloads IaaS users still need to select adequate provisioning and allocation policies to instantiate resources and map computational jobs to them. Even though some studies on the policies employed in cloud environments already exist, current and potential IaaS users need deeper insight on the achieved performance and incurred cost of the used policies, derived through empirical investigation. In this work, we address these problems with the use of SkyMark, a performance analysis framework for IaaS clouds. SkyMark has three key features: ?rst, it is designed to analyze IaaS deployments through a sequence of automated tests and the subsequent automated analysis of results. Second, it can analyze the impact of individual provisioning and allocation policies to the performance of the workload execution. Lastly, it is able to generate complex workloads, stressing any of the compute, memory and disk components. With the use of SkyMark, we ?rst study the overheads that the cloud software stack imposes to the workload execution. Subsequently, we analyze the performance and cost of six provisioning and three allocation policies through experimentation in three IaaS environments, including Amazon EC2.","cloud computing; IaaS; performance analysis; evaluation; scheduling","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software and Computer Technology","","Parallel and Distributed Systems","",""

It gives cleaner world and healthier environment to live. Most of the green energy resources such as tidal and wave are freely available in large amount and also sustainable. On the other hand, the energy demand is increasing along with population growth. Therefore, researchers are developing the technology of energy converter from these resources to support human activities, business and leisure. Indonesia an archipelago country with plenty of narrow strait and surrounded by two oceans makes this tidal energy extraction looks promising. A pioneer study in Bali Strait as the reference site is selected among other prospective sites. Bali strait has relatively shallow water depth, high current density and high energy demand to support Bali Island and its tourism board. As the equipment of tidal energy converter is placed in severe condition for relatively long period, hence it has to be strength resistance and fatigue resistance. Fatigue failure will cause integrity failure which mostly occurs in the joint connections and at the base of support structure. Therefore, Fatigue design plays an important role in the development of tidal energy converter. Fatigue analysis on MCT support structure is based on experience and engineering judgement. Two established industries, oil and gas exploration and offshore wind turbine, are tailored into marine current turbine development. In addition, a range of representative cases is selected in this dissertation. To conclude, the fatigue service life for MCT support structure located in Bali strait has fulfil the minimum required of 80 years (20 years service life with factor of safety 4.0) with various alternatives. Contrary to the offshore wind turbine (OWT) with natural period at soft-soft range, the recommended natural period range for MCT is placed at soft-stiff range. This because of the MCT support structure requires stiffer and more compact structure as they are exposed to more severe loading compare to OWT. However, another analysis should be conducted such as strength resistance and accidental limit stress in order to have a complete design. On the other hand, Environment Impact Assessment should be prepared as well. In addition, this study might be the first study of fatigue assessment in MCT support structure and should be considered as an opening to a further renewable energy development.","fatigue life; natural period; support structure; wave; spectrum","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","CoMEM - Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management","",""

Knowing that planet and Sun orbit one another in almost circular orbits, and the mass of the satellite is negligible compared to the mass of these bodies, the model of the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP) can be used. Dynamical Systems Theory (DST) concerns itself with the analysis of differential equations, as the equations of motion in the CR3BP are. After finding the Lagrange libration points, the region about these points can be examined. Periodic orbits and asymptotic orbits are two of the four types of motion in these regions. The asymptotic paths form manifolds and create a natural highway to travel from and to the area around equilibrium points. Extending the manifolds far from the periodic orbits for many Sun-planet systems shows a network of manifold tubes, which is referred to as the Interplanetary Superhighway and may be an energy efficient way of transfer. Zooming in on two consecutive Sun-planet systems the transfer from one to another can be examined. The actual four-body problem is approximated by two coplanar coupled three-body problems. The high-trust maneuver requiring the minimal instantaneous velocity increment, to get from one CR3BP to the next, is to be found. On the intersection of manifolds, different positions for executing the maneuver are available. Furthermore the mutual geometry of the two systems changes with the chosen epoch. So for changing place and time of the maneuver, the minimal velocity increment is computed and analyzed. Finally the optimal maneuver is used in the design of a mission; a transfer from one planet to another.","space; trajectory design; dynamical systems theory; circular restricted three-body problem; interplanetary space flight","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-03-20","Aerospace Engineering","Earth Observation and Space Systems","","Astrodynamics & Satellite Systems","",""

The maturity of this biometric technique and, mainly, the dramatic improvement of the capture devices have lead to the proposal of fingerprinting in multiple applications. In this thesis a hardware architecture for a Fingerprint Verification System (FVS) in a mobile embedded device, one of the most challenging problems in this field, is developed. The objective of the system is to decide whether an input fingerprint belongs to the same individual than a previously stored one. This procedure is called verification, in contrast with identification, that tries to decide which fingerprint in a database shows higher resemblances with an input one. In this thesis, new algorithms are proposed for fingerprint matching, taking as a departure point literature and research publications from last decades. The main development is the introduction of Delta and Core detection algorithms. With this points a classification process of the fingerprints is implemented.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-02-24","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","CAS","","Computer Engineering","",""

(mentor); Diepeveen, N.F.B. (mentor); Albers, P.S. (mentor)","2012","The Delft Offshore Turbine (DOT) project is a research project within the Delft University Wind Energy Research Institute (DUWIND). The main objective of the DOT research project is to make offshore wind energy a competitive energy source. One of the research lines in the DOT project is considering the centralization of electricity generation within a wind farm. The complete process of wind energy extraction up to the connection with the electrical grid must be taken into account in order to develop an optimal technology to generate electricity from offshore wind energy. The DOT project thus approaches the design of a wind farm by regarding the entire farm as one system instead of a collection of systems. For this purpose a renewed wind farm concept was developed within the DOT project. A unique aspect of the DOT concept are the fluid power transmission systems used to transfer the energy of single turbines to a central platform for electricity generation. The main objective of this thesis is to prove the functionality of the DOT transmission concept. To prove the functionality of this concept a small scale demonstration set-up of the DOT transmission was designed, constructed and tested. Prior to the start of the design process the design objectives and requirements were identified. The transmission is designed for a specific 10kW rotor. The rotor speed needs to be controlled close to its optimal tip speed ratio in order to maximize the energy extraction from the wind. This is achieved by using a passive control strategy together with accurately sized components in the transmission. A dynamic model of the transmission was developed to increase the physical understanding of the transmission and to assist in the design process. The demonstration set-up was constructed in the water laboratory at the faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences of the TU Delft. In the demonstration set-up the rotor is simulated by an electric motor with a controllable speed. The dynamic model was validated successfully with experiments in steady state and dynamic conditions. The functionality of the transmission was analyzed by simulations with the validated transmission model and a simplified rotor model. The following conclusions are drawn from the experiment and simulation results:  For constant wind speed conditions above 4.7m/s the passive control method controls the rotor speed at an almost constant tip speed ratio. With the available 5.96mm nozzle diameter the rotor operates at 90% of the maximum power coefficient CP,max. To operate the rotor at its optimal tip speed ratio (100% of CP,max) the nozzle diameter is the only parameter that needs to be adjusted.  Simulations with turbulent wind speeds show that the tip speed ratio variation is much larger in these conditions than in steady state conditions. In these conditions the rotor operates between 75% and 90% of the maximum power coefficient. The relatively slow response to fluctuations in the transmission cause the larger variations in tip speed ratio in turbulent wind speed conditions.  The total efficiency of the transmission is between 43% and 48% at wind speeds above 4.7m/s.  The estimated required wind speed to start the transmission is between 4 and 6m/s.  The complete system of rotor and transmission is strongly damped. Therefore no problems are expected when the system is excited at one of its natural frequencies. The experiment and simulation results prove the functionality of the developed transmission. In the near future experiments with the transmission and a 10 kW rotor are planned at a test facility of the Energy research centre of The Netherlands (ECN). Based on the results of this thesis project no problems are expected during these experiments with rotor. The simplicity of the passive control strategy is a great advantage of this control method. An in-depth research of the suitability of this method for large single turbines or wind farms is recommended. Based on the analysis in this thesis, the main concern for large scale application is the slow response of the transmission to fluctuations in the wind speed. The response time will increase due to the reduced stiffness caused by longer pipelines with larger diameters.","wind energy; DOT; offshore turbine; Windenergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Offshore Engineering - Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor); Wisse, M. (mentor); Caarls, W. (mentor)","2012","This study investigates the evolutionary co-optimisation of fuzzy control and system parameters for the Resonating robot Arm (RA). The RA is a novel concept for a pick-and-place manipulator that uses a spring mechanism to reduce the required actuator torques. Since the performance of the total system depends on the combination of the spring mechanism and the controller it is difficult to find (near) optimal solutions using conventional design approaches in which the system and the controller are optimised separately. Therefore evolutionary cooptimisation is proposed in which Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are used to optimise the RA system as a whole. Three experiments were conducted in which the first experiment validated the use of fuzzy control and EAs to find near optimal control solutions, and the second and third experiment considered the co-optimisation of the RA with one and two degrees-of-freedom (DOF), respectively. Two types of EAs (CoSyNE and CMA-ES) and two types of fuzzy controllers (with fixed and free membership functions) were applied and their performances compared. The results revealed that evolutionary co-optimisation yields near optimal solutions for the 1-DOF RA, which require 43% less torque than the solution found through a separate optimisation of the system and control parameters. In case of the 2-DOF RA, evolutionary co-optimisation resulted in working solutions, however, no consistent convergence to near optimal solutions was found. Additionally, it was shown that for all experiments the best solutions came from the CMA-ES algorithm in combination with the fuzzy controller with free membership functions. The main conclusion drawn from this study is that evolutionary co-optimisation is an effective approach to find near optimal solutions for the 1-DOF RA, however more research is needed for it to be effectively applied to the 2-DOF RA.","robot arm; evolutionary optimization; co-optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

Stridor is an abnormal, noisy or toned/voiced breathing sound which is caused by obstruction or malformation of pharynx, larynx, trachea or the bronchia; whereby the turbulence of air and vibration of surrounding tissue are the source of the observed sound. There is a need for uninvasive diagnostics because of risks involved using anaesthetics, especially on young children. To find the obstruction from a sound signal, first one needs to know what kind of sound is produced by what kind of geometry. Doing this numerically has the advantage of allowing one to change only one parameter at the time. Using a hybrid approach, combining LES and the Lighthill equation, the airflow acoustics for internal flows can be predicted. The acoustics are validated on a reed instrument and diaphragm. The sound pressure level is of the right magnitude and also good agreement is found for the distribution of power. The lower frequencies are however over predicted. The fluid part is validated using PIV measurements on a simplified upper airway model. Good agreement was found. The fluid and acoustic analysis on the different upper airway models showed that probably for increasing constriction the sound production mechanism shifts from turbulent sound production to tissue vibration. Therefore a rigid wall approach is not good enough to predict the sounds generated by obstructions in stridor patients.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

Anatomical variation between subjects further complicates this organization. Currently, there is no way of storing, accessing and visualizing these heterogeneous datasets in an integrated fashion. Such capabilities would have great potential to empower anatomy research. In this work, we present methods for the integration of heterogeneous spatial and non-spatial data from different sources, as well as the complex relations between these, into a single model with standardized anatomical coordinates: The Unified Anatomical Human. All captured data can then be interactively visualized in various ways, depending on the anatomical question. Furthermore, our model enables data to be queried both structurally, i.e., relative to existing anatomical structures, and spatially, i.e., with anatomical coordinates. When new patient-specific medical scans are added to the model, all available model information can be mapped to them. Using this mapping, model information can be transferred back to the new scans, thus enabling the creation of visualizations enriched with information not available in the scans themselves.","medical visualization; heterogeneous data; computer graphics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science - Media and Knowledge Engineering","","Computer Graphics and Visualization Group","",""

(mentor)","2012","Building on the experience built up from the management of more than 30 integration project, the objective of this research as been to improve the post-acquisition HR integration approach of Philips New Venture Integration, based on a gap analysis between the current model approach actual HR integration processes employed during the integration of acquisitions. Opportunities for improvement of the HR integration approach are proposed with respect to the definition of HR integration objectives and the implementation of HR integration activities As the field of post-acquisition integration is very broad, initial research themes are developed by both internal and external interviews. Because the NVI HR Integration model is a mature model which has been used and improved over the last five years, the internal interviews serve to quickly focus on the most pressing issues, whereas the external interviews provide an out-of-the-box view which might provide solutions to problems which Philips has not yet been able to solve. The action research method is used for this research with the aim of positively affecting organizational change, by developing the improved HR Integration approach together with the persons involved in the actual integration of acquisitions. Action research is a cyclical process that consists of five distinct phases of (1) Diagnosing (2) Action Planning, (3) Action taking, (4) Evaluation and (5) Specifying Learning. Due to the limited time, this research is based on one single cycle. Based on the results of this single cycle it can be concluded that the Philips NVI post-acquisition integration model incorporates many of the concepts of the process-perspective on socio-cultural integration discussed in academic literature. Both the perspectives of task integration and human integration are both clearly represented in the post-acquisition integration model. Using the action research method I have been able to outline opportunities for improvement in order to better match the planning, management and execution of the HR integration approach with the intended results. The inherent complexity of the M&A integration process, and the heterogeneity between deals, make it difficult to develop generalizable conclusions when comparing many different acquisitions, without the risk of over-generalizing and oversimplifying these acquisitions. By using a qualitative approach, this research allows to investigate a single approach in depth. The resulting conclusions shed new light on certain existing paradoxes within the academic literature on post-acquisition integration, and although these insights are not statistically generalizable, they might serve as a starting point for improved understanding of the performance of mergers and acquisitions.","post-acquisition integration; socio-cultural integration; mergers and acquisitions; human resource management; process perspective","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Technology, Strategy & Entrepreneurship","","Management of Technology","",""

In some areas of Sub-Saharan Africa appropriate organic waste management technology could address development issues such as soil degradation, unemployment and energy scarcity, while at the same time providing climate benefits. The role that carbon markets could have in facilitating the implementation of composting, anaerobic digestion and biochar production, in urban and peri-urban regions in dry tropical climate was investigated, with a case study on Tamale in the North of Ghana. A life cycle assessment of realistic implementation scenarios for low-tech, small scale variants of these three technologies was performed, in order to assess the potential contribution they could give to climate change mitigation. Furthermore an economic feasibility study was carried out to assess the influence of access to carbon markets and changes in the carbon price on the viability of these technologies. It was found that substantial climate benefits can be achieved by avoiding landfilling of biowaste, producing electricity and substituting the use of conventional fertiliser. Biochar production could result in a net carbon sequestration. These technologies were however found not to be economically viable without external subsidies, and access to carbon markets at the considered carbon price of 7 EUR/t of carbon would not change the situation significantly. Carbon markets could help the realisation of the considered composting and anaerobic digestion systems only if carbon price will rise above 48-77 EUR/t of carbon (respectively for anaerobic digestion and composting). Biochar production could achieve large climate benefits and, if it would be approved as a land based climate mitigation mechanism on carbon markets, it would become economically viable at a lower carbon price of 30 EUR/t of carbon.","Composting; Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Biochar; Carbon; LCA; Life Cycle Assessment; Ghana; Sub Saharan Africa","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Delft University of Technology","Department of Technology, Dynamics and Sustainable Development","","Industrial Ecology","",""

The scope of this project is to design, develop and implement an integrated cave management system for Rio Tinto Underground Technology Centre. A successful outcome will result in the implementation of CaveCad on all Rio Tinto caving operations. The block caving mining method is being increasingly applied as a mass mining method used to exploit base metals and diamond resources. In block cave mining, geotechnical monitoring is fundamental to the successful management and operation of the mine. Current state of the art in monitoring, although innovative and useful, has lacked the collective integration of multiple systems from which collective information can be used to make unambiguous and timely decisions. This is the reason for the design, development and subsequent application of CaveCad. In addition to the design and development process of CaveCad, this study includes background information on block caving and cave monitoring, data research on the relevant monitored data types and a comprehensive case study. It also includes software research into the different system components and the testing of the Geotech module, a GOCAD Mining Suite geotechnical plug-in. Finally, the first CaveCad module, which was released in December 2011, is fully described. The report concludes with a discussion, recommendations and a conclusion. The database and system architecture comprising CaveCad has been successfully designed and developed.

The evaluation of the proposed technique took place by means of comparisons between different test cases in order to specify the existence of similarities in the statistical behaviour of original tests and their repetitions. Therefore, statistical tests are used to examine the behaviour of the individual tests not only individually, but also in combination with the rest of the test components. For the selected statistical and computational approaches the optimum measurement space step had to be specified. Therefore, a comparison took place between measurements every 5cm and every 10cm. The length of the confidence intervals was used to quantify the difference in accuracy and the two fundamental non parametric tests of Mann-Whitney U/ Wilcoxon W and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (theoretical explanation Appendix B) were applied in order to qualitatively investigate the magnitude of the behavioral change of the distribution due to the addition of the in-between measurements (profile measurements every 5cm). The analysis showed that although the smaller measuring step increased the accuracy at about 10 -30% the differences in absolute damage values were trivial. Furtherupon, differences among tests that occur in the plunging and in the surging area were examined and tendencies were recorded. The outcome showed that an imperceptible difference occurs. The deviation was steadily bigger for the case of tests located in the plunging area (28% in contrast to 21.5% of the surging area), but this difference is considered to be trivial. Finally, the accent was paid in the limitations of the available means and equipment. The observed higher damage values at the sides were investigated. The 13 cross sections of the structure were divided into two groups of side and middle cross sections and comparisons between them were accomplished. Then the influence of the boundary measurements was quantified in order to interpret any existing tendencies of higher damage values and local irregularities that may affect the output of the computations. In fact, the data analysis showed that the variation of damage values at the side cross sections was for all the cases larger than the middle ones. In half of the cases the difference was significant while for the other half, difference occurred, but with a lower magnitude.","breakwater; permeability; model tests","en","student report","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2012","The most densely populated and economical most valuable areas in The Netherlands lie below mean sea level. These areas are protected against the sea by a coastal dune system. The vital importance of this dune system is reflected in the extensive collection of Dutch legal regulations that ensure the safety level of the dunes. Current safety assessment method for dunes, prescribed by these regulations, is based on conducting large numbers (thousands) of simulations to estimate dune erosion at individual locations along the Dutch coast. With the use of more complex dune-erosion models (i.e. Xbeach; Roelvink et al. (2009)) in the safety assessment, the method gets computationally more intensive. This means that conducting large numbers of simulations for a dune safety assessment are not feasible. Therefore new probabilistic approaches (e.g., Bayesian approach) are needed in order to apply state-of-the-art insights and models for dune erosion in a safety assessment. The aim of this study was to gain an insight in the applicability of the Bayesian network approach for dune safety assessment against extreme storm events on the Dutch coast. First a database was generated that serves as input to the Bayesian network. The content of this database is obtained in a way similar to current assessment method. This means, data-sources (wave conditions, bottom profiles) and the dune-erosion model (duros+; Vellinga (1986), van Gent et al. (2008)) to simulate the dune erosion process were equal. Qualitatively the Bayesian network is represented by nodes (variables) and arrows (relations). Variables and relations were selected such, they were physically related to the dune erosion process and could be obtained out of the database. Quantitatively the Bayesian network is described by a conditional probability table defined by a expectation-maximization training algorithm. For this training process, cases (a case is a record in the database and represents a storm event) out of the dataset were selected. Sensitivity analysis of the required number of training data, as well the determining variable of this Bayesian network were made. Results show the Bayesian network is capable of reproducing the dune erosion process (given this set of data) for 89%. The loss in skill is a consequence of the discretization of the variables in the Bayesian network. The number of training-cases needed to make reliable predictions that are more accurate then predictions made with the use of the prior probability, is approximately 5,000 cases. Results of the sensitivity analysis indicates water level information is a determining term regarding the prediction skill. However, when other hydraulic conditions (wave height, peak period) were known the water level was redundant. Indicating water level information is captured by the variables wave height and/or peak period. Dune erosion volumes predictions for locations at the Holland coast, shows a high amount of uncertainty and results in unreliable predictions (negative log-likelihood ratio) when using a Bayesian network trained on cases representing the Wadden coast. Indicating coastal features between both coastal regions are too diverse. Furthermore, a Bayesian network is a useful tool to improve insight into data. Expected relations between variables can be investigated and visualized in the Bayesian network immediately.","Bayesian network; Dune erosion; Safety Assessment; Extreme Storm Events; Dutch Coast; Probabilistic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2012","This thesis will propose a new method to predict the response of sensitive equipment, once it is installed on the factory floor. Currently, only the stiffness of the floor is taken into account when the dynamic response of a machine on a floor is predicted. To improve these methods, a short literature survey is done about the dynamics of factory floors. From this survey it follows that a floor is better characterised by an SDOF oscillator. To use this characterisation in practice, dynamic substructuring will be used. With dynamic substructuring it is possible to predict the coupled response of a machine, when the dynamic response of the floor is known. This could either follow from a detailed model or from a measurement. In this thesis it is shown how this should be done with measurements. This dynamic substructuring can be easily extended to improve the method to predict the response of the machine to the vibrations of the oor. It is found that an equivalent system can be defined which predicts the oor vibrations more accurately. This method is again based on a dynamic measurement of the floor, as well as the free vibration level of the floor. In the second part of this thesis, the theory is validated with an experiment. First it is shown how to obtain the dynamic response of the oor from impact measurements. It is found that a floor typically has a lot of damping, which damps the response quickly. This limits the achievable frequency resolution. Also problems are encountered with harmonic vibrations of a floor, which appear as a resonance, and the combination of the low response and an exponential window, which might cause an artificial anti-resonance. These measurements are than used to predict the coupled response of a test case. This prediction is also validated with a validation measurement. It was found that these floor measurements together with the dynamic substructuring predicts the coupling very well. The proposed method to predict the coupled vibration level of the oor could however not be validated with this experiment. When the results obtained with the dynamic subtructuring are compared with the results as obtained with the existing methods, it is found that dynamic substructuring improves the prediction very much.","dynamic substructuring","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-05-31","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Iosup, A. (mentor)","2012","There are currently many systems that offer online board games, for instance, social networking sites, where board games enjoy enormous popularity, but also systems such as the Internet Chess Club, which has been around for over a decade. However, these systems are all centralized and typically have drawbacks for the user, such as subscription fees or advertisements. As an alternative, we have designed a decentralized protocol, called GameCast, that enables users to play turnbased multi-player board games over a peer-to-peer network. The GameCast protocol supports three processes, dissemination of peer and game information within the network, game agreement, which allows one peer to invite another by sending invites, and game-play, which enables peers to play a game over the network. Our current GameCast implementation, called Tribler-G, is built as an extension to the Tribler file-sharing application, and focuses on enabling users to play online chess through the Tribler-G GUI. To evaluate the performance of the GameCast protocol, we have created GameTest, a system capable of emulating a peer-to-peer network. Using GameTest, we have conducted a large-scale emulation of hundreds of peers on the DAS-4 distributed supercomputer. The results acquired during the emulation show that GameCast scales well and uses little bandwidth. Additionally, we have performed user tests, the results of which show that users are generally positive about Tribler-G in terms of usability.","Tribler-G; peer-to-peer systems; online gaming; social networks; gossip protocols; chess","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software and Computer Technology","","Parallel and Distributed Systems","",""

(mentor); Van der Voort, H.G. (mentor); Taheri, M. (mentor)","2012","As an extension to the research on “Open Innovation”, this thesis, based on an empirical study of university spin-offs (USOs), intends to make some contributions to the increasing understanding of “openness”, not only for micro and small size firms, but also in another context other than U.S.. Moreover, instead of analyzing from a traditional firm-level perspective, the study approaches the topic by emphasizing the role of the firm’s external and geographical context in shaping the flows of knowledge that the firm can act on. Therefore, the following research questions are brought to the fore, aiming to shed some light on regional policy making: How does the concept of “Open Innovation” apply in the background of USOs in terms of their external contexts, to what extent are these firms open, and what factors will influence their openness? To initiate the study, the most urgent question ahead is to quantify the intangible concept of openness. Thanks to the magic of mathematics, different dimensions of openness are drawn from the literature, including external knowledge breadth, depth, capacity and diversity. External knowledge breadth indicates the number of types of information and knowledge a firm can access, while external knowledge depth is related to the tie strength between the firm and its various partners. External knowledge capacity denotes the “size” of the external knowledge pool, constructed by both breadth and depth. And external knowledge diversity is about the heterogeneity of partners’ social backgrounds in the knowledge pool, while also taking into account the spatial orientation of the firm. These dimensions are framed as “Openness Index”, and virtually constitute an external knowledge pool that firms “reside in”. Furthermore, influencing factors, basically enabling and strategic intention factors are extracted to reveal the power of influence on different characteristics of openness. Results from multiple regression analysis show that: 1) spin-offs in a less urbanized area (Trondheim instead of Delft) tend (or are forced) to be more open in diversity, so do older and larger firms; 2) although larger size firms receive more local supports, they generally have a smaller external knowledge capacity; 3) a founding team with a deep industrial experience may be reluctant to explore the capacity of external knowledge and receive supports, whereas a broader experience may lead to a higher diversity of the firm; 4) a prospector strategy (a competitive strategy that emphasizes product/service innovation and protection of that innovation) may stimulate the firm to become more open in diversity and receive more helps locally; and 5) a high ambition level of the firm generally benefits its openness both in capacity and diversity consistently. Remarkably, according to the test of hypotheses, probably the importance of “market space” has been underestimated, which may play a significant role in such a turbulent and rapid-changing environment that (high-tech) spin-offs pertain to. To move a step forward, the universal principles underlying the openness of university spin-offs were explored. The results imply that scalability does exist, particularly regarding diversity, which manifests a sub-linear scaling – a decreasing return with increasing firm size, and there is virtually a ceiling as diversity grows. This could be a practical and critical hint for policy makers or problem owners, as to promote diversity, some measures may be necessary for compensating this effect of diminishing return. The Structural Equation Modeling method, as “insurance” of multiple regression analysis, and a more convenient way to perform multivariate analysis, to check mediating, indirect effects and potential interrelations, was also adopted in the study. The importance of diversity is illustrated again, as a dominant variable among openness indices. This result is tagged into previous theories and analysis results, and may even relate to the concept of biodiversity, regarding the firm as a living organism. Finally, to answer the question posted in the beginning, the link between openness and performance of spin-offs needs to be exposed. Therefore another set of data was collected to gather the information of both employee (fte) and turnover in 2010. The growth rate, taking some form of absolute or relative growth, was calculated and used as dependent variables, with the openness indices as independent ones. The outcomes demonstrate that in the arena of openness, the highest employee growth and highest turnover growth do not fall in the same niche, but awarded to different winners – “innovators” that have a high diversity but weak and loose ties with partners, and “resource addicts” that have strong ties with partners, but low diversity, respectively. This inconsistency illustrates that a strategy blindly targeting at openness is neither wise nor beneficial, or even harmful. Hopefully, the analyses of this specific dataset can change some mindsets of the policy makers, especially the regional governments. They can see that: 1) tailor-made policy is preferable for either spin-offs in different stages of development, or the different players in openness arena, while a uniform approach may be more appropriate after certain (developmental) threshold; 2) the differences in entrepreneurs’ profile can be used as selection criteria, and supporting science-based firms can strongly stimulate job creation; 3) supporting policy can be developed more efficiently by benchmarking to find out the most needed and most lack-of supports currently; 4) subsidizing firms with a prospector strategy and stimulate them to a higher ambition level can benefit both turnover and employee growth; and 5) specifically, mentoring and learning-by-doing types of support should be provided to fresh startups, while more “traditional” types of support can be given to older survivors. The use of the word art not only fits nicely into the title, but also associates some of the old wisdoms into the work. The choice of art here is the image that the word conjures up of being more fluid, and denotes a tendency of the world’s convergence that there may be some universal patterns underlying different phenomena. There may be no single approach or way to guarantee an appropriate level of openness within a firm or other organizations. Rather, the approach to being open must be crafted around the ecosystem created by the intersections and interactions between the firm’s internal resources, its virtually porous boundary, and the external resource/knowledge pool facilitated by networking relationships. Lessons and stories are presented in this thesis, however, how to make sense of them, and steer them for a better “performance” is truly and remains an art lies in the hands of various problem owners.","Openness; Open Innovation; University Spin-off Firms","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-03-02","Technology, Policy and Management","Innovation Systems","","Management of Technology","",""

These possibilities include a maximum thrust-designed, maximum torquedesigned, and fatigue damage-designed powercurve. Furthermore, the NREL 5 MW powercurve is optimized using part-wise engineering-based cost functions. For this turbine, 5% of the levelized cost of energy is saved if the powercurve is adjusted.

(mentor); Nikolic, I. (mentor); Bekebrede, G. (mentor)","2012","Agent-based modelling is a popular and suitable tool for exploring the possible states of so-called socio-technical systems. These systems consist of both technical artefacts (the physical infrastructure, e.g. pipelines), and many social artefacts (relevant actors and institutions, e.g. end-users and governments), which are intertwined with each other and strongly interact (De Bruijn & Herder, 2009). The quality of the model output strongly depends on the quality of the rules of an agent, i.e. the lines of code that describe how an agent behaves. Slightly different rules on agent-level, may lead to significantly different outcomes on system-level (Bousquet, Cambier, Mullon, Morand & Quensiere, 1994; Levine & Fitzgerald, 1992). Thus, valid rules for agents are crucial for a valid analysis of socio-technical systems as a whole. When modelling a socio-technical system with an agent-based model, some agents represent social artefacts, and thus must simulate real-life behaviour. However, in many cases, rules that describe social phenomena, are not based on empirically tested, theoretical models, and agents display unrealistically simplistic behaviour (Jager & Janssen, 2003). This restricts the analysis with respect to social behaviour, and may even lead to an invalid system analysis. In earlier research it is suggested that gaming simulations can be used to improve the realism and diversity of agent behaviour. However, this application of games has not been examined extensively. This research aims to acquire insight in whether this application of games is possible and feasible. The central research question thereby is: To what extent can gaming contribute to the definition of realistic behavioural rules for agents in an agent-based model, within the context of modelling socio-technical systems? An extensive literature research shows several problems and challenges with agent-based modelling. These include fundamental problems with the currently used methods used for gathering information about realistic behaviour (i.e. interviews and literature research). Several characteristics of gaming can help to reduce some of these these challenges, providing theoretical evidence that there is a potential for synergy between the two methods. Based on a structural comparison of the methodological processes of agent-based modelling and gaming, it appears that there are several possibilities in which gaming can contribute to the definition of realistic behavioural rules of agents. In this thesis we elaborate on using gaming as a data collection tool. The gap between global knowledge about how agents behave and the implementation of precise rules in models is large. In case games can function as a valid data collection tool, the collected data can function as a basis for rules, which helps to overcome, or at least to reduce, design and formalization problems. When a game is used as a data collection tool, there are three basic requirements that must be met: one must be able to generate valid data, to measure the desired data, and to analyse the data. Several aspects with regard to fulfilling these goals, affect the validity and the costs of the data collection tool. Furthermore, choices within one design (game design, design data collection, or design data analysis), may have implications, direct or indirect, on other design choices, both within that design and in the other two. This interconnectedness makes the design process of the data collection tool as a whole very complex. Neither the game, nor the data collection method, nor the data analysis method is per definition leading in the decision which is the most suitable design. Whether, and how much the data collection tool can contribute to the definition of realistic behavioural rules, is very context dependent. The proposal for using games as a data collection tool, and the proposed design framework have been done solely on a theoretical basis. The development of a useful and feasible tool, however, should also have a decent practical basis. Therefore, this work should be seen as the first of many research projects on this topic. The lessons learned from the application of this tool can and should be used to improve the proposed design framework.","agent-based modelling; gaming; methodology; design framework; data collection tool; realistic behaviour; psychology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy & Industry","","SEPAM","",""
