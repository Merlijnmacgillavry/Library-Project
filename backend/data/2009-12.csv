(mentor); Oosterom, P.J.M. (mentor)","2009","In this thesis the use of the discrete 3D Voronoi diagram in modelling continuous fields in geosciences will be assessed. The Voronoi diagram is a structure that divides a certain space into cells, called Voronoi cells. These cells are created so that every location within each cell is closest to the corresponding data point, or seed, of that cell. Every location in that cell is assigned the value of the corresponding seed. Throughout history, the Voronoi diagram has been widely used. In general, the Voronoi diagram is used in three spatial operations.  Using the Voronoi diagram to determine spatial distribution and neighbourhood relations between points in a dataset.  Using the Voronoi diagram to determine the area of influence of points in a dataset.  Using the Voronoi diagram as a basis for the natural neighbour interpolation method. In geosciences, data is sampled in many different ways. Sometimes by means of a regular grid for instance, but measuring continuous fields is often done in an anisotropically distributed pattern. Most often this is due to the way in which samples are collected. The Voronoi diagram can be a good means of visualizing and determining the distribution of data points, and therefore it can be a useful tool when working with anisotropically distributed data. The exact 3D Voronoi diagram is a data model in vector format that has been investigated for quite some years now, often in different areas of sciences. The properties, the advantages and the disadvantages of this data model have been documented. The discrete 3D Voronoi diagram is a data structure in raster format, and, although it has been investigated, it has not been properly documented with respect to its properties, advantages and disadvantages. In this thesis these properties are described, especially in light of the modelling of continuous field data in the realm of geosciences, to perform for instance the natural neighbour interpolation, visualize the data distribution and other spatial operations. To do so, first a new algorithm has been devised, based on literature reviews of different articles on the 3D discrete Voronoi diagram. The new algorithm presented in this thesis has been implemented through the Python programming language. In order to use the discrete 3D Voronoi diagram in combination with geo-scientific, continuous data, a GIS that handles 3D raster data was identified, namely GRASS, and the possibilities and functionalities of GRASS with respect to the discrete 3D Voronoi diagram were investigated. Some functionality, such as resampling and natural neighbour interpolation, that was not found in the GIS but that is considered necessary, has also been implemented. By using test data, the entire process has been tested, from creating a discrete 3D Voronoi diagram, through interpolation it, to visualizing and analyzing it. The outcome shows that the discrete 3D Voronoi diagram is a proper tool for handling and analyzing 3D continuous field data. It enables user to go from a dataset of 3D points to a 3D continuous field, in the environment of a GIS, which allows for even further spatial analyses and operations. One of the advantages of the implemented algorithm is the effectiveness in adding, moving and removing points. This makes it very suitable for dynamic modelling, as well as natural neighbour interpolation. The algorithm also shows other interesting future possibilities, such as creating 3D generalized Voronoi diagrams. Some of these advantages and future uses are currently difficult or not yet possible to implement in an exact environment. Besides the possibilities of the presented algorithm, practical implementation of the algorithm is not yet feasible, due to calculation-time related issues. However, it is expected that if a compiled programming language such as C++ is used, as opposed to the interpreted language Python, the efficiency of the algorithm will increase.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","GIS technology","","Geomatics","",""

(mentor)","2009","A remote guesthouse in the Brazilian province of Rio de janeiro is using electricity from the nuclear fed power grid. The owner would like to change the energy supply from nuclear to hydropower if a hydropower plant would produce enough energy to keep the guesthouse running. A small hydropower plant could possibly produce enough energy for the guesthouse. The owners of guesthouse have got expansion plans and at the moment the energy bills are reasonably high. Also several devices are not used very often because of the high price in use. By the cheap way of producing electricity, the Vila Volta guesthouse could change a lot of non-electronic fed devices into electronic fed devices, which would make the guesthouse more modern. Examples of these devices are boilers and the sauna. Another possible advantage is the fact that the owners don’t have to carry the barrels of gas into the valley. To limit the Bachelors thesis project to hydraulic engineering questions, a feasibility and achievability study is done for a hydropower plant at the Vila Volta guesthouse. Designing and building the hydropower plant is not the main issue. These issues will be dealt with later on by the owners of the guesthouse themselves. The writers of this thesis investigated different options, but did not make any important decisions. The main goal of this study is to answer the following question: “Is it feasible and achievable for the owner of the Vila Volta guesthouse to build a small hydropower plant in order to produce enough energy to fulfil the demand of energy?”","hydropower; small-scale; Brazil","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

In de toekomst zullen deze omstandigheden waarschijnlijk alleen nog maar beter worden. Het toepassen van zonne-energieopslagsystemen is vooralsnog niet of nauwelijks direct gerelateerd aan de energiebehoefte van huishoudens. De keuze voor een zonne-energiesysteem wordt voornamelijk bepaald door wat er gemiddeld geldt voor een woningtype. De belangrijkste vraag op voorhand is of er significant verschil zou zijn met de huidige manier van ontwerpen, als het zonne energieopslagsysteem afgestemd wordt op de energievraag van het specifieke huishouden waar het systeem geïnstalleerd zal worden. Het gaat hier dus om de invloed van huishoudelijk gedrag voor energiegebruik op de configuratie van een algemeen of veelvoorkomend opslagsysteem. Om de voorgaande materie goed te beschouwen zijn probleemstellingen opgesteld. In eerste instantie leidt het feit dat een bepaald type woning geen eenduidig energievraagpatroon heeft (de omstandigheden per huishouden verschillen enorm) tot de eerste probleemstelling. De eerste probleemstelling stelt hier de vraag: is het mogelijk om met het gedrag van een huishouden een bepaling te maken voor het patroon van de energiebehoefte? Het doel hierbij is het ontwikkelen van een model dat de continue energiebehoefte van een bepaald huishouden en woningtype kan bepalen.","","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","","",""

(mentor); Brems, T. (mentor); Koster, R.P. (mentor)","2009","This master thesis started with a personal curiosity for bio-based plastics for assumed environmental and emotional reasons and started with the question: ‘Why is not more of this material used in everyday objects?’ Environmental awareness and global warming has led to a grown interest for sustainable product development. The selection of bio-based plastics as a material is seen as one of the means to contribute to sustainable product development. This report describes the analysis and future concept design process of a product for Naturally HEMA, derived from a holistic sustainable perspective, with a focus on bio-based polymers. The project was executed for the department of New Markets at HEMA Amsterdam at the Faculty of industrial Design Engineering of Delft University of Technology. In order to create a more profound understanding of the fields in which the design problem was rooted, a literature study on sustainability and design, the potential environmental benefits and challenges in product development of bio-based plastics as defined in previous research, HEMA as a commercial product development and retail company and governmental legislations regarding end-of-life scenarios was performed. Findings derived from this research were presented in an analysis and translated into points of attention for further concept development. One of the challenges in product development with bio-based plastics is the lack of understanding and awareness of the potential environmental benefits of this material with designers, product developers, industry and consumers. To contribute to the improvement of this awareness and to assist communication within the value chain on the potential benefits of bio-based plastics, a short movie is proposed in which a few of the benefits are explained in simplified manner to provoke curiosity, accompanied by a poster with more detailed information. The methods used to arrive at a product concept for Naturally HEMA were based on the Vision in Product Design method, context-mapping and user- interviews. A future sustainable HEMA scenario was proposed, in which the definition of sustainability as derived from the analysis was embedded: Sustainability is the possibility for human and other life to flourish on this planet forever. In the proposed future sustainable scenario, HEMA plays a role in the centre of local community life by offering durable product solutions, as well as involving and connecting people to contribute to the beauty of each others’ and their personal everyday life’s. By making sustainable actions more easy and obvious for their customers, people will experience a more fulfilling life. The to-be designed product aims to be a (small) stepping stone towards that future scenario. To design a sustainable product is not a design goal in itself and therefore the product domain ‘Women during their maternity, five years from now’ was chosen. The way in which to respond to this domain has been described by a statement: I want future parents to feel encouraged to the smaller world of the maternity period to build a trustworthy base together with and for their child to be raised in. In order to fulfill this statement, desired product interactions and meanings are described, to be met by the to-be designed concept. The future concept proposed for Naturally HEMA, consists of a complimenting product-service combination for expecting parents of three elements. Each element can be used on itself, but together intensify the user-product interaction and the encouragement to surrender to the maternity period. The first element is called the ‘HEMA Steentje’; a package design to contain four different care-products, developed for the maternity period. This HEMA steentje is designed to become a toy for the future child and made of bio-based plastic. The HEMA steentjes provide the expecting parents access to the HEMAma website, designed to be used during the maternity period. This website consists of three levels, each designed to offer relevant information and services to encourage expecting parents to surrender to the maternity period. The third element is the ‘Rustkussen’ and can fulfill several functions during the maternity period. The concept was further elaborated with a focus on life-cycle-thinking, the selection of renewable materials, multiple functions to extend the functional life, communication of environmental benefits of products in an inspirational and positive way and the encouragement of re-use. This report concludes with recommendations regarding further product development and an evaluation of the proposed concept to the design statement and future sustainable HEMA scenario.","bio-based plastics; sustainability; HEMA; maternity; Design; product-service","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2010-12-23","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

Esprite Nomade is a design studio, designing luxury travel and lifestyle products for wealthy travelers and luxury hotels. The company wants to stabilize its position in the market, and become a more profitable company. Therefore a new luxury tent line should be designed, with tents to be used for events, like parties, picnics and meditation, and a tent to be used as a private guesthouse. With this tent line, Esprite Nomade should change from capacity function to product function, meaning that tent designs should be ready for sale. Esprite Nomade’s mission, to increase travelers’ appreciation of nature, combined with the current market segment of luxurious travel, makes the niche market of luxurious sustainable tourism suitable for the company. The tents will be designed to be used in the tropical rainclimate, which is a suitable climate zone for both luxury and eco travel. The aspects of sustainability, ‘people’, ‘planet’ and ‘profit’, are investigated, resulting in criteria that should be met by the tent line. In an explorative research the vision of travelers and general managers of luxury hotels on nature experience, luxury and environmental conservation is examined. From this research can be concluded that travelers’ awareness of the environment can be increased by positive nature experiences, information and participating in nature projects. Based on the previous information the most important design themes for the project are ‘Nature Experience’, ‘Luxury’, ‘Environmental Friendliness’, ‘Customization’ and ‘Easiness’. Criteria for the tent line are stated and a choice for using bamboo and cotton-based fabric is made. The final design is a result of explorative sketching and model-making. This new luxury tent line is presented on the basis of the most important design themes. The new luxury tent line can enhance the user’s experience of luxury and nature by, among other things, by providing a feeling of spaciousness and wide outlooks on nature.","sustainability; luxury; customization; environmental friendliness; travel; nature experience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design for Interaction","","","",""

(mentor); De Koning Gans, H.J. (mentor); Boot, M. (mentor); Bijlsma, A.C. (mentor); Ligteringen, H. (mentor)","2009","Maasvlakte 2 is het project waarmee de haven van Rotterdam wordt uitgebreid. Het sluit direct aan op de huidige Maasvlakte. De havenbekkens van beide Maasvlaktes worden verbonden door de Yangtzehaven in westelijke richting door te steken naar Maasvlakte 2. De doorsteek bestaat uit een voorfase waarin een kanaal wordt gegraven ten behoeve van de lozing van koelwater van de E-on centrale, de zogenaamde tijdelijke doorsteek. Na de voorfase zal de volledige doorsteek worden gerealiseerd en is Maasvlakte 2 nautisch bereikbaar. Door de verbinding van de havenbekkens zal het getijvolume naar de Maasvlaktes toenemen waardoor de stromingssituatie in de vaarwegen naar Maasvlakte 2, de Yangtzehaven en rond de Papegaaiebek, abrupt verandert. Loodsen en schippers zullen zich moeten kunnen aanpassen aan deze nieuwe situatie. De hoofddoelstelling van deze studie is om te bepalen wat er verandert aan de stromingssituatie in de vaarroute naar Maasvlakte 2 door het verbinden van de havenbekkens, of er nadelige effecten ontstaan voor de scheepvaart en hoe hier met eventuele aanvullende maatregelen op kan worden geanticipeerd. De gedefinieerde subdoelen moeten antwoord geven op de vragen of de oplossing voor de tijdelijke doorsteek goedkoper kan worden uitgevoerd, of met een alternatief ontwerp een gunstiger stroombeeld voor de scheepvaart gecreëerd kan worden en wat de meest gunstige omstandigheden zijn om de doorsteek te realiseren. Om bovengenoemde redenen zijn voor deze studie beide fases van de doorsteek onderzocht en vergeleken met de situatie voor de doorsteek. De stroming voor deze drie situaties is gemodelleerd met het driedimensionale numerieke model Delft3D-FLOW. De getijbeweging door de tijdelijke doorsteek veroorzaakt gedurende eb en aansluitende agger periode een zone van verhoogde stroomsnelheden in de Yangtzehaven. Door het vertragen van de stroming wordt deze instabiel en ontstaat neervorming in de Yangtzehaven. De afmeermanoeuvre die schepen hier moeten maken wordt hierdoor waarschijnlijk nadelig beïnvloed. Door verdere toename van het getij volume ten gevolge van het volledig doorgesteken van de Yangtzehaven zijn de stroomsnelheden maatgevend vanaf het begin van de Yangtzehaven en rond de Papegaaiebek. Schepen moeten hier een bocht van 180° maken om Maasvlakte 2 te bereiken en door de complexe stromingssituatie kan het zijn dat de maatgevende krachten op het schip voor verschillende diepgangen van schepen anders is georiënteerd. Onder normale omstandigheden wordt hier geen hinder verwacht voor de scheepvaart. Op basis van het ontwikkelen en vergelijken van een aantal alternatieven voor de tijdelijke doorsteek is geconcludeerd dat de tijdelijke doorsteek waarschijnlijk niet goedkoper kan worden uitgevoerd maar dat met redelijk beperkte aanpassingen wel gunstigere afmeeromstandigheden gecreëerd kunnen worden. Door een afgemeerd schip aan de Euromaxkade op te nemen in het stromingsmodel is bepaald dat de aanwezigheid van het schip een aanzienlijke invloed heeft op het stromingspatroon in de Yangtzehaven. De maximale stroomsnelheid neemt niet toe, er worden wel meer neren gevormd maar de maximale dwarsstroomsnelheden nemen af. De krachten op het schip blijven binnen de gestelde toleranties van de afmeerconstructie maar variaties in de krachten en het moment op het afgemeerde schip ten gevolge van de zone met verhoogde stroomsnelheden zijn een indicatie dat de efficiëntie gedurende het laden en lossen mogelijk achteruit gaat. De doorsteek procedure vergt een goede voorbereiding en afstemming van zowel de werkzaamheden rond het sluitgat als de realisatie van het koelwater kanaal. Zodoende kan worden voorkomen dat het waterpeil in de havenbekkens van Maasvlakte 2 te hoog stijgt waardoor de afvoer van het koelwater wordt belemmerd. Om te voorkomen dat de stroomsnelheden in de Yangtzehaven erg hoog worden en dat er veel zand mee stroomt, zal de tijdelijke doorsteek gerealiseerd moeten worden als het waterpeil in de Yangtzehaven hoger is dan in de Maasvlakte 2 bekkens. Vanuit het oogpunt van de koelwater criteria is het raadzaam om de tijdelijke doorsteek in de winter te realiseren, als het water in de havens verder is afgekoeld en bij doodtij als de stroomsnelheden lager zijn.","haven Rotterdam; Delft3D; stroming modelleren; Maasvlakte 2","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-12-31","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Ports and Waterways","",""

(mentor)","2009","The aim of the project is to design a product or device that will enable autistic children to practice emotional expressions with the use of PrEmo animations. It will have to grow with the capabilities of the children and it will have to trigger the children to explore and learn. The product will be aiming at autistic children between 6 and 10 years of age that have no deficits in mental capabilities. These are the children who struggle most with their social problems during puberty. Snapje is an iPhone app. to learn emotions to autistic children in everyday life. The parent or caretaker makes photo’s with his iPhone from situations in which the child is part of or from familiar people. With these photos and the PrEmos games can be played. The iPhone has an additional cover with key cord that protects the iPhone from falling, bumping or breaking. Not only does it protect, it also brings more structure to the game in giving feedback on who’s turn it is. In the settings menu, players can chose their own character with belonging colour. The colour, lighting up from the RGB-leds in the cover, correspond with the colours of the characters that have been chosen. The level can be changed in the settings menu as well. A photo is opened and parent and child can play a game with the photo in which they both have to tag the photo with an emotion. The turns are well addressed by the coloured cover and the characters. The game can be played very openly, discussing what emotions take place, but it can also be played in a way you only know afterwards if the same emotion or different emotions have been chosen by parent and child. If the child selects an emotion that is identical to one chosen by the parent, the child gets directly extra reward. Afterwards it is clear who has chosen which emotion, by coloured distinctions similar to the colours of the players. This can be discussed, and the importance of emotions can be defined. In addition to this game the child can play four other games on his own. Match and Memory make the child familiarize with the emotions. With the other two games the photos can be reviewed. This happens either in a passive mode in which the PrEmo’s are visible or in an active mode in which the child has to choose which PrEmo belongs to the photo. Snapje is a fun way to learn emotions in relation to it’s context! Fun! The younger children do not only have a big interest in reviewing photos of themselves and familiar people, they also like the PrEmo-animations. Useful! Snapje interests the younger children who can still learn from situations in which they played a role themselves. It raises awareness to the emotions that took place in relation to the context. Intelligent children over ten years might have less interest in playing the game in their spare time. However, the game is useful for them when played with photos of strangers and situations in which they were not present. Adaptable! Parent and child find their own way to play Snapje. Either in an open or competitive way. Snapje stimulates playing together! The play-in-turns, create structure and clearity. Not only the child revives situations and becomes aware of emotions that have occurred with themselves and around them, but the parent can get more insights on the child’s emotions as well. Parents are enthusiastic about Snapje and eager to make photos for the game, if their child can still learn about emotions that occur by usage of these photos.","emotion; autism; children; iPhone; prEmo","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2009","Samples from two bronze Geistingen axes, one from Nijmegen and one from Tongeren, are examined and analysed in order to answer the question ‘How are they produced?’. It is concluded that both axes do not have the same composition: the Nijmegen axe is identified as a binary copper-tin bronze, while the Tongeren axe is regarded as a ternary copper-antimony-nickel alloy. Both axes possess a porous dendritic microstructure with an interdendritic phase, which is typical for a cast material. In between these phases, Cu2S- and lead-antimony particles are present. The axe from Nijmegen also contains silver particles in addition to the previously mentioned ones. It is assumed that these particles all originate from the raw material, namely the ores used, and that they are formed in the melt. The melt of both axes has been at least at a temperature of 1150 °C, based on the presence of Cu2S-particles. Probably, both objects are water-cooled after pouring the liquid in the mould, according to the secondary dendrite arm spacing. This spacing indicates that the two axes are formed with different cooling rates. No subsequent working of the axes has taken place on the sampling locations. In conclusion, the two Geistingen axes are produced by co-smelting the same types of ore in different ratios. The bronze is consequently cast into a bi-valve mould. This is then water-cooled to let the object solidify. No subsequent hot- or cold-working has taken place.","Bronze; Geistingen; Axe; Late Bronze Age; Production; Archaeometallurgy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Materials Science & Engineering","","Microstructure Control in Metals","",""

(mentor); Verbraeck, A. (mentor); Simons, L.P.A. (mentor); Mooi, H.G. (mentor)","2009","Nowadays, in an environment of globalisation, intense competition and rising research costs, Collaborative Research Projects (CRP) are essential means of sustaining technological growth. Collaborative research activities are increasingly applied across research-based and business-based organizations and are becoming an efficient way to achieve mutual outcomes. However, collaboration engages a broad sample of organizations often differs in culture, in values or project interests. Furthermore, the fact that CRP are being performed in an unclear innovative environment adds extra difficulties to be managed. Uniresearch BV is a firm that coordinates EU Research Projects and has developed its own techniques and methods to manage the execution of Collaborative Research Projects. With the aim to acquire a deeper and explorative insight into the methods and tools used to execute Collaborative Research Projects (CRP); the central research question to this study is: How can the management of the project execution be improved in Collaborative Research Projects? To answer this question several research approaches have been performed in this study. The main research approach adapted was conducting interviews of organizations, managing Collaborative Research Projects. The first part of the interview attempts to find what is considered as Project Management Success in CRP, the second seeks to pinpoint what the methods are used to monitor and control CRP, how do they contribute to achieve PMS, and how do they change across projects. The purpose of the last part is to identify which factors affect Project Management Success. Moreover, two questionnaires are part of the methodology used in this research. One questionnaire has been performed to Uniresearch BV employees in order to obtain a definition of Project Management Success. The other one to the most frequent users of Uniresearch BV web based management tool, with the intention of obtaining a better view of the standard tools used on CRP. This study has identified the usability of the final outcome and accomplishing the main objectives of the project as the main indicators of Project Management Success (PMS) in Collaborative Research Projects. In order to obtain a higher degree of PMS, this study has found two paths: through improving the methods and tools to monitor and control CRP, and identifying the relevant factors that affect the execution of the project and therefore the Project Management Success. Regarding the methods and tools to monitor and control, the findings show that in every project new methods have to be developed and adapted to the project. Consequently the interviewees claim that more integrated, standard and formal procedures are needed. Since they consider that Collaborative Research Projects is uncertain and this connotes a lack of knowledge about accomplishing the defined goals, formality provides more organization, policies and adherence to routine operations. They also agreed that the tools developed should be user friendly. Even though it has been found that the methods and tools used to monitor and control Collaborative Research Projects are not currently used in every kind of project, the findings show that risk management deserves more consideration in complex projects, like Collaborative Research Projects. Looking at the factors influencing the execution of the project, this research has identified that Communication, Trust & Commitment are crucial in achieving Project Management Success. Furthermore, a connection between these two factors has been observed during the research. As a conclusion, improving the level of communication means to improve the degree of trust & commitment between managers and partners. Apart from these two important factors, other factors have been found in this study. The results reflect that the project Set Up including the planning and the responsibilities of the partners must be well defined in order to execute the project in a good order and to ensure Project Management Success. Furthermore, the Partner Selection is another important aspect that has been found; the respondents of the interview consider that is relevant to select a partner with past experience or with proper skills to add to the project. The last factor identified is the managerial skills of the project manager. The respondents found that adequate personnel who apply the methods and tools properly make a difference in achieving Project Management Success. A pattern across the interviewed organizations has been identified. As a result, the differences between groups of projects have been examined over five categories: partner homogeneity, reporting frequency, communication frequency, methods to establish trust and commitment and managerial skills. Although the conclusions extracted from this analysis might not be proved, the differences demonstrated are undeniable. Private Research Projects, managed by private companies, report higher values in all the five categories and therefore it is expected to have better levels of management success. On the other hand, Research EU Projects registered lower level of partner homogeneity, which means higher project complexity but controversially, their methods are more flexible and less explicit. A set of recommendations to Uniresearch BV has been formulated based on the previous conclusions. First the methods currently in use to manage Collaborative Research projects should be further examined. Then, if it is required, the firm should implement more formal methods to establish communication with partners, as communication plans. Moreover, considering the importance of Trust & Commitment, it is essential to ensure explicit and described methods to enhance Trust & Commitment. Another recommendation might be effective when the company participates in the first stages of Collaborative Research Projects. Finally, it is important to describe in detail the tasks and project responsibilities and to choose carefully the partners to be involved. Although this research has its limitations, as the imprecise selection of the interview sample or the lack of detail collecting data, this study has achieved its aim of examining the methods and the influencing factors on the execution of CRP, providing conclusions and recommendations on how the management of CRP can be improved. Further research can be conducted to analyze in a quantitative approach whether the factors are affecting the Project Management success in each type of Collaborative Research Projects. Moreover, it is also suggested to study each type of CRP separately to identify which factors are more relevant in each group.","collaborative research projects; execution phase; project management; Uniresearch BV; Project Management Success","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2009-12-18","Technology, Policy and Management","Technology, strategy and Entrepreneurship","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor); Schitter, G. (mentor)","2009","One of the most versatile instrument in nano technology is the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). An AFM can image and measure surface properties on the nanometer scale by mechanically positioning a very sharp tip with a raster-scan pattern over the sample surface with a piezo-electric three-dimensional positioning stage. However, obtaining an image is time consuming and thus too slow to allow one to observe dynamic biological processes on the molecular level. One of the limiting factors on the image quality and operating speed, is tracking errors stemming from hysteresis, creep, and vibrations introduced by the positioning stage. Iterative Learning Control (ILC) is a control method that iteratively updates the input signal in order to compensate for repeating tracking errors. This thesis aims for applying ILC to the fast x-axis of a high-speed AFM scanner, with the objective to increase the scanning speed with nanometer precision. In standard ILC the achievable position accuracy is limited by the measurement noise. In this thesis two methods, reduced learning gain and signal averaging, are studied in order to achieve a position accuracy beyond the measurement noise when operating the scanner at video rate. Simulations demonstrate that both methods are able to achieve a position accuracy beyond the measurement noise. Analyses for different values of modeling error, demonstrate that the reduced learning gain method introduced robustness to the ILC algorithm. The choice between the two methods in terms of total learning time is determined by the iteration time, the measurement time and is subject to the amount of modeling error. The measurement time is relatively small when operating the AFM at video rate, therefore signal averaging is the best choice in terms of learning time. Both methods are applied to the AFM scanner and are able to reduce the tracking error beyond the noise floor of the sensor. However, these results are based on the strain gauge sensors of the AFM. Experiments to test the accuracy of the position sensors show these sensors to be inaccurate in certain working conditions. Nevertheless, when using the position sensors as reference, experiments for ILC operation at 1030~lines/s and at 1950~lines/s a tracking error of 1~nm is achieved. Therefore, it is possible that the ILC methods in combination with better position sensors reduce the tracking error to the 1~nm specification.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

(mentor); Hultink, E.J. (mentor)","2009","The project I conducted this project for my graduation at the faculty of Industrial Design Engineering from Delft University of Technology. In 6 months I investigated the possibilities for Hyves users to have a stronger bond with the brand. Hyves is the biggest website in the Netherlands and is a Social Network Site (SNS). Social Network Sites are online communities on which users can create a profile and connect with other users. Furthermore there are possibilities to share photos and videos, post blogs, add different gadgets, and so on. It can be said that Hyves is the only significant Dutch SNS, but international competitors are coming up within the Netherlands. In order to make sure Hyves’ users stay loyal to them, they need to ensure they have a strong bond with them. As Hyves has grown exponentially since its foundation in 2004, the company has not had the time to focus on their users yet. This project is a start into this direction and investigates users’ opinions regarding the site, as well as to estimate their bond. User research results in 2 ideas for Hyves to create a stronger bond with their users. The process In order to investigate users’ opinions, different research techniques are used. The project starts with a segmentation of the users. Hyves as over 9 million users most of which are Dutch. This means they reach over 50% of the Dutch population above 13 years old. To get a grip on this big amount of users, different segments were made, accompanied with a persona for each of these segments. As each of these segments would need a different approach to be bonded with, 2 segments were chosen to further focus on. These were the Ignorant and Curious segments: both are not very frequent users (weekly - monthly) and are not strongly bonded with Hyves. The Ignorant user just randomly browses around on the site, sometimes just looking around at others’ profiles, sometimes posting content (e.g. uploading photos, sending messages). The Curious segment is more of a passive type of user, who just looks around and never really post anything themselves. Both segments use the site more to keep up to date of old acquaintances, and not to be in contact with their close friends. A focus group with participants from these 2 segments gave more and deeper information about these types of users. 7 users participated in the session, which gave rich information about these segments. With the results of the focus group I set up a questionnaire. This survey was put on Hyves, and 1810 users filled it out. Finally, with the results of the survey 2 ideas were further developed and accompanied with an implementation plan The results In general this project has shown that user research can lead to new, important insights for Hyves. Focus groups for example are a good way for Hyves to get an indication of their users’ wishes. Online surveys also are an appropriate technique for Hyves to use. To website is a perfect host to collect data, with the amount of users which visit Hyves everyday, data collection happens quickly. Hyves does already conduct surveys, but this could be done more often, and be more focussed on users. For this project it was found that the more often someone uses Hyves, the more bonded they are. Furthermore 2 of the main reasons for users to keep their Hyves profile is because it is an easy way to keep in contact with their friends, and because it is a good way to find back old acquaintances. Also there were little reasons for users to delete their profile. A too public profile and or if they use Hyves too little were the top 2 reasons. Also it was found that privacy is important to the users, which is a recent change for SNS, were users are becoming aware of the dangers of personal information online: 60% of the users has made their profile more private in the past year. At the same time Hyves users have difficulties setting their privacy: Half of the users thinks their profile is more private than it actually is. With these findings, 2 ideas were further developed:  Visual feedback of privacy settings - Give users examples of what their profile looks like for their friends, friends of friends, hyvers and everyone. This enables them to check their settings and set them to their preference. Being sure of your privacy settings creates a safer feeling on Hyves and might lead to more participation.  Division of friends into groups - Explore the possibilities of division of friends into groups. Users often reflect their offline life on Hyves, which sometimes creates difficulties. On Hyves there is no degree in friendships, while this could help users to feel more free online. The division of friends will give users the possibility to give more nuance to their online network. It enables them to fence off certain aspects of their profile for particular groups. Also it could be possible to easily stay up to date of all of your groups of friends. For these ideas an implementation plan was made, as well as a project proposal for Hyves.","social network site; Hyves","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2010-12-18","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Song, H. (mentor)","2009","This master thesis presentation concludes the research done on a wavefront-sensorless (WFSless) adaptive optics (AO) setup, where light intensity of a focussed beam behind a pinhole is measured. As wavefront compensator, a Piezo Deformable Mirror (PDM) was used. The goal of the research is to investigate which algorithms lead to the highest light intensity possible and the time needed to reach this optimum. The research consists out of two parts: compensation for the hysteresis of the PDM, which now causes inaccuracy of the actuator strokes; and implementation of theories on WFSless AO found in literature. To reduce the effects of hysteresis, compensation was developed, which uses a modified structure of the Coleman-Hodgdon equations (C-H eq.). The inverse model can directly be used and the number of variables was reduced. The optimization algorithms used to find light intensity are a Nelder-Mead (NM) simplex which directly optimizes PDM actuator voltages (VO), a NM, which controls 14 Zernike modes and a line search (LS) and quadratic optimization (QO) algorithm that optimize 14 individual Zernike modes coefficients. The OA and the hysteresis compensator were experimentally evaluated. From the experimental tests it can be concluded that the NM algorithms result in the highest light intensity. The use of Zernike modes increases the optimization speed. For the NM simplex a reduction of 59-66% in time was achieved before the algorithm reached 95% of its final light intensity value. If the NM simplex in Zernike mode optimization is compared with the QO, the QO only needs 60 steps to reach a photodiode value of 3V (about 80% of highest possible light intensity), whereas the NM simplex needs 129 steps. The use of hysteresis compensation led to an increase of the light intensity for the NM in VO and the LS and QO.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

(mentor)","2009","The conclusions of this research are based on a combination of the literature on the subject of business cases and projects and of 50 responses (of which 26 complete), primarily by members of two professional organisations, to a questionnaire that was created for this research. The respondents have indicated to blame many budget and time overruns to unexpected events. At the same time they rated the importance of a risk analysis in a business case quite low, while a risk analysis could acknowledge the possible occurrence of such events - thereby already diminishing their effect on the project. This research also found many time-related issues, but it is proposed to solve these issues outside of the business case (e.g. communication), as it is not meant to present how a project should be executed. This research proposes to update the business case when large changes in the outside-world occur, to be followed by a new decision moment. This is proposed because (1) testing project decisions against an out-of-date business case is more difficult than when it contains current data; (2) large changes in the outside world may imply that the project does no longer represent added value to the business and it may be decided that it should be postponed or discontinued. Benefit and cost estimations within business cases are frequently (intentionally) inaccurate, which leads to false investment decisions. Understanding the opportunistic behaviour and taking the inaccuracy into account are first steps to solve the issue. Other steps that increase the value of the document are: applying discounting of future benefits and costs; monetising non-financial benefits or creating a cost-effectiveness analysis and including ex-post measurement strategies of anticipated (non-financial) benefits that will enable easier project evaluation. This research found no evidence in the dataset that the business case aided in achieving project management success.","project; business case; practice; success; cost; benefit; risk; time","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Technology, Strategy and Entrepreneurship","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor); Hultink, H.J. (mentor)","2009","This thesis handles strategic considerations for Redken, a L’Oréal brand which operates in the market of professional hair styling. It has a full portfolio for the practice of stylists. All products have a high quality, created through constant investment in research and development. Redken directly sells to stylists, by which it has a “business-to-business” (B2B) business model. As a result, little contact exists between Redken and the end-customer of the product. The only form of contact is by means of one-way communication: marketing. Redken produces many materials for in-salon use, created to stimulate product sales and strengthen the brand image. Due to the one-way communication with the customers, Redken lacks feedback. It has little knowledge on the in-salon experience of customers. Existing literature on in-store experiences and marketing provides useful knowledge. Firstly, full marketing support is important to make product launches become a success. Secondly, it is important to use customer segmentation based on the type of benefits sought by customers or purpose of their visit (either hedonic or utilitarian). Thirdly, loyalty programs can help create both brand as well as store loyalty. Furthermore, Redken needs to be aware of the importance of physical presence, either in visuals or in product display, communicating all its core activities and including its sponsorship of the Amsterdam International Fashion Week. Finally, be aware of the positive emotions enticed by free distribution of gifts or tools, and use these emotions to create possitive affect. Two consumer studies are used to gather input previously unavailable. The first study is a simulation of salon visits, through which input is gathered from 99 women. Each participant had her hair washed and had a scalp massage, the combination of which took 15 minutes. Participants were split in six groups, for each of which a different environment was created (two different locations, three different ways of decoration). After the services, they were asked to evaluate their experiences. The second study consists of two focus groups. From the discussions, several conclusions are drawn. Based on the outcomes of the two studies, recommendations are defined. Finally, this report is complemented by several examples of yet to develop marketing materials. Additionally, a concept brand plan is presented, combined with an implementation proposition for the marketing materials and several budgetary calculations.","marketing; consumer research; hair; salon; in-store experience; decoration; promotion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2010-12-18","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Bruining, J. (mentor)","2009","Since most easy oil has been produced, there is an increased interest in enhanced oil recovery methods, e.g., in-situ oil combustion. Oil combustion in its current form was first patented in 1953, by R.L. Smith and K.M. Watson. It has not seen widespread use, because controlling the process is considered very difficult, and explosion hazards and corrosion in wells made thermal oil recovery by employing steam, which was also developed in the fifties, more popular. Nevertheless, a steady stream of research continued to be done throughout the years. Experimental and modeling work largely focused on the so-called longitudinal behavior, which describes the process in the form of a wave-train related to a propagating combustion zone. In practice, however, the override of injected air implies the existence of reactive and transport processes perpendicular to the main direction of gas flow. Therefore, this paper embarked upon an experimental study of oil combustion processes occurring below and perpendicular to the overriding gas stream. A T-shaped quartz-reactor is used, of which the vertical part is filled with a mixture of sand and oil. An electrical resistance wire was used to heat up the interface of the overriding gas-stream and the oil-saturated sand column. The composition of the effluent gas was recorded using a gas-chromatograph. The temperature in the vertical part is recorded using thermocouples. From the produced data, a theoretical model is suggested describing the reactions and transport phenomena occurring perpendicular to the main gas-flow direction. Both low temperature oxidation and high temperature oxidation are observed. Air is transported through the sand by thermally driven natural convection and diffusion. Coke formation is observed. From the coke formation observed when using pure hexadecane it is inferred that a mechanism exists that forms coke directly from hydrocarbon components that are in the gas-phase. An experiment using glass beads as a porous medium instead of sand proves that this mechanism also takes place in the absence of potential catalysts. The amount of coke and the amount of transport of oxygen to the combustion zone can both limit the continuation of the combustion. Which is the case depends on what oil is used.","EOR; combustion; in-situ","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Petroleum Engineering","","","",""

The goal of this study is to observe the effect of ultrasound on the emulsification of oil and water. For the experiments that were covered in this study an ultrasonic bath was used. Characterizing the energy distribution within the ultrasonic tank was the first crucial step. It was observed that salt dissolution was enhanced as a result of sonication. The dissolution was used as a measure for the local energy intensity. A significant amount of salt had gone into dissolution as a result of sonication. This is a novel method to characterize the energy distribution of an ultrasonic bath Two high energy regimes that were localized with the dissolution method were used for the emulsification of the oil and water. A rang of surfactant concentrations were tested. The goal was to study the effect of a varying surfactant (alpha-olefin-sulphonate) concentration on the result of the emulsification process of hexadecane and water. After filling a test tube with a surfactant solution and oil and positioning it in the previously localized high energy spot in the ultrasonic bath the sample was sonicated. After 30 minutes of sonication, either an emulsion or a gel-like substance was observed between the surfactant solution and the oil. It had been observed that the type and quantity of this “middle substance” depends on the surfactant concentration. The gels that were recovered from the test tubes were freeze-dried and analyzed with a scanning electron microscope. The gel has a dual porosity. The large-scale pores have a spherical shape and are 50-500 ?m in diameter. The smaller pores are shaped as wormholes. They are 1-3 ?m in diameter. The gel could prove useful for near-wellbore applications.

(mentor)","2009","Due to a competitive business environment and demanding customers, many companies turn to globally distributed software development and agile methodologies. Globally distributed software engineering can bring great advantages in reducing costs, reducing time to market, and give access to a larger pool of skilled resources. Agile methodologies acknowledge many of the development challenges companies face, such as changing customers requirements and the necessity to have frequent releases. Introducing agile by itself can be a challenge for a big organization, especially when a blend is made between agile and distributed development, since these have some contradictory features. The global company Exact faces some challenges when introducing agility into its business processes. This research has as a goal to introduce agile into the globally distributed development process of Exact. It is hard to introduce agile as a whole, therefore we address the biggest challenges faced within Exacts development process first. One of the main challenges faced within Exact is communication between the globally dispersed product management and product development teams. An agile practice addressing this communication challenge is to use automatic status updates and product updates generated by an automated build process. This research will explore what features of continuous integration are useful for Exact and the created system will be evaluated. The ideas presented in this thesis have not yet been tested and evaluated on a large scale, due to time restrictions. However a prototype has been tested on a small scale for one project, and the initial responses from product development and product management were positive. More important, a shift in perception occurred at product development to support a more open development process.","globally distributed software engineering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-01-08","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Horvath, I. (mentor)","2009","This report presents the design of a haptic tool for designers. The tool should aid them in material selection for product experience and fit in an advanced design studio known as the Tangible Virtual Reality environment. The field of haptics and existing haptic devices were studied, as well as the Tangible Virtual Reality environment. Additionally, insights in designer’s needs for this task were sought. The results from these analyses suggest that existing devices are somewhat ineffective because they do not give multi-sensation feedback. Multi-sensation stimulation is what occurs in real life: when touching an object, people feel several characteristics like warmth, texture and softness simultaneously. Six characteristics are deemed important to designers. Consequently, a tool mimicking materials should provide a similar experience. Based on the multi-sensation theory, a solution idea, called the tactile window, was developed. The solution idea describes the intended behaviour, functionalities and possibilities of the design. Given this vision of what the design should be like, technologies that could achieve this were sought, and the possibilities to combine them explored. To contain the complexity, only two of the six relevant material characteristics, texture and warmth, were included in the first concept. The first is simulated using an array of vibrating pins driven by piezo benders, the second with a peltier element acting as a heat pump. The integration of the four other relevant material characteristics falls outside the scope of this project. To prove the feasibility of the concept, a prototype was built and tested. The functionality was evaluated with a simple matching experiment: nine designers and design students matched virtual materials displayed on the prototype to real material samples. The test results seem to confirm the multi-sensation theory. The prototype is able to give the impression of a certain surface, but the absence of four of the essential characteristics makes for virtual materials that are not considered one hundred percent realistic. Also, the algorithms for displaying texture and warmth need refinement. In general, the results of this project are promising. However, further testing with the existing prototype as well as further integration of material characteristics is recommended.","haptics; material selection; advanced design support","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Design for Interaction + Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor); Soons, F.A.M. (mentor); Hellebrand, S.L.M. (mentor); Ligteringen, H. (mentor)","2009","Op moment van schrijven is de aanleg van Maasvlakte 2 in volle gang. Het masterplan is echter nog in ontwikkeling, maar steeds meer keuzes worden vastgelegd. Daarom moet onderzocht worden of er op Maasvlakte 2 een ruimteclaim voor een Binnenvaart Service Centrum (BSC) moet blijven staan. Een BSC is een neutrale binnenvaartterminal waar een deel van de binnenvaartcontainers van de verschillende zeeterminals worden afgehandeld. Het BSC heeft een aantal functies. Het BSC vangt de kleine call sizes af voor de terminals. Het BSC vermindert het hoppen voor de binnenvaart. Het BSC biedt een uitwijkmogelijkheid wanneer er calamiteiten op de terminal optreden. En daarnaast kan een BSC een deel van de empty’s (lege containers) afhandelen. Als eerste zijn een aantal varianten van binnenvaartafhandeling vergeleken. Uit deze analyse volgt dat het opdelen van de kadelengte in diepe zeekade en een deel “dedicated” binnenvaart/feederkade een positieve invloed heeft op de wachttijden en de investeringskosten. Daarnaast volgt uit deze analyse dat bij de ontwerpoverslag op Maasvlakte 2 geen lange wachttijden ontstaan. Een BSC heeft hierdoor weinig invloed op de wachttijden. Ook volgde uit de analyse dat een BSC een positieve invloed heeft op de wachttijden voor zeeschepen en feeders. De terminaloperators hebben hierdoor belang bij een BSC. Naar aanleiding van deze conclusies is het BSC benaderd vanuit de optiek van de terminaloperators. Hierbij is de situatie bekeken waarbij de terminals de maximale overslagcapaciteit bereiken. Vervolgens is gesimuleerd hoe groot de extra overslagcapaciteit is wanneer kleine call sizes naar een BSC worden gestuurd. Hieruit volgt dat wanneer alle calls kleiner dan 25 TEU naar een BSC worden gestuurd, er 5% meer volume overgeslagen kan worden. Voor elke TEU die via het BSC overgeslagen wordt kan 5 TEU extra zeevolume aan de terminal worden overgeslagen. Wanneer alle calls kleiner dan 50 TEU naar het BSC worden gestuurd is deze verhouding lager. Hierbij kan voor elke TEU over het BSC 1,65 TUE extra zeevolume worden overgeslagen. Vervolgens is het BSC voor een stuurcriterium van 25 TEU verder uitgewerkt. Dit BSC moet een capaciteit hebben van 430.000 TEU. Hieruit volgt dat er 6 ligplaatsen nodig zijn, dit is een kadelengte van 554m. 554m is 3% extra ondiepe kadelengte waardoor 5% extra overgeslagen kan worden aan de diepe zeekade. Voor dit BSC zijn een aantal mogelijke locaties bekeken. Uit de MCA volgt dat de Hartelhaven de meest geschikte locatie is voor het BSC. Voor deze locatie is een ontwerp gemaakt met Wide Span Gantry kranen, en transport per MTS. Daarnaast is een ontwerp gemaakt voor een willekeurige locatie op Maasvlakte 2. Hierbij is geprobeerd het ontwerp zo compact mogelijk te houden, zodat het op verschillende plaatsen ingepast zou kunnen worden. Dit ontwerp is uitgevoerd met insteekhavens en het transport vind plaats per AGV. Voor beide ontwerpen zijn de kosten bepaald. De kosten voor het overslaan van 1 TEU op het conventionele BSC zijn 47,04. Voor het moderne ontwerp liggen de kosten hoger namelijk 47,38 per TEU. De conventionele variant is goedkoper omdat op de locatie in de Hartelhaven al voorzieningen aanwezig zijn. Voor de exploitatie gaat de voorkeur uit naar een coöperatie van de stuwadoors, want wanneer zij meedragen in de investeringskosten zullen zij ook gebruik gaan maken van het BSC.","binnenvaart; Maasvlakte 2; BSC; Binnenvaart Service Centrum","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-12-16","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic engineering","","","",""

In the last year, supermarkets have been buying pre-packed products instead of packing in the butchery. This is a big threat for Conpax since their machines are only suited for the packaging of fresh meat and cheese products. - ANALYSIS: Field research has been realized in supermarkets to analyse the existing usage of the machine. Supermarket butcheries do not have much space, so the new design should be compact. The expectations of consumers have been researched and lead to new presentation and packaging concepts. - FINAL DESIGN: A machine with a new architecture has been designed for Conpax.

(mentor); De Ree, J.J.D. (mentor); Molenbroek, J.F.M. (mentor)","2009","Analysis of the absenteeism among KLM pilots showed that much more KLM pilots (5,8%) are reporting absenteeism due to back problems than the average KLM employees (4,4%). Besides, KLM Operations receives yearly a lot of complaints concerning the comfort of the cockpit seats. Since the absenteeism of pilots due to back problems cost KLM yearly a lot of money it is desirable to reduce the amount of back injuries among pilots. This project describes solutions how the high prevalence of back injuries among KLM pilots can be reduced and how the comfort experienced while sitting in the cockpit seat can be improved. First of all an assessment of the back injuries and the discomfort experienced by KLM pilots is executed by a literature study. Next an extensive analysis is executed to determine the relation between the cockpit seat design and the reported back injuries and discomfort. A product analysis is executed to analyse the possibilities for KLM to solve the problems. A market analysis is executed to find out which solutions are available on the market to solve the problems. Next several concepts are developed and tested to solve the problems. The analysis showed that the high prevalence of back injuries among KLM pilots is caused by an unsuitable seat design and the sitting behaviour of pilots, who prefer to sit slouched. The seat pan and backrest contour do not provide a good sitting posture for pilots. They both initiate a slouched sitting posture, which is in literature described as the main risk factor for developing back injuries. Extensive analysis of the regulations for cockpit seats showed that it is realisable for KLM to redesign the cockpit seat cushions to provide a good sitting posture for their pilots to reduce the risks for developing back injuries. Several concepts for seat pan and backrest cushions are developed to provide a good supported and comfortable sitting posture for all pilots. Prototypes are built for the several cushion concepts and tested among KLM pilots. The best concept for the seat and backrest cushion is elaborated to a final product that meets the regulations which makes implementation of the cushions inside the present generation aircrafts possible. Besides, the change in sitting behaviour should be realized by giving all pilots an instructional workshop and half-yearly back check. Besides, it is advised to pilots to do fitness training at the hotel of destination. An instructional booklet is developed to increase the knowledge of pilots concerning their own influence on the development of back injuries and to give advise how to prevent back injuries. Apart from the short term solution for KLM there is developed a vision for the 2nd and the 3rd generation cockpit seats to prevent back injuries and improve comfort. The first tests with the new seat pan and backrest cushion show promising results. Based on these results it is expected that implementation of the new cushions in combination with proper instruction and a half-yearly back check will result in a reduction in the amount of absenteeism due to back injuries in the long term. More extensive testing of the seat pan and backrest cushion is advised to test the durability of the cushions and the opinions of more pilots, since test in the flight simulator resulted in very few responds. Since it is hard to realise a change in behaviour it is essential to frequently repeat the things pilots have to do to prevent back injuries. Although the project is executed to prevent back injuries among KLM pilots the analysis shows that the new cushions have to be implemented in all IPECO/Boeing cockpit seats in general, since the analysis showed that the unsuitable seat design which increase the risk for developing back injuries is not caused by the specific anthropometry of KLM pilots but by the general seat pan and backrest contour that does not correct support the human body. It is therefore expected that not only KLM pilots deal with a high prevalence of back injuries but all pilots flying Boeing aircrafts.","cockpit seat; KLM; sitting; back injuries","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Applied Ergonomics and Design","","Integrated Product Design","",""

On basis of a personal profile, the bracelet can find other people in the area that have things in common with the user. These people can be stored as contacts in the dock, and through camera and touch-screen input, users can send messages to them and to friends and family. In a final confermative research, a working prototype and a sight model were tested with end users, in order to specify if the design met the set goals. This research showed that the MeetMe is indeed a good way of acquiring new contacts for seniors willing to expand their social network.

Zakelijk verkeer en woon-werkverkeer vormen ongeveer 35% van het personenverkeer en zijn samen goed voor zo’n 7 Mton emissies (CO2- equivalenten). Volgens het Sectorakkoord mobiliteit, logistiek en infrastructuur 2008-2020 hebben“partijen behoefte aan inzicht in hun besparingspotentieel. Zij willen daarom over een inzichtelijk en verifieerbaar overzicht van hun CO2-balans kunnen beschikken, dat inzicht geeft in de huidige CO2-uitstoot van Partijen en dat een helder beeld geeft van de potentie en te verwachten effectiviteit van CO2-gerelateerde maatregelen”. Volgens de Taskforce Mobiliteitsmanagement is nu vaak nog sprake van een hoge mate van abstractie en is er veel behoefte aan praktische tools. In dit onderzoek is een dergelijke tool (of ‘beslissingsondersteunend systeem’) ontwikkeld die een organisatie concreet moet vertellen wat de omvang is van zijn verkeersemissies (monitoren), wat het hieraan kan doen en wat er potentieel bespaard kan worden (adviseren), zonder dat de bereikbaarheid van de organisatie in het geding komt. Ook krijgt de organisatie met de tool inzicht in kosten en/of baten van de verschillende maatregelen en inzicht krijgen in hoe de emissies zich verhouden tot andere bedrijven (benchmark). In het advies dat de tool geeft wordt per persoon een ´optimale´ reiswijze bepaald op basis van de potentie voor twee typen maatregelen op het gebied van mobiliteitsmanagement (modal shift en carpoolen). Hiermee wordt op bedrijfsniveau gekeken naar waar in de vervoerswijzekeuze van werknemers (modal split) winst valt te halen (zonder overigens mensen persoonlijk aan te spreken en bijvoorbeeld te verplichten om te gaan fietsen). Door met reiskostenvergoedingen te schuiven kan de organisatie wel proberen om een bepaald reisgedrag te stimuleren of juist te ontmoedigen. De uitkomsten van de tool zijn onder andere geëvalueerd aan de hand van een aantal casestudies bij verschillende organisaties. Hieruit blijken de resultaten die uit de tool komen redelijk te kloppen. Hoewel op sommige punten de nauwkeurigheid wel verbeterd kan worden, hoeft dit niet problematisch te zijn. De tool lijkt in principe een goed bruikbaar instrument voor CO2-reductie. Gebruik van de tool heeft daarnaast een aantal positieve neveneffecten voor het bedrijf. De tool bekijkt echter maar een deel van het probleem, namelijk het woon-werkverkeer. Het uitbreiden van de tool voor zakelijke ritten zal de complexiteit van de tool behoorlijk kunnen vergroten, waardoor uitbreiding van de tool niet een eenvoudige taak zal zijn.","","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

The system consists of vertical draining tubes with a length of 2.0 m called PEMs (Pressure Equalizing Modules). Under the surface level, every 100 m a row of PEMs is installed between the high and low waterline. Ecobeach is a Danish invention and the inventor claims that at beaches at different places around the world the volume of sand is increased thanks to the PEMs. This “drainage system” differs from other beach drainage systems in the way that normally horizontal drains are being placed under the beach, connected by a pump. When the Dutch test started very little was known about the functioning of the PEM system. For this reason scientific research to the PEMs was being started in September 2008. First the situation in the test area is examined. The beach, and especially the swash zone, is a complex area, influenced by tides, waves, sediment transport and groundwater flows. Five hypotheses are formulated of the influence PEMs can have on their environment. If a PEM can influence the groundwater behaviour in its direct vicinity, a process can be initiated which has an effect on the total beach. The initial events, caused directly by the PEMs, have to be studied in the field to make clear if the different hypothesised processes are realistic. Moreover consequences of the possible processes initiated by the PEMs should be recognized if anything happens. For this reason a fieldwork is executed in August-September 2009. Measurement results of the groundwater behaviour in the vicinity of PEMs show that some hypotheses are unlikely, and some are still questionable. An analysis of the sediment in and around the test area makes clear that possibly a process is going on in the Ecobeach test area, which could be a result of the PEMs. Because this study will be continued, this report shows an initial study to a very complex system. It shows the setup of a large study, interesting analysis methods and surprising results. Nevertheless it will lead sometimes to new questions.","beach drainage; ecobeach; sediment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

(mentor); Silvester, S. (mentor)","2009","Actually, not as often as you’d think. Statistics show the majority of car trips made in the Netherlands are on shorter distances. 80% of them are between 5 and 20 km and the car already after 2 km starts being a major part of urban transportation. On short distances (up to 7,5 km - 10 km) most trips are for domestic purposes (groceries, shopping, etc.) and exactly for this cargo transport the bicycle is an unappealing option. PhD. Research by E. Heinen has shown that the need for transport of objects greatly influences bicycle use negatively in comparison to car use. This is also supported by Anable and Gatersleben’s research, which states that the main reasons for choosing the car over the bicycle by people is the flexibility and convenience it offers. When we combine this knowledge with the ever increasing congestion in larger cities and the trend of limiting car traffic there by the municipals, there are clearly visible opportunities for an alternative on these short distances, where the car really shouldn’t be this prominent. The bicycle is an obvious candidate for this as it operates on distances where the car really is not necessary. In order to win share from the car’s position, flexibility and convenience of the bike should be improved. Expanding the cargo space adds flexibility and convenience; adding electric assistance improves the convenience. The effective distances of the bicycle is also increased, further moving into the car’s territory. The Packer is a new take on the transport cycle concept. The cargo area is in the rear to keep a clear view in the front. The cargo space of 220 L is larger than a standard supermarket trolley, while at the same time keeping the width and length smaller than competitors. The smaller rear wheel provides a larger contact force (meaning less rolling resistance). The design philosophy was to keep it clean, but progressive. This is evident, for example, in the elegant integration of chaincase and battery with the frame. The Packer has been styled in such a way it retains recognizable elements of cycles, but at the same time differs enough from the rest to communicate the message of a “new urban mobility concept”. This will also help it to distance itself from the niches some existing cargo cycles have locked themselves in. Put together, the Packer is a product which can increase bicycle use in urban areas with a combination of flexibility, convenience and image.","electric; transport; cycle; cargo; urban mobility; bakfiets","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2010-12-14","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

(mentor)","2009","The goal of this master thesis is to describe the spatial distribution of the wave overtopping discharge over and behind the crest of a coastal defence structure. The influence of the most relevant parameters on this process is explored. This research has been performed by means of a physical model. The following relevant parameters were varied during the experiments to consider their influence on the spatial distribution of the wave overtopping discharge: wave height, wave steepness, water depth, crest height and wave spectrum. Four different types of wave overtopping discharges were measured in this research: total wave overtopping discharge, wave overtopping discharge directly behind the crest, wave overtopping discharge over impermeable backfill and wave overtopping discharge over permeable backfill. Based on the equality of the comparison between the experiment results and existing theoretical methods to calculate the total wave overtopping; further experiment results are considered as acceptable and reliable and can be used to derive the relation for the spatial distribution of the wave overtopping discharge. The total overtopping discharge flows over the crest of the breakwater and is divided in two components: the infiltrated discharge into the crest and the overtopping discharge directly behind the crest. A method to describe this distribution is defined. This method includes the influence of the wave height, wave length and crest height. The spatial distribution of the wave overtopping discharge behind the crest depends on the permeability of the backfill. For an impermeable backfill with a slope of 3% towards the breakwater, the overtopping discharge at every point behind the breakwater is divided in two parts: one part flows back over the impermeable backfill under the influence of gravity and the other part passes the point and travels further away from the breakwater. The final relation between the reduction factor (ratio between the overtopping discharge at a certain distance behind the crest and the overtopping discharge directly behind the crest) and the distance behind the crest was found to depend on a dimensionless presentation of the wave energy flux. For a permeable backfill, the overtopping discharge at every point behind the breakwater is divided in two parts: one part infiltrates into the backfill and the other part passes the point and travels further away from the breakwater. The influence of the wave energy flux on the relation between the reduction factor and the distance behind the crest was found to be smaller than for an impermeable backfill.","spatial; distribution; wave; overtopping; backfill; crest; wave; energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Ambrosius, B.A.C. (mentor)","2009","This work is part of the ESA-project, that wants a preliminary study about the feasibility of building a permanent base on the south pole of the Moon, before July 1st 2020. Moreover after having completed the building phase, the maintenance has to be guaranteed for at least another ten years during the operational phase. The problem is tackled considering only the orbit design point of view. The Space Trajectory Analysis (STA) software has to be used to perform the entire mission, which is a requirement imposed by ESA. Actually this is a thesis group work, that has been split in three different parts, one per student: ascent (since the launch until the parking orbit is reached), transfer (until a lunar parking orbit is obtained) and landing phase. In this thesis the central part is investigated. Since the best transfer orbit has to be found, all the possible options to go from the Earth to the Moon have been studied and analyzed: two-body problem, three-body problem and low-thrust trajectories. Therefore the Lambert’s problem has been tackled by using impulsive manoeuvres and low-accelerations arcs (modelled by the Exposins theory). In both cases a global optimizer has been used to find the best orbit transfer. For these two kinds of trajectories the STA Interplanetary Module and the STA Interplanetary Low-thrust Module have been used respectively. The third option is represented by heteroclinic manifolds trajectories, able to connect the Sun-Earth and the Earth-Moon 3-body systems. To that purpose the STA 3-Body Module has been developed to compute trajectories exploiting this model. Also in this case a global optimizer has been used to get the best solution. In all cases the total ?V has been the objective function. Actually to build a lunar base the most relevant parameter is the payload mass that cab be delivered into a lunar orbit per each launch. The TOF has been strongly considered only for the trajectory design of manned missions, and, in case of similar performance, for cargo missions too. The computations turned out that the Ares V launcher is the only one able to transfer enough mass per launch in order to build the lunar base, and both high-thrust and 3-body trajectories can be selected. Actually 3-body trajectories allow to transfer circa 4 tons more per launch, for this reason they have been widely used for the building phase. Furthermore the Ares V is the only launcher that can accomplish successfully manned missions. In this case only high-thrust trajectories have been considered, since the TOF becomes an important factor to take into account. Low-acceleration trajectories seemed to be well-promising, but a numerical integration of the trajectory (not included in the STA Interplanetary Low-thrust Module) is required in order to better evaluate this kind of orbit. This was outside the scope of this particular study.","moon","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-12-08","Aerospace Engineering","SpE/ AS","","","",""

The conventional material testing only describes the fabric behaviour globally. In order to create better understanding of how sand/rock particles move under compression, micro X-ray CT-scans are made of specimens from the material in question. An X-ray CT-scan alone however, is not enough to properly analyse the fabric movement. For this purpose, Digital Image Correlation (DIC) is applied to obtain 3D images of the fabric movement. With this thesis research has been done to an alternative way of performing discrete 3d digital image correlation. While previous methods have attempted to use complex vector fields, an easier more straightforward way of detecting particles was developed. This method has been called ‘particle reconnaissance’. This might also be called refinding particles using their shape parameters such as volume, 3d area, moments of inertia, Eigen values and particle specific Cartesian coordinates. The ultimate goal was to refind all grains in a research mounting and visualize how they had moved. To develop and test this method the programs Avizo 6.0, Excel and Matlab were used. An attempt has been made to digitally transform the grains using their transformation matrix. Some trouble with the reconstruction of the rotation matrix from the inertia tensor and/or trouble with understanding how the principal axis in Avizo were defined has complicated this matter.","Avizo; Digital Image Correlation; strain localisation; DIC","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geo-Engineering","","","",""

Their products are sold to museums, visitor centres, zoos, etc. Museums are the main customers of Guide ID and the project has therefore focused on them. The assignment for this project was to design a new product for Guide ID that enhances the museum experience of visitors. The project especially focused on two aspects of the museum experience, namely personalisation and interpretation. Personalisation is a strategy employed by museums to respond to individual visitor interests and preferences, which can then be linked to their collection and/or activities. Interpretation is about the understanding of museum objects. Audio and multimedia guides like wall labels and catalogues are used to provide this interpretation and help visitors to make meaning of museum objects. With these aspects in mind, the ARGO was designed. The ARGO is a handheld application that makes use of the Augmented Reality see-through-effect to link interpretive content to museum objects. It enables visitors to actively engage in the stories of museum objects, follow their interests and choose the depth of their interpretive experience. In addition the product is able to help visitors navigate through the museum building with the help of virtual signs. This not only helps visitors to find the different museum facilities but also enables them to find specific objects within the museum. The application is distributed via the Internet and can be downloaded on the visitor’s own smartphone.","interpretive device; museum; multimedia guide; Guide ID","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

A force controlled experiment was performed in which a metal backed glenoid component with various PE inlay radii was subjected to a simulated joint reaction force. Local interface micromotions, rim displacement and bone substitute deformation were measured using DVRT sensors. All measured variables were significantly larger (p<0.05) in the non-conform inlay with radial mismatch 6 mm, compared to the conform inlay. These findings are contrary to previous reports by other authors who found that a larger mismatch not only reduces interface micromotions but translational forces and bone strains as well. The reason for these contradicting findings is the fact that in the present study a force controlled experiment was performed as opposed to a displacement controlled experiment. A non-conform inlay allows for a larger humeral head translation in the inlay. This causes a larger resultant moment on the metal back that opens the bone-implant interface. It is concluded that as glenohumeral mismatch increases relative micromotions, rim displacements and bone deformations increase, reducing the chance of vital bone ingrowth to occur.","In-vitro Measurement; Interface Micromotions; Glenoid Implant","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-01-15","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

The ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve block is a new regional anesthesia technique that is very promising. This new technique encounters problems when parts of a patients leg needs to be sedated for a certain operation. In most cases there are two nerves that need to be blocked, the n. Femoralis and the n. Ischiadicus. The first one is positioned in the groin while the other is positioned in the subgluteal region (buttock). In general pediatric patients are under general anesthesia while performing the ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve blocks. This results in that there is a problem when the n. Ischiadicus needs to be reached, because the pediatric patient is lying unconscious on his back. The conventional way is to turn the patient around with two to three anesthetic staff members. This causes problems for the staff and the patient. In this report a new solution is explored, one that is staff and patient friendly. The end result is a product that can be placed by one anesthetic staff member while the patient lies unconscious on his back. The product lifts the leg that needs to be operated and in this way create a large workspace for the anesthesiologist to perform the ultrasound-guide nerve block of the n.

(mentor); Özcan, E. (mentor); Van Egmond, R. (mentor)","2009","Products are no longer solely judged on their functionality; this is nowadays taken for granted. Today's products distinguish themselves by the user experiences they elicit. Depending on the product at hand, audition may play an important role in establishing such an experience. Therefore, it is important for product designers to consider the quality of the auditory experience. A typical design process consists of four phases: problem analysis, conceptual design, embodiment design, and detailing. A final prototype is commonly built during the last design phase, often it is only at that time the sound of a product becomes apparent. The sound may be evaluated, and should it fail to comply with the aimed user experience, a large part of the product may have to be redesigned. The product development process could be much more efficient if product sound design is incorporated from the very beginning. Product sounds, as emitted by domestic appliances (e.g., electric tooth brushes, microwave ovens, alarm clocks, etc.), are composed of sound producing mechanical and electrical parts. Various sounding models and tools have already been developed to imitate the sound of product parts. However, at the beginning of a product design process often no knowledge is yet available on the parts to be used. Contrary to sounding models, no tool to sketch product sounds existed, until now. This graduation project concerns the conceptual development of PSST: a Product Sound Sketching Tool. PSST is a sketching tool consisting of a collection of playful physical icons (phicons), a table, and a web-cam connected to a product sound synthesizer. The synthesizer can be controlled by manipulating phicons on the table. Each phicon resembles the sound parameters it manipulates by means of its visual and tactile design. PSST allows unexperienced industrial sound designers to create ideas for product sounds belonging to different product sound categories. Findings of two experiments demonstrate this activity can be characterized as sketching. Furthermore, the findings strongly suggest that the tool facilitates an interpretive cycle, and consequentially thinking sketching. Finally, findings demonstrate that the tool allows for intentionally creating energetic product sound sketches. PSST is specifically designed for the conceptual design phase. Proposals have been made to integrate PSST in a design studio environment. These proposals include exchanging sound sketches between design team members, modifying existing sound sketches, and coming to a fine-tuned compromise during design meetings. PSST is a first step in designing product sounds from the very beginning of the design process. When the resulting product sound sketches are used as guide throughout this process, a final prototype can be developed more efficient and more effective. The sound of this prototype will then comply with the intended product character, and the experience the product is supposed to evoke. PSST was realized through iterations of building, testing, interviewing, and creative sessions with (sound) designers. The project took place at ID-StudioLab, a design research community at the Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering, Delft University of Technology.","product sounds; sketching; tangible user interface","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

One aspect of this is how to cheaply enable game entities to travel through their virtual worlds in a natural and realistic fashion. Game map sizes and complexity have however risen to such an extent that there is a strong demand for automization in order to relieve artists and designers from their medial tasks, and enable them to focus more on the creative aspect of game design. As a solution to this, we introduce systems for the autonomous generation of precomputed Navigation Meshes (NavMeshes) and their in-game application. These meshes contain abstractions of all walkable surfaces of a static map environment in the form of a set of convex areas and a matching graph topology. We discuss the pros and cons of generating them solely from map collision volumes using a 'lightweight' form of Boundary Representation (B-rep or BREP) algorithm, to help remove areas that cannot be reached due to the dimension of the traveling objects. This B-rep approach provides compact yet accurate NavMeshes abstractions that are ideal for classic path-finding algorithms. Natural movement around dynamic obstacles is achieved using a combination of 'fuzzy' whiskers sensory systems, and a 'deterministic' fall-back mechanism that temporarily enhances the resolution of the NavMesh graph locally. Further speed-ups are obtained by parallelizing classic A* algorithms for nowadays common multi-core architectures. We introduce the 'Parallel Bidirectional Search' that significantly outperforms traditional A* implementations.","NavMesh; AStar; Parellization; Path-finding; automization; navigation; games","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Mediamatics","","","",""

(mentor); Charbon, E. (mentor)","2009","In the development of wireless sensor networks, the lifetime of a sensor node is always a key design consideration. Since the battery in a sensor node can usually not be recharged or changed, power management is an effective way to extend the network lifetime. The wireless transceiver, also regarded as the ‘main radio’, is a relatively power hungry component in a sensor node. Therefore, an auxiliary always-on hardware ‘wakeup radio’ was proposed in order to reduce the overall power consumption. The wakeup radio listens to the wireless channel whereas the main radio is only active for a rather short time when the wakeup radio receives the packet with a certain pattern. Consequently, the power efficiency becomes a primary concern in the design of wakeup radio. This thesis focuses on the low power design and implementation of a digital baseband subsystem in the wakeup radio. Firstly, the architecture and details of the subsystem are described. Then the design is verified by both a Spartan-3 FPGA board and TSMC90 chips. The design is functional as designed. In the end, the chip measurement setup and results are discussed. The power consumption varies from 2.1 ?w to 8.4 ?w, within our design target of 10 ?w. To our knowledge, it is the first work on the digital implementation and chip measurement of the wakeup radio.","wakeup receiver; WSN; digital baseband design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2009-12-14","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Engineering","","Microelectronics","",""

(mentor); Crul, M. (mentor)","2009","Climate change is already happening and represents one of the greatest environmental, social and economic threats facing the planet. The warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising global mean sea level. To stop climate change, scientists have set as an upper safe limit for atmospheric CO2 that of 350ppm (parts per million C02). In other words, the level to which we need to reduce the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere if we want to avoid the catastrophic climate effects. The bad news is that the atmospheric carbon has already reached 383ppm, and shows an increasing rate. Hence, instant action is required. Carbon-neutral prosperity is possible, but requires bold actions from all. A good start to do so can be from our own homes. Residential energy consumption is the second most rapidly growing area of global energy use after transport, contributing to total energy use generally between 15% and 20%. The adopted policies and measures to cut back greenhouse gasses attributed to households, aim to do so mainly by: increasing the use of renewable energy (solar, wind, biomass, geothermal) or by improving the energy efficiency of houses and households. The latter, is the focus of this project. If we want to improve the energy efficiency of households we have to deal also with the consumer’s behaviour as a significant determinant on the household’s environmental impact. To address this issue better, a qualitative research was carried out, with eight households in the city of Delft. By applying conventional ethnographic methods such as interviews, observations, probes and focus groups, the research aimed to understand people better, come closer and engage them during the whole process. A pilot study, pinpointed the need to bring the consumers closer to their daily practices, give them insights on their effects and help them develop a mental model about energy. To look for possible solutions, a follow up study was carried out, providing energy meters to the participants and probing them to interact with the meters and with their neighbors/participants. The study resulted to three key insights for changing energy consumption: Transparency, Feel in Control and Collaboration. The first is well addressed by smart meters, which transform energy from invisible to transparent, raising general awareness to people. However, what do people do, after they get aware of their energy consumption is often overlooked. During the user studies with the energy meter, participants’ interest faded after 2-3 weeks. Although they were might still checking the energy meter, they did not find the indications competent enough. What they needed was to feel more powerful and certain about the choices they make and the actions they take to reduce their environmental footprint in daily life. They needed to feel more in control of their energy usage. Furthermore, discussing about their experiences, comparing their energy consumption, sharing knowledge, practices and ideas helped the participants to identify problems and seek for solutions that would improve their domestic energy usage. To achieve this, the concept of the EnergyMentor was developed, which aims to help fill the gap from awareness to action. The EnergyMentor is social software that brings together people that want to learn or teach alternative ways of conserving energy and minimizing their environmental footprint. The EnergyMentor, complementary to an energy meter, can create great potential to save energy as it transforms the sterile indications of the energy meter into rich suggestions and tangible actions. The EnergyMentor creates a network of experts that can be called upon at a moment’s notice to answer questions about energy and sustainable living. By integrating the EnergyMentor in people’s existing workflow of using a cell phone or a computer, one can easily and quickly ask questions and get personal, precise answers. Listening to real stories of people that have already taken on the challenge to minimize their energy consumption can be more engaging and fascinating than browsing endless lists on the web. People can text ideas and solutions to each other or even send a video of themselves, for instance, making home energy improvements. Last but not least, the EnergyMentor offers the opportunity to find other local users who are trying to live a more sustainable lifestyle. This can create great dynamics on a local level, fostering more chances to grow grassroots movements and fostering the success of centers for sustainable living.","energy mentor; sustainable design; energy conservation; energy metering","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2009","During the last ten months, we have designed and developed a game for the Microsoft Imagine Cup. This game, built on the Cannibal Engine, was to revolve around the Millennium Development Goals. The obvious goal was to win the Imagine Cup, or at least to get as far as we could possibly can. Our team consisted of three programmers with little to no game design experience, and in the last couple of months a 3D artist helped us with creating the models of the game. In the end, we did not win, nor even made it to the finals, but we were still an experience richer. The design of the game did not go as quickly and as smoothly as expected, but in the end we came up with a design everyone was happy with. It would be a game that did not incorporate the Imagine Cup theme as explicitly as most other entries of the year before, but still would convey the message of the Millennium Development Goals. Set on a distant planet, we also gave ourselves some artistic freedom with the character design, which was necessary because we did not have an artist yet. The main gameplay element of the game would be the ability to travel back in time, whenever for however long you wanted. In the end the mechanic became limited in its use by an energy meter that depletes when you went back in time, and by a five-minute limit of the time you can go back in time. Implementation-wise this mechanic proved to be quite a challenge, especially in combination with an adventure-puzzle-platform game with enemies and other moving and changeable objects. However, with three programmers working almost full-time on it, any problems that arose were dealt with. Having three programmers also meant a sound and solid structure, except when the deadline nears, which is when anything goes, as long as it works. This did not have to happen very often, however. Near the end of the development process, we got the Cannibal Composer from Cannibal Game Studios, to go with their Engine. Using this Composer the world was created, story elements and puzzles were added to the world, and all just in time for the deadline of round 2. Or rather a trifle too late, since the end result could have been that much better, even with just a few hours more. All in all this has been a hard, but challenging and rewarding Bachelor Project, and none of us have regretted our choice of doing this.","Game; Imagine Cup; L-systems; Time travel; Game design; Cannibal; Scrum","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems","","Computer Graphics & Visualisation","",""

These methods are both variants of the classical Evolutionary Structural Optimization (ESO) method which is based on removing gradually low-stressed material. Both variants are similar in their heuristic approach taking the von Mises stress as a local removal criterion. However they differ in their topological description: ISOESO is an one-directional method with an explicit boundary representation; the structural boundary coincides with a von Mises threshold stress contour. Material is removed by increasing this threshold value. In LS ESO the structural boundary is represented in an implicit manner by the level set model which is bi-directional and thus able to admit previously removed material. These two methods are compared quantitatively on different benchmark problems.","structural optimization method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-01-15","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Klos, T.B. (mentor); Zhang, Y. (mentor)","2009","In many real-world decision making settings, situations arise in which the parties (or: players) involved must collectively make decisions while not every player is supposed to have an equal amount of influence in the outcome of such a decision. The ""weighted voting game"" is a model that is often used to make such decisions. The amount of influence that a player has in a weighted voting game can be measured by means of various power indices. Weighted voting games are part of the more general class of simple games. In this thesis, we study the problem of finding for a given class of simple games (including weighted voting games), the game in which the distribution of the influence among the players is as close as possible to a given target value (i.e. power index). We investigate the posibilities that we have for exactly solving this problem. For the case of weighted voting games, we obtain a method that relies on a new efficient procedure for enumerating weighted voting games of a fixed number of players. The enumeration algorithm we propose works by exploiting the properties of a specific partial order over the class of weighted voting games, for which we prove existence. The algorithm enumerates weighted voting games of a fixed number of players in time exponential in the number of players, but polynomial in the number of games output. As a consequence we obtain an exact anytime algorithm for designing weighted voting games. We look at various ways to improve on this algorithm. A large improvement follows by exploiting the properties of two specific types of coalitions, which we refer to as roof coalitions and ceiling coalitions. The algorithm, together with these improvements, has been implemented in order to measure the practical performance and to obtain various data on the class of weighted voting games. Our method for solving the voting game design problem heavily relies on the ability to transform between different representations of simple games, which we refer to as ""voting game synthesis problems"". We give an extensive treatment of these synthesis problems, and in particular we prove that there does not exist a polynomial time algorithm that transforms the list of ceiling coalitions of a game into the list of roof coalitions. However, we also show that an output-polynomial time algorithm for this problem actually does exist, by providing one.","voting; power index; cooperative game theory; algorithm; simple game; design; weighted voting game","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","","",""

(mentor); Bouwman, W.A.G.A. (mentor)","2009","An application is a specific class of information systems that supports the business processes of an organisation directly (Riemp et al., 2007). Many companies and organisations rely on applications to operate and support their daily operations. The complete set of applications of an organisation is called an application portfolio. As time goes by the application portfolio of an organisation grows and becomes more complex in order to support the changing business needs. As a result maintenance and operational costs grow and the adaptation of the applications to support the business becomes more difficult due to the complexity (Fabriek et al., 2007). Application Portfolio Management (APM) is a framework to structure the decision making for the investments in the application portfolio and should result in a reduction of maintenance cost and complexity, but also in an optimal support of the business processes. The APM framework defines the processes for the decision making and couples the business strategy to the application architecture in order to ensure the support of the business processes (Eck et al., 2004). Rijkswaterstaat (RWS) has centralised all IT facilities including the applications to the DICT, the IT department at RWS. The DICT encounters major problems to manage their application portfolios. The DICT is overwhelmed with hundreds of existing applications with the corresponding requests and wishes of the business, but the DICT simply does not have the capacity to fulfil all the requests of the business. In addition many actors from different departments with different goals and ideas are involved in the current APM decision making processes. All these actors have also problems with the current APM processes, but perceive also the outcomes of the APM processes different. The situation at RWS is recognised as a multi actor context, because the actors have different opinions and goals, but are dependent on each other to accomplish their goals. The APM theory only describes the theoretical processes for optimal decision making about the application portfolio, but does not take a multi actor-context into account. In the research project, process management is selected as additional theory and combined with the APM theory to solve the problems at RWS. Process management is a decision making process that considers the organization as a network of actors that have to solve a common problem. Process management typically applies in a network of actors that is not hierarchically organized, but exists of more or less autonomous actors that have different goals, but are dependent on each other to reach those goals (de Bruijn et al., 2007). The strategy to solve the APM problems is that the involved actors start a process in order to solve the APM problems together. In the research project an actor analysis is applied to establish a provisory agenda of APM issues and the actor configurations necessary to solve these issues. An inventory of possible conflicts among the actors, recognised as dilemmas, that might block the process is also provided. The main issues on the agenda are the absence of a business architecture and the absence of the selection process. The business architecture is required to derive the desired functionality and application architecture from the business strategy. The selection process is required to select the most valuable applications and most important functionality within boundaries of budget and capacity. Many of the problems the DICT originate from the absence of the selection process and business architecture. The actual design of the process, the negotiation of the final agenda and process rules among the involved actors and the actual process execution are not part of the research project. RWS can decide to start the actual process to improve the APM processes based on the proposed agenda, actor configuration and the dilemmas. This is also a major limitation of the research project. Only the outcomes of the actor analysis are validated by the client of the research, but the proposed strategy to start a process is not validated at all. Additional research is needed to validate the process management approach to resolve the APM related problems. Another weakness is the chosen research approach. The case study at RWS only provides results for the specific situation at RWS. The agenda, the actor configurations and the dilemmas all apply to the situation at RWS and do not apply to other organisations. However the link between the missing APM processes and some issues on the agenda, some actor configurations and some dilemmas are potentially more general than the situation at RWS only. Besides the limitations of the research project the process management approach appears to be useful to analyse the multi-actor context of the APM processes. Process management relates the problems the regarding to APM to actors configuration and potential conflicts among actors and provides a course of action for an acceptable solution for the involved actors.","Application Portfolio Management; IT Management; Process Management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2009-12-07","Technology, Policy and Management","Sectie Informatie en Communicatie Technologie","","","",""

The study showed that increasing the observation time, increase the confidence regions of the estimate. The study showed that smoothing is needed, but it comes with a trade-off between precision and response time. Increasing the time smoothing increases the precision but decreases the response time.

The tunnel will be construction with the cut-and-cover method. Before the constructions starts first a ground improvement campaign is performed. Afterwards sheet pile walls will be installed in cemented slurry trenches and the building pit will be excavated dry wherever possible. The subsurface in Maastricht consist of a top soil of sand and clay and a thick gravel layer on top of limestone. The water level in Maastricht is generally high. Goal of this report is to determine the geotechnical and geological risks related to the tunnel construction. The Formation of Maastricht consists of weak porous limestone with flint and hardground layers. The limestone can be affected by dissolution, weathering by groundwater flow, erosion due to the Meuse River or be faulted and reduced to carbonate sand. Problems with excavation, leakage of slurry, lack of bearing capacity and passive resistance and uplift of the building pit floor or high groundwater inflow are expected. In this report the extensive preliminary site and laboratory investigation is described. This investigation had the goal to assess geohazards and to identify the most promising techniques for further investigation phases. Various databases were exploited to map the fluctuations of the gravel-calcarenite interface. Characteristic horizons made it possible to make a member division for the Formation of Maastricht. Vertical displacement of members between adjacent boreholes revealed the presence of a fault. The cores did not only contain rocks but also carbonate sands. Pocket penetrometer test performed on cores at close spacing allowed an objective mapping of the spatial distribution of carbonate sands, very weak and weak calcarenite along the tunnel alignment. These results have been correlated to the UCS results. Beside that a correlation between carbonate sand and fault zones has been detected. At the fault location, analyses of groundwater chemistry confirmed the connection between deep and shallow limestone layers. Many geophysical test methods were performed in a pilot zone, above the detected fault. The seismic reflection conducted with a low energy airsound source was found to be useful to image the fault. It revealed the presence of a complex fault zone rather than a single fault. The north east orientation of the fault zone was interpreted based on regional fault trends and correlated to fractures measured in boreholes with the help of a borehole camera. Estimating in situ permeability and deformability remained difficult. Primary permeability was found to vary over 3 orders of magnitude, up to the in situ permeability measured with the Lugeon test. In the fault zone a higher permeability is expected. For each member the distribution of material properties is studied and the flint content per member is estimated based on the borehole logs. Of the stratigraphy, lithofacies and some material properties a 3D model has been constructed, to image and analyse the subsurface. These models are found to be useful since stronger and weaker zones can be recognized and since they can be used for future investigations of for example groundwater flows.","limestone; Maastricht; tunnel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geo-Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2009","Neural stimulators have the potential of becoming very important devices for the treatment of a wide variety of diseases. One of the major problems with existing stimulators is the limited waveform adjustability. This precludes the use of sophisticated stimulation programs and thereby affects the efficacy of the therapy applied. Another issue is the limitted implantability of the device, resulting in long subcutaneous wires. Because of these two reasons a new type of stimulator is required. Electrodes implanted in neural tissue are modeled using a highly non linear model with a capacitive nature. It is however shown that the response of the electrode tissue interface can be modeled accurately enough using a linear capacitive model. The physical process associated with the stimulation of neural tissue essentially comprises lifting up the tissue potential above (or below) a certain threshold value. This means that stimulation essentially is the injection of a particular amount of charge into the tissue in order to lift the potential of the tissue. Furthermore the injected charge needs to be canceled precisely in order to prevent tissue damage. First a system level design of a complete stimulator system is presented. This design includes the possibility of feedback: based on the brain activity recorded by electrodes a certain stimulation pattern is applied. After the system definition the design of the output stage, responsible for injecting the stimulation pattern into the tissue, is treated. Most existing stimulators use a current based architecture in which the charge is controlled by enabling the stimulator for a certain amount of time. Voltage based stimulation however is shown to have a higher power efficiency. A novel type of voltage based architecture is proposed using indirect current feedback of the tissue current. Using a current integrator with a very high dynamic range the injected charge can be controlled very precisely, while any arbitrary voltage waveform can be used for stimulation. Circuit simulations prove the feasibility of the approach and show a charge mismatch in the order of 0.1% is possible, paving the way to full charge balancing. Furthermore, they predict correct functionality over all process corners, including mismatch. The system only uses a singleended supply and the quiescent power consumption of the system is less than 17 ?W. Therefore it can be concluded that the novel approach for the output stage design proposed in this thesis allows the use of a very versatile stimulator; any arbritrary waveform can be injected while assuring charge balancing. Furthermore power consumption is minimized in order to relax the requirements for the battery and thus improve the implantability of the system.","neural stimulation; stimulator; charge cancellation; deep brain stimulation; tinittus","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Electrical Engineering - Microelectronics","",""

(mentor); Weber, M. (mentor); Brezet, J.C. (mentor)","2009","The goal of this project was to design a Product Service System incorporating a loyalty program for human power in the fitness club. This was started by a literature study. The fitness industry was analysed, literature on motivation and loyalty studied and a inspiration was sought in reference projects. This led to conclusions about the fitness industry, loyalty and motivation, requirements for the Product Service System and open questions that needed further research. During the research phase these questions were answered by interviewing stakeholders, members and club owners, and holding a creative session. The literature study and research together were the foundation for a vision on the Product Service System. This has three main elements; fitness 2.0, motivation and interaction. Fitness 2.0 describes the change of focus in fitness from appearance to health. For a healthy lifestyle you need to exercise, people have found fitness as a solution to implement exercise into their daily life. Motivation exists of two parts, motivation to exercise and motivation to act sustainable. Motivation to exercise was illustrated with an adapted motivation-ability-opportunity-behaviour model. Setting and achieving goals now feeds into attitude towards the action. Enjoyment is added as an extra feedback loop from the experience of the behaviour. Motivation to act sustainable can mainly be achieved by the Product Service System by informing the members on environmental problems and what they can personally do about it. The interaction system plays an important part of combining the concepts of fitness, health, nature and sustainability together. Based on the vision a concept of a Product Service System was designed. It contains of three elements; the loyalty program, the interaction system and greenwashing the fitness club. The loyalty program concerns the members generating electricity and the conversion of generated electricity points into rewards. The loyalty program makes exercising more fun and helps to motivate the members to exercise (getting rewards, setting goals. The interaction system involves all the interaction between clubs and members. This interaction is done via the cardio machine, the website and optional via a smartphone application or a kiosk. This interaction aims at motivating and/or informing the members on exercise and health, on sustainable actions and on the fitness club. The fitness club is analysed and recommendations on environmental improvements are made, clubs can choose how far they want to go. What the club does is also communicated to the members. In the final part of the project some recommendations are made on the business model. It is proposed Creditz markets the Product Service System as use-orientated. This means Creditz remains owner of all the hardware and clubs receive the service of the use of the machines. This way Creditz has good monitoring control in the start of the business, clubs do not have to pay a large sum of money at once and it is overall more sustainable as Creditz has full control over what happens to the bicycles.","human power; product service system; loyalty program","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Kamphuis, H. (mentor); Smulders, F.E.H.M. (mentor)","2009","Purpose - Open Innovation provides opportunities to overcome the problems that SMEs have in a product innovation process. The purpose of this study is to understand and improve the pivotal roles of the innovation intermediary in an open setting to match small firms through design activities. The matching process is caught in a model that pinpoints which essential roles are important at several stages. Design/methodology/approach – The approach takes the form of empirical qualitative research by participation action research. By use of a time-line the interventions and roles of the innovation intermediary are mapped. These interventions and roles are evaluated with (i) the engaged actors, and (ii) observations. Findings - The report illustrates how Open Innovation for small firms is created by the innovation intermediary. Collaborative activities between small firms is not achieved easily. Therefore the intermediary should take an active position in brokering by selecting and connecting firms, suggesting matchability characteristics. The major roles to achieve matches is the ‘connector’, ‘diagnoser’, and ‘project initiator’. Practical implications - The described process is used to communicate the valuable function of the innovation intermediary in an Open Innovation setting for small firms. Furthermore, it shows that passive Open Innovation hardly works for small firms. Originality/value - The study provides the first steps in research of a new type of intermediary organizations for small firms in an Open Innovation context. It suggests a model based on empirical findings of interventions for the innovation intermediary and improvements for future projects similar to the project which is studied in this research project.","Product Innovation; Open Innovation; Small Firms; Intermediary; Roles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Zand, F. (mentor); Van Beers, C. (mentor)","2009","Information Technology systems are used to cover many functions and they fulfil various roles within an organization. Corporate IT spending and investments have constantly increased since the plunge it took in 2001, and still there is much uncertainty on how exactly these systems influence the business and impact business performance. The large number and variety of IT systems and the lack of understanding of their effects in the firm makes the decision of the proper system to invest in a difficult one. Many have studied the value creation process of IT systems, but the results of these studies are not conclusive and often contradictory, which is why there is still a lot of research that needs to be done in this field. This study contributes to the IT value creation literature. By analyzing the mechanisms through which IT affects business processes by means of an extensive literature study, a new IT classification model is created based on the roles IT plays in a firm. The analysis shows that IT systems fulfil various roles in a firm, that through these roles IT affects several intermediate firm processes, and these intermediate processes in turn have an impact on firm performance. Unlike previous IT classifications which were made to be used in a specific context or to study specific outcomes, the classification that is created in this paper is a high level, general classification model that can be used to study different IT effects in various contexts. Besides an extensive literature study, interviews are conducted with IT managers in various firms and IT business consultants to get a deeper understanding of how IT systems effect firm processes and eventually business performance. To validate the model and get empirical information on which IT systems to adopt in which firm situation, empirical analysis is performed. The effects of the use of IT systems and sectoral differences between the manufacturing and construction sector are analyzed, as well as the use of IT systems with different firm and market characteristics of manufacturing firms. In short, the empirical analysis shows that: - Firms in the manufacturing sector seem to benefit more from the use of a customer relationship management system than firms in the construction sector. - For manufacturing firms with a wide customer base the use of a customer relationship management system seems to be a necessity if not advantageous. - For manufacturing firms that procure primarily from international suppliers the use of a supply chain management system seems to be a necessity if not advantageous. - For manufacturing firms with highly educated employees the use of an enterprise document management system seems to be a necessity if not advantageous. - For large manufacturing firms (more than 50 employees) the use of an enterprise resource management system seems to be a necessity if not advantageous.","IT classification; IT value creation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Technology, Strategy & Entrepreneurship","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor); Van Deursen, A. (mentor)","2009","Cloud databases generally use a data model different from relational databases. Instead of a fixed structure, the data is organized as collections of key-value pairs. The structure of entities is not enforced by the system; entities are flexible with regard to the properties they have. Many programming languages use static data models, which makes communication between these systems non-trivial. This document describes LINQ-to-Azure, a data access layer between Windows Azure Tables and .NET which enables manipulation and querying (using LINQ) of the data and supports both the flexible model of Azure Tables and the static one of .NET.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","","",""

(mentor); Happee, R. (mentor)","2009","Eight healthy young adult males seated in a rigid chair and restrained by a five point harness belt underwent anterior-posterior random appearing multisine perturbations with a frequency range of 0.3-20 Hz. Six different conditions were tested differentiating in maximum acceleration level ([1;2;4;8] m/s²) and in task (mental arithmetic and blindfolded). The head and neck kinematics were captured by a Qualisys motion capture system and Xsens accelerometers. Muscle activity of the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles was collected by a Delsys EMG system. A two pivot neck model was developed representing the head-neck kinematics separating upper and lower neck kinematics. The kinematics were described with an error margin of 2.5 % of the maximum range of motion of the head. The amount of neck deformation relative to the perturbation is expressed in gain and phase, the linearity is expressed in squared coherence. For the head-neck kinematics a significant (P < 0.05) increase in gain was found for decreasing acceleration levels, indicating non-linearity of the human reflexes and/or the passive neck mechanics. At lower frequencies, the mental arithmetic task resulted in a 9 % decrease of neck deformations (P < 0.01). At lower frequencies, blindfolding resulted in a 16 % increase of neck deformations (P < 0.05). The pivot rotations showed for low acceleration levels similar gain and phase characteristics for both the upper and lower pivot up to 3 Hz. Increasing acceleration levels resulted in a major decrease of relative upper neck deformations (P < 0.05) and an increase of relative lower neck deformations (P < 0.01), suggesting different control strategies for both pivots. For frequencies above approximately 5 Hz an increasing phase lag up to 180º for the upper pivot with respect to the lower pivot is found, indicating C-shaped neck bending for low frequencies and S-shaped neck bending for high frequencies. With the exception of the upper pivot response the squared coherence showed globally values above 0.5 between 1-12 Hz.","human neck; head kinematics; stabilization; identification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BMechE","","","",""

(mentor); Van Ham, J.C. (mentor); Schrijnen, P.M. (mentor)","2009","The European Union (EU) transport sector and its policymakers are presently being confronted with two crises: fossil-fuel dependency and environmental degradation. The EU has introduced the two Directives 2003/30/EC and 2009/28/EC to increase the sustainability of the transport sector in relation to these issues. The directives require Member States (MSs) to set targets for the share of renewable energy in transport which is to replace petroleum-based fuels, and thus help to reach the mandatory level of ten percent by 2020. Biofuels are considered to be the most viable option to meet these targets. This research outlines the issues to be tackled when considering increases in biofuel usage and examines a potential scheme with the objective of achieving an increase in the use of biofuels in the road transport sector; the development of EU biofuels corridors. An EU biofuels corridor is defined as a long-distance and cross-border route on the Trans-European Transport (TEN-T) Network roads on which blends with a high biofuel content (referred to as high-blends) are offered regularly along the entire length of the route.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Delft University of Technology","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","","TIL","",""
