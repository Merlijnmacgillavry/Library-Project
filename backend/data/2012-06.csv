(mentor); Jonkers, H.M. (mentor)","2012","A polymer-modified self-healing mortar is a mixture of Portland cement, water, sand, polymer and self-healing material. The polyacrylic ester emulsion (PAE) is used as polymer and as self-healing material bacterial spores from genus Bacillus + calcium lactate is used. The reason why this type of bacteria is used as a component of self-healing material is because of the high alkaline environment inside the mortar. A mortar has a pH value of between 9 and 11. As far as known, only this kind of bacteria can be used as a self-healing agent for mortars. Why a polymer-modified self-healing mortar? This polymer- modified self-healing mortar has an autonomous self-healing mechanism with, a high workability, a high flexural strength and also a high adhision. The experiments that has been performed in this study show that a polymer- modified self-healing mortar is a strong material with and active self-healing. This bacterial self-healing mechanism can heal cracks up to 0.46mm in contrast to the autogenous self-healing (of conventional mortar) of cracks up to 0.18mm. Beside this the fresh mortar showed a high workability. These properties make the polymer-modified self-healing mortar a strong and a more durable mortar. This concept can also be used to produce polymer-modified self-healing concrete.","self-healing; bacteria","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Materials and Environment","","","",""

Silences are as interesting as utterances. They tell us much about the process of globalization.” (Short, 2008) Silences refer to the cities whose connectivity is less than that predicted by their population, and they are called Black holes. According to R.Short explanation, Tehran, Baghdad and Pyongyang are among those cities which have an ideological resistance of being connected to the global system because of their religious or politics beliefs. But on the other hand, the economic role of Tehran in Islamic Financial Services (IFS) among the Islamic countries and the geo-political and social role of Tehran in the Middle Eastern countries show us a new aspect of globalization which has never been mentioned in the recent recognized literature. Maybe it is now the time to shift our analysis to the Middle East countries which have been the victim of the hegemonic world city imagination highlighted by Massey (2007). Moreover, Tehran municipality is now at a crossroad in its spatial development. “Making Tehran a Global city” is one of the seven main aims of its last master plan. In this regard, creating a “world trade centre” in Southern part of the city has introduced as an action project contributing in achieving this goal. The problem deal with this project is about the concept and location of the project. The southern part of city of Tehran has faced an uneven development through its growth history. This trend has resulted to an obvious division and polarization between North and South socially and spatially. Consequently, south part of Tehran is now full of left-over post-industrial areas which are like voids among new urbanized parts.

The result is to establish an integration of urban-business environments through Hi-speed infrastructures and therefore, reconfigure development towards hinterlands-region. This thesis is a morphological research into Mumbai’s urban centres focused on the changing roles of the central business districts, their connectivity and the behavior of the city towards its hinterland region, situated in the age of rapid urbanization and metropolitan expansion. Mumbai is the financial capital of India and an alpha city (see figure 3) owing to its increased corporate presence in the global economic networks (Grant and Nijman, 2002). As a ‘Gateway City’ Mumbai is changing at a fairly rapid pace of urban restructuring necessitated by its present day urban structure as a large metropolitan center (Sita, 2008). The population of Mumbai Metropolitan Region is expected to increase from 19.0 million in 2007 to 26.4 million in 2025 (UN Secretariat, 2007). The main background of this graduation project explores the various urban development processes of Mumbai in different-scales of the city, metropolis and region aimed at restructuring the growth of city mainland (see figure 2) towards the hinterland region. It is a specific study on the effects of historical transformations on the city structure from an infrastructural point of view to explore the spatial consequences. The problem deals with the notion of five main centralities in Mumbai, namely Fort-Nariman Point, Bandra-Kurla Complex, Thane, Vashi and Panvel, wherein each is a different reality in itself and the south CBD remains the dominant source of most employment activities. The problem statement is formulated based on the lack of metropolitan integration between the urban centres, which has an enormous impact on the infrastructure of the city, causing overstressed transportation, congestion of the inner city and further lacks new development opportunities for city growth. (described in detail in the next sections). The research objectives and questions are framed based on these challenges which engage Mumbai as an emerging global city positioned in different scales. The space of present Mumbai needs new development strategies and tools, adequately supported by physical infrastructure to reconfigure city growth towards hinterlands and to make the urban centres work together. Therefore, the context of this thesis is twofold; the first researches the role of Mumbai as an emerging global city and the second researches its poly-centric structure. The project focuses on delivering a spatial proposal for a strategic development plan for the twin cities of Mumbai and Navi Mumbai by the addition of a new development axis, and a design test incorporating the idea of different-scales. The axis is a ring which circles the twin cities and integrates the centralities by the addition of a new High-speed public transportation layer to balance urbanization across the peninsula-region.","Transformation; Centralities; Scales; Integration; Congestion; Transportation; Relations; Development; Hi-speed","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Urbanism","","Complex Cities and Regions in Transformation","",""

In addition, huge amounts of data are collected which tells us more about the sedimentology of the beach and soil structure. This data is used later on to study influenced beach processes and morphological change. For this study both the beach near Egmond aan Zee as the beach near Hvide Sande are looked at. At these coastal areas several drainage tube fields are installed. A large-scale mechanism is described which describes a hypothesis for the influence of the drainage tubes on the beach sediment. This mechanism consists of five possible processes that could be categorized into three groups: pressure changes, air ventilation and vertical transport of water. It starts with the flow of water through the tubes due to a continuous variation of the sea level. A starting point or ‘trigger’ could be the measured outflow of groundwater by Pieterse (2009). Water stored in the beach subsoil flows from the high water line to the low water line by a groundwater gradient. The drainage capacity of the tubes is largely determined by the outflow capacity of water. As the water chooses the path of least resistance the very permeable shell layers at Egmond aan Zee or gravel layers near Hvide Sande could increase the flow through the tubes. Levelling of the groundwater gradient increases the storage capacity of water in the beach. As the moisture level of the beach lowers, the beach becomes more dry in time. Aeolian transport increases which sorts the sediment at the beach. Fine grains are blown away along the coast and into the dunes. The beach becomes more stable.","sediment; ecobeach; drainage tubes; hugo ekkelenkamp; Egmond; Hvide Sande; NETICS; morfologie; morphology; korrelgrootte; groundwater","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

(mentor); Romein, A. (mentor)","2012","The shift in society from industrial towards a society where innovation, knowledge and creativity are the pillars of the economy has among others led to abandoned industrial sites. Government organisations are searching for ways to attract creative workers to their area. In the mean time conventional financial fundings of big redevelopments are no longer realistic, because of the building crisis. This thesis is aiming to develop a strategy for former industrial areas to redevelop, with the help of local (creative) entrepreneurs with limited big investments. We apply this strategy with a design on a former sugar factory in the city of Groningen. This former sugar factory is a 125-hectare big site, with a hardened factory site and meadows in the periphery of the city. The municipality bought the area in 2010 and is now wondering what to do with this plot of opportunities within their borders. The council itself has no direct building need, or the resources to invest largely in the area; on the other hand it is aiming to become a ‘city of talent’. The research question is: How to create a spatial strategy for a creative-based urban development, with limited financial resources on a former industrial site, in the case of the sugar factory in the city of Groningen? Research shows that creative entrepreneurs can play an important role in transforming former industrial sites into attractive areas. Therefor it is important to know what spatial elements can attract these creative entrepreneurs to a certain area. It is important for them to agglomerate and meet in third places like bars and galleries in a certain area because that way they can a) get in contact with cultural gatekeepers b) derive a form of inspiration out of others, and the area c) use the creative reputation for their own cause. Research shows that creative entrepreneurs are drawn to an area that; a) has a certain sense of place b) is mixed in use, functions and style c) is flexible in their use d) provides contrasts of old (industrial) heritage and new attractive real estate e) is well accessible, close to the centre and provides a safe environment. A possible strategy to redevelop a former, not so popular enclosed site with creative entrepreneurs is by placemaking and building a infrastructural framework. By allowing creative entrepreneurs to use the space for all sorts of temporary projects the site a) gets known by potential future users B) improves the reputation of the site c) the value of the property increases and development can take place after a while. By providing in a basic infrastructural framework and leaving the infill flexible and changeable through time an area becomes attractive for all sorts of users. The strategy of the SuikerUnie uses this model of strategy, and applies two new elements. A) The use of the plots remains flexible and adaptable through time. B; the strategy proposes a gradual investment model, where the investments in the public space and network co-evolve along with the development of the inhabitants. In the case of the SuikerUnie the site is made accessible by adding a new clear basic infrastructural framework and a new station. The site is split up in three parts; a new creative district, an agricultural park, and a rural area. The creative district is located on the hardened area of the site. The former factory is redeveloped in a creative factory; the station is placed next to it and provides a new link to the other side of the train track. It connects to the current infrastructure and to two redeveloped hangars. One hangar is redeveloped into a biological food market the other into an educational institute. The rest of the creative area is coming to life by adding student container within the new infrastructural grid, and providing physical space for temporary projects. When investors (small or big) are interested, the containers can move a block and the temporary projects get a little bit less space. This way the area transforms towards a creative new district in town. The agricultural park provides a spatial connection between the rural landscape and the city park outside of the area. The park shows in an aesthetic way all sorts of agricultural crops. The products are sold in the biological market and attract potential new inhabitants to the site. The rural area is transformed from meadows into an area where one can work, recreate and live in a green environment. This is done by making a new infrastructural framework along the existing ditch pattern. The plots within the framework are rented out to allotment owners. They pay the ground price back in yearly small installments. These new users are encouraged to build their own house through time. Along with the amount they built on their plot, the yearly installment increases. The quality of the street-profile gets upgraded alongside with the transformation of the area. The more the new inhabitants invest in their homes, the more the municipality has to invest in the public space. Rules and guidelines for building your house prevents the area from being enclosed and scattered. The outcome of this strategy is not predicteble beforehand. The area becomes a new centre for living, working and recreating. But it is possible that the area remains a low profile green area where there are a lot of allotment gardens, student houses and a biological creative centre. The framework and the financial model is flexible and adaptable enough to capture these outcomes. The innovative part of the strategy is the combination of using all sorts of actors with a spatial need (not only creative entrepreneurs) and allowing the public space and the amount of investments by the owners to upgrade alongside with the development of the inhabitants. The gradual growth of the area, the flexible outcome of the area, in combination with the chance to start today makes this strategy truly creative.","industrial heritage; strategies for redevelopment; creative cities; spatial design; urban regeneration; transformation of brownfields; allotments; creative entrepreneurs","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-07-07","Architecture","Urbanism","","Urban Regeneration","",""

(mentor)","2012","Problem statement Sports teachers (and other users) often suffer from bad acoustics in sports halls. A survey revealed that most complaints are about tiredness, throat problems and hearing problems. Bad acoustics in sports halls are mainly caused by an uneven distribution of the sound absorbing material in a hall. Often, the roof absorbs most of the sound where the floor and walls up to 3 meter reflect most of the sound. This lower part of the walls needs to be strong, flat and hard to rebound balls. In this way, vertically reflected sound is being absorbed faster than horizontally reflected sound. This difference causes sagging Schroeder curves and therefore long reverberation times. Dutch standards for acoustics are mainly based on reverberation times, so sagging curves are unwanted. Besides the problem of the long reverberation times, another problem is found. Measurements show that sports halls constructed with stone-like materials absorb sound according to the expectations of the material properties. Sports halls constructed with perforated steel sound absorbing panels give different results. These panels seem to behave differently on sound absorption than expected. Especially low frequencies seem to be absorbed extremely well by the panels. The research question therefore is: ‘Why do perforated steel sound absorbing panels seem to behave differently in absorption coefficient in sports halls than expected from laboratory test results?’ Because this question is part of the larger subject ‘acoustics in sports halls’, it is necessary to investigate the acoustical behaviour of perforated steel panels for a broad demarcation of the subject. Approach In order to find an answer to the research question, two hypotheses are tested by measurements. The measurements are done in a laboratory and in a scale model. The results are analysed. The conclusions give insight in the sound absorbing behaviour of perforated steel sound absorbing panels. Besides that, the conclusions give guidelines to the design phase of this graduation project. Hypotheses: 1. A perforated steel panel behaves differently in practice than in a laboratory situation on absorption coefficient because the shape of the panels causes sound absorption of parallel striking sound based on a phase shift principle. 2. A perforated steel panel behaves differently in practice than in a laboratory situation on absorption coefficient because the backing construction has influence on the result. Laboratory measurements Absorption coefficient measurements are done in the reverberation room of the acoustical laboratory. Different samples of the roof structure are tested. By comparing the results, we get insight in the influence of different parts of the roof structure. Besides that, hypothesis one can be tested: the influence of the backing construction will become clear. Scale model measurements The scale model makes it possible to test the influence of different shaped roof structures in a small model. By using the same, reflecting material for all walls, we get insight in the influence of changes in roof shapes. Some of the roof structures are (partly) covered with a sound absorbing material to compare the results of those to the other variations. This research should give an answer to hypothesis two. Results The scale model measurement results show that profiled structures cause a considerable decrease in local sound pressure compared to a hard, flat surface. This decrease is largest for low frequencies. The surface with sound absorbing material on top causes the biggest decrease, which is caused by the sound absorption of the facing material. The ‘sound absorption by shape’ is caused by the phenomena of diffusion and interference. It is not visible in reverberation times (T20), just in histograms and Schroeder curves. The laboratory measurements show that the influence of the thermal insulation layer; a part of the backing construction, is large on (low frequent) sound absorption. The rock wool panels give a high peak in the sound absorption graph for 100 Hz. This very good sound absorption is probably caused by the panel being its own panel-resonator and porous absorber in one. The influence of the ‘cannelurevulling’ is small, like the influence of the vapour barrier and different perforation degrees. Conclusions Perforated steel sound absorbing panels absorb more low frequent sound than expected. This good sound absorption is probably achieved by the profiled shape of the steel panels in combination with the backing thermal insulation. The profiled shape causes the effect of sound absorption caused by the effects of diffusion and interference. The backing construction absorbs a large part of the low frequent sound because the hard, stiff and heavy rock wool panels are probably a porous material and panel resonator in one. The research does not give strong guidelines to improve the roof structure. The gained knowledge is used in the design of a wall panel. The walls up to three meters are still the weakest link when talking about acoustics in sports halls. The designed panel should improve this situation.","acoustics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-06-30","Architecture","Building Technology","","Green Building Innovation","",""

We beschouwen een vloeistof tussen twee platen, de vloeistof wordt bewogen door de bovenste plaat een constante snelheid te geven, daardoor zal een snelheidsprofiel in de vloeistof ontstaan. We verwachten verschillende snelheidsprofielen afhankelijk van de soort vloeistof die tussen de platen zit. In een niet-Newtonse vloeistof, zoals gelei of olie, kunnen lagen met een verschillende snelheidsgradiënt ontstaan. De lagen noemen we schuifbanden. Dit verslag behandelt snelheidsprofielen en de bijbehorende schuifbanden in vloeistoffen. De schuifbanden ontstaan door polymeren in de vloeistof, polymeren zijn lange moleculen met een herhaalde structuur. De polymeren in de vloeistof kunnen in elkaar verstrengeld raken. In dit opzicht verschillen niet-Newtonse stoffen, bijvoorbeeld olie, van een Newtonse vloeistof zoals water. Om met deze verschillende soorten vloeistoffen te kunnen werken is het belangrijk om te weten hoe ze zich gedragen. Om stromingen van vloeistof te beschrijven, gebruiken we de Navier-Stokes vergelijkingen. Met behulp van deze vergelijkingen kunnen we de evenwichtsituatie van een bewegende vloeistof vinden. In dit verslag wordt gekeken of de evenwichtsituatie stabiel is. Praktisch gezien kunnen de lagen zich anders over de vloeistof verdelen als het evenwicht niet stabiel is.","vloeistofstroming; schuifbanden; shear bands; snelheidsprofiel","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Applied Mathematics","","","",""

(mentor); Van Grondelle, E. (mentor)","2012","Pearl River Delta (PRD) is one of the fastest economic development regions in China. The big cities in PRD attract a great many young high-educated immigrants and become over crowded. The number of private cars has been dramatically increasing since the last few years, which creates serious traffic congestion, air pollution and energy shortage. Most young immigrants are living stressfully in these cities due to the low income, high workload and limited personal mobility. They spend hours in commuting. They are surrounded by the “concrete jungles”, where people tend to worship social status and wealth. It is predicted in this thesis that the PRD transportation in 2020 will shift from the currently dominant private cars to more public transportations and bicycles. In order to accord with this sustainable mobility, the Urban Cocoon electric concept car wants to empower people to stay sensible, empathy and connected with others, and rediscover their intuitive needs for personal mobility. This mobility should be sustainable, enable people to keep pace with the rapid life and adapt to the hot and humid weather. Instead of being sold as private cars, the Urban Cocoons will be used as sharing cars, which offer affordable, high-quality personal mobility to the citizens, while limit the impact to the environment. As sharing cars, Urban Cocoons can be easily integrated into the whole transportation system. The body of Urban Cocoon is aerodynamical. The innovative climate control system can dramatically decrease the energy consumption on cooling and enable the occupants stay connected with the natural environment. The sustainable electric Urban Cocoon will become an ideal mobility for the PRD citizens and enable them to have a healthier and happier driving experience.","Pearl River Delta; Electric car; Sustainable design; Interior climate control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor); Campfens, F. (mentor)","2012","The electricity power system is shifting from a high reliance on centralized large power plants towards a system in which distributed generation units, like solar panels, are penetrating into the lower parts of the power grid. As a result, the consumers are becoming active prosumers who in addition to consuming can also autonomously generate, store, import or export power. Secondly, the introduction of new electronic devices, such as: electrical vehicles and heat pumps resulting in increased energy demand. The capacity of the current energy grid is insufficient to facilitate the future needs. To solve this problem without constructing a complete new power grid the smart grid is devised. A smart grid is able to use the assets of the legacy power grid in a more efficient way; in order to facilitate the future power needs without installing a complete new grid. The “smart” in “smart grid” heavily relies on the use of telecommunication and ICT. A smart energy grid holds the promise of increased reliability, since there is no longer one single point of failure, increased energy sustainability, through the use of different types of environmentally friendly energy sources, and an increased efficiency, due to less loss in transporting energy over large distances. However, the smart grid, with its intermittent distributed energy sources also presents various challenges. Firstly, the traditional grid topology is designed for uni-directional top-down power flow, which might not be able to optimally include local bi-directional power exchange. Specifically, the low-voltage and the medium-voltage network segments, where most of the local power exchanges is going to take place, needs to be updated. Secondly, the intermittent production behaviour of the distributed sources as well as the autonomy of the prosumers to manage their own energy demand likely lead to different (and possibly more volatile) load profiles. Control of the resources in a smart grid is therefore important. To build and control a smart grid, a large network of smart devices must be created, these smart devices must be able to communicate with each other. Since smart grids are not commonly in use, and still much under development, acquiring data on the actual telecommunications requirements is an utopia. Nonetheless, since ICT forms a crucial element of a smart grid, the aim of this research is to estimate which parts of a smart grid would have the biggest telecommunications demands. Subsequently, based on our knowledge of the Dutch energy grid of Alliander and various simulations, we take a cautious step at guestimating the actual telecommunications need in the foreseeable future of the smart grid. We take a bottom-up approach starting at the end nodes in the low-voltage energy grid.","smart grid; telecommunication; PV; EV; voltage and congestion control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Network Architectures and Services","","","",""

(mentor)","2012","With the continuous rising competitiveness, the need for improving performance has become vital for organizations to stay in the market. In order to improve the performance, one first needs to evaluate the output of a process or procedure on basis of efficiency. Having it measured, the processes or procedures could be modified such that it increases the output, efficiency or effectiveness. For this measuring, a tool known as maturity model has been developed over the past years. Despite the existence of many project management maturity models, several shortcomings and lacking can still be found, such as ignoring the human and organizational aspects as one of the many examples. This results in the main research question of this report: “How can the existing maturity models be further enhanced and applied effectively across several industries?” This question is further divided into three sub-questions, where the first sub-question focuses on the current state of the project management maturity models and the project management elements a model should possess, which will assist in making a new project management maturity model. The second sub-question delves deeper in the various project management elements (competencies) and identifies commonalities and dependencies of the maturity levels of these competencies. The last sub-question serves the purpose of testing the applicability of the newly developed maturity model. The methodology employed to collect the data is a multiple case study with multiple resources. The quantitative approach helped gathering empirics by applying the model on various organizations. Followed by a detailed analysis, a qualitative approach was used to validate the model and its findings, to minimize biases in the research conclusions. Besides thoroughly analysing the existing project management maturity models on their unique features and shortcomings, this study provided a newly developed maturity model which addressed these shortcomings. The application of the model on various organizations and the followed data analysis together with the validation interviews provided some interesting findings like: - The categorization of various project management competencies targeting a broader set of competencies (especially soft and societal factors). The categorization, helped finding out what elements within the field of project management were given the most/least importance and what the correlations were amongst these elements - Besides one overall maturity level, unlike existing maturity models, this maturity model due to its unique way of calculating provides four overall maturity levels. Each of the four overall maturity levels, represent one of the four categories, where various elements are grouped based on their properties. This gives a broader overview of the strengths and weaknesses of the organization, such that those weaknesses can be easily identified and worked upon. - Although maturity models in general get easily influenced by subjectivity and different opinions of respondents, the questionnaire used for this model was found to make things more objective due to the clear descriptive answers. Besides contributing to the existing academic literature, this study also provided empirical evidence on the way various project management competencies are perceived and might need extra focus. The empirics and recommendations provided by this study could then be used for further for further research or be directly applied in practice.","Project Management; Maturity Models; Maturity levels; Competitive advantage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Technology, Strategy, & Entrepreneurship","","Management of Technology","",""

(mentor)","2012","This is a numerical modelling study on the impact of dredging and disposal activities on the long-term morphological development of the Columbia River mouth (MCR). Dredging activities removed 120 Mm3 of sand from the MCR during the studied interval between 1958 and 1999. Only one-third of this volume was disposed in the active littoral zone. Therefore, dredging activities might be an important factor for recent erosion trend at the coasts directly adjacent to the MCR. The net influence of both dredging and disposal activities is analyzed by making use of a Delft3D model. Morphological acceleration techniques and wave climate reduction are used to bridge the gap between hydrodynamic and morphological time scales. The model performance is assessed with simulations for the 1926-1958 interval. These simulations indicate that the model captures the large-scale morphological changes that occurred in the study area. Simulations for the 1958-1999 interval are then used for the analysis of the impact of dredging and disposal activities. Based on the model results, dredging activities led to significant volume losses in the inlet itself and in the area west of the river entrance. On the Peacock Spit shoal directly north of the inlet, the volume losses due to dredging are almost completely reversed by disposal of dredged material on the shoal itself. Dredging and disposal activities did not have significant effects for the littoral drift at coastal stretches adjacent to the MCR. In the studied period, the Peacock Spit shoal did absorb the negative effects of dredging and the additional supply due to disposal activities, without reducing its sediment supply function to the adjacent coastal cell. Other effects of dredging and disposal activities were the formation of distinct sand mounds at the locations of some disposal sites and maintaining the southern orientation of the MCR channel at the estuary side of the inlet. Main implication of the model results for disposal strategies is that the sand volume of the Peacock Spit shoal should be maintained to avoid further erosion of the shoal and prevent undermining of the North Jetty and to maintain the sediment supply function of the shoal for the updrift coastal cell.","Long-term morphodynamics; Columbia River mouth; ebb-tidal delta; fluvial sediment supply; dredging activities; Delft3D; morphological acceleration techniques","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

The event offer the unique opportunity to redesign the post-disaster redevelopment strategy of the informal settlement, housing the large portion of the urban poor population in the devastated capital of Port-au-Prince. This thesis aims at the formulation of a development strategy for the informal settlements in Port-au-Prince. The problems of lack of basic facilities, informal development and a lack of governmental support create the underdeveloped conditions the communities are living in. Helping to overcome these problems enables a potential development of these areas. The strategy developed provides the opportunity to empower the community in the formation of a local development vision in cooperation with other stakeholders. In the light of the local development framework, the development of single communities can be brought together, strengthening the output of the process. The development of the settlement itself focuses on the enabling of urban agriculture. The need for water, fertilizer and productive grounds offer the possibility to link the basic development (sanitation, water management, etc) together. The combined program creates links that can be implemented into the urban environment thereby structuring the settlement. The strategy has been tested in the community of Tisous, one of the many informal settlements inside Port-au-Prince. Located in the western fringe of the city, the community need to be developed.

All these will bring about unexpected encounter with nature into the space. The carefully chosen botanic products does not only provide precious samples for the production of knowledge and scientific development, but also produce an array of species, colors, seasonal blossoms, fragrances and textures which consume the general public’s corporeal senses. There are two roles of the building in the urban context – the proposed botanic garden. The first one is a gateway transiting from the man-made cityscape to the planned landscape. The opening – the gateway locating at the center of the building redirects contemplation towards the botanic world. The elongated homogeneous façade does not only direct one’s view towards the opening on the axis, but also erased the sensual connections between 2 sides of the landscape at the first impression to enhance a contrasting experience with the hidden garden behind. The second one is mainly achieved and realized on the other side of the building. The botanic garden is regarded as a natural carpet of an enjoyable atmosphere and the proposed architecture is a sloping platform – a mount where the public can climb up for an overview of the whole landscape and the planned garden layers. The botanic garden becomes the stage and the building as the theater seating.

(mentor); Sloff, C.J. (mentor); Mosselman, E. (mentor); Mastbergen, D.R. (mentor)","2012","In the Colorado River the Glen Canyon dam is located. The Glen Canyon dam is constructed in the Colorado river for the production of electricity. Due to the dam, nowadays only a fifth of the pre-dam sediment volume flows into the Colorado River through the Glen Canyon dam and the two major tributaries, the Paria River and the Little Colorado River. Due to the lack of sediment the sandbars present in the Colorado River started eroding. An attempt to solve this problem was by mimicking the pre-dam seasonal variation in discharge. High flood experiments (HFE) were conducted in 1996, 2004 and 2008. These HFE’s were partly successful; some sandbars grew, while other eroded during the HFE. A Delft3D model of two pools and sandbars was created for a better understanding of deposition of sediment on the sand bar. The resulting modelled topography showed 5 major differences with the measured bed levels. The banks in the model were higher than in reality. The main stream width became smaller as opposed to reality. The sandbar height was over-predicted and the sandbars were growing too much into the pool. The last difference is that the model did not show an erosion hole in the main stream as was visible in the measurements. To improve the shortcomings of the model two adjustments are implemented in the model. Turbulent velocities appear to be important because surface boils were seen during the HFE. In this thesis a sediment transport formula is created, which includes the turbulent velocity fluctuations on the sediment entrainment. The second adjustment is an avalanching and slumping formulation to overcome the shortcoming related to the narrowing of the main stream and to include the slope slumps as seen at the site. These near-bed velocities are described using a probability density function, which includes the turbulent velocity fluctuations. The near-bed concentrations are calculated using the probability of occurrence of an instantaneous velocity. This probability is multiplied with the concentration corresponding to that velocity. For every instantaneous velocity in the probability density function a concentration contribution is calculated. The sum of these contributions describes the concentration including the turbulent fluctuations. The avalanching is included by stating that no deposition can take place on slopes steeper than the angle of repose (32 degrees). Two methods are described: one where the sediment that cannot be deposited is re-suspended and one where it is transported as bed load. A third method simulates a large slope slump at a location where the bed slope was larger than the angle of repose. The slope is then changed to an equilibrium slope of 25 degrees. The sediment is transported as bed-load to the lower lying computational cells. With the inclusion of the two new formulations in the model that is applied to the Eminence pool, both formulations show to have an effect on the computed topography. When the near-bed turbulent velocities are included in the sediment transport the sandbar extends more into the pool, where the measurements show a shorter sandbar. The slope slumping method severely changed the computed topography; the Delft3D model became unstable. Both avalanching formulations showed a same influence on the final computed topography.

The Mechanical Hive is designed as a model of transforming an industrial site from residual to generating, making thus a step further from just re-integration. By introducing a strong program, which reaches out to the social level, in terms of interaction, stimulation and involvement, the Hive intends to trigger a new identity for the whole neighborhood, acting on urban, architectural and social level. To support a flexible program, which promises a continuous diversity, I introduced a special type of architecture, mobile architecture. The Hive, physically expands in the proximity and the entire neighborhood by means of mobile ateliers, self sustainable units that populate and interact with the surroundings. The Hive becomes an unique entity, an open community of artists who live and work together, who share and accept the city and its people within;it promises diversity, social interaction, and very important openness to experiment.","reuse; mobile architecture; social; flexibility; dynamic; diversity; artists; community; factory; industrial; grid; atelier","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","RMIT","","","",""

(mentor); Sobota, M. (mentor)","2012","Part 1: Group work: Due to the uncertainty of how the Pampus area will actually be developed, during the research and analysis stage only solid facts were taken into account, such as the site in its current condition, the path of the train tracks, the connectivity and relation to neighbouring urban areas and the basic principles that the Netherlands aims to develop the Pampus area on. Consequently, a growth – based mechanism based on the aforementioned parameters was developed, that would ""grow"" the city in the immediate area around the transferium. The aim was that the transferium itself will incorporate part of the urban tissue and its functions. The mechanism, developed in Processing, defines positioning and sizes of urban functions around the transportations node that is the center of the transferium. Additional parameters that affect the results are direct sunlight and distance from the train tracks (sound nuisance). The mechanism also incorporates an ""infrastructural growth"" submechanism, that is used to create a circulation network between the functions based on the principles of the Constructal Theory. Part 2: Individual work: Aiming to create a structure that would not require means of transportation for internal circulation, the growth mechanism was constrained within a boundary defined by comfortable walking distances. As the scale was reduced, the Constructal Theory submechanism was discarded due to its high level of abstraction, and a more defined circulation network was developed based on Graph Theory. The results of the system were positioned in a hypothetical context based on the latest masterplan developed for the area, and further research was done in order to connect the tranferium with the surrounding urban tissue. Since though this masterplan is not approved as final, the connection was developed in such a way so as if the context changes, it can be adapted appropriately to the new situation. During the design stage, a voxelization process of recurring subdivisions based mainly on voronoi patterns was implemented in order to produce a result with meaningful aesthetic, functional and structural properties. Lighting conditions were evaluated with Ecotect, and an outer structure provides environmental conditions control while also collaborating with the interior of the building for support purposes. The train platforms support structure is developed separately from the rest of the Transferium to reduce vibrations nuisance. Two alternative shell structures have been developed, one populated by four different components focusing on the specific needs of the interior functions, and one with two components that also incorporates PV panelization for energy production that may be able to satisfy a considerable percentage of the Transferium energy demands. The resulting building has the qualities of a megastructure. It has achieved the aim of housing functions of great diversity while maintaining aesthetic coherency. The Transferium has been elevated into something more that a simple train station, into a possible landmark for the future Almere Pampus, reflecting the qualities the Netherlands has set for the entire area.","Non-Standard and Interactive Architecture; hyperbody; parametric; train station; megastructure; computational","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-07-20","Architecture","Architecture","","Hyperbody: NS&IA","",""

(mentor); Meijers, E. (mentor)","2012","A metropolitan Region of the Third World countries like Tehran metropolitan region (TMR) in Iran, in consequence of unbalanced rapid urban growth, is facing with large set of unique social and demographic, cultural, economic, ecological, environmental and managerial problems. The entire problems are because of lack of effective regional plan and uncoordinated structure of the local authorities in concern to regional issues. Recently governments proposed a regional plan for the TMR which intends a polycentric development for the spatial configuration of the TMR. However, having the monocentric picture of the TMR in mind, this question rise that is it really possible to consider the TMR a polycentric urban region? What is the suitable regional strategy that provides synergy in the TMR? In this thesis prominent literatures related to the Polycentric Urban Region (PUR) are reviewed. Two complimentary aspects of polycentricity namely, morphology and functional relationship are identified as essential elements for polycentric development. Governance structure of region is also considered as a third element for reaping the alleged benefits of polycentricity. These three factors together formed the analytical dimension of polycentricity. These three elements were studied in the TMR context and potential and deficiency of the region regarding to these elements are identified. The normative dimension of polycentricity is dedicated to reviewing the history of the region and studying the government’s plans in course of history to see how their plans promote or discourage the polycentric structure in the region. Based on the findings it is concluded that the government’s plan for polycentric development of the region is ambitious and is not consistent with the current realities of the region. Therefore according to the analysis of the region a planning guideline in 5 aspects of centrality, mobility, low income settlements, land escape and governance is proposed. These sets of recommendations aim to provide balance development in the region and create social cohesion. Also by optimal alternation of the governments plan the TMR triangle is introduced and designed. Tehran, Karaj and International Imam Khomeini airport (IKIA) form the corners of this triangle. Three corridors connecting the three corners of this triangle is designed through Transit oriented Development. The superiority of this proposal to the government’s proposal is, first it is based on the realities and potential of the region. Second, It also considers the regional administrative organization for coordination of local authorities. The proposed plan by taking advantage of the potentials in the region steers the government’s plan to the direction which is more feasible. The proposed plan leads to more urban cohesion and synergy in the region and improve the life quality of its residents. In this thesis all the steps from literature review to planning, design and evaluation of the plan are explained extensively.","polycentric development; metropolitan region; TMR; governance; urban synergy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-07-09","Architecture","Urbanism","","Spatial Planning & Strategy (Complex cities)","",""

The researches lead to a collective strategy to focus on the “Riberas Del Bravo” District as a prototype and address the cycle of decay creating and feeding the abandoned housing phenomenon (social decay, economic decay, urban/physical decay) The urban plan for this prototype site consists of several startup project both architectural and infrastructural. The urban strategy for the Area was devised in 3 main phases of enhanceing and empowering communities, Densification (along with de-densification and agricultural production) and formalization. This project is located on the border of the proposed de-densified area with the densified area. Within the Urban plan this project is a secondary and higher education facility which addresses the need for secondary educational facilities as we figured out through the urban design and as pointed out by the PDU (municipal development plan). The school is meant to function as a “Community managed School” which in the later stages also functions as a community center. The Vocational Training aspect of the facility is developed at the same time as the infrastructural projects in the Urban Plan in order to train a portion of the unemployed in Riberas del Bravo for participation in the other development projects such as the Material bank, the water infrastructure and agriculture.","Social Housing; Critical architecture; Border city; education architecture","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-07-20","Architecture","DSD-Delft School of Design","","Urban Asymmetries","",""

(mentor)","2012","“Studio Capital Region focuses on the challenges in the urban nodes of global networks, which could be part of centralized, decentralized or distributed structures. Despite its immediate association to governmental/administrative cities, Capital Region is a framework to undertake a comprehensive research into the spatial issues in the leading, transforming and/or emergent urban centres with their hinterland in the globalized networks of growth, sprawl, accumulation and even counter-urbanization. Within this framework, the city is considered to be a fundamental object of architecture. Hence, architectural production is considered to be a projection to the “project of the city” at large. The studio aims at investigating the latencies of architectural strategies by focusing on the site-specific situations conditioned by the mentioned complexity of capital regions.” Within this framework of the design studio, the case of State Farm founded by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in 1925 portrays an actual urban potential that currently lies in the very centre of capital city of Turkey, Ankara. The State Farm was meant to portray the ambitions of modernization project of the country by creating an epitome of scientific agricultural production, industry and leisure annexed to the newly founded capital city’s urban desires. However, the idealism of nature as a complimentary binary to the urban order of the city was shattered by the pressure of rapid growth of the city starting from 1950’s. Because of the migration of masses of labour to the city after 1950’s and especially 1980’s, the city that was planned for 600.000 inhabitants has reached the population of 4,5 million in a couple of decades. Consequently, the State Farm Land also lost its role by becoming literally surrounded by urban settlements and being fragmented by land speculations. However, with the critical framework reflecting on the utopian basis of the project of modernity, I see the actual condition of the State Farm as a temporal projection on its initial ambitions, as it needs to be realigned with the changing demands of the society and the conditions of urban growth. Yet, it’s also fact that the city of Ankara also needs a review of those initial desires of urban speculation and growth to be brought in harmony with the urgency of re-establishing an urban ecology, which is also jeopardized by the degeneration of the public space due to the dominance of the transportation system by heavy prominence of private cars in the traffic. In Ankara, the changes in the economical and political patterns have resulted in an extremely fast growth of the population, which has manifested itself in a monotone urban sprawl, lacking diverse public program. The traditional idea of the city with its dense public centre with dwelling around is not valid anymore. The city needs accessible, low threshold public spaces and programs, as a line through the city. The state farm was the first example of transformation of agriculture by using scientific methods and modern technology. But today this area does not fulfil its purpose anymore, and has lost its meaning. Its purpose was to create a new society by bringing together, modern agricultural and industrial production techniques, combining them with leisure activities and developing an urban farm. This idea didn’t last very long, because of the changing society, behaviours and economy. The temporality of this vision is obvious when we look at the current state of the city. It has lost the quality of living in harmony with nature and also the idea of conquering nature and making it part of daily life. The city, which was meant to be a garden city, finally became a car city. This is why it’s meaningful to focus on the natural artefacts and re-qualify these. The main theme of the project is Utopia as a temporal projection. In my opinion it’s only valid for a certain period of time because of the changing society and the changing needs. It’s an illusion to think that a utopian projection lasts forever; therefore, I propose a model for temporal desires. The theme of temporality is translated into a spine of urban ecology that can facilitate many public and infrastructural programs in combination. One of the strategies applied to provide low threshold public spaces and improve the life quality in Ankara was to utilize the Ankara River as the armature or the spine of my proposal to enhance the public life on the green grounds of State Farm in the middle of the Anatolian steppe land. The unfolding of public programs on this spine will provide the city with an integral backbone of leisure zone stretched out along the east-west core of the city. Ankara River is a small river that runs through the city. Because of long time exposure to sewage and industrial pollutants, it is no longer viable as a water source for irrigation. The river splits Ankara almost in half and crosses through many neighbourhoods and the city’s lowlands. There are many bridges built over it throughout the city and in some instances it is completely covered and encased in a tunnel. The proposed plan is to re-qualify the riverbed of Ankara and adopt it as a backbone of diverse public programs to utilize it both as a social and ecological infrastructure for the city. Therefore, the scarce resource of water is used as the main organizing element for providing diverse programming to the city. This is done by widening the river for more infiltration and by installing a geo-membrane on the riverbed so the water doesn’t sink into the ground and stops the flow. Along the river, constructed wetlands need to be created to clean the water of the river, and the storm water. The constructed wetlands function as decentralized water treatment plants which constantly clean the water of the river and decrease substantially the pollution by the city. The clean water will then be used to create lakes. The lakes are combined with different public programs. For example the first lake, which is closest to the city centre is combined with a beach as the main program. Like the river, the beach has been approached as a spine with different programs connected to it. This ecology functions as a concert beach, with a rock centre as the main program; because of the many emerging rock bands and the lack of a suitable place where they can perform. Similar to the urban proposal and the beach, the design of the rock centre is conceived as a compact and functional armature, which allows for diverse spatial quality of the design. This building works as the proof of concept of architecture as the generator of social events and also exhibits the pursuit to create architectural singularities within the urban program. The goal of this way of dealing with the project of the city is to create a master plan for improving the quality of the public life as well as the water quality and ecological diversity of the city.

A network and swarm based research and design for non-standard architecture The discussion posed is an research investigation and design proposal of an large urban-architectural insert, in relationship within the immediate local surroundings with the inner-city of Almere. Two keys items of development were concerned; 1. a 'connecter' of multi-modality transfer and their respective infrastructure 2. a immediate area to establish a public sphere and place. A specific standpoint of perspective has been investigated of network- and swarm theory, and applied as a design strategy by targeting specific issues. The problem definition which has been deducted from an regional to local scale is concerned with various dimensions of ecological, economic-political and social-cultural nature; Seen from an network perspective, it is crucial for cities and regions to enhance a their degree of linkages, being part and player in network circuits. Almere is in need to enhance their concurrent nodal position within the Randstad region, in order to increase their network circuits on infrastructural, economic and ecological dimensions. As well to profile a distinct and socio-cultural identity. Therefore, the main research question being posed is; How to develop a local spatial intervention of a multi-modal transferium, being a place of circuit connectivity, enhancement and establishment of a distinct identity of the central-station area? A Hypothesis is developed in which local spatial design of the transferium and immediate surroundings, has a potential of targeting qualities on transfer, infrastructure and ecological connections, in which affects a distinct identity and place of the central station area of Almere. The specific decision methodology is using a bottom-up and top-down approach, for the practice of design, by departing from a combined network- and swarm theory. This theory, is explored and applied by use of developing a computer-based real-time design simulation-applet or design instrument, targeting at three specific related sub research topics. 1. program : concerning programmatic function distribution of program requirements in relation to hybrid relationships 2. paths : establishing path-infrastructure among the program and surrounding contextual infrastructural connections of external and internal circulations. 3. structure : embody stable structure of the basic building blocks, the aggregation. By these three separate however related procedures, as well allowing parametric control and being informed by environmental analysis and data-sets, it enables to produce a concrete specific non-standard architectural design proposal. In network-thinking and their respective components of nodes, organisation and relationships, the real-time design instrument generates pointcloud, lines of connections which represent a probable 'fit' solution suitable for further architectural development. The use of swarm principles applied in the multi-agent simulation enable mobility or dynamic swarming behavior of such a pointcloud, in relating to their predetermined encoded design of architectural conditions of program, structure and paths. Catalogs of the three sub themes are investigated by genotypic alterations, whereby a candidate is chosen which in its phenotypic expression or embodiment, has unique qualities of tectonic-structure and urban-architectural features of building and landscape. The area built from an urban polder-model structure is contradicted by the proposal of an building complex of a global porous pattern, or clusters of individual buildings, by which it allows to connect with the green belt-parks in the immediate surroudings. By the underground placement of the train- and bus perrons, their is minimization of infrastructural barriers and reduction environmental pollution such as noise and views. Also it enables the opportunity to use the ground level as a landscape of public place. Triangles are key, being used as drivers to meet local demands and requirements concerning structure, construction and of architecture exterior and interior qualities. The global building pattern is faceted, and fragmented in nature. Perforation of tectonic patterns are related to the amount of required light, views, or solid surfaces, in respect to the program. Further procedures from embodiment to materialization are closely related by applying state-of-the-art Robotic CNC production techniques, and by deploying scripting techniques for the realization from digital to physical models.","multi-agent system; swarm theory; network theory; multi-modality; almere; real-time simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Hyperbody","","","",""

The result of this project comes in the form of design, which can be used by designers and other actors such as housing corporations and local residents, as a show case with solutions dealing with issues of social safety, cohesion, diversity and life resistance. The researched context is that of a mixed neighborhood with late post-war portiek dwellings and 19th century housing; the neighborhood in Oranjeboom street in the city of Rotterdam is used as a case for study and design. Since the project is concerned with the relation between social functions and physical, spatial properties, and aims to achieve the presuppositions for social sustainability, emphasis is placed on incorporating the perspectives of local residents; both existing and future expected ones, with a particular focus on families with children and working-at-home persons living in the neighbourhood. An integrated intervention pattern is developed, at different levels of scale –from urban to architectural and material scale, concerning built-up area, program, public and communal space and indoor living environment. Design deals mostly with two social sustainability aspects that were deemed most relevant within the specific context .These are firstly social safety, since aspects related to this appear to be the greatest threat to the future value of these neighborhoods. Secondly, possibilities for social interaction, since this is the most important (potential) quality of the neighbourhood. Spatial preconditions for a design that replies to these problems are also strongly correlated. The first issue is translated in solutions for accessibility and usability of public and communal spaces and border treatment, through a clear privacy zoning between public and private space. Solutions for visibility were also important to offer easier social control. The second issue is translated in solutions for communal activities and communal space design; external and internal: the courtyard and the portieks design was the main focus points. The other two issues: diversity and life resistance are treated through solutions for variety in building typologies and functions in the district and flexibility and affordability issues of the housing. Specifically water management and insulation-thermal costs awe remain points of focus. Architectural design proposal is made for a crucial neighborhood part, namely a residential building block, the main traffic structure, and the communal courtyard and public park area around it, to test how the theoretical preconditions and patterns can be translated into a coherent design. Keeping social potential in Oranjeboom street by designing a neighboorhood that enables and facilitates the change of its inhabitant’s social situation, enabling social and economic survival. Research in the thesis plan and two papers (article and reflection paper has led to formulate the desirable and possible characteristics for the design of the district. The application of these design criteria - social safety, cohesion, diversity and life resistance. -dictated specific spatial preconditions in order to enable successful livability of the district.

On the other hand, re–using the existing values in order to achieve the upper goals is a big challenge that all Rmit projects include. The main goal of the research , and the design in this Rmit project was recognizing the significance of the ensemble and being able to reinterpret its values through the redesign.","regeneration; housing renovation; social sustainability; post-war neighborhoods; Rotterdam","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-06-28","Architecture","Architecture","","RMIT","",""

(mentor)","2012","Healthcare is a highly complex system which contains many stakeholders, such as patients, relatives, doctors, nurses, medical specialists, hospitals, health insurance providers, pharmaceutical companies, medical technology manufacturers, public health representatives and government. Although providing the optimal care to improve the health of patients is the common aim, each stakeholder has a different viewpoint on how to achieve that aim (Kanter, 2011). This incongruity in the system is one of the biggest barriers to innovate in healthcare area (Kanter, 2011). Any innovative effort initiated by a stakeholder is often prevented from materializing into an innovative result due to the complex entanglement of stakeholders within the different areas of healthcare structure. Thus, it is very difficult for innovation to be accepted and adapted by the entire healthcare system, resulting in particularly lengthy innovation process. Research Aim and Focus The main goal of this project is to provide a conceptual framework that supports and improves the current product/service innovation process in the health care area. The preceding research focuses on understanding the dynamics of health care innovation, to look into the bottlenecks in implementation of innovation to new products/ services (from perspective of the stakeholders) and the redesign of product/ service innovation on the conceptual level in accord with the health care system of the Netherlands (Europe). Structure of the Research and Report Outline As indicated, health care is a complex system with many stakeholders. Therefore, the first part of the research focuses on discovering all facets of the health care innovation system including its key stakeholders (Chapter 1) and identifying the barriers of health care innovation and current solutions based on literature review (Chapter2). The second part of the research (Chapters 3 and 4) presents the findings of the empirical investigation of bottlenecks of innovation in the Dutch Health Care System. The field research consists of unstructured and semi-structured interviews with 14 individuals as representative of different key stakeholders and 2 observational studies; one held in Erasmus Medical Center New building Office, Rotterdam, and the other one held in Young Entrepreneurs Society Building, Delft (YESDelft). The third part of the research focuses on analysis of the results. The primary results are explained in Chapter 3. In Chapter 4 explains and uses theoretical frameworks to analyze the findings and Chapter 4 are based on field research and analysis of the results.","health care innovation; Bottlenecks in health care innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

This requires intensive infrastructural improvements to the current situation of Almere. One of the main improvements of the network will be the redesign of the central station of the city. The current station is situated around a combination of small dysfunctional public spaces and conflicting flows of traffic. In a series of experiments with the topics of different network speeds, users, behavior and needs is tested to propose a infrastructural landscape and embodiment that is both efficient and pleasant as a new design for the central train station of Almere. The quest is no search for an optimal result, but rather a proposal abstract machine that can generate pretty good solutions while still maintaining intuitive decision making in the design process. The aim of the design is to enhance the connectivity of the dysfunctional part of the Almere city center and to create a multi-functional area with a 18 hour usage pattern. The design method is based on a bottom-up research process with the use of different algorithmic principles for generation and performance evaluation like swarm behavior and ant-trail and Dijkstra algorithm’s.

(mentor)","2012","Long Term Evolution (LTE) is the latest high speed mobile broadband technology that is gaining widespread attention due to its high data rates and improved Quality of Service (QoS). Initially, LTE was seen as a technology for supporting high speed data, but there is a growing interest in the industry to support voice over LTE. The support of voice over LTE has lot of challenges owing to the fact that both voice and data traffic are to be carried over the same radio and core networks. The optimum usage of resources in the radio network is of high importance as there is a growing need to improve the capacity at reduced cost. The transport network is another key area that needs to be carefully planned according to the capacity of the radio network. Differentiation and scheduling of resources in the transport network plays a key role in guaranteeing good end to end performance for both voice and data services. In this thesis, the impact of differentiation and scheduling of resources in the transport network on the end to end performance of voice over LTE is investigated. The results indicate that without proper prioritization and scheduling of resources in the transport network, the performance of voice is severely affected when the transport network is congested with data traffic. To overcome this scenario, we prioritize voice over data traffic and analyse its performance for different transport network scheduling algorithms. From the results, it is clear that with proper classification and scheduling of resources in the transport network, significant increase in voice capacity is observed. On the other hand, by totally prioritizing voice, performance of the data traffic is affected to a large extent. Hence, to achieve a balance, voice users are classified into different priority levels and the performance of voice and data in this scenario is investigated. The analysis for all these scenarios are based on simulations using OPNET simulation tool.","LTE; 4G; Voice","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-07-03","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","Electrical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Van Dorst, M. (mentor)","2012","In this project the answer was searched on the research question how the perceived safety in Dutch underprivileged housing areas can be improved through the enlargement of the social cohesion by means of the design of the public space. In most underprivileged housing areas the socio-spatial problem is that the inhabitants do not feel connected with the neighbourhood and with each other. Furthermore, they are unhappy with their living environment, and in particular the public space. Visitors of the neighbourhood find the public space bad as well, and in some cases do not even dare to go to the housing areas. Currently the method used by municipalities and housing corporations to tackle the socio-spatial problems of underprivileged housing areas, is to demolish (part of) the housing area, and build new housing blocks. This forces inhabitants to move, and in a lot of cases they will not be able to return to the newly build houses, because they are more expensive. This method has been proven ineffective because it only moves the problem from one area to another. The main problem, inhabitants being unhappy with their living environment, and passers-by sometimes even afraid to go in the housing area, is not addressed with the current inhabitants in mind. To answer the research question two sub research questions on the use of public space were relevant. The first sub research question on which different roles in terms of social cohesion can different types of public spaces have produced the following answers. In underprivileged housing areas a large part of the leisure time is spent outside, on the street. It is therefore important that the inhabitants have places in the public space where they can meet. Secondly, to increase social safety, it is important for passers-by to understand what kind of neighbourhood they are in, who is living in the neighbourhood. This can be done by providing space in the public realm where indirect contact between passers-by and inhabitants can be established. But, more importantly, in order to enhance the social cohesion it is important that the inhabitants can actively claim the public space. Laying a claim on the public space can be achieved through having a front garden, or facade garden, but also in communal outdoor areas. This claim can be strengthened by handing over the management of (parts of) the public space to the inhabitants. In some streets, handing over the management is not advisable, because they are also used by other groups than the inhabitants, for shopping, school, or going from one important location to another. In these kinds of streets the management cannot be totally transferred to inhabitants, but letting inhabitants have a say in the design of the public space is already beneficial for the social cohesion. This means that in the neighbourhood the publicness of a street has to be defined according to the presence of public facilities and are therefor of public interest, or whether it is a street in which only inhabitants need to be. This results in a division of four levels of publicness. The second sub research question, how can public space be made easily adaptable to the users, but without great costs for the municipalities, was inspired by that fact that due to the current economic crisis municipalities and housing corporations have less funds to spend on revitalising urban living areas. In order to achieve the two goals, adapting the public space to the wishes of the inhabitants and without great costs for municipalities, cooperation with the inhabitants can be used. This cooperation can be in the form of letting inhabitants have a say in the design, which creates better support for the design. Another possibility is to let the inhabitants contribute in the execution of the public space. This can be done in the form of funds, but also, and perhaps more important in underprivileged housing areas where the inhabitants have little money, in the form of labour. When inhabitants have invested in the public space, this creates a bond between inhabitants and the space, and they will take better care of their public space. Therefor not only money in the short-term is saved, but also in the long-term. This also benefits the social cohesion between the inhabitants themselves and between the inhabitants and their living area. The location and the function of the street, the level of publicness, defines how much the inhabitants can be involved in the management of the public space. To test the found answers to the research question, the underprivileged housing area of the Schilderswijk and Stationsbuurt has been used. This is a housing area which was from the start build for the working-class. In first instance the building quality was deplorable, and from the eighties onwards many parts have been demolished and rebuild, but without one general plan. This created a living area with many different architectural styles. At the moment the quality of the buildings is adequate, but here as well people are not happy with their living environment. The neighbourhood has been analysed and the public space defined on its level of publicness, according to its function. For each level of publicness a design was made to show how the public space will look if designed in a manner that improves the social cohesion and the perceived safety. The combined designs create a network in which streets are legible and support the intended function, thereby increasing the perceived safety of the inhabitants of the neighbourhood and the passers-by.","urban regeneration; public space; social safety; social cohesion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-06-30","Architecture","Urbanism","","Urban Regeneration","",""

We took the Riberas del Bravo settlement in the northern Mexican city of Ciudad Juárez as a case study. This city has numerous problems, of which the emerging phenomenon of abandoned and deserted housing in Mexico is among its most striking. The entire settlement consists of dwellings built between 2000 and present, of which about 20% - 25% are abandoned houses. This phenomenon has various reasons and points towards a complex mesh of forces that influence the built environment. They encompass entangled dimensions of political economy and socio-economic developments, which only touch the built structure of actual housing at the very last stage. In the first weeks we were investigating the events in the history of Juárez, which lead to its formation, its growth and ultimately to the problems of today. Eventually this resulted in a timeline, historical maps and analytical maps of all the (main) factors involved. In the end of the Msc-3 period our research resulted in a common strategic proposal on the level of the city and moreover on the level of the case-study. Because of all the information we gathered and the group-strategy it resulted in, I had the possibility to create a project, which is not only architectural, but also sensitive to its environment. Aspects of my project (like setting up of an alternative economic model based on Adobe production, tackling mono-functionality and long-term solutions) are a direct result of the combined effort of the collective strategy. I think because of my intuitive way of working, I have now a project which is more dynamic (a plot which transforms over the course of 50 years, through means of various aspects), from Urban plan to the very grain of an Adobe in the wall in the common kitchen. And above all, my project is now a firm stance against the social atrocities and urban asymmetries prevalent in Juárez. It is not just a design projected on a certain spot, but on the contrary: a project, which involves local inhabitants in a refined and responsible way. The project succeeds, when inhabitants take the initiative to pick up a shovel and oppose to the dependency of the Maquiladora-system (this system is proven to be destructive for Juárez). As a result an architecture emerges, which doesn’t deny the Urban Asymmetries, but embraces them and turn them into a positive social-economic experiment. An architecture, which at the same time (among others) is a repetition of a standard unit, but succeeds in not becoming a mere monotonous and mono-functional plan, but rather a diverse and sophisticated part of the settlement. My project is part of a collective work, of several projects, which together make a difference and form a prototype for the revitalization of the city of Ciudad Juárez.","Adobe; Mudbrick; Rammed Earth; Excavation; Local economy; Multi-functional","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-07-06","Architecture","Delft School of Design (DSD)","","Urban Asymmetries, Ciudad Juárez, Mexico Studio","",""

(mentor); Hermans, W. (mentor)","2012","For decades, city plans of Bangkok have been the prerogative of a few influential interest groups. Interests of the middle to upper class and more powerful groups have been protects and carelessly neglected the needs and interests of the lower- income majority or other vulnerable groups, particularly those who live in unprofitable areas. The consequences of this approach can be seen in places, where a high proportion of population live in isolated areas lacking provision for basic infrastructure and services. In other words, when the city prioritizes global development towards efficiency and attractiveness, this exclusive approach results in segregation and fragmentation on the local level. Without being integrated to the urban tissue, this undesirable truth has triggered the author’s interest in seeking for the way to change the paradigm in which local level especially the vulnerable groups will also be able to participate and benefit from global interventions by the government. Therefore, it is very significant to promote urban vitality that enhances not only their living quality, but also economic viability and social cohesion. Thanks to the mass transit system (MTS) expansion plan of Bangkok launched by the government in last few years, the hypothesis of integrating global (infrastructure) into local dimensions (urban tissue) will be experimented. The thesis starts with a serious problem of the city brought by the MTS (elevated level) implemented on a fragmented and unorganized urban spatial structure (ground level) of the city due to a rapid urbanization. Without any coordination to urban development, when the market begins to intervene, losers are local residents seen via gentrification, segregation and inequity. However, in accordance to the expansion plan, it covers the historic core of the city, which is crucially needed to be preserved. This is a high time to reconsider and integrate not only global and local planning, but also urban and infrastructure development towards sustainability. By planning for local inhabitants, the inclusive approach aims to prepare for the undeniable infrastructure development to meet local demands and basic services before it comes and to make use of it when it finishes to improve spatial quality and to enhance socio-cultural dimensions together with economic conditions. To conclude, the author will focus on the local level and search for an appropriate linkage with the global planning by using the MTS network expansion and the historic core of Bangkok as the study case.","mobility; heritage; Bangkok; vitality","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Urbanism","","Complex Cities Studio","",""

(mentor); Plomb, H. (mentor); Bruyns, G. (mentor)","2012","The main problématique of the site -Ciudad Juarez and the graduation studio was to investigate into the various issues contributing to the emerging phenomenon of abandoned housing in Mexico. In addition to poor urban planning, there is a fundamentally flawed system in the manner in which social housing is conceived, designed, produced, inhabited and devalued in Mexico. These factors create a cycle of decay and dysfunction of which abandoned housing becomes one of the many spatial consequences. The goal of the thesis project was to come up with a strategic proposal and interventions which can provide counter or alternative proposals to the current situation of decay and allow for a socio-economic platform to develop from within the community. The project investigates into how urban agriculture or in this case peri-urban (peripheral urban) agriculture and other related programs serve as a ‘bottom-up’ strategy to tackle the ‘top-down’ issues in Juarez. A matrix with a toolbox for production and an inventory of open space explores the possibility of creating continuous productive landscapes and new urban infills from voids and forms the first step towards orgainizing the city towards the creation of productive landscapes. This not only provides food for the community but also allows for transforming the current urban landscape in Riberas Del Bravo by transforming the ‘terrain vague’ – the abandoned houses, fallow land, unused urban spaces into productive, green spaces through urban farms, community gardens, community kitchens and greenhouses. Architectural expression of the primarily utilitarian buildings which develop during the phase-wise development of the strategy take into consideration local, easily available materials and passive climate concepts. The project also investigates into the role of various stakeholders and urban actors involved in the various stages of the institutionalization of urban agriculture in Ciudad Juarez to develop a multi-stakeholder platform for implementation of urban agriculture.","urban farming; bottom-up strategy; urban asymmetry; urban voids","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-07-09","Architecture","Architecture","","Delft School of Design, DSD","",""

To handle the urgent demand from working migration and reduce the problems triggered by congestion in mega cities, decentralization and new towns are widely accepted by Chinese urbanists and politicians. However, new towns in China lost their urbanity in the instant city-making while European new towns have experienced a long time reflection. This master thesis intends to advance the knowledge on new town development by applying GIS-related quantitative methods to compare new towns in various contexts with their historically evolved peers. There are two main directions in this research: improving quantitative analytical methods and understanding the transformation process of new towns. This research dwells on quantitative modeling on three elements of urban morphology: street network, building types and function via GIS. By this way, a new quantitative analytical method about built environment can be raised based on the study of van Nes, Berghauser-Pont and Masshoodi (2012). Through applying this new method to compare the development process of Dutch post-war new towns with historical city, a series of spatial principles will be found and applied into Chinese context. Specifically, in the Netherlands, the transformation process in Dutch new towns will be revealed and an urban diagnosis tool will be given. Then, all the knowledge getting from Dutch context will be converted into a Chinese case: Songjiang new town to provide guiding. Although the focus for this thesis will be on one new town, it contributes to the development strategy for other new towns in China as well.","new towns; GIS-related urban modeling; Space Syntax; Spacematrix; MXI","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-06-29","Architecture","Urbanism","","Complex City Studio","",""

It became clear that the project’s focus needed to challenge the status quo by promoting decentralized development, restoring the ecosystem, and supporting economic growth of local communities. These complex challenges were met by the following design aims: THE MATERIAL:  Employing Guadua bamboo as a sustainable alternative for seismic resistant reconstruction. Currently, it is grown in the vicinity of the proposed building site for restoration purposes and as a local material source.  Showcasing the high level of versatility available in bamboo based products and the generation of numerous new markets per respective product (bamboo cable, composite products, woven panels), in addition to utilizing natural culms with intentionally enhanced curvature (during growth) for structural purposes. THE SITE:  Choosing Jacmel (one of the most vibrant cities in the south) as a location for investment instead of Port-au-Prince thus decentralizing development initiatives. Promoting the city’s rich natural and architectural heritage and supporting its identity as Haiti’s cultural and artistic capital. Strategically placing the ULR at the main entry point into Jacmel effectively creating a City Portal with a high traffic profile for local tourism, merchants, artisans, and local bamboo building tradesmen to gain exposure and nationwide influence.  Integrating the existing site conditions (prevailing wind directions, elevation changes, solar orientation, intense heat and rain) the design strategically responds to the context and climate of the location through diverse degrees of protection; thorough its massing, diversity in space heights, undulating roof, “double” façade, and shading elements. THE LIVING ROOM:  Designing a highly accessible public “Living Room”, redefines conventional built typologies with a porous hybrid program and built structure which supports cultural flows providing flexible spaces for Jacmel’s identity and strengths to be displayed (art, films, music, festivals).  The Haitian lifestyle -“Life taking place on the streets”- can freely flow through informal and improvised encounters between Jacmelians, Haitian, or foreign visitors helping to strengthen the local economy.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-03-31","Architecture and The Built Environment","Architectural Engineering and Technology","","","",""

Unlike the traditional service blueprint model, it provides a framework that creates insights in the service from both the company and their client. Second difference in this model from other models is the addition of relevant internal and external factors that could directly influence the service. Placing the service in a context. Result of the project is a new service that uses an existing analyzing tool of the company.

(mentor); Van den Burg, L.P.J. (mentor)","2012","The city of Amsterdam is broadly considered to be of great cultural and historic value. For centuries, it has played a vital role in the development of The Netherlands and Western Europe as the centre of the Modern World. Traditionally, the balance between government, freedom and trade is considered to be of paramount importance for the prosperity of this open society. The fact that the historic structure has escaped many potentially negative consequences of the city’s transition into a poly-centric regional metropolis is a testament to the cultural awareness of its citizens. However, for all the transformations the city has seen throughout the years, the city centre has not remained entirely unaffected, bringing about a process of urban regeneration in which cultural and social interests are often outweighed by economic interests. This graduation project is aimed at regaining the balance between economic, cultural-historic and social interests when making planning and design decisions. An impression is given of what a suitable approach to the issues at hand could potentially look like: by attuning buildings to the ‘human scale’ on which the urban fabric evolved, by densifying the pedestrian network and by increasing the amount of public space suitable for stationary activities in the city-centre, a physical framework is given for a durable balance between economic, cultural and social functions with the same properties that made Amsterdam’s heritage assets so much sought after: identity, diversity, flexibility, ownership and accessibility.","urban; regeneration; conservation; heritage; Amsterdam; Nieuwendijk","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-07-19","Architecture","Urbanism","","Urban Regeneration","",""

(mentor)","2012","The main problématique of the site -Ciudad Juarez and the graduation studio was to investigate into the various issues contributing to the emerging phenomenon of abandoned housing in Mexico. In addition to poor urban planning, there is a fundamentally flawed system in the manner in which social housing is conceived, designed, produced, inhabited and devalued in Mexico. These factors create a cycle of decay and dysfunction of which abandoned housing becomes one of the many spatial consequences. The goal of the thesis project was to come up with a strategic proposal and interventions which can provide counter or alternative proposals to the current situation of decay and allow for a socio-economic platform to develop from within the community. The project investigates into how urban agriculture or in this case peri-urban (peripheral urban) agriculture and other related programs serve as a ‘bottom-up’ strategy to tackle the ‘top-down’ issues in Juarez. A matrix with a toolbox for production and an inventory of open space explores the possibility of creating continuous productive landscapes and new urban infills from voids and forms the first step towards orgainizing the city towards the creation of productive landscapes. This not only provides food for the community but also allows for transforming the current urban landscape in Riberas Del Bravo by transforming the ‘terrain vague’ – the abandoned houses, fallow land, unused urban spaces into productive, green spaces through urban farms, community gardens, community kitchens and greenhouses. Architectural expression of the primarily utilitarian buildings which develop during the phase-wise development of the strategy take into consideration local, easily available materials and passive climate concept. The project also looks at the role of various stakeholders and urban actors involved in the various stages of the institutionalization of urban agriculture in the site.","urban farming; urban asymmetry; Mexico; multi-stakeholder platform; bottom-up strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-07-09","Architecture","Architecture","","Delft School of Design, DSD","",""

Although some tumors that are malignant can be curable, it comes at a cost of unbearable pain and mental trauma. X-ray based techniques are being used for many decades for detecting tumors. These techniques are applied at the expense of exposure to high ionized radiation levels. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is another technique which is a non invasive medical diagnosis for detecting tumors. However, MRI is quite expensive test and the powerful magnetic field of the MRI system may damage an external hearing aid or cause a heart pacemaker or electrical stimulator, or neuro stimulator to malfunction. In recent times, the rapid advancement in radar and microwave technology has attracted the attention of the biomedical engineering community for application to medical imaging. The capability for penetrating waves into human body, non ionizing radiation and possibility of high resolution through UWB technology makes microwave technology an attractive alternative in biomedical imaging. In this thesis, first a comparative study of UWB antennas proposed in the open literature for imaging is performed. This study outline some of the most significant intrinsic limitations of these antennas. Next taking into account a wide range of technical and medical concerns, this thesis addresses the analysis and designing of a novel antenna for imaging tumors inside the human body in the frequency region of 3?10 GHz. Thus, we propose an effective design strategy that combines theoretical inputs, and technological constraints to design the novel leaky slot antenna. We believe that our results pave the way for future research oriented to the design of a complete microwave imaging medical system for medical application.","Dielectric constant Fidelity Factor; Matching Medium; Leaky- Wave phenomenon; Phase Center; UWB","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-07-04","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","Electrical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Van de Voort, J.A. (mentor); Bobbink, I. (mentor)","2012","Although dikes are very important they can provide more than only water safety. We have a future with possible sea level rise and dikes will need to become higher. The land protected by the dike will lose contact with the water. It is time to rethink the dike as a solitude element and create new possibilities to provide new space in dense urban environments, new connections between water and land and better use of land in a sustainable, durable way. Building within the dike creates beautiful architectural challenges and opportunities with the play of the levels, the view on landscape and river, on top of and behind the dike, the play of the light, the contradictions in light and dark, closed and openness. All this can be used to create areas with distinct architectural atmospheres. The funeral center uses these elements to create spaces for the needs of the different faces of a service. Three kilometres from the ‘Rotterdam Blaak’ station in the bend of the river Meuse lies the ‘Eschpolder’, enclosed within two dikes. Around 1970 polluted slit was stored in the area on top of which nature took over and created a beautiful landscape. The funeral center is situated along the outer dike and has certain elements within the natural area, such as an urn cemetery and a meditative building. Along the inner dike there is ample space for recreational functions. For example boat rentals from which one can paddle along the islands. The project creates a new place for remembrance, close to the city, which can also be used for recreation and nature experience. This gives the Eschpolder a new character, where death is part of life. A place for grieving, for religion and beauty, but also for recreation, relaxation and fun. Just like the water, attractive and dangerous at the same time, it is two sided. Within the building is a water defense wall of sheet piles which will take over the function of the dike and provide water safety for the building and the land behind. The rusting surface has a beautiful weather beaten face which is a reference to the beauty and acceptance of decline. The water defense wall is designed for 5,0m. NAP. This provides a large safety factor which will ensure adequate protection into the distant future. The openings in the wall can be closed in emergencies. The water defense wall divides the dike into two sides. The land side is related to the functions of the building that are more private, about contemplation, remembrance and grieving in a protected environment behind the dike. The river side relates to the everyday life, the fact that one has to go on without the deceased and that life goes on. The building is approached on top of the dike. When moving through the building the floorlevel lowers into the dike. The moment of contemplation in the auditorium lies safely behind and within the dike and has a view to the polder. The service is followed by the ritual of bearing the coffin along the dike, to the crematorium building, into the earth. When one proceeds to the condolence the floor level rises up to the top of the dike, the water, the wind, life goes on. The project can be used for inspiration and to promote the discussion on multifunctional use of dikes. It shows the possibilities of the Eschpolder, functioning as a beautiful and integral part of the city of Rotterdam. The funeral center gives the Rotterdam people a place for a pleasant experience of parting in a beautiful ambiance.","Funeral Center; funeraire architectuur; crematorium; uitvaartcentrum; waterkering; water; architectuur; landschap; Rotterdam; Eschpolder; dijk; rivier; multifunctioneel","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-07-17","Architecture","Architecture","","Delta Interventions","",""

(mentor)","2012","Since the second half of last century, traffic congestion on road network has become a predominant phenomenon due to the rapid increases in transport demand and number of vehicles. It starts to become clear until later that century traffic congestion cannot be solved single-handedly by expansions of road network. During peak hours, besides recurrent congestion caused by insatiable demand, non-recurrent congestion caused by incidents, adverse weather conditions and work zones, are becoming more problematic with their temporary disturbances causing traffic breakdowns. Developments and deployments of traffic control strategies come into effect to solve recurrent and non-recurrent congestions with a synthesis combining technologies, traffic theories, mathematics and kinematics. Although ITS control measures are relatively new, they transform into the backbones of a prevailing type of traffic management, Dynamic Traffic Management. When coordination and integration between DTM control measures is introduced as the advanced approach to restore the utilization of road network, great hope is placed on Coordinated Network Management to improve the effectiveness of traffic management. The Field Test Integrated Traffic Management Amsterdam aims at investigating the effect and the control concept of coordinated network wide traffic management for the implementation in 2013. The graduation project is to develop an assessment methodology framework for modelling and ex-ante evaluation of CNM. This methodology is applied to the kidney shaped network of southern Amsterdam region in order to perform ex-ante evaluation on realizing and testing dynamic coordinated network management. Evaluations and validations of the above modelling are presented to show the effect of individual DTM and coordinated DTM, also known as CNM, under recurrent and non-recurrent congestions. A test solution towards advanced deployment strategies and methodologies based on an incident-induced empirical case is contrived later using Matlab. Simulation results are also presented in order to assess this test solution and the effect of CNM under its coordination strategies and methodologies. Finally, findings, conclusions, recommendations and future directions are drawn to bring the thesis project to completion. Hopefully, this thesis work could be referred to for the future implementation of CNM in the PPA project and it could be informative to other CNM related researches.","Coordinated Network Management; traffic management; control measure; assessment methodology; enhanced test solution; case study","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-07-04","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","Master","",""

In particular during the re-entry phase, high maneuverability of the vehicle is preferred such that reusable (manned) spacecraft can land on conventional runways. Control devices are therefore a necessity to improve the maneuverability of the spacecraft. Consequently, the hypersonic flow behaviour around control flaps is thoroughly investigated over the last decades. Boundary layer separation/reattachment and shock wave interaction are general flow phenomena that occur in hypersonic double ramp flow. Furthermore, streamwise periodic counter rotating vortices (Gortler vortices) tend to grow in the boundary layer over the control surface. Gortler vortices are induced by the centrifugal forces associated with the change in direction of motion forced on the fluid by the concave geometry of the surface. Gortler vortices take the form of a striation pattern and considerably modify the heat flux and can cause spanwise heat transfer variations of 100%.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2012","The MSc. graduation project dealt with understanding the implications of Neo liberal policies on the city of Juarez which lies on the US - Mexico border. In 2009 Ciudad Juarez was rated as “the most violent zone in the world outside of declared war zones” due to high crime rates, femisides, homicides, corruption, drug trafficking and multiple other problems. The city is also presently facing massive exodus and the abandoning of large portions of its housing stock due to the increase in violence and a prevailing low intensity war between the state and the drug cartels. The reasons for this asymmetrical development are multiple and point towards a complex mesh of forces that transgress the scope of the built environment. They encompass entangled dimensions of political economy and socio-economic developments, which eventually affect the built environment. With this background a six month intense research was carried out and a counter proposal group strategy was proposed on a prototype site Riberas Del bravo and eventually an Urban & architectural intervention was designed. Thus as part of my graduation project I designed a collective transport system comprising of three design elements the Transferium hub, the bus stops and the routes on the prototype site. The core design idea dealt with developing a time based concept, that allowed hybridization of the programme and hence catered to both peak and anti-peak hour differently. Firstly a strong east west axis was developed to regulate and accentuate the flow of people along the canal & public promenade proposed as part of the group strategy. These east west axis were flanged by three pavilions serving the Transferium and Community center on the two edges and a multipurpose market space at the center. The central multipurpose market space manifested itself further as Hawking zone courtyard, Mobile Market courtyard and Permanent Market. During the peak hour the Transferium expanded into the central multipurpose space and during the anti-peak hour the community market/activities expanded into the multipurpose space. Thus depending on the flow of vehicles the central multipurpose space grew or condensed in size catering to different activities.","Transferium; Neo liberal Policies; Urban Asymmetries","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Delft School of Design","","Urban Asymmetries","",""

Formation of external filter cake and internal filtration of solid particles were visualized and leak-off volumes were determined as function of time. At the end of the experiments the formed external filter cake and internal particle deposition were characterised with the aid of an Electron Scanning Microscope. Using drilling fluids containing carbonate particles it was found that leak-off volumes for saturated cores are larger than for unsaturated cores. It was observed further that leak-off volumes increase with the particle size, i.e. consistently with a more permeable external filter cake and limited internal filtration.

Together with the urban expansion to rural areas, new towns as self-sufficient areas were constructed to settle public housing in New Territory since 1970s. However, some new towns developed into public housing clusters without enough living opportunities because of socio-economic changes and huge economic benefit. Tin Shui Wai is just such a new town of public housing cluster, with a large concentration of low-income groups. It is a Besieged City, out of the network of the mainstream of Hong Kong as a global financial metropolis and deserted at the edge of the metropolitan area. However, from Urbanism views, it still has potentials on different scales. The government is pushing a new development area of HSK next to TSW. There is no doubt that this area will attract investment with new infrastructure connection. However, it is hard to say whether the new development could benefit the low-income groups in TSW. So, this graduation project is to explore an inclusive development strategy that could benefit the low-income groups to open the Besieged City of TSW. The new development strategy, as a supplement to the government’s plan, would follow the development trend of the WNT area, make good use of nature and human resources in local environment, create spatial opportunities for community development, and focus on improving the life quality of low-income groups.","Hong Kong; Public Housing; New Town; Inclusive development strategy; community development","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Urbanism","","Complex Cities studio","",""

Maar gemeenten houden vast aan oude gewoontes en geloof in groei. Het lijkt alsof gemeenten geen beeld hebben van de effecten van hun huidig beleid, zowel nu als in de toekomst en de mogelijke problemen die hierdoor veroorzaakt kunnen worden. Gemeenten durven niet ver vooruit te kijken en daarbij een richting te kiezen waar ze vervolgens met overtuiging naar toe kunnen sturen. Waarschijnlijk omdat ze niet weten wat de juiste richting zal zijn. Dit onderzoek probeert helderheid te bieden over wat wel de juiste richting is en hoe deze eruit ziet. Door alle mogelijke toekomstscenario’s uit te werken is duidelijk gemaakt wat er allemaal te verwachten is. Daarnaast is er uitgewerkt welke strategieën een gemeente kan hanteren en hoe deze strategieën er dan uit kunnen zien. Hierdoor werd het mogelijk om combinaties te maken van verschillende scenario’s en strategieën om zo te zien hoe die combinaties wel of niet functioneren en belangrijker, waarom ze zo functioneren. Het streven van dit onderzoek is daarom het creëren van duidelijkheid over de effecten van verschillende beleidskeuzes in verschillende scenario’s om zo beleidsmakers een houvast te geven bij toekomstige beleidsbeslissingen. Dit is uiteindelijk bereikt door een drietal mogelijkheden uit te werken in een hoog, laag en ongewijzigd scenario en deze te confronteren met de strategieën van het tegengaan van krimp, het faciliteren van krimp en het sturen op een transitie. Hieruit blijkt dat de beleidsstrategie die het beste aansluit op de mogelijke toekomst scenario’s een sterk strategisch reactievermogen heeft en zich richt op de succesfactoren uit de strategie van het sturen op transitie.","Krimp; Strategieën; Gebiedsontwikkeling; Urban Area Development; Strategies; Rural; Shrink; Beuningen; Gemeente; Municipality; Scenario's; Scenarios; Confrontatie; Transitie; Prognose; Pennings; Robert; Master; Thesis; Landelijk; Confrontation","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-07-03","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","Urban Area Development","",""

(mentor); Koppels, P.W. (mentor)","2012","The Olympic host cities have been facing difficulties with the post-use of the legacy of the Olympic Games. When organizing the Games, big plans for the city arise and during the event, the city shows its beautiful venues. However, after the Games the venues remain empty and unused. The post-Olympic period offers too little demand for the created venues and public space. During the years, the legacy of the Games has become more and more important and host cities are planning their legacy from the initiative phase on. However ‘white elephants’ still occur. Just planning the legacy does not seem to be enough. The mega-event strategy should be connected with the long-term perspectives of the host city’s urban regeneration plan. The master thesis is to investigate how the aspects of post-use creation are implemented on building level and to what extent the mega-event strategy of the Olympic host city influences this implementation. These aspects of post-use creation are at city, area and building level and contain the; urban planning, stakeholders, social costs & benefits, mobility, program, routing, catchment area, organization, adjustability, architectural value and function factor. The research methods used in this master thesis are a literature study, the case study method and a cross-case analysis. The cases of Barcelona, Athens and Beijing are investigated on the aspects of post-use creation and the cross-case analysis has provided lesson learned of these cases. These lesson learned form the basis of the theoretical guidelines to enlarge the chance of post-use creation on building level, which is the end-result of this thesis. Important is the integration of the aspects of post-use creation in the mega-event strategy, connecting it with the long-term perspectives of the urban regeneration plan of the host city. Especially the aspects of urban planning, program and adjustability are of great influence on enlarging the chance of post-use.","post-use; Olympic legacy; mega-event","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-06-28","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","Urban Area Development","",""

If an evaluation system exists that is able to point out specific flaws in the stage of development, it can lead to a very robust and improved algorithm. This work attempts to create such an evaluation framework. Given an algorithm that detects people and simultaneously tracks them, we evaluate its output by considering the complexity of the input scene. Some videos used for the evaluation are recorded using the Kinect sensor and a benchmark dataset from the PETS workshop is also used. To analyze the performance of the tracking system,the reasons due to which the algorithm might fail are investigated and quantified over the entire video sequence. A set of features called Scene C omplexity Measures are obtained for each input frame. The variability in the algorithm performance is modeled by these complexity measures using various regression models. From the regression statistics, we show that we can compare the performance of two different algorithms and also quantify the relative influence of the scene complexity measures on a given algorithm.","tracking; surveillance; people detection; regression","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","Media and Knowledge Engineering","",""

Complex Network approaches have shown a direction to study some of the problems faced by power grids and it is a continuing challenge thus far. Power grids have been studied for their structural vulnerabilities using purely topological approaches. A purely topological approach assumes that flow of power is dictated by shortest paths. However, this fails to capture the real flow characteristics of power grids. We have proposed a flow redistribution mechanism that closely mimics the flow in power grids using the \ac{PTDF}. With this mechanism we enhance the already existing cascading failure models to study the vulnerability of power grids. We apply the model to the European high-voltage grid to carry out a comparative study for a number of centrality measures. `Centrality' gives an indication of the criticality of network components. Our model offers a way to find those centrality measures that give the best indication of node vulnerability in the context of power grids, by considering not only the network topology but also the power flowing through the network. In addition, we use the model to determine the spare capacity that is needed to make the grid robust to targeted attacks.","power grids; complex networks; cascading failures; flow redistribution; centrality","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-06-29","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","Distributed Systems and Networks","",""

As the city develops, within the limits of it appear as an integral part, spaces that lack of a clear role. Their meaning is continuously open to the formulation and often emerges ""randomly"" from the event of occasional events. What may make the acceptance of the void as a key element in an urban structure and under what conditions this (urban space) can be determined? The absence of a building in an area of the city is not enough for giving him the concept of 'urban void'. Spaces that can be characterized by a specific function or they serve an aesthetic point of view, and particularly in any case characterized by contents of the ""filled"" with interesting or indifferent actions of everyday life within cannot be defined as urban voids. Instead it could be seen to what extent, and even buildings are urban voids in conditions devoid of above characteristics. The voids are derivatives of unforeseeable transformations of the city. Their presence creates strange feelings. It could be seen as a reaction to the body of the city or a collateral development. So, which is the aesthetic perception of the urban voids of the escalator area? What defines them as voids? They are places? Or non- places? Do they have potentials to be filled with a specific function and which is the best solution? To be an integral part of the city or a parasitical formation of spaces? The site of the escalators is a mosaic of non-places, a mixture of different micro worlds with an escalator system to penetrate them and automatically define them as a performance. People who travel with the escalators are the viewers of the performance. Those who use the micro worlds, the performers, experience the semi-private spaces. But what exactly is the role of public space in this area? How can we re-define the new Hong Kongian public space under the new conditions of neo-liberalism? Which is the part of these urban voids inside this interrogation and redefinition of the public space? In conclusion, how we should treat these urban voids in order to serve the new re-defined feeling of Hong Kong?

It combines the two dominant SAT solving techniques: lookahead and conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL). First, it partitions the search space into so called cubes using a lookahead solver. Each cube is tackled by a conflict-driven clause learning solver. Crucial for strong performance is the cutoff heuristic that decides when to switch from lookahead to CDCL. Yet, this offline heuristic is far from ideal. In this work, we present a novel hybrid solver that applies lookahead and CDCL simultaneously. Both solvers work together on each cube, while communication is restricted to synchronization. Our concurrent cube-and-conquer (CCC) solver can solve many instances faster than pure lookahead, pure CDCL and offline cube-and-conquer, but is not suitable for all instances. We have developed two metrics that can be used to accurately select when to apply CCC or to fall back to pure CDCL. We think CCC is especially useful as part of a portfolio that selects a suitable solver based on machine learning techniques, and show that machine learning techniques can indeed be used to select accurately whether CCC or CDCL works best.","satisfiability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Algorithmics group","","Computer Science","",""

(mentor); Verheij, H.J. (mentor); Verhagen, H.J. (mentor); Van den Bos, J.P. (mentor)","2012","Granular filters are used for protection against scour and erosion. For a proper functioning it is necessary that interfaces between the filter structure, the subsoil and the water flowing above the filter structure are stable. Stability means that there is no transport of subsoil material through the filter to the water above the filter, and that no filter material is removed by currents above the filter. Three types of granular filters can be distinguished; 1) Geometrically closed filter structures, 2) Stable geometrically open filter structures, 3) Unstable geometrically open filter structures. This research is focusing on stable geometrically open filter structures. Recently, a desk study has been carried out by Deltares resulting in a new theoretical formula for single layered geometrically open filter structures (CUR, 2010). Hoffmans improved the theoretical formula that had been founded by Deltares (Hoffmans G. , 2012) The goal of this research was to verify the formula found by Hoffmans [2012] for structures loaded by currents (flow parallel to the filter construction). As part of the verification of the design formula ten flume experiments were performed in the Environmental Fluid Mechanic Laboratory at Delft University of Technology. After the execution of the model tests an extensive analysis was made based on the performed model tests and model tests performed in the past (Bakker [1960], Haverhoek [1968], Wouters [1982], Konter et al. [1990], Van Huijstee and Verheij [1991] and Van Velzen [2012]). The analysis showed that the formula is valid for single layered geometrically open filter structures loaded by currents. Two adjustments to the design formula are proposed: 1. The relative layer thickness fits better when related to the nominal diameter of the filter material; 2. The alpha value proposed by Hoffmans [2012] is too high (new alpha values are 30% to 60% lower). The original formula as proposed by Hoffmans [2012] gives unrealistic values for situations with wide graded filter material. Model tests showed that the relative layer thickness is better represented when related to the nominal diameter of the filter material. The design formula can be used for design purposes. The design of a single layered geometrically open filter structure can be schematized in two steps; 1. Firstly, determination of the material that should be used for the top-layer; 2. Secondly, determination of the layer-thickness of the filter/top-layer taking into account filter and base material characteristics.","bed protection; open filter; filter structure; granular filter; geometrically open; design formula; model test; flume experiment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2012","Het ontwerpen van een uitvaartcentrum te midden van onze samenleving. Waarom is dit nodig? De dood is een belangrijk onderdeel van ons bestaan, iedereen krijgt er vroeg of laat een keer mee te maken. Daarnaast hebben we te maken met een multiculturele samenleving waar verschillende geloven elk hun eigen rituelen en tradities kennen ten aanzien van de dood. Het is belangrijk dat hierop ingespeeld wordt met de voorzieningen die nodig zijn. Verder is er ook in het uitvaartweze zelf veel veranderd, mensen zijn steeds meer betrokken tijdens het hele proces, willen meer zelf doen. Ook hierop dient te worden ingespeeld. Onderzoek wees uit dat de functie vaak terug te vinden is buiten de kernrandzones, in een natuurlijke omgeving. In dit ontwerp is gekozen om op zoek te gaan naar binnenstedelijke locaties die dezefde kwaliteiten hebben als buiten de kernrandzones, dus natuurlijke en rustige kenmerken. Gekozen is om één van de bouwblokken, het crematorium, verder uit te werken. Hier komt alles samen, het herdenken van de overledene, het laatste afscheid samen, het napraten en de herinneringen ophalen, kortom het afscheid. In het ontwerp is gekozen om de verschillende fase te scheiden van elkaar, zodat verschillende emoties elkaar niet tegenkomen of passeren. Hierbij zijn de volgende fases aangegeven, het afscheid, het loslaten en het herdenken. In het ontwerp is de afwisseling van binnen/ buiten erg belangrijk. Het helpt de nabestaande verder te gaan in het proces van de rouwverwerking, het geeft lucht en ruimte aan de zware vaak moelijke stappen die gezet dienen te worden. Naarmate verder wordt gegaan in het proces opent het gebouw zich verder, bij de koffiekamers opent het gebouw zich en ontstaat er een weids uitzicht over de rivier de Schelde. Het uitvaartcentrum waarin het crematorium zich bevindt geeft ruimte aan samenkomst. Het creert een plek in de stad waar men kan terug komen zonder er echt voor de functie zelf te moeten zijn. Dit in combinatie met de ontwikkelingen rondom de kades van de Schelde. Het geheel wordt een rustgevige plek te midden van het hectische stadsleven.","Dood","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-07-05","Architecture","Architecture","","Explorelab","",""

(mentor)","2012","The continuous rise of internet solutions in everyday life and business is resulting in a growing awareness that higher education should embed more Web2.0 technologies in the learning process. 65% of higher education institutions now say that online learning is a critical part of their long-term strategy (Allen & Seaman, 2011). Blended learning is interesting in this respect because it combines the best of both worlds: face-to-face and online instruction. As a result, higher education institutes and their members expect blended learning software that is increasingly interactive, advanced and user friendly. These expectations can no longer be satisfied by Learning Management Systems such as Blackboard and Moodle for two main reasons: these systems lack interactivity because they are administration-oriented and they simply can’t keep up with all the developments and needs because it is an ‘all-in-one’ solution. A new wave of more social, niche learning software supports this vision. However, due to the marginal size of project based learning in the average university, learning software for project related courses are still missing. That’s why project courses are dependent on solutions such as print, email, wikis, blogs or Learning Management Systems that are designed primarily for content courses with lectures and exams. Content courses are intrinsically different from project courses. Consequently, project courses use solutions that do not optimally satisfy today’s needs and opportunities within higher education project courses. A web platform dedicated to project courses and the associated student projects seems more capable to fulfill existing or future requirements, needs and opportunities within project based learning and project course management. The goal of this graduation project was to find and validate benefits for educators and students: What are the benefits for educators from having a web2.0 community to support the project course? What are the benefits for students from having their student project in the ‘cloud’? The main research has been done using a prototype web platform which piloted with four project courses at the faculty of Industrial Design, involving more than 250 students and teachers during their complete course. Using online & offline feedback, website statistics and insights from each pilot, the web platform was improved on a continuous basis. The findings resulted in a final concept, an interaction model, a conceptual business plan and a prototype web platform, called Shareworks.","project courses; application; shareworks; blended learning; online learning; virtual learning environment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Conceptualization and Communication","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Van Timmeren, A. (mentor); Schipper, R. (mentor)","2012","The building industry in the developing countries, today, is confused between technological developments and the vernacular. The values imbibed in tradition, and colonial hegemony in India have had deep impacts in the psychological perception of the vernacular. Unfortunately, in today’s circumstances, where in population explosion and rapid urbanisation have resulted in severe housing shortages and demands, the advantages which can be borrowed from the technological advancements in the developed countries cannot be ignored. The meaning of ‘traditional’ itself is mistaken today, where the construction practice is no longer vernacular, but utilizing manpower at large on site to produce buildings is being termed as ‘traditional’. The cultural values associated with what has been termed as ‘traditional’ building methods are so deeply rooted that, even though all the stake holders are aware that the ‘traditional’ building methods are no longer viable solutions for present day demands, it is still continued at large, due to lack of much research on what values technology could add to the building methods for housing. Though it must be mentioned that the scene is not the same for commercial projects, where technology is slowly catching up. This trend, is weighing heavily on the housing industry. Therefore the need of the hour is to come up ideas, systems, strategies of utilizing the potentials of what technology can offer to benefit in supplying quicker, better quality housing. This is absolutely essential from the point of not only housing demands, but also there is a deep declined in the percentage of skilled labour available for making good quality ‘traditional’ craftsmanship. So it is better to channelise the ‘unskilled’ labour into a more productive chain of work, to develop new crafts- ‘industrial’ crafts. This report documents a brief investigation of the present housing scenario in India, the existing construction alternatives, what possibilities industrialization can offer, case studies on a few systems to help arrive at a good system to be developed, and finally ends with a development of a product which can be used to address the housing needs in India, with further research. Parallely a study of fly-ash is presented, the under-utilization of which is seen as the second problem in this research work. So the product/ system proposed and developed is one utilizing a good percentage of flyash as its main ingredient. The Flyash ‘Stack-crete’ as I would call it, is a prefinished load bearing wall element, which can be stacked up to make up a load bearing facade, for a low rise. The report culminates with a discussion on a mockup, the potentials of the product and possible constraints. It should be mentioned here, that, industrialization offers several possibilities as noted in the report. Product and system development is one way of addressing it, and is definitely an important step in the whole process. So the flyash based prefabricated product proposed is one of the ways of addressing the housing needs in India in a sustainable way. I shall by no means make a claim that it is the best way of solving the housing problems, but can conclude that it is a viable option under Indian circustances to address the housing needs with further research.","industrial; prefab; India; concrete; flyash; facade; wall","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-07-10","Architecture","Building Technology","","facade master","",""

The main question of this study is that what are Chinese customers’ emotional values during their cooking experience. To answer this question, a contextual research was conducted in China in the winter of 2011, in order to get deep insights from intended customers and figure out the important emotional values during their cooking experience. 9 home-visits and one group session were conducted in both Beijing and Shanghai, 18 participants got involved into the field research. The home visits moves from general information to the details, which includes Participant observation, Collage, Mindmap and Force-choice. The finding from field research is that there are three types of emotional values that are important for users, on one hand, they formulate an affective expectation for the coming cooking experience. On the other hand, they influence the judgement about the current experience. The three categories of emotional values are: Self-Achievement, Family relationship and communication as well as Enjoyment. Due to these findings from contextual research would be used to help designers to develop kitchen appliances in China market, the intended customers are broken down into 4 types in order to develop tailored products. Based on these four types of user and findings from research, four inspiration manuals are developed in order to help designers to understand each type of users as well as generating tailored ideas and concepts. Each manual includes 4 blocks. Firstly, ‘Persona’ aims to help designers to empathize with target users. Secondly, ‘Scenario’ illustrates a typical cooking experience of intended users. Thirdly, ‘Emotional Values’ lists all the important emotional values during user’s cooking experience. Finally, Aesthetic qualities are given to help designers to formulate desirable product appearance for target users. In addition, opportunity cards are attached at the end of the manual, they provide both opportunities and possible solutions, designers are expected to use them either as warm-up tasks or as an additional inspiration material to spark ideas.","Context research; Field research; Inspiration manual; Customer's emotional value; Design research; Cooking; Food","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Strategic Product Design","","","",""

The project exploits the relation between those elements while finding a solution to the main challenges in front of the city today: To achieve a balanced urban development, which will lead to international recognition. The structure of the thesis follows the one-year process of its elaboration. It starts with a research part, defining the main problem and the tracking the political reasons behind it. Further the main socio- spatial problems of the city are analyzed through the scope of the public space – a vulnerable urban element, constituted form the relations between diverse actors (public, private, civic). Therefore public space is not only used as a tool for solving urban issues, but also an analytical tool, speaking of the complex processes taking place in the city. The theoretical part explores the capacities and properties of public space on a context-free level. Public space is then used as a structural tool, able to frame the urban management model in a desired direction. In order to reinforce that structure, and give it a social dimension, public space is engaged with the cultural and historical heritage of the area. The final products, a strategy and a design, offers an example of how the of the main discussed elements could co-exist and present an opportunity for the development of the city. Although the thesis was initiated by a strong interest about the specific location, it concludes by an approach that could be applied to other locations, sharing similar symptoms and problems.","public space; Sofia; historical heritage; post-socialist processes; urban strategy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-05-31","Architecture","Urbanism","","Complex cities graduation studio","",""

In order to cope with the mentioned main problems, I developed a strategy which reveals the possibilities of stimulating the stagnant real estate development and proposes intervention projects in order to capture the synergy of the existing and future large urban projects. In addition, these interventions improve the spatial conditions of socially vulnerable areas and directly benefit the locals and their living quality. Two key intervention projects were studied in more detail and a design proposal for them was proposed. This made it possible to open up a discussion of the actual development possibilities even in the times of the economic scarcity and real estate market stagnation.

(mentor); Remoy, H.T. (mentor)","2012","In de toekomst zal de vraag naar nieuwbouw afnemen en zal er juist steeds meer van de bestaande voorraad getransformeerd dienen te worden. Bovendien zullen veel bestaande gebieden geherstructu-reerd worden om deze gebieden leefbaarder te maken. Hierbij kan tijdelijke transformatie een grote rol spelen. Vaak duurt het erg lang voordat - na het initiatief om een gebied te transformeren – het gebied daadwerkelijk wordt getransformeerd. Als er in de tussentijd niets met de gebouwen in dit gebied gebeurt blijven gebouwen leegstaan en blijft het gebied onleefbaar. Hier ligt een grote kans om twee problemen; het tekort aan studentenkamers en deze tijdelijke leegstand, op te lossen. Stichting Herontwikkeling tot Studentenhuisvesting Delft (SHS Delft) heeft deze kans gezien en wil deze problemen oplossen. SHS Delft is een stichting die bestaat uit studenten van de Technische Uni-versiteit Delft. SHS Delft wil graag panden transformeren naar tijdelijke woonruimte voor studenten en deze panden vervolgens zelf beheren. In Utrecht is eerder een dergelijke stichting opgericht (Stichting Tijdelijk Wonen Utrecht) die al enkele panden tijdelijk heeft getransformeerd naar studentenhuisves-ting. Toch is het voor zulke beginnende stichtingen als SHS Delft lastig om duidelijk te krijgen wat ze moeten doen en vooral hoe ze dat moeten doen. Het kost voor de stichting erg veel tijd om er achter te komen hoe ze het aan moeten pakken. Daarnaast zullen ze veel van wat STW ook al heeft uitge-zocht opnieuw moeten uitzoeken, omdat er nog geen duidelijke informatie op papier is verzameld. Vandaar dat SHS Delft naar de TU Delft toe is gestapt met de vraag hoe ze het aan moeten pakken, waar ze moeten beginnen en hoe ze problemen waar ze tegenaan lopen het beste op kunnen lossen. Op dit moment is er duidelijk een gebrek aan kennis op het gebied van het gehele proces (vanaf het initiatief tot en met beheer) van tijdelijke transformatie van leegstaand vastgoed naar studentenhuis-vesting. Groepen die zich bezighouden met studentenhuisvesting gaan los van elkaar aan de slag en moeten steeds opnieuw het wiel uitvinden. Daarom wordt in dit onderzoek de vraag gesteld: Hoe kan het proces van de transformatie van leegstaand vastgoed naar tijdelijke studenten-huisvesting in Nederland worden georganiseerd van de initiatieffase tot en met de beheersfase? Het doel van dit onderzoek is tweeledig: het richt zich enerzijds op uitbreiding van de kennis over tij-delijke transformatie en richt zich anderzijds op het ontwikkelen van een handleiding voor de trans-formatie van leegstaand vastgoed naar studentenhuisvesting. Deze handleiding kunnen studenten huisvestingsstichtingen en andere ontwikkelaars van studentenhuisvesting gebruiken wanneer ze leeg-staande panden willen transformeren naar tijdelijke studentenhuisvesting.","transformatie; studentenhuisvesting; handleiding","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-06-27","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","Design and Construction Management","",""

This was the main challenge of the design in terms of daylight, and the main parameter that determined the daylight strategy and the tests which were done during this thesis. The main problem that had to be solved, was to reverse the unfavorable situation of the partially daylit building volume and to validate a system that could provide the building with adequate levels of daylight during the year.

The major findings indicate that the active tangibles, in general, show great potential for conveying abstract computer system information through their functional parts. In addition, active tangibles can be used to facilitate common computer system commands. The final prototype facilitates abstract cut, copy and paste commands within a photo sorting canvas environment. Results from both qualitative usability test indicate that the final prototype is capable of delivering a pleasant and intuitive experience. The final prototype facilitates natural, unrestrained and flexible interaction surrounding multi-touch tabletops. Potentially, this type of tangible could be used to convey computer system information over additional sensorial dimensions and support collaborative scenarios that surround interactive tabletop displays. This report recommends TNO to continue the development of Sensator technology in this direction, alongside other ways of applying Sensator technology.","multi-touch; active tangibles; natural interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Department of Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Molenbroek, J.F.M. (mentor); De Haan, F.G. (mentor)","2012","Introduction This report is part of a graduation project performed for KLM Royal Dutch Airlines (KLM). KLM is the flag carrier airline of the Netherlands. The report is about the introduction of the iPad as information source for the ground agents at KLM and the ergonomics concerning the use of it. The main goal of the iPad is to improve the service that ground agents can provide for the passengers of KLM and Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. The agents will use the iPad during their work and for this the ergonomics relating to the use of it should be pleasurable, both for the holding of the device as the user interface ergonomics. Previous research has indicated that the iPad is too heavy to hold, when standing, for longer than 15 minutes. This report will talk about the advised way to use the device and will give an advice on the user interface of the to be created application (app). Analysis In order to find the optimal combination between a support for the iPad and an app that will help agents make quick repairs intuitively several studies have been conducted. The studies were conducted to o see which factors are important for ergonomically responsible use of the iPad. Literature, internal reports, interviews, observation and context mapping have been used to gain more insights in the environment in which the agents operate. iPad support The first study that was done is finding the right posture during the use of the iPad by the agents to prevent physical complaints when using the iPad. This study indicated the visual- manipulative comfort zone, the ideal placing, of the iPad. Key to preventing physical complaints is variation of the posture. With these results in mind a better context analysis has been made to be able to place the correct use of the iPad within the work environment. The most surprising outcome was the difference in amount of people at transfer centre 6 from long times none to rows of people during calamities. From this study four personas were made to keep in mind during the design process. At last a market research was conducted to see what information could be gathered from the already existing support products on the market and other comparable professions. The research pointed out that the iPad is a unique device and the circumstances in which the agents work is challenging. Repair app First literature was consulted to find out about ergonomic guidelines for a touch user interface. The most important outcome of this study was: less is more. The app should be designed as simple as possible to ensure an intuitive interaction. Secondly, by interviewing KLM employees the main content of the app has been established. Five tasks were selected that are the base of the app. At last research has been done on finding a fit for KLM. Important to distinguish KLM are its colors, white, blue and a ‘touch of orange’, and the use of squares for internal communication especially. With the results of the research a list of requirements could be formulated for the to be designed iPad support and repair app. Design iPad support The iPad support that has been designed is carried on one shoulder and crosses over the body in standby mode. To use the iPad a quick motion of three steps can be made to place it in position; bringing the iPad in front of you, placing the frame of the support against the belly and sliding the iPad away from the body. The strap of the support is worn around the neck. The support places the iPad in the visual-manipulative comfort zone and can be used without hands, which leaves them free to interact with the passengers. Repair app The app concept has a basic lay out that stays the same in the entire app. A column on the left side presents options and a main frame is connected to the selected option. At the bottom five icons can be found that each represent a repair. For the prototype of the app the option to add baggage to a passenger booking is simulated. Conclusion Both the iPad support and the app were tested separately and together. iPad support The main findings of the user test pointed out that the iPad can be used during a shift of 1.5 hours by using this iPad support. Overall the support was received well. The negative sides of the iPad support are the strain on the neck for some people, and the attachment of the strap to the support blocks some parts of the screen. The design was said to fit KLM but might be too feminine for men. Repair app The app was received very well. All participants could walk through the flow without a problem. The design is considered businesslike, friendly and to the point. Combination The app matches the support. The advantage of the app is that the viewing part is placed on the top of the app and the action, data entering, part is placed at the bottom of the screen. Because of the distance the iPad support creates between the belly and the iPad, the arms can be in a good position when pushing buttons or entering data. All in all both designs have been received well by the 26 participants of the user tests and the agents indicated that they would want to use the support and the app.","design; interaction; iPad; app; ergonomics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

(mentor); Luiten, E.A.J. (mentor)","2012","This project promotes building regional capacity by means of collaborative planning in order to co-evolve with change. It is not about weighting alternative solutions or leaving things to the market, but about cooperation between actors from the public, private and business sector, each with their own knowledges that can be employed to build adaptive strategies. The known, UK originating, planning instrument green belt has been used to make the case. The green belt policy aimed to keep land open and got developed in the UK in the first half of the twentieth century. In time it became an universal accepted means to control urban sprawl. During the last decade some fundamental changes within the object and process of spatial planning has complicated the very effectiveness of this spatial planning instrument. First metropolitan areas are growing together into a new phenomenon called metropolitan regions. Within these metropolitan regions green belts have become part of a spatial unit that also contains opposing land uses like urbanized areas, urban sprawl, and highly dense residential areas. Secondly within the process of spatial planning a shift from government to governance is fading the system responsible for the implementation of green belts. Governing processes are no longer fully controlled by government but subject to negotiations between a wide range of public, semi-public and private actors, whereas green belts are depending on a high level of intervention by government. A developed hypothesis responding to these fundamental changes has been tested and further explored in a case study: the case of the Green Heart. The Green Heart is a spatial policy for controlling urban growth in the central part of Randstad Holland. During the last decade Dutch national government is slowly retreating from this policy. At the same time the area is confronted with urgent local problems threatening the very characteristics of its cultural landscapes. The western part has to deal with soil salinazation, while the amount of fresh water storage is decreasing. In the eastern located peat lands the characteristic peat is vanishing as a result of oxidation. This process of oxidation is caused by low ground water tables needed for agriculture, without interfering the peat will be disappeared in 50 years. Proposing a collaborative planning strategy this project has found new ways to deal with these issues while simultaneously it does an effort to revisit the universal green belt planning instrument.","regional planning; collaborative planning; green belts; green heart; resilient governance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Urbanism","","Complex Cities","",""

(mentor); Zandbelt, D. (mentor)","2012","This graduation thesis tackles the issue of airport-driven urban development in the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area context. Initially planned outside of cities for security and pollution reasons airports are now attracting urban development in their proximity. This development consisting of hotels, office spaces or congress centres is driven by the benefits of a location providing a fast connection to an airport with a large variety of flight destinations. This phenomena is linked to a time based competition business model in which the speed with which companies reach their world spread customer base is vital for their performance (Kasarda, 2000). Through the large flows of people and goods that they attract airports are becoming regional nodes of activity in their city regions. Multiple authors indicate the need for the development of new conceptual frameworks that would help better understand the complex urban interactions triggered by airports on a regional scale (Freestone and Baker, 2011, Salewski et al., 2012, Schaafsma, 2009, Schlaak, 2009, Knippenberger, 2010). Through this thesis I am proposing an alternative spatial development strategy for the area between Schiphol Airport and Amsterdam. The strategy aims to integrate the airport related urban networks in a regional vision which takes into consideration spatial, demographic and economic trends specific to the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area. Moreover the strategy aims to provide solutions for the local urban integration of airport related business parks. My vision for the area is to develop Amsterdamse Bos as a metropolitan park with an urban edge providing a living and working environment in an international context. Existing spatial planning models of airport-driven urban development are not yet sufficiently developed. I therefore chose to use network urbanism theories in order to explain and propose future development strategies on a regional and local scale. The thesis ends with an evaluation of the proposed strategy and of the suitability of a network urbanism approach within this context.","airport-driven urban development; Amsterdam Metropolitan Area; Schiphol Airport; network urbanism; regional planning","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Urbanism","","Spatial Planning and Strategy Chair","",""

(mentor); Korthals Altes, W. (mentor); Sepúlveda, D. (mentor)","2012","This thesis reviews the effectiveness of Chilean Regulatory Plans (Regional, Metropolitan and Municipal) to counter act Santiago’s socio economic segregation patterns. Particular types of segregation, country’s housing policy, Santiago’s land market dynamics and transport & infrastructure investments are analyzed to allow identify what is necessary to be achieved to counteract city’s segregation problems and which role regulatory plans can have in the solution. A first requisite for a regulatory plan to be effective in reducing Santiago’s segregation patterns is to have a clear goal regarding what is wanted to be achieved. Santiago segregation patterns involves all socio economic groups, but as the negative consequences of these patterns are been suffered by lower income groups, regulatory plans efforts should be directed on improving their situation. Therefore the goals of any proposal should be directed on counteract ‘low income group’s socially homogeneized segregated areas (south and north-west)’ and ‘new low income inhabitants exclusion from city’s urban area’. Chilean urban development and lower income groups dwellings production is organized under a system where Governmental bodies sets urbanistic norms (in the case of urban development) or financial resources (in the case of social dwellings production) and private parties take development’s reponsability. After 30 year of ‘market’ functioning, city’s segregation problems have been consolidated and in some cases have worsened. An ‘effective’ proposal to counteract segregation problems cannot be based on market functioning because low income groups do not represent an ‘atractive market’ for private developers and also because market ‘free functioning’ have not allowed Governmental bodies to control urban developments quality (for instance the consolidation of low income segregated areas). Therefore an effective proposal to counteract segregation patterns requires an active involvement of the Governmet bodies with incidence over the urban space regarding social dwellings location and quality, to see short term results and to allow ensuring minimum standards of quality for those inhabitants who cannot make effective their residential choices (low income groups). Each public institution that has to be involved in a solution for segregation problems counts with their own instruments. Metropolitan Regulatory plans are definied by MINVU’s SEREMI Region Metroplitana and Municipal Regulatory Plans per each municipality. Thinking about an ‘isolated’ regulatory plan’s solution for segregation problems is not possible as these phenomas are the consequences of many factors that regulatory plans do not have the attributions to control. Regulatory plans role inside before indentified segregation pattern’s solutions are according to the challenges that each one represents: (1) ‘Low income group’s socially homogeneized segregated areas (south and north-west)’ requires urban regeneration projects. Low income segregated areas social homogeinity hampers the arrival of private investments due to limited acquisition capacity of its inhabitants. An urban regeneration project should be aimed to break down this ‘residential monofunctionality’. MINVU’s Urban Development Division (DDU) can manage regeneration processes through the public call to tender for the design of an ‘Urban Regeneration Project’ (URP). Metropolitan and Municipal Regulatory Plans role in this solution is to allow URP implementation as they can provide the required ‘spatial territorial organization’ (densities, land uses, coefficients, etc) that the proposal requires to achieve its goals. Also Housing Policy subsidies, transport & infrastructure potential and the incidence of ‘Municipal Common Fund’ have to be considered. (2) ‘New low income inhabitant’s exclusion from city’s urban area’ requires a land generation policy. Due to city’s land values currently is not possible to develop social dwellings inside city’s urban area. The objective of ‘urban land generation’ is to allow well located social dwellings inside city’s urban areas with sufficient provision of facilities and services. Following the French model of a compulsory percentage of social dwellings per municipality, it is considered that this type of policy could have an effective impact on the demands of new lower income inhabitants of being located inside city’s urban area. Regulatory plans are considered as the suitable instrument for the application of this kind of measurements in the Chilean context. Regulatory plans allow to respond to local demands and to distinguish among the different urban centers according to their own characteristics. Situation that is not possible from policies (like housing policy) that rules country’s complete territory. Metropolitan regulatory plan could establish a ‘banwidth’ of the required surface per municipality that should be destinated for social dwellings; and also a criteria to determine per municipality the exact percentage of residential surface that should be considered (this criteria could be according municipalities’ infrastructure and facilities capacity). Each municipality (trough municipal regulatory plan) defines their percentage of social dwellings that could also be adapted according to the local demands that municipality management is able to detect. Also Housing Policy subsidies, transport & infrastructure connectivity and regulations to control land speculations could contribute to land generation policy implementation.","socio economic segregation; Chilean regulatory plans; effectivennes; Chilean housing policy; Santiagos land market; Santiagos transport & infrastructure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2015-01-01","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","Urban Area Development (UAD)","",""

It will host the organization of multidisciplinary activities aiming to raise awareness on the subject, inform, motivate and inspire people. Its infrastructure would be the main platform for this message to come across, meaning that by all means the building has to be at reach to society. From an urban point of view, a strong synergy with the immediate context and integration with the Manhattan Midtown East its vital to ensure that people is attracted to the building. A clear accessibility from both, the city and the river side promenade is equally important. Currently, the different programs addressing a more sustainable development are too fragmented and divided over all the UN councils and many separate local organizations worldwide. The UNEC will be a confluence centre at an international, national and local level, attracting individuals, institutions, corporations and governments. Acting as a role model for the world, the building for this reason must set the conditions for integration and collaborative work among the different entities of knowledge and institutions, by seamlessly combining them in under one green roof. The convergence of disciplines and stakeholders will be empowered by an architecture that facilitates informal encounters as a guiding principle. Openness and spatial continuity are the main qualities of the program distributed around an open central space connecting the different areas of the buildings. However, the distribution of circulations, with strategic control points (security), allow for certain areas of the building to function in an independent manner. With the atmosphere of a public domain, the building creates new landscapes for social interaction (courtyard and garden roof) on a ground “ In-between”, a ground for mediation. Thus, the value of this graduation project lies in being a design assignment for a project that deals with the question of sustainability from a extremely important stand point, which is not only minimizing the environmental impact of a building, energy consumption, etc; but also with how to facilitate and be a host to the coordinated efforts and measures to be taken towards a more sustainable development.

All three measures reduced the short-circuit levels successfully to values within the electromechanical and thermal withstand levels of the power system. Simulation results revealed that the SCFCL has a significantly lower impact on the rate-of-rise-of-recovery-voltage (RRRV) of the circuit breaker (CB) as compared to the CLR.

There are also risks for the public interests of quality, accessibility and affordability of care. How can private equity investment in Dutch medical specialist care be durably successful in light of these obstacles? Durable success is defined as when both the private interests of key actors, as the public interests are furthered. Taking the point of view of a private equity investor, a qualitative exploration was performed, based on an agency cost framework, case studies and interviews with important players.

This project utilizes this good feeling and utilizes the elements feedback can be provided about, the rhythm and the double support phase. By taking a bit slower rhythm the skater is challenged to improve on his technique in order to keep the same speed. When the rhythm is not matched up and the skate is placed too early, the double support phase, feedback will be provided.

Mobility accounts for 20 percent of the CO2 emissions of western countries and hence it is critical to model the mobility pattern and plan the charging infrastructure for the future electric vehicle fleet to achieve the goal of emissions reduction. Electric Mobility is a disruptive technology while it is assumed to support the grid integration of renewable energy generation. The EV charging infrastructure needs to be carefully planned to avoid expensive grid upgrades. The Dutch mobility data is used as reference and the vehicle usage is modeled to estimate the opportunities EVs present for better utilization of the grid capacity. The key areas where charging facilities are to be provided are established. EVs suffer from range limitation compared to the fossil fuel powered vehicles of today due to expensive and heavy batteries. Hence the Quick Charge Requirements are analyzed. In this study Fast Charging and Battery Switching are compared from a grid point of view. The predicted EV charging load is combined with the existing demand on the grid and the micro-grid energy flows are simulated in Matlab to identify the best possible installed renewable energy scenario. The results include how much of each renewable energy source need to be installed to cater the demand with minimal grid exchange. The EV charging loads as well as Battery Switch Stations charging behavior is modified based on the demand on the grid resulting in an increased renewable energy uptake.","Electric Vehicles; Charging Infrastructure; Battery Switching","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Electrical Sustainable Energy (EWI)","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

The construction industry seems to be a late developer. Lately, port authorities have started many initiatives for a more sustainable port. To make ports more sustainable it is worthwhile to improve the construction of infrastructure and building projects: the construction industry is still one of the most polluting industries. Hence, in this thesis the answer is given to the question of how to integrate sustainability as a procurement criterion for infrastructure projects in ports. This is done by developing a procurement model which is aimed at sustainable procurement. Sustainability is important for a port: the amount of total environmental space is decreasing due to stricter policies. To enable further growth of port activities, sustainable management is inevitable. A more sustainable port results in a larger public support for port activities. Furthermore, sustainable management can result in lower costs due to a higher efficiency in the business activities. It is important that the port authority chooses for a contracting form that allows enough space for the contractor to deliver a sustainable construction. This is possible with innovative contracting forms such as D&B contracts in contrast to traditional contracting forms. The right procurement procedure is important too. The model includes criteria and an evaluation method. These criteria are set based on interviews with stakeholders and literature search. These criteria can be categorized in the fields People, Planet and Profit. It is essential to apply Life Cycle Analyses with a preference for quantification of criteria e.g. emission footprints. In practice this is almost impossible due to the complex computations which contractors have to do. That is why the applied model is different from the ideal model, because there is chosen to assess the different measures in a qualitative way on 1) how specific, measurable, acceptable, realistic and time bounded the measures are and on 2) the impact during the whole Life Cycle of the construction. It is important that it is clear for the contractor which criteria are used and what is demanded by the assessment of the measures on sustainability. The alternatives are evaluated with the concordance method. This method is emerged as the most suitable based on applicability, transparency, flexibility, stability, effectiveness and user-friendliness. Beside it evaluates the scoring on weighted criteria (concordance), the concordance method evaluates how low the alternative scores for a good balance between the criteria. This is how this method distinguishes itself in a positive way. The criteria with the evaluation method form the model and it is applied on three different projects for the construction of quay walls in the port of Rotterdam. There was a clear differentiation between the alternatives in the outcomes, in an appraisal was made between sustainable criteria and investment costs.

Delft University of Technology developed a concept with a flexible Leading Edge Inflatable (LEI) kite to generate the energy, which can maneuver at higher altitudes where the power density is much higher and the wind velocity is much more consistent compared to operating altitudes of conventional wind turbines. Using a realistic kite computer simulation the design of the kites can be improved, by better understanding the structural behavior of the kites. The existing kite models are able to reproduce the general behavior of the kite. However, the local effects, such as the actual shape of the structure, wrinkling, stresses and collapse are difficult topics that cannot be examined in the existing models. The models are also not able to use physical inputs and predict the behavior. In this thesis the method that is set to investigate the local effects as well as general structural behavior of the kite is the Finite Element Method (FEM). This is a predictive method, which means that the actual material properties, geometrical and external loads are used as inputs of the model. The FEM solver that is used for this research is called Madymo. This is a general purpose FEM, CFD and multi body solver and used in the automotive industry for crash investigation. The internal pressure of the LEI kite is assumed to be equally distributed inside the struts and the leading edge. In Madymo, the method that is used for this purpose is called the Uniform Pressure (UP) method. A cantilever inflatable cylindrical beam applied with a tip load is the first case study that is discussed. For validation, linear theory and an experiment are compared to a reference case of the FEM model. Also a parameter sensitivity study is performed. The second case study consists of modeling the V2 LEI Mutiny kite, including the bridle system, in FEM. The kite was qualitatively compared to a test with three load cases: gravity, load in the center of the leading edge and a falling mass. The results of the inflatable beam were very promising in the linear and first non linear states, compared to the theory. The model and theory showed a deviant behavior from the experiment, and for collapse, further study is needed. The model of the kite proved to be much stiffer compared to the real kite; however, as a first study it showed to be very promising to model the kite with FEM. Further study is needed for optimizing the model of the bridle system and to model the local effects of the kite, such as the connections between the leading edge and the struts.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Institute Applied Sustainable Science Engineering and Technology","","","",""

This is why it is important for Dutch municipalities to have a method for the assessment of vulnerability. However, vulnerability is not directly measurable. Methods to assess the vulnerability of urban areas to climate change are either qualitative and not informative enough or too costly, specific, or complex, and therefore they are not often applied by municipalities. The Adaptation Tipping Point (ATP) method is a promising method that helps municipalities to determine the urgency of climate change adaptation. It comprises assessment of ATPs: “the point where the magnitude of climate change is such that the current management strategy will no longer meet the objectives” (Kwadijk et al., 2010, p.730). In this thesis, the ATP-method is pre-tested as a method for vulnerability assessment in Rotterdam-Noord and a part of Nijmegen. These case studies, together with past experiences based on literature research, suggest that the method is - in principle - suitable for use as a way of assessing vulnerability by municipalities. It provides useful information in addition to traditional top-down impact and damage assessments. However, more research into improving the feasibility of the ATP-method, for example through estimation of ATPs on the basis of either rules of thumb or expert judgement, is necessary to make the method practically feasible. In addition, the application of the method to the theme of pluvial flooding is a proof of principle; it needs to be applied to the themes of groundwater flooding, drought and heat stress on municipal level as well.","Adaptation Tipping Point; Vulnerability; Municipality; Vulnerability assessment","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-06-25","Technology, Policy and Management","Policy Analysis","","Systems Engineering Policy Analysis and Management","",""

(mentor)","2012","The possibility of an automatic object matching process in combination with a VGI (Volunteered Geographical Information) type of map has been explored in this research. TOP10NL, the topographic map of the Netherlands and OpenStreetMap (OSM), the VGI type of map have been chosen for this purpose. The object matching process in this research became more critical as OSM does not always follow strict rules. Therefore, to overcome the complications special care has been taken into account on the characteristics of these two datasets and have been incorporated in the object matching process. Knowledge from previous studies in this field has been explored and adapted in this study. As TOP10NL and OSM represent completely different type of datamodels, a schema translation had to be done to harmonise them. The average geometric accuracy of TOP10NL is ±2 meter, whereas the quality of OSM is uncertain over locations. Therefore the quality of the OSM dataset over the study areas was also judged before developing the object matching model by some quality measures of geographic maps. Only the quality measures ‘data lineage’, ‘completeness’ and ‘positional accuracy’ were considered in this study. The data lineage shows that both datasets share quite a large number of objects from the same origin. It was found that the road, railway and building objects were quite complete in the OSM dataset over the study areas whereas the water objects were quite incomplete. Because of the reliable data lineage of the OSM data over the Netherlands the positional accuracy of the OSM data were found to be quite good. Considering the geographic location and the importance four areas within the Netherlands were chosen for the experiments. The urbanised Delft and Rotterdam, semi-urbanised Dokkum and the rural part of Echt were selected for the experiments. The common features within both TOP10NL and OSM, which are road, building, water and railway, were considered for the experiments. Two different object matching models were developed for line and polygon objects. For both models the decision rule was developed considering the characteristics of the datasets used in this study. For line matching the decision rule was developed to make the list of best matched pairs by accumulating them in a step by step procedure, whereas a straight forward simple rule has been developed for polygon matching process. These models were verified with the different object class data of the different study areas. The accuracy was high and for more than 90% instances the correct match was found. In the road matching process it was possible to insert the ‘street names’ from the OSM database as an attribute in the road network database of TOP10NL. A number of matching tables have been formed for different cardinality of matched objects which may be useful in the future in an automatic updating process of TOP10NL and OSM.","OpenStreetMap; TOP10NL; Object matching; Quality assessment of OpenStreetMap; VGI map","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","OTB Research Institute for the Built Environment","GIS Technology","","Geomatics","",""

(mentor)","2012","Richards Bay Port, located in the East Coast of South Africa, was built during the 1970s. Two rubble mound breakwaters were constructed to protect the deep-water entrance channel and create a sheltered area for the vessels. Since the completion of these breakwaters in 1976, they have withstood several major storms, including cyclones that have caused significant damage to the dolos armour layers. To restore their functionality, two major reparations were carried out in 1976 and 1996, respectively. In addition, a severe storm that occurred in March 2007 caused relevant damages to the breakwaters of Richards Bay Port. Their damage level was established after the survey conducted in May 2007. This survey concluded that most of the breakwaters sections had an intermediate damage, except from the South Breakwater’s roundhead, which was in failure and it required urgent repairs. Since then provisional measures have been adopted to avoid the spread of damage along the breakwater while new repair works are designed. The main objective of this thesis was to determine the most suitable design for the repair works that should be applied in the roundhead of the South breakwater at Richards Bay Port through a Quasi Three-Dimensional (3D) model testing. This was achieved by reproducing the observed damage at the structure’s roundhead in one of CSIR’s hydraulic laboratory flumes and testing three repair alternatives. These repair alternatives consisted of covering the damaged structure with new armour units. Dolos, Core-Loc and antifer cubes were the armour units used in this research. The wave basin used to conduct this research had a length of 32m, a width of 4m and an available height of 1m. A transitional slope of 1:15 that extends about 4.5m long was built inside the basin to connect the deep water with the shallower water close to Richards Bay Port. Thereafter, the seabed profile corresponding to the South East direction was constructed along the next 20m of the basin. The structure was placed at a distance of 26m from the wavemaker. Graded gravel was used to construct the core, underlayer and toe protection of the roundhead, with a nominal size of 4.2g, 4.8g and 12.2g, respectively. The existing armour layer was built using dolos of 68g and gravel that represented the broken pieces. Above this damaged armour layer, the new armour units were placed with a nominal size of 82g for the dolos, 102g for the Core-Loc and 100g for the antifer cubes. The new armour units were placed trying to replicate the placement conditions at the roundhead. A total of 8 to 9 tests were conducted per armour unit. Five wave conditions were tested with increasing significant wave heights varying from 7cm to 18cm. Two water levels were set up per wave condition (High Water and Low Water). The tested wave conditions were generated with a JONSWAP spectrum and a duration that corresponded to a 1000 waves approaching the structure. Prior to and after each test, pictures were taken from three fixed positions perpendicular to the roundhead. These images were visually compared with the Armour Track software developed by CSIR to identify and quantify the movement of the armour units. This software is based on the superposition technique and it is useful to determine the stability of the structure. For each test, the stability number and the measured damage within the reference area were estimated. Generally the movements of the units occurred along the water line. However for higher wave heights (return periods of 20, 50 and 100 years), the waves overtopped and the damage started to concentrate in an area located between the angles 120 and 150 degrees from the direction of the incident wave, until failing with the overload condition. From these experiments it followed that the Core-Loc repair alternative does not perform as good as the other two options. Although all the repair options have difficulties to achieve the placement requirements at the roundhead, this phenomenon has a larger impact in the Core-Loc armour layer because it consisted of a single layer and any unit displacement resulted in failure of the structure. Therefore repairs should be undertaken more frequently, which leads to larger maintenance costs. The remaining repair options had a similar performance, even though the resistance mechanism of dolos and antifer cubes is different. The first one resists by the interlocking between the units, whereas the antifer cubes resist by their mass. Both are placed as double armour layers and thus some damage is allowed before carrying new repair works. The main difference between them is the actual feasibility to construct the units. The antifer cubes do not have any size restriction. Therefore heavier units can be manufactured without changing the stability of the unit. However, dolos have a size limitation because of its slenderness, and right now dolos heavier than 30-tonne cannot be built. Overall it could be concluded that the repair alternative consisting of antifer cubes is the one that should be applied at this particular location due to its performance and its construction feasibility.","rubble mound breakwater; dolos; antifer cubes; core-loc; coastal repair works; hydraulic stability; damage assessment; Richards Bay port","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2012","The size of modern technological systems has grown significantly and the need for fast, online optimization-based control is a necessity. The complexity of these systems along with the need for increased accuracy in the computed outcome dictate the usage of optimization methods for the computation of the solution. Besides this, new data arrive in real time and in fast rates, that have to be incorporated efficiently in the control policy under design. Exploiting the state-of-the-art, multicore, computing architectures, we can achieve fast online solutions of optimal control problems by splitting a large problem into several smaller ones that can be solved in parallel. In this thesis, we apply an operator splitting technique to a generic convex optimal control problem. The resulting algorithm alternates between a quadratic regulator iteration, and a step in which single-period optimization problems are solved in parallel. Depending on the constraints and non-quadratic objective terms, these single-period problems can be solved extremely quickly, or even analytically in many cases. In the time-invariant case, pre-computing the gain matrices in the quadratic regulator problem gives another speed-up, as well as an algorithm that requires no division, and is therefore suitable for implementation with fixed-point processor. The method is demonstrated on several examples arising in different application areas. Furthermore, we develop an extension to this algorithm so that it can handle more generic optimal control problems and propose a different decomposition approach that achieves an even higher level of parallelization.","System & Control; Operator splitting method","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-07-17","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","","",""

(mentor); van Bussel, G.J.W. (mentor)","2012","This project aims at investigating whether or not unconventional and/or random offshore wind farm layouts lead to better performance of the farm. The determination of each solution is based on the estimated value of the Levelized Production Cost, thus the cost per produced unit of energy (i.e., ecents/kWh). For the purposes of the current research a previously developed Matlab code is used. Due to some restrictions that had been adopted by the original composer of the code, the tool was updated and extended so that it is able to evaluate more random-shaped offshore wind farms. The optimization of an offshore wind farm layout is a multidisciplinary problem, which includes several design variables. In addition various restrictions should be considered if the purpose of setting the problem on a more realistic basis is desired. In this study due to the limited time as well as narrow computational resources, only some of these parameters are considered. Among others they include, the wake effect, electrical losses and a site specific wind rose. A reference offshore wind farm is set, and in detail is investigated, by a deterministic and stochastic approach, the effect of a) different separation distance for each row and column of the wind farm, b) displacement of individual wind turbine(s), c) discard of specific wind turbine(s). These alterations try to achieve the increase of the energy production, either by maximizing the energy output of the wind turbines, due to the decrease of the losses caused by the wake effect, or by minimizing the electrical losses. Moreover, a better layout design could be realized by reducing the costs which refer to the overall project. In addition to the aforementioned listed alterations the case of the Horns Rev offshore wind farm is studied. This case is investigated by the deterministic and stochastic approaches, as the previous cases and the results are compared to the ones included in already published bibliography. Overall, it was shown that the layout design according to the characteristics adopted in this research could lead to a more efficient offshore wind farm. In the majority of the cases it is seen that the decrease of the LPC is mainly a result of the cable cost and losses. When the small test wind farm is considered, it is noticed that the structured approach of unconventional layouts resulted in better values for the LPC in comparison with the more random approach.","Windenergy; layout optimization; offshore wind farm design; levelized production cost optimization; unconventional layout design; random layout design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","","","Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

Luckily more materials are available that offer the desired transparency; transparent plastics might be a promising addition to the world of transparent building. The transparent plastics that are considered most suitable for building applications are Acrylic (PMMA) and polycarbonate (PC). In this research the behaviour of these transparent plastics is analysed and it is investigated whether and how the materials can be used in building structures, to further explore the dream of completely transparent buildings. Transparent plastics show some, for building materials, unusual characteristics, as thermoplastic and visco-elastic behaviour, special production techniques and a very low ratio between Young’s modulus and strength. This requires a different design approach. A case study is performed to get more feeling for the design with thermoplastics. To be able to use the freedom of shape and to explore the limits of the materials an observation tower is designed. An entirely transparent tower, made completely from transparent plastics. The design demonstrates that it is technically possible to design building structures in acrylic and polycarbonate. Transparent plastics offer promising possibilities for building design but still a lot will have to be investigated further before they can really be used for load bearing structures. For instance the development of standard details, the investigation of fire safety, the buckling behaviour of plastics and the long-term behaviour for a design life over 20 years, which is now the limit by a lack of data,. This will be a trajectory of years but other materials have come that long road before. Once the plastics industry recognises the opportunities of investing in this new product market the development of suitable building products, details and optimal material compositions will certainly progress faster. Transparent plastics will probably never become a threatening substitute for standard glazing applications, but they have the ability to become a worthy colleague to glass in the future and an interesting addition to the world of transparent building.","Transparent building; Polycarbonate; Acrylic; Transparent plastic; Structural application; Observation tower","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

Solar panels have a Maximum Power Point (MPP), which, when operated at that point, ensures the maximum available power is obtained from them. In this thesis, different options were explored to solve the problem of tracking the MPP of a solar panel. The focus of this thesis was the software part of tracking the MPP and the goal of this thesis was to implement the most efficient algorithm that works in fast changing levels of irradiance and when thesolar panels are partially shaded. In order to realize this goal, we first did a literature survey to learn about the available algorithms and their respective advantages and disadvantages. Subsequently, we chose the algorithms which had potential and we could realistically implement. Those algorithms were P&O, In ond and their adaptive variants. We simulated those algorithms for their efficiencies in Simulink and implemented them onto a microcontroller. Lastly, we made an experimental setup and measured the algorithms for their efficiencies. The results showed that based on the simulations, the adaptive InCond algorithm is the most efficient algorithm, also in fast changing levels of irradiance. As the simulation did not simulate partially shaded solar panels, we can not make any conclusions about the performance of the different algorithms in that case. In the experimental setup, we verified that the controller and all implemented algorithms worked correctly. However, we were not able to verify all the simulation results, as we could only only test the sudden shading condition. The MPPT was able to reliably track the MPP of a solar panel, depending on what algorithm was used. Some algorithms were more susceptible to noise than others, and eventually we concluded that the adaptive P&O algorithm performed best in the experimental setup, because it is least susceptible to noise and has the advantages of an adaptive algorithm. We did not measure the efficiency of the MPPT. However, based on the simulations and the measured efficiencies of the other subsystems of the MPPT, we are confident that we succeeded in designing and implementing an MPPT algorithm with an efficiency of at least 95%.","MPPT; maximum power point tracking; algorithms; comparative; efficiency","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2012-07-24","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","Electrical Engineering","",""

Currently, there are no control strategies that determine the appropriate step locations to obtain a successful overstep of an obstacle. The objective of this simulation study is to maximize the gap size by determining the step locations. The step strategy is tested on the SLIP-model and a model containing leg damping and push-off. With the means of an optimization, it is found that the optimal step strategy consists out of 3 phases: an adaptive phase from running cycle to the optimal state for the beginning of the leap, the beginning and end of the leap and another adaptive phase to end in a desired end state. For the SLIP-model is found that the maximum gap size is almost independent of the initial velocity of the model and mostly depends of the system’s energy. In order to maximize the gap size, the first and second step location have to be coincident. Furthermore, the damping and push-off proved to be an important factor for the step locations and the obtained gap size, as the first and second step locations do not coincident anymore and the gap size is reduced significantly.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-07-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD","",""

The linear viscoelastic Kelvin, Maxwell and Burgers models were implemented in Matlab by means of The Boltzmann superposition principle. This method was verified using cases which could be represented by analytical solutions. During the extensive sensitivity analysis carried out, it was determined that the ratio n/(f?) influences the shape of the strain response curve in a creep test for all of the models considered in this study. With the knowledge of parameter n/(f?), preliminary conclusion on the result of the test can be drawn. The change of the second modulus is defined by the Kelvin unit which determines the delayed elastic deformations. The time required for these deformations to fully developed is given by 5?2. The changes in the value of the second modulus occurs only before this value is attained. However in linear viscoelastic Burgers model, this change is relatively small . This is because the Maxwell unit in the Burger model has a major influence on the shape of the stress-strain curves. Available literature was used to obtain the input parameters for Burgers model for ice. They were obtained by calibration of the model data with the experimental data presented therein by producing a best fit curve. Since this study utilized a non-linear model to replicate the experimental data, it was also used to compare the results of a linear model with a non-linear model. The region conforming to the delayed elastic deformation was not represented accurately by the linear model. Uniaxial cyclic compression test performed at UNIS was modeled using the linear viscoelastic Burgers model using the scaled down input parameters obtained through calibration with fresh ice creep test to enable their application to this case. The viscoelastic model was unable to completely agree with the findings from the test carried out at UNIS.","linear viscoelastic model; ice; dynamic ice action; cyclic loading","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM)","",""

One way to improve the performance is to maximize the power output of the solar panels on top of the car. Maximizing the power output can be done with a 'Maximum Power Point Tracker'. The aim of this thesis was to develop an improved, distributed 'Maximum Power Point Tracking'-system which optimizes the power efficiency of the solar panel array of the Nuna 6 solar racing vehicle. To prove that the proposed distributed topology is more power effificient when compared to a central tracking topology, simulations of the total Nuna 6 electrical system were performed. Based on the simulation results, together with Nuna 6 specifications, a DC-DC boost converter was designed. Validation of the design was done by simulation with the Nuna 6 model. After validation, a breadboard proof-of-concept was built. The proof-of-concept was successfully tested and compared with earlier simulations. The system design process was evaluated and recommendations for further study and future real-life implementations were formulated. The simulation results prove that the proposed distributed tracking system is as much as 40% more efficient in large insolation differences and 10% in small insolation differences. The system excels when insolation differs, however it is slightly less efficient when used with equal insolation on every panel. The developed proof of concept demonstrates a functioning maximum power point tracker and DC-DC boost converter. The power efficiency of the boost converter was found to be between 95:8% and 98:5%, with an efficiency of 97:1% for the rated input power of 200W.","MPPT; Nuna; Power Point tracking; Boost converter; distributed","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2012-07-21","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Sustainable Energy","","Electrical Engineering","",""

The platform acts as a pivot for the brand outings. It inhibits background information on the company’s context. The context consists of the surroundings, the products, the people and the company itself. Each of these pillars are elaborately portrayed in the platform. The platform expresses both the direct and short-term excitement which consumers crave, but also the more long-term subconscious need for brands they can trust and are authentic. Exploring and discovering the brand context As such, the platform provides the opportunity for potential retailers and consumers to explore the brand and its context in full detail. This exploration will lead to the visitor being more engaged in the experience. This explorative brand experience conveys a feeling of discovery and control at the visitor’s side and that will lead to a more genuine and long-term relationship between the brand and the stakeholder. Project Goals The project had three goals: Firstly, the brand identity needed to be defined. Secondly, the perceived brand image needed to be determined. Thirdly these two needed to be brought together. ?By interviewing the brand owners and analysing the full set of existing brand touchpoints a detailed brand identity could be defined. This well-defined brand identity was then assessed by asking consumers and retailers to shed their light on the brand and a selection of five competitors. They were asked to answer questions regarding brand associations, quality and affordability. Factor analysis has led to the conclusion that brand is communication ‘direct excitement’, but not yet ‘genuinely trustworthy’. Trigger A flipbook is designed, which functions as a trigger for people to access the online platform. The cards in the flipbook can also be ripped out, so the experience can be shared with peers.

Secondly it focuses on modeling the buoy behavior and calculation algorithms for determining the moment of slack. A series of GPS measurements are conducted to test the accuracy and precision of candidate receivers. For the hardware a Waspmote-board and Meshlium router are chosen. Together they provide a complete solution for the GPS system, including GPS receiver. The solution combines adaptability with low costs. The module is made waterproof and solar powered. A buoy model is made with which data sets can be simulated to test the accuracy of the calculation algorithms. The sensitivity tests of the algorithms are performed with a Monte Carlo model. Clear differences in performance between high-end and common receivers are observed. EGNOS improves only the performance of the high-end receiver. The buoys have different behaviour, not all buoys can be modeled the same. Also a bias of up to 10 minutes is found for the calculation algorithms. In terms of sensitivity of the methods, there is a critical standard deviation for the GPS receiver for which the methods become unstable.With all tested GPS receivers the moment of tidal slack can be calculated with a deviation up to 15 minutes.

(mentor); Chang, Z.Y. (mentor)","2012","The Electronic Instrumentation Lab at Delft University of Technology desired to have a demonstrator for low-power temperature and humidity sensors they developed, in the form of a wireless sensor node. This thesis presents the design of the energy management system of this node. The primary design goal was to allow the sensor systems to run for as long as possible, at least a year, without any kind of service or human intervention, doing so in indoor lighting conditions. Using the state of the art of such energy systems in sensor nodes, a concept consisting of energy storage combined with energy conditioning was generated. A single cell lithium-ion polymer battery and an ultra low quiescent current linear voltage regulator (the Texas Instruments TPS78233) were used to implement this concept. Switching voltage regulators with buck and buck-boost topologies were also considered, as well as combinations of linear and switching voltage regulators, but these ultimately turned out to be highly inefficient when the sensor is idle and the output current is in the order of microamperes. The lithium-ion polymer battery chemistry was chosen because it is widely available in high capacities, it has a relatively low self-discharge current and it can be charged. As the ultimate goal of this design was to let the sensor systems run for as long as possible, and not just a year, energy harvesting techniques were also researched. It was found that amorphous solar cells were the best option for this design, as this was the best commercially available technology for harvesting energy at low light levels at the time. A promising new solar cell technology for this purpose is the dye-sensitized solar cell, however, these were only available as do-it-yourself kits at the time, and project time constraints withheld the usage of this technology because of that. Energy harvesting based on radio-frequency electromagnetic waves was also considered, but it was found that this technology did not provide enough power within the size and budget constraints. As such, a secondary concept was generated, using a 100x50 mm amorphous solar panel by Sanyo Energy and a lithium-ion charger circuit based on the Maxim MAX17710. The charging circuit consists primarily of a largely integrated switching voltage regulator using the boost topology. Both of these systems were implemented on a single circuit board along with the other sensor systems, designed such that it was possible to switch between the two energy systems easily. When this circuit board was completed, measurements were done to determine the average output current of the charger under office light conditions. When it is assumed that these conditions last for about ten hours per day, the average current output was found to be approximately 45 ?A. Furthermore, the average supply current for the sensor was found to be 53.4 ?A. Using these numbers, the minimum capacity for the battery to run the system for a year was determined to be 1300 mAh when no harvesting system is used, and 213 mAh when the solar panel is used.","energy management; wireless; autonomous; sensor node","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Engineering","","Electronic Instrumentation Laboratory","",""

Tagged Tracing on the other hand, operated correctly on systems employing both asynchronous and synchronous communication with an overhead of 43 percent. We did not evaluate the accuracy of Recognized Tracing as the accuracy is dependent on the implementation of the dynamic system. Recognized Tracing presented an overhead of 36 percent. We developed a dashboard which allows storing and loading of requests and traces, such that the reconstructed traces could be evaluated for correctness.

However, these devices are highly susceptible to co-channel interference (CCI). Therefore, interference cancellation (IC) techniques for ULP non-coherent OOK receivers are investigated in this thesis. Various IC techniques are discussed in literature. However, the non-coherent OOK receiver architecture calls for the design of new low complexity IC techniques. The main constraint of the system is imposed by the analog front end that uses a simple square law detector to down-convert the RF signals to baseband and there is also only single radio frequency (RF) chain. The challenge is to mitigate CCI under these constraints and improve the detection performance. The non-coherent detection of OOK signals requires the knowledge of the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the incoming signal. Therefore, SNR estimation plays an important role in non-coherent OOK receivers. Thus the scope of this thesis is twofold. Firstly, the SNR estimation and non-coherent detection techniques are proposed for OOK signals. Secondly, the interference mitigation techniques are proposed for the case of continuous wave (CW) CCI and OOK modulated interferers. The problems of the proposed techniques for the case of M-ary phase shift keying (MPSK) modulated interferers are also investigated. Finally, the implementation of the SNR estimation techniques on real time hardware platform is discussed.","On-off keying; low power; non-coherent; SNR estimation; Interference mitigation; Co-channel interference","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","Telecommunications","",""

(mentor)","2012","This thesis is concerned with the notion of Darwinism and its application outside of its traditional biological realm, to that of economics. The mechanism of natural selection is based on the co-­? existence of variational, hereditary and selective processes within a system (Cordes 2006). This context-­?independent description of natural selection has been coined ‘Universal Darwinism’, the extent and practical relevance of which is not thoroughly understood. This thesis has aimed to contribute to the understanding of this practical relevance by applying a framework of Universal Darwinism to a specific economic context, that of the Dutch horticulture sector. The innovation and adaptive complexity in this industry makes it highly suitable to respond to the notions brought forth by Universal Darwinism. The competitiveness of the Dutch horticulture sector is under pressure and ways are sought to formulate policies to improve it. By identifying national legislative bodies as the primary stakeholder, the practical relevance of Universal Darwinism is derived from its role in illuminating a deeper understanding of the drivers of economic change and its interplay with the competitiveness of the sector so as to facilitate the formulation of more effective policies. Through an agent-­?based simulation study that is thoroughly grounded in a Darwinistic ontology, answers are sought to these questions. The primary research question of this thesis has been formulated as: “How can the application of Universal Darwinism help inform policy formulation to improve the competitive position of growers in the Dutch Tomato Sector?” This research question covers a lot of ground and was identified as being the consolidation of three different themes: the Framework of Universal Darwinism, Competitiveness within the Dutch Tomato Sector and Sectoral Policy Formulation. On the one hand, sufficient insight into the framework of Universal Darwinism was required to understand how to apply it to the economy. On the other hand, the drivers of competitiveness for growers within the Dutch Tomato Sector were to be understood. Lastly, these two themes were to be combined within a sectoral policy formulation directed to improving the competitiveness of growers. Therefore, a deconstruction into three separate research questions was found to be appropriate. These were formulated as: “What is the structure of and what are the core drivers of competitiveness within the Dutch Tomato Sector?” (1), “How can a framework of Universal Darwinism be applied within the context of the Dutch Tomato Sector Economy?” (2) and “How do Sectoral policies, aiming to improve the competitiveness of the Dutch Tomato sector, perform and how does Universal Darwinism help interpret the insights achieved and shed light on policy formulation?” (3). In the methodological discussion, it was shown that the framework of Universal Darwinism showed considerable overlap with the ontological commitments of evolutionary economics. This allowed for a set of generalized conditions for evolutions could be identified that allowed for the transplantation of Darwinism to the economic realm. In this transplantation, three assumptions were made with respect to two themes. Firstly, ongoing difficulties exist around the appropriate ‘Unit of Evolution’ within economics. This thesis assumed as a unit of evolution a description of ‘company strategy’. Although many other definitions exist, this definition allows for an intuitive bridge between the behavior and selection of the growers in the model. Secondly, two assumptions had to be made with respect to the ‘Variability of the Selective Landscape’. If the environment of a company is too variable, both the description of evolution and the relevance of any policies derived from it would carry little meaning. These assumptions, together with the data requirements necessary for the model, led to a set of barriers to the practical relevance of Universal Darwinism within economics were constructed. For the current study goals, it was found that Agent-­?based modeling is the appropriate methodology because it is able to build a model of the economy on Darwinistic foundations. In discussing ontology of an evolutionary agent-­?based modeling, it was found that the ‘production of agent instructions’ was found to be the key link that distinguishes economic evolution from mere economic change in the economy. The model hypothesis were formulated as: “It is feasible to build an agent-­?based 4 model within the framework of Universal Darwinism (thereby distinguishing economic change from economic evolution)” (1), “The model can reproduce the stylized facts observed in the Dutch Tomato Sector” (2) and “The model is able to give insights into the relationship between policy formulation and the competitive position of Dutch Tomato Growers” These model hypotheses were chosen in order to collectively help reflect on both the primary research question, as well as the barriers to the practical relevance of Universal Darwinism within the field of economics as a whole. An extensive empirical investigation subsequently looked at the empirical foundations of the model by investigating the structure and core drivers of competitiveness within the Greenhouse horticulture Sector. The first research question was answered in the form of five different Stylized Facts’ of this particular economy and an overview of threats and opportunities / policy measures available to enhance the competitiveness of the Dutch Tomato grower. The stylized facts related to differences in the particular production systems used within this economy, an observed trend of increasing concentration and scale in the market, a positive relationship between performance volatility and company size, the particular price and volume contracting behavior observed between growers and retailers and the importance of company innovation and knowledge exchange within the sector. In the model conceptualization phase, a connection was sought between the economic characteristics of the sector (structure and stylized facts) and the ontological foundations of an evolutionary agent-­?based model. In addition to formulating model assumptions that set the ground for the model boundaries, the model objective and the concept of grower competitiveness were identified. Grower competitiveness was defined through the notion of the ‘selection of individual tomato growers’ in the model. In this definition, competitive Tomato growers stay ‘alive’ or ‘economically viable’ while uncompetitive Tomato growers go bankrupt or ‘die’ in the model. As such, the model objective was identified as giving insights into the relationship between policy formulation and the selection of individual Tomato growers. A set of 10 different model scenarios were constructed to help illuminate the relationship between policy formulation and the selection of individual Tomato growers. While some of these scenarios rested primarily on the notion of economic change, others included strong elements of economic evolution, thereby giving insights into the role of evolution in the economy. The base case model simulation simulated the stylized facts in the economy well and formed the reference model for subsequent model scenario comparisons. From these comparisons, conclusions were drawn. It was found that innovation stimulation for northern markets for the benefit of competitiveness can only be (initially) effective if the innovation is of such a type or sufficient measures are taken to limit or delay the transplant ability of innovation to southern regions of production while maintaining diffusion in the northern region. The effects of knowledge diffusion were very strong in the model, creating both opportunities and risks for the competitiveness of the northern grower. Further more, Resource and Credit support were found to be an effective policy mechanism to help improve the competitive position of Northern growers. Expansion stimulation , on the other hand, seemed to require very prudent investment and expansionary grower strategies to be effective. Northern growers appeared to do well in case the retailers were more selective in their pricing demands from the growers, indicating the power of innovation as a way of maintain close ties with retail partners. The simulation results led to two pieces of advice for stakeholders in the greenhouse horticulture sector: “Investigate the potential benefits of future sectoral innovation (both incremental in terms of production efficiency gains as well as radical in the form of new market creation). If there seems to be limited innovation possible in the sector, the competitiveness of Dutch Tomato growers runs a serious risk of declining in coming years (or be very costly to maintain) and competition with 5 southern growers is to be avoided using other means (such as assuring other markets than purely northern European ones).” Determine the ease of knowledge diffusion in the sector. The diffusion of knowledge regarding production efficiency depends on the barriers to transplantation that exist either intrinsically in the type of knowledge that is shared or the difficulty of incorporating such knowledge into effective business operations or extrinsically in the ease of information flow between different companies. In terms of study limitations, several barriers and model assumptions and limitations were identified. The most important two barriers were data availability and the environmental variability of an economic system. In terms of the first, several model assumptions and limitations had to be made with respect to different model components due to lack of data availability (for example in how companies change their reactive behavior towards their economic environment over time). In terms of the second, it was observed that data requirements increase as we are forced to take processes into account that are relevant or shorter-­?time-­?scales. As such, a balance needs to be found between the time scale of the model (from minutes to years to centuries), the data availability for the model (the shorter the time-­?scales to be included, the more data required) and the validation of the model (leaving out too many descriptions of reality will limit the model validation). In the conclusions, the study findings were decontextualized from the particular economic context of this study and transplanted upon the research problem initially identified: “What is the practical relevance of US in economics?” Three practically relevant contributions of this a cross-­?disciplinary bridge were identified: UD helps economists to “structure economic phenomena into a coherent system of interaction” (1), “Identify the scope and limitations of a model, thereby illuminating policy generalizability (2) and “Allow for cross-­?discipline system comparison, thereby utilizing economic of scope within the realm of science” (3).","Universal Darwinism","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-06-19","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy & Industry","","Engineering, Policy & Management","",""

(mentor); Zijlstra, H. (mentor); Pasterkamp, S. (mentor); Van der Sluis, A. (mentor)","2012","Currently there are a lot of vacant buildings available. To reuse these buildings, which may or may not have monumental status, the project has to be financially feasible. If a building has good potentials to be reused, the capacity of the structure and the possibilities of adapting the structures needs to be examined to make a project possible This study focuses on how the structural design influence the redesigning for reuse of a monument. As a design case the Flour factory in Leiden has been selected. The old flour factory ‘de Sleutels’, located at the corner of the Oosterkerkstraat and the canal the Zijlsingel in Leiden is a complex of nine different buildings with each different characteristics. The architect Peter Zumthor designed a plan on how to reuse the existing buildings and which interventions should be done to realize this. The problem definition is the following: How can the interventions, as proposed by Peter Zumthor and partner, be integrated in the current structures of the former flour factory ‘meelfabriek de Sleutels’ in Leiden, so that sound safe structures, set out in the Dutch Building Regulations and in the Eurocode-regulations, are created and which adjustments and additions should be made to realize this goal? The methodology generated is applied on this project. First as much as possible data was searched for. This data was, when possible, compared to inspections on the buildings on site to get a realistic overview of the characteristics of the building. Where data was missing assumptions were made (in reality it is recommended to find the missing data by inspections on site) or conclusions were drawn from visible inspections. With this overview it was possible to detect the failures and possibilities of the structures of the buildings. The failures and possibilities resulted in different solutions to realize the proposed architectural interventions in the existing structures. A selection of the best solution was done by testing them on the set preconditions (as set in the architectural analysis, in reality this is done by client, architect, state or municipality and other stakeholders involved). The solution that fits best is selected to develop the final structural design. To adapt the Boiler House to an workshop building the foundation capacity has to be examined further and the possibility to couple the building in South direction to the cleaning building to provide stability. If it is possible the steel should be examined on its yielding strength and a check has to be done if the masonry is still intact and if the bond between steel skeleton and concrete floors still is present, otherwise anchors could be used to solve this problem. To adapt the silos built in 1904 to a hotel the foundation should be reinforced, because it has now only a rest-life of 25 years. The cracks in the roof should be repaired to prevent (further) carbonation and corroding of the steel. To adapt the Mill to an atelier building, sloping columns are added to transfer the overloading forces to the outer dies, with extra capacity, to make the foundation safe. Braces are added in the outer portals and two inner portals to take care of the displacement. The structure should be cleaned from corrosion and protected; a sprinkler installation should diminish the temperature of the structure to provide fire safety. To adapt the Flour Warehouse to a fitness building a steel top is realised with steel-plate concrete floors to make a light structure, to create a safe foundation. Outriggers are placed in the top to take care of the displacement. Where reinforcement is visible the concrete should be repaired to prevent (further) carbonation and corroding of the steel. To adapt the silos built in ’37, ’38 and ’55 to a hotel the concrete has to be repaired where reinforcement is visible to prevent (further) carbonation and corroding of the steel. To adapt the cleaning building to a design office the foundation capacity has to be examined further and the concrete has to be repaired where reinforcement is visible to prevent (further) carbonation and corroding of the steel. To adapt the extension of the Mill to apartments the structure should be cleaned from corrosion and protected. The displacement should be diminished by adding braces or a core. To adapt the Tower of Silos into design and fashion shops the concrete has to be repaired where reinforcement is visible to prevent (further) carbonation and corroding of the steel. The final conclusion: The interventions and additions of the structures of The Mill and the Flour Warehouse are sound safe structures verified according to the Dutch Building Regulations and the Eurocode-regulations. The capacity of the existing structures is used at full extend and simple solutions make additions or adaptions possible. The monumental values are kept intact and the preconditions as set according to the vision of the architect and the client wishes are nearly achieved. Recommendations When an existing structure is adapted to the needs of a renovation project the following recommendations can be done:  Use the methodology as generated in this thesis, based on the ABCD method. When data is thoroughly searched and compared with measurements from inspections on the structures it is possible to find failures and possibilities, which give a good base for the redesign.  When there is a need for adapting the structure search for the extra capacity of a structure and make a solution with this capacity.  From this thesis it appears that buildings build until at least 1947 were not designed on stability and or horizontal displacement, consider this when making a redesign for a structure of the same period.","renovation; structural design; buildings 1900-1960; factory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Chang, Z.Y. (mentor)","2012","The required product is a wireless indoor climate sensor. It is an autonomous sensor that transmits several parameters concerning its environment wirelessly. The product will be used to demonstrate a number of energy efficient sensors. The electronic instrumentation department at Delft University of Technology developed these sensors in association with NXP. Since the desire to communicate information wirelessly in an energy efficient way existed, several options could be explored. First a wireless protocol had to be chosen. Thereafter, a hardware solution had to be found in order to implement the chosen protocol. Lastly, the information had to be displayed on a computer screen. This thesis investigates six wireless protocols that can transmit information. The investigated protocols are Bluetooth, ZigBee, Rubee, UWB, Z-Wave and the well known Wi-Fi. In order to choose the right option, several criteria were set up. First of all, the system had to be entirely wireless. Therefore, the power consumption had to be as low as possible. Moreover, the program of requirements stated that the transmission distance had to be at least five meters. After searching for suitable wireless protocols for this assignment, the hardware had to be chosen. The SX1212, XBEE series II, ATmega128RFA1 and CC430xxxx were found as potential solutions. The same criteria that were subjected to the wireless protocols were applied to these hardware solutions as well. Furthermore, the ease of hardware implementation was added as well as the ease of software implementation. Additionally, the knowledge available at EEMCS about these solutions was appended to the criteria. The measurements had to be displayed after setting up the wireless communication. The measurements could be displayed on a website, an app or a computer screen. The measurements could have been stored locally as well as externally. Safety is one of the criteria used to choose a display solution. This was why locally storing the measurements was preferred. However, the recent popularity for apps was a criterion for choosing the method of displaying the information as well. The ZigBee solution was chosen, because it was most suited for this project. Rubee, UWB and Wi-Fi were abandoned, because those protocols do not meet the specifications. ZigBee uses less power than Z-Wave and therefore, is chosen above Z-Wave. The fact that former researchers encountered problems while setting up a connection between two Z-Wave modules was added to the argumentation. Bluetooth can have either a short range or a high outputpower to transmit. Since the “short range” was considered too short, Bluetooth was abandoned as well. Moreover, ZigBee had been developed to transmit a low amount of data in a low power consuming way. Hardware had to be chosen after finding a suitable protocol. The XBEE series II was chosen from the hardware solutions. A low amount of data had to be sent and the XBEE series II was the least power consuming of these solutions while sending a low amount of data. Moreover, the XBEE series II was the easiest to implement. There were several options to display the received data. Since the data had to be received by a computer, displaying it on a computer screen was chosen. The data was displayed in the console in which the program was written. Moreover, an internet connection is not mandatory. However, it was chosen to develop an app as well. This is because an app can be viewed anywhere at any time. The current running through the system was measured in order to check if the requirements were met. The system appeared to have an average current consumption of 50.8?A. This consumption would be sufficient for the system to run autonomously for a year. Furthermore, it was necessary to check if the system was able to transmit over at least 5 meters, since the program of requirements stated this demand. The measurements showed that the system was able to transmit over 40 meters, which was enough.","sensor; wireless; communication; ultra low power; indoor","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2012-07-18","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electronic Instumentation Laboratory","","Elektrotechniek","",""

For the purpose of this Master thesis the hawkmoth was used as a starting point and source of inspiration. First and foremost the hawkmoth is a fairly large insect, with a wingspan of roughly 10 cm. The larger scale of the insect will translate to an easier design in terms of the scalability of structural and electronic components. Furthermore, the hawkmoth displays consistent and simple kinematics. The complex aerodynamics are not fully understood, it is still unclear how we can design flapping kinematics that will lead to an optimum performance with respect to maneuverability, speed, and energy efficiency and are feasible to manufacture. The problem is tackled through an experimental campaign in a water channel. The kinematics investigated are two pitch-plunge motions based on the hawkmoth and a third purely sinusoidal motion. The Reynolds number is 4, 800 and the reduced frequency is 0.38, similar to the hawkmoth. The kinematics are subjected to force data acquisition, flow visualization, and particle image velocimetry. The results are compared to flapping experiments and calculations using computational fluid dynamics and an unsteady vortex model. The results show that the effect of the elevation angle is very important when looking at the details of the force development. A strong correlation between the strength of the leading and trailing edge vortex and the forces was found. The force data acquired during the experiments compares well to the to the CFD calculations. The calculated force coefficients are between 82 and 87% of the magnitude measured during the experiments. The bias towards a lower value can be explained partially by the assumptions of the CFD model and the presence of blockage effects during the experiments. Comparison with the unsteady aerodynamic vortex model suggests that the dominant force generating mechanisms are the leading and trailing edge vortices. The impact of spanwise flow and tip vortices on the overall magnitude of the forces is not as significant. The comparison of pitch-plunge experiments with flapping experiments showed a good agreement as well. The force coefficients measured during flapping are about 50% smaller compared to the pitch-plunging case. The difference is attributed due to the fundamental difference in kinematics and the definition of the reference velocity. The agreement of the shape of the time history of the forces suggests that the underlying flow topology is analogues in both cases. It remains to be evaluated if the spanwise flow component is also present and whether the evolution of the tip vortices is comparable. The application of advanced and delayed rotation proved to have dramatic effects on the force generation. Delayed rotation is detrimental to the force production, thrust produced was 60% less compared to the baseline cases. Advanced rotation yields an increase in thrust of 34 to 47% with a reduction of up to 20% in efficiency. The flow topology was remarkably similar to the baseline kinematics with a slight shift in phase. Both the application of advanced and delayed rotation provides a large potential in maneuverability. An increase in reduced frequency to a value of 0.7 lead to an increase in the thrust produced. A qualitative study of the flow topology showed that the vortical structures were similar to the baseline cases. A small decrease in efficiency was measured for the bio-inspired cases and a small increase for the harmonic motion. It might thus be favorable for roboflyers to flap at higher reduced frequencies.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & Propulsion","","","",""

(mentor)","2012","Met behulp van een MRI-scanner kan er bij een patiënt een afbeelding gemaakt worden van de binnenkant van het lichaam zonder dat deze opengemaakt hoeft te worden. Deze afbeeldingen worden gemaakt om een diagnose te stellen. De arts kan beter zien wat er aan de hand is met de patiënt als de resolutie van de afbeelding verbetert. De resolutie kan verbeterd worden door een MRI scanner te kiezen met een hogere magnetische veldsterkte. Een ander aspect dat meespeelt hoe goed de arts kan zien wat er aan de hand is, is de scherpte van de afbeelding. Deze wordt mede bepaald door hoe nauwkeurig de hartslag kan worden gemeten, want met behulp van de hartslag kan op dezelfde fase in de hartcyclus een scan worden gemaakt. Door verschillende scans die op hetzelfde moment in de cyclus zijn genomen over elkaar te leggen wordt het contrast beter. Uit een Electrocardiogram (ECG) kunnen vaste punten in de hartcyclus worden gedetecteerd. Deze hartmeting wordt echter ernstig verstoord in een MRI-scanner door het statische magnetische veld. Hierdoor worden op verkeerde momenten in de hartcyclus een scan gemaakt. Dit zorgt voor minder scherpe afbeeldingen. Dit is een probleem voor ziekenhuizen met een 7 T scanner zoals het LUMC. Om het probleem op te lossen wordt een nieuwe draadloze sensor ontwikkeld die de hartslag kan meten. De ontwikkeling van de sensor is opgedeeld in drie onderdelen:  Acquisitie van het biomedisch signaal waarop cardiac triggering kan plaatsvinden;  Omzetting van het analoge sensorsignaal in een digitaal signaal en onderdrukken van de ruis;  Transmissie van het digitale signaal vanaf de sensor op de patient in de MRI-scanner naar een computer en detectie van het triggersignaal. Drie verschillende teams werken elk aan hun eigen onderdeel. In deze thesis is onderzocht wat de beste methode is om draadloos een sensorsignaal te versturen in een MRI-scanneromgeving. Het sterke magneetveld en de RF golven op 298 MHz vormen de grootste storingsbronnen. Er wordt gekozen voor een draadloos systeem omdat een bedraad systeem in een MRI-omgeving kan leiden tot ernstige brandwonden. Daarnaast heeft de opdrachtgever kenbaar gemaakt een draadloos systeem te prefereren zodat de sensormodule een grote mobiliteit heeft. De volgende vormen van draadloze communicatie zijn onderzocht: optische communicatie, akoestische communicatie en radiofrequente communicatie. Op basis van de eigenschappen van deze technieken is een keuze gemaakt voor de gebruikte communicatie. Optische communicatie op basis van infrarood is voor dit doel niet geschikt omdat er een direct zicht nodig is. Dit is een probleem omdat de communicatielink verbroken zou kunnen worden indien de patiënt beweegt. Een ander nadeel is dat de maximale afstand die gegarandeerd wordt slechts 1 meter is. Voor afstanden van meer dan 3 meter is akoestische communicatie niet geschikt, omdat de betrouwbaarheid van de verbinding erg slecht wordt. Daarnaast bleek verder dat de datasnelheid veel te laag was. Voor digitale radiofrequente communicatie zijn een aantal protocollen beschikbaar. Deze verschillen voornamelijk in maximale datasnelheid, afstand en vermogen. Bluetooth en ZigBee zijn het best geschikt voor het product, waarbij Bluetooth een hogere datasnelheid heeft en ZigBee minder energie verbruikt. Aangezien de datasnelheid van ZigBee voldoende is om meerdere signalen te zenden en te ontvangen wordt ZigBee geselecteerd. De MRF24J40MA, een ZigBee module, is uiteindelijk gekozen, omdat deze als enige een minimale hoeveelheid ferromagnetische materialen bevat en op korte termijn leverbaar is. Er worden ZigBee transceivers gebruikt omdat er op een bidirectionele manier moet worden gecommuniceerd. Eén ZigBee transceiver wordt aangesloten op een computer zodat deze de hartslag en de temperatuur kan weergeven. Een microcontroller zorgt voor de interface tussen de transceiver en de pc. De andere microcontroller aan de kant van de sensor detecteert de belangrijkste harttoon uit het akoestische hartsignaal en biedt aan de uitgang een puls aan naar de MRI-scanner. Voor het prototype is deze uitgang aangesloten op een Light-emitting diode(LED). Voor het prototype wordt er gebruik gemaakt van een eerder opgenomen akoestisch signaal. Dit signaal duurt in totaal 6 seconden en wordt continu herhaald. Er is ook een Graphical User Interface (GUI) gemaakt. Deze interface biedt een medicus de mogelijkheid om snel en duidelijk te zien wat de hartslag en de temperatuur van de patiënt is. In de GUI wordt weergegeven waar er wordt getriggerd in het akoestische hartsignaal. De GUI is gemaakt met MATLAB aangezien dit het minste tijd zou kosten en de auteurs de meeste ervaring hadden met deze programmeertaal. Helaas is het niet gelukt om het transmissie gedeelte aan te sluiten op de producten van de andere teams. Ook zijn er nog geen testen gedaan in de MRI-scanner. Het is waarschijnlijk dat het transmissiesysteem goed zal functioneren in de MRI-scanner, aangezien de ZigBee modules zeer weinig ferromagnetische materialen bevatten. Dit kan echter pas getest worden als het hele systeem op elkaar is aangesloten.","","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2012-07-04","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Telecommunications","","","",""

This pushed for the development of a statically balanced frequency up-converter, that can integrate an energy harvester capable of coping with low frequencies vibrations of broadband nature. On the static balancing ground, a new mechanism is proposed, with the balancing of the folded suspension, a traditional mechanism of precision engineering.

(mentor)","2012","For this project, Environment Mapping & Surveying (EMS) from South Africa has provided two pressure meters for wave measuring. These pressure meters give a value for the pressure, which must be converted to pressure and after that to a Rayleigh distribution and a wave spectrum. Therefore is the purpose of this report to test the pressure meter and to convert the outcomes of the pressure meter to wave heights, resulting in a Rayleigh distribution and a wave spectrum. At first, there were calibration tests in still water to measure the hydrostatic pressure. The pressure meter was lowered in the water, with some stops, hanging still. At that moment the water depth could be found in the graph of the measured values in the time, so the relation between the water depth and the measured values is found. With that relation it is possible to find the relation between the measured values and the real pressure. After this, the verification tests are done. These tests are done in the Delta Flume of Deltares, during the Bardex II project. The pressure meter was lowered into the flume, to measure the waves that were made for the Bardex II project. After this, the outcomes were converted by three Matlab-scripts into a Rayleigh distribution, a wave spectrum and some characteristic values, like Hs and Hm0. These figures and the values are compared to the measurements of Deltares to find the accuracy of the pressure meter. The comparison with the measurements of Deltares shows that the pressure meter has an accuracy of five percent. The most important characteristic values are even more accurate, up to one or two percent. The figures of the Rayleigh distribution and the wave spectrum are comparable to the figures of Deltares. These outcomes make the pressure meter a quite accurate instrument to measure waves. Due to the fact that this instrument is inexpensive in comparison to other wave meters, it is a very usable instrument for fieldwork or low-budget projects.","wave height; wave measurements","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

Deze langsdammen worden, net als bij kribben, geplaatst om de vaarweg op zijn plaats te houden en om de vaarweg te versmallen bij laagwater, zodat de beperkingen op de maximale vaardiepte worden beperkt. Verder heeft een langsdam, in tegenstelling tot kribben, als gevolg dat de weerstand wordt verlaagd en het stroomvoerend oppervlak (het gedeelte van de rivier dat water afvoert) wordt vergroot en daardoor wordt de waterstand verlaagd. Aan de hand van het model SOBEK is bepaald wat het maximale regelbereik van deze langsdammen is bij een toepassingslengte van 0 tot 45 km. Het regelbereik varieert, afhankelijk van de diepte van de oevergeul tussen 0 en 2 m, tussen de 100 - 233 en de 144 - 328 m3/s voor de scenario's Hoge afvoer & storm en Piekafvoer.

Dit gaat gepaard met een waterstandsdaling bij de Pannerdensche Kop van 19 cm in het scenario Hoge afvoer & storm en van 24 cm in het scenario Piekafvoer. Gevolg van deze maatregel is wel dat een waterstandsverhoging na 45 km bij Tiel optreedt van 14 cm respectievelijk 16 cm optreedt in het scenario Hoge afvoer & storm en Piekafvoer. Verder is er geconstateerd dat de maatregel Langsdammen geen negatieve gevolgen heeft voor de laagwaterscenario’s.","regelbereik; langsdammen; Waal; Pannerdensche Kop; longitudinal dams; discharge distribution","nl","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","51.869511, 6.039827"

(mentor); Verwaal, M. (mentor)","2012","This is my thesis for the graduation project of the master program Integrated Product Design at the University of Technology Delft. It describes the development of an LED lighting system designed for Lughes. The goal (of this project) is to develop a LED lighting system suitable for the use in offices and homes. Importantly, based on the available machinery of the client, the main production method will be waterjet cutting. Part 1: Analysis During the analysis phase, the waterjet cutting technique, the LED technology and what is already on the market in the area of LED lighting in homes and offi ces was investigated. Research is done to explore what the target group wishes are. This investigation has led to the design brief and a bill of requirements. The conclusion of this phase is that is has to be a hanging LED lighting that is suitable for the use in offices as well as in dining rooms. The design has to look luxurious. The purchasing price will be at the upper end of the market. A LED lighting system having a purchasing price at the upper endof the market, is for the target group not a problem. The lighting system has to look luxurious and uses the newest technology the purchasing price will be high. Therefore the buyer group will be not very big and the batch size will be small. This corresponds well with the production method waterjet cutting. This product will be made for the high end market. Part 2: Idea generation In this phase eleven lighting ideas were drawn. They were drawn with the output of the analysis phase in mind. The eleven idea’s were evaluated and compared. Four were chosen for further development into concepts, based on the following objectives:  The design fits in offices as well as in dining rooms.  The main production method has to be 2D waterjet cutting.  The lighting is adjustable by the user.  The design has an exclusive character.  The lighting is more functional then a ‘common’ hanging light (a hanging light that consist of fi xed light tubes).  The design looks good when the light is switched off.  The design is easy to clean. Also the preferences of Hiroshi and Lughes were taken into account when these decisions were made. Part 3: Conceptualization The four concepts were elaborated more into detail. One was chosen to develop into a final LED lighting design, based on the following objectives:  The main production method has to be 2D waterjet cutting and making use of the small glass craftsmanship companies is an option,  The purchasing price will be at the upper end of the lighting market (± 950 euro’s per lamp).  It should have a luxurious appearance,  It should be easy to rotate the light,  The design should be easy to transport. Also the opinion of Lughes and Hiroshi played an important in roll in the decision making. The concept that was chosen to elaborate was concept number 3. Part 4: Final design During this phase The chosen concept was developed into a final lighting design.","LED; lighting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

Sample was selected among the designers working and living in the southern part of Vietnam- area of Ho Chi Minh City. Data were gathered using qualitative research methods- semi-structured interviews, sensitizing workbooks and sensitizing cards with images and words. The research results reveal the step-by-step design approach that includes 7 steps- idea finding, plan creation, design sketching, and technical drawing, making and checking the prototype, creating a production drawing and last but not least- working with production. There were found three main stakeholders designers have been collaborating and communicating with- namely boss of the designer, production unit or production company, who is making the prototypes and later producing products, and foreign buyers and/ or local customers. Research results showed that local designers are facing many barriers related to communication and collaboration with other stakeholders involved in the design process. From the research results ideas for solutions were generated and later on translated into 3 diverse concepts. The concepts have been evaluated by Vietnamese designers.","designers in Vietnam; design communication; design process challenges","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

This development is putting pressure on society in economic, but also social terms. Privatization processes force hospitals to work more efficient, to compete for customers more pro-actively and to find new sources of revenue. They will put more effort in attracting patients by improving the patient experience. This makes so-called Post-Discharge Satisfaction (PDS) scores increasingly relevant. As a direct result, the hospital environment and the way it is organized is changing over the coming period of time and this will also have consequences for the business that Douwe Egberts Coffee Systems (DECS) is in. In this project I analysed how DECS can offer a meaningful contribution to enhancement of the patient experience in the hospital context. This eventually resulted in Douwe Egberts Invite, which is an on-demand coffee service that contains a premium single serve capsule machine that gets installed near the patient’s bed on reservation. Douwe Egberts Coffee Invite helps to foster social connectedness between patients and relatives and furthermore enhances the patient’s feeling of independence. For hospitals, Douwe Egberts Coffee Invite forms an opportunity to enrich their service portfolio and gain additional turnover.","health; care; coffee; tea; patient; experience; hospitals; hospitality; service design; system design; customer-driven innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-06-15","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Visser, A.A. (mentor)","2012","At the start of the graduation project in October 2011, the Excimer laser of Spectranetics was used for the Elana technique. Because the design, technology, and usability was outdated, Elana started in corporation with MLase the development of the new laser. With a functional prototype as starting point, the goal of the graduation project was to design the housing and user interface for the Elana medical laser, that offers medical professionals the required functionality and is easy and safe to use in the operation room. An extensive analysis by desktop research, and field work resulted into specific design requirements, which formed the base of the idea and concept development. Ideas were sketched and further detailed, and principle solutions were generated, what resulted into five concepts that were worked out in SolidWorks. One of the concepts was eventually chosen by making use of a full-sized model (called a mock-up). By combining the best features of the concepts the eventual design for the Elana medical laser was created. During the design process the ideas of the designer were constantly evaluated by the designer, the people of Elana & MLase, and a clinical physicist of the UMC Utrecht. Other stakeholders involved during the process were: an operation room coordinator, cleaning experts, and a purchaser. The design goal was met by designing a medical laser that will meet the needs of the medical professionals, by offering functionality, usability, ergonomics, safe working conditions, optimal maintenance access, optimal production and assembly, stability & reliability, and optimal cleaning. In addition the user interface will provide the user the actual information they need, and a touchscreen will allow the operator to navigate through the information, and will make it possible to confirm or change options. The overall design of the housing and interface was made attractive and aesthetically pleasing by making it modern, neat, and clean, with well-considered proportions, colors, materials, shapes, and placement of the components. By addressing the previous mentioned conditions, by expressing the Elana corporate identity, and by making the laser better accessible to hospitals (cheaper), the Elana medical laser will meet the needs of the medical professionals and will therefore become a sellable product for Elana. The evaluation of the design by the designer, the clinical physicist of the UMC Utrecht, the people of Elana, and the people of MLase showed that the design of the Elana medical laser was received very well, and that it met most of the requirements. However before the Elana medical laser can be realized it will need some detailing related to the attachment of the covers and display, and labeling.","design; interaction; elana; medical; laser; user; interface; user-interface; housing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-06-15","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Chu, Q.P. (mentor); Van Kampen, E. (mentor)","2012","The sensor-based approach of Incremental Backstepping is applied to flight control law design in this research project. It allows the usage of the same control law on different types of aircraft without the need for redesign. Apart from full state availability, the derivation of Incremental Backstepping assumes instantaneous control action. Due to actuator lags and delays, the implementation of control commands cannot necessarily be considered instantaneous. This mitigates the stability guarantee provided by Lyapunov theory. Therefore, a novel technique to estimate the time delay margins of the Incremental Backstepping controlled systems is proposed in the thesis. This provides an important stability measure for possible certification and widens the application range of Incremental Backstepping. This simple, yet effective, Lyapunov-based control technique shows positive robustness properties with respect to model uncertainties, unknown parameters, external disturbances and time delay effects. It is applied to the DA 42 aircraft as a (pilot-in-the-loop) rate controller in the scope of this thesis. The implementation requires measurements of the aircrafts angular accelerations and control surface deflections. If the latter is not available, it is shown that filters can still be used in the control system. However, the usage of filters mitigates the highly favorable robustness properties of the closed-loop system. Moreover, a controller evaluation strategy is proposed. It rates the performance and stability properties of the Incremental Backstepping controlled system in terms of the flight control system requirements. Evaluation of the Incremental Backstepping controller shows allowable input multiplicative uncertainties of up to 40% of the nominal value at the worst-case excitation frequency for a controller update rate of 100Hz. When no reference shaping is applied, the handling qualities of the incremental rate controller show to be less desirable than that of a conventional linear controller designed specifically for the DA 42. However, it is possible to improve handling characteristics by reference shaping. Furthermore, the handling characteristics of the incremental controller remain fairly constant along the flight envelope and in adverse flight conditions.","Incremental Backstepping; Time delay; Lyapunov-based control; Fly-By-Wire; Diamond DA 42; Nonlinear; Sensor-based control; SAFAR; Pilot-in-the-loop; Aircraft rate control; Flight control evaluation; SSV","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Control and Operations (C&O) - Control and Simulation Division (C&S)","","Guidance, Control & Navigation","",""

(mentor)","2012","The research objective of this thesis is to determine the new hydrodynamic and morphodynamic situation in case the Oosterschelde storm surge barrier is removed, with emphasis on the development of the intertidal area. To reach the objectives of this study a literature study is performed which describes the impact of the Deltaworks. An analytical model is developed to evaluate the effect of the Philipsdam and Oesterdam on the hydrodynamics in the Oosterschelde when the barrier is removed. Besides that a Delft3D model, the Kustzuid model, is used to determine the effect of bathymetric changes, removal of the barrier and realignment of the basin. Several adaptations have been made to the Kustzuid model to improve the performance. A theory by [Friedrichs and Aubrey, 1988] is used to analyse the distortion of the water level and discharge signal. The applied theory uses the relative phase of the M2 and M4 component to indicate the asymmetry. Removal of the barrier causes an increase of the tidal range by 10 to 20%. This is indicated both by the analytical model as by the Delft3D model. The tidal range will not get as large as it was before the Deltaworks. Removal of the barrier will cause an increase of the tidal prism and strengthen the ebb dominance of the basin. Besides that shoal build up will be enforced by the higher current velocities. Simulations with different bathymetries dating from 1983, 2008 and 2100 indicate that the loss of sediment from the shoals to the channels leads to a less ebb dominant system. A sligthly less ebb-dominant system is found in 2008 compared to the 1983 scenario. Ongoing loss of sediment from the intertidal area leads to a scenario without intertidal flats in 2100. In the 2100 scenario without barrier the system gets flood dominant in the eastern parts of the basin. Flood dominance throughout the entire basin is found when the barrier is still in place in 2100. Large scale realignment of the Oosterschelde is simulated by adding intertidal area to the Oosterschelde without increasing the channel volume. These simulations show increased ebbdominance, leading to export of sediment. The set back of part of the dikes will increase the flow velocities inside the basin, however not enough to cause shoal build up. When the barrier is removed in combination with realignment, shoal build up will occur. Based on empirical relations, realignment of the Oosterschelde is not expected to have a large effect on the relative flat area.","Oosterschelde; Tidal asymmetry; Delft3D; Analytical model; Barrier removal; Kustzuid model; Tidal basin; Tidal analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal engineering","",""

Daarnaast worden er simulaties uitgevoerd om de invloed van de contouren van het meer op de verblijftijd te onderzoeken. De berekening van de verblijftijd geschiedt op basis van een deeltjesmodel. Hierbij beweegt elk deeltje zich apart voort. De beweging van een deeltje wordt gegeven door de advectie-diffusie vergelijking. Met behulp van de Fokker-Planck vergelijking volgt er een uitdrukking voor een deeltje in tweedimensionale richting, waarbij er geen rekening wordt gehouden met de waterhoogte. Deze vergelijking geeft de verblijftijd van water in het meer, de voorwaartse methode. Daarnaast kan door de achterwaartse methode te bekijken de verwachte resterende verblijftijd benaderd worden, waarbij er als het ware wordt teruggerekend. Door het Euler-schema toe te passen, wordt er een numerieke benadering gevonden van de beweging van een waterdeeltje. Met behulp van deze benadering is er gekeken naar de verblijftijd van water in het meer op verschillende gebieden.

The objective of this research is to obtain physical knowledge in predicting the water level for the Dutch coast. This provides a better understanding of the contribution of storm characteristics to high water levels, and can therefore be very useful in the forecasting of extreme surges from the passage of these storms. Secondly, possible changes in meteorology can be taken into account in this model, in contrast to the current method. Another advantage is that the simulated wind field based on storm parameters may also be a tool for simulating and understanding the behaviour of waves for the North Sea and the joint probability with the water level.","Storms; North Sea; extreme statistics; wind; probability distribution; ocean surface; storm characteristics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2012","This report reflects the graduation process of Gerjan van Geest a master student of Integrated Product Design at the faculty of Industrial Design Engineering at the Technical University Delft. The graduation subject was: “Design of an improved photoplethysmographic-clip” With a photoplethysmographic (PPG) sensor it is possible to measure the heartbeat and oxygen saturation. The department of Experimental Anaesthesiology, laboratory of Experimental Anaesthesiology, at the Erasmus Medical Centre is developing an improved PPG-sensor technology, with the new technology it becomes possible to assess the condition of the blood vessels and thereby heart and vascular diseases can be diagnosed in an early phase of development. Heart and vascular diseases is an umbrella term for multiple diseases like heart attacks, strokes and transient ischemic attacks (TIA’s). The Analysis outcomes Several issues have been found that cause artefacts in the measurements of the PPG- sensor, such as movement of the clip on the finger, the size of the finger, incorrect placement of the clip on the finger and the pressure of the clip on the fingers. Next to that subjects like cleaning the clip and safety issues should also be taken into account. The most intensive users: the patients, the nursing staff and the doctors, are the main stakeholders of the PPG-clip. They all prefer a clip that is comfortable in use. It should fit nicely, be easy to place and give no wrong signals. If these three stakeholders are convinced of the ease of the clip the rest will follow at the condition that the clip stays affordable. Vision To prevent movement artefacts the new clip has to be stable on the fingers of a variety of patients. This means that the clip is not able to move while it is in use and that the clip has to be easy to place on a finger, no matter what size the finger is. Next to that the clip should be comfortable to wear for at least four hours, although the patient is passive. The clip should give extra information about the conditions of the blood vessels, if there are any impurities inside the blood vessels, which could indicate to heart and vascular diseases. The exact kind of signal that the doctor receives, a number, some sort of graph or a sound, should be determined in a later stadium. Ideas By using a morphological chart multiple ideas have been generated, based on the outcomes of the vision created at the end of the analysis. All ideas were defer to a list of criteria to select the best ones. Two ideas were developed further into concepts: ‘Toy’ and ‘Inflated’. Concept choice Both concepts are very interesting to work out completely and both concepts could work in reality. But only one should be chosen to work out completely, so a comparison will be made between both concepts. The comparison was based on the positive and negative points in different kinds of fields and makes that ‘Toy’ will be the most favourite concept. Next to that is it the most intuitive concept of the two. The name of this concept was later on changed into Vamulec. Vamulec Vamulec is a clip consisting of two elements, the body and a roller. The body is a cylinder, which is split up in two antennas that contain the sensors. The patient’s finger will be placed between the two antennas. The roller will be rolled over the two antennas, which will press them down unto the patient’s finger. In this way does the Vamulec variety of finger sizes and keeps the sensors stable during use. A prototype is made to test whether or not the Vamulec works. Out of these tests it became clear that there is a lot of room for improvement. A redesign should be made implementing all the outcomes of the usage tests. Also more research is needed to prove that it is possible to assess the condition of the blood vessels and thereby heart and vascular diseases with a photoplethysmograph.","photoplethysmograph; vamulec; heart and vascular diseases; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-06-14","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

The research starts by defining the ambient conditions, target group and the basic human body heat balance. It was found that not the core temperature of a body is the result of heat drawn (cooling) or added to the body (warming) by the environment. The design is focused on single-handed dinghy sailors, as they face the most extreme conditions and exercise levels. Heat generated in the body by exercising is conducted through the skin and the suit materials to the suit surface. At the surface, heat is exchanged with the environment, particularly by evaporation of (spray) water from the surface and convection (wind). Ideas to control these heat transfer modes are applied in a range of suit concepts. A simulation model is made to evaluate the effect of a sailing suit on the body’s thermal balance during a race. Using this model, concepts are evaluated and further detailed. The model is further detailed and validated, to be able to predict the properties and performance of a suit during a match. With this simulation model, the suit design is optimized for a sailing match during the 2012 Olympics in Weymouth. The result of this master thesis are a sailing suit and a simulation model for sailing gear. The suit is designed and optimized using this model, proving both the model’s functionality and the suit’s expected properties.","sailing gear; thermal comfort","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2013-06-14","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Engineering","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

The first step to do so, is to develop a trajectory simulator. To incorporate the effect of wind (weather cocking) and spinning, it is necessary to develop a simulator with three translational degrees of freedom, and three rotational degrees of freedom. The position and velocity of the rocket are described in a Cartesian coordinate system. To prevent singularities in the orientation, quaternions are used to describe the orientation of the rocket. To propagate these through time, classical equations of motion for a rigid body can be used. To do so the impulse thrust force and the jet damping moment are considered as an external force and external moment. The gravity force, the aerodynamic force, and the aerodynamic moment are the other external influences. To calculate these, the Earth is modeled as a flatted sphere (both shape and gravity field) with a US 1976 standard atmosphere, and a tabulated wind profile. The aerodynamic forces and moments are calculated based on this environment and a limited set of aerodynamic coefficients, obtained from the Missile Datcom 97 program. Because the problem’s nature it is not solvable analytically. Furthermore, in some parts of the flight the state rocket’s state changes rapidly, while in others parts the system behaves very smoothly. Therefore a Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg 56 variable time step integrator is used to solve the equations of motion numerically. As a result of this decision it is necessary to implement an event handling algorithm to execute discrete behavior (e.g. stage ignition) at the right time. To validate the in C++ developed program ROSIE, a small amateur rocket’s flight (2m long, apogee at 1 km) is simulated. The results show similar behavior as observed in the real flight data of the simulated rocket, indicating that the simulator is valid for the simulation of small amateur rockets. When comparing a single simulated impact point with a measured impact point, they will most likely not coincide. This can be explained by errors in the flight’s modeling, and can be due to randomness in what is simulated. By stating that these errors are due to uncertainties in the analysis, and modeling these uncertainties as random (input) variables, the result of the analysis will also be a random variable. An advantage of such a variable is that the result is not a single point, but a probability distribution. This distribution can be used to determine the risk to each individual, or the area which needs to be evacuated. To determine the probability distribution different methods are used. These methods can be grouped in parameterized and non-parameterized methods. With parameterized methods, a known type of probability distribution is used to model the dispersion of the impact point. To estimate the parameters of this distribution only a limited number of simulation runs is necessary. The downside of using a parameterized method is that the problem is simplified, in such a way that it can be modeled by a known distribution function. This introduces errors in the estimation of the risk. The alternative is to use a non-parameterized method. The method used is Monte Carlo simulation. To determine the probability of impact in a certain area, the trajectory simulation is run a large number of times. Because part of the input is random, each estimated impact point will have another location. By counting the number of impact points which landed in the sub domain, and dividing this by the total number of simulations, the probability of impact in that specific area can be calculated. Properties of Monte Carlo simulation can be used to specify a confidence interval for the calculated answer. By increasing the number of simulations the accuracy of the answer can be increased. The downside of Monte Carlo simulation is that many trajectory simulations are necessary, making it a very computational time intensive method. For the parameterized methods two different types of probability distributions are used, being the bivariate normal distribution, and the mixture model variant. This variant combines multiple bivariate normal distribution into a new more complex model. To estimate the parameters of these distributions, they are fitted through the data generated with trajectory simulator. This data is generated with different sampling schemes. Four different schemes are used. One-at-a-time sampling and orthogonal array sampling are only valid for the bivariate normal distribution, while the random sampling and Sobol sequence sampling scheme can be used for both. To compare the different methods, they are applied to a preliminary design of the Stratos II rocket. This is a large amateur rocket (5m) which will fly the 50 km in the near future. As a starting position for the comparison, 50000 random trajectories are simulated as benchmark data (Monte Carlo simulation). Comparing the parameters of the bivariate normal distribution obtained with this simulation and with 85 one-at-a-time samples shows a differences of 15 to 30 %. When 81 orthogonal array samples are used, this difference is reduced to less than 10%. With the same number of samples the found accuracy of Sobol sequence sampling is similar to that of the orthogonal arrays, but an advantage of Sobol sampling is that any number of samples can be selected to reach the desired accuracy. Random sampling cannot be used at a low number of samples. Orthogonal array and Sobol sampling have a better performance than one-at-a-time sampling, but are also more complex in their use. Which method to use, depends on the application. The second aspect which is benchmarked, is how accurate the parameterized method estimated the probability of impact at two specific locations. Comparing the probability (and its confidence interval) obtained directly from the Monte Carlo simulation with the one obtained from the bivariate normal distribution (based on 50000 random points) shows that the latter method can be either a factor 2 to 3 too conservative, or too optimistic. Whether or not this is acceptable depends on the applications. Using a mixture model, consisting of only two bivariate normal distributions, already shows significant improvements. Increasing the number of components does increase the accuracy, but also the sensitivity to outliers. Therefore it is not wise to use more than 5 components. To determine the influence of each individual parameter on the probability distribution (the footprint), different sensitivity methods are applied. To study non-linear effects and interactions, the set of parameters is reduced with the Morris elementary effect screening method. Applied regression based sensitivity analysis shows that the dispersion in range direction consists mainly of linear contributions. More specifically, these are the contributions due to uncertainty in thrust of the second stage, the drag coefficient and the atmospheric density. The dispersion in cross range direction depends for a significant part (> 10%) on non-linear contributions and interactions between parameters. This explains the error when modeling the probability distribution with a bivariate normal distribution. For the studied case, the two parameters which have the most influence on the dispersion in cross range direction, are the thrust misalignment of the first stage and the center of mass offset. The Stratos II is simulated to be launched from Esrange Space Center. Comparing the found footprint with the allowed impact area of Esrange shows that it is unlikely that the studied design is allowed to be launched from this site. By improving the design, it might be possible to reduce the size of the footprint in such an extend that it will fit if nominal flight occurs. Unfortunately, due to the experimental nature of the rocket, Esrange will likely demand that for non-nominal flight too, the footprint has to be in the allowed impact area. It is very unlikely that this is possible for a rocket flying to 50 km.","Rocket trajectory Stratos simulation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Space Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2012","The demand to increase performance while conserving power has led to the invention of multi-core systems. The software until now had the convenience of gaining better performance over faster processors without any need for a change. The advances in the multi-core hardware have shifted the responsibility of software performance from hardware architects to software developers. To harness the true power of the multi-core, the software must utilize the available cores and memories. In this thesis, we focus on the issue of multi-core memory mapping which is an area of active research. The availability of multiple memories creates several possibilities for memory mapping. Further, with an increase in the number of memories and application parameters there is an exponential increase in the number of possible mappings. In this context, the challenge is to find techniques which automate the process of finding an efficient mapping for a given use case. The use case under consideration is an automotive software running on a multi-core electronic control unit (ECU). The proposed techniques help to optimize memory accesses by performing efficient memory mapping and reduce the runtime on a system which employs a non uniform memory access (NUMA) characteristic. The optimal memory mapping problem is NP-complete, it is tackled using integer linear programming (ILP) for smaller problems and heuristics to practically solve bigger problems. We also propose metaheuristics as an add-on to mitigate the drawbacks of ILP and heuristics. The experiments on the dual-core ECU hardware show that our flash memory mapping techniques reduce runtime by 2.76% when caches are enabled and up to 8.73% when caches are disabled. Also, the benefit of the ILP technique for RAM is 50.48% when compared to the placement of all the variables in global RAM.","multi-core; NUMA; automotive; memory mapping; algorithms; embedded systems","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-09-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Software Technology","","Computer Engineering Research Group","",""

(mentor)","2012","After the disastrous floods in 1953 in the Netherlands, measures are taken to improve the safety in the Netherlands. In the Southwest of the Netherlands a couple of tidal basins are closed by the construction of dams and storm surge barriers. The closure of tidal basins shortens the coastal length and can result in a cost reduction comparing with heightening of dikes. The Eastern Scheldt storm surge barrier is one of the most well-known storm surge barriers. In view of the expected sea level rise the Deltacommission 2008 stated that the barrier cannot operate safely at a sea level rise of more than 1,0m and preferably, therefore, has to be removed. Furthermore the barrier causes sand hunger whereby large parts of the sandbars will ultimately disappear under water. This will affect subterranean animals and birds which are dependent on the sandbars. When the barrier will be removed these consequences can (largely) be prevented. In this study the best decision alternative for the safety of the Eastern Scheldt is investigated in view of costs and flood risk. This is done by defining two alternatives: (1) maintaining the Eastern Scheldt storm surge barrier and (2) removing the Eastern Scheldt storm surge barrier. In the analysis 3 scenarios of sea level rise are regarded: the current sea level, a sea level rise of 0,5m and a sea level rise of 1,0m. The consequences of the alternatives, such as the required dike reinforcement (heightening and widening) and reinforcements on the barrier, are determined and a cost-benefit analysis is made. It turns out that, if the current safety standard is satisfied, maintaining the barrier is a lot cheaper than removing the barrier. This is partly due to the magnitude of the costs for the removal of the barrier. When the safety is based on the values to be protected around the Eastern Scheldt, it turns out that the optimum flooding probability is 1/500 per year. The required dike height can be lower in that case, but still maintaining the barrier is cheaper.","Eastern Scheldt; sea level rise; Oosterschelde; zandhonger; safety; ecology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Coastal Engineering","",""

The purpose of this research was to find operating force and cable displacement combinations that could be produced best without visual feedback. The force-displacement combinations were realized by a force task and interchangeable spring in the experimental setup. Thirty participants without arm defect wore a prosthesis simulator. They were first asked to produce a reference force with direct visual feedback of their operating force, next they were asked to reproduce this reference force without visual feedback. The error between visual produced value and blind reproduced value was used to evaluate the results. Best reproduced operating forces were found between 24 and 32 N. Best reproduced cable displacements were dependent on the spring that was used; the larger the cable displacement was, the better the result. For larger forces it was more difficult to repeat the reference force-displacement. A perfect prosthesis should be operated by forces between 24 N and 32 N. It is important to take the amputee and their individual abilities into account as the results differ largely between participants.","prosthesis; body powered; shouder harness; control; operating forces; cable displacements; perception","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-06-21","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

(mentor); Schwering, P.B.W. (mentor)","2012","Nowadays, for the defense and security community, it is of prior importance to classify threats that are merged in a background while at the same time understanding the context of the entire scene. Traditional TV and Infra-Red (IR) cameras allow for an easy context understanding by providing valuable background and scenery information. Unfortunately, they typically do not allow a human observer to detect and classify semi-hidden targets. This study investigates the added value of the combined use of laser range gated viewer (GV) and IR camera to solve semi-hidden target recognition. To this end, an algorithm is developed to fuse GV and IR images based on a weighted averaging technique and employing existing multi-resolution image representation schemes. Our best fusion method for semi-hidden target recognition is selected from all methods considered by using an Image Quality Metric (IQM) combined with an accurate saliency metric. Both metrics are validated using human conspicuity experiments. For very complex scenarios, we additionally designed a background dimming algorithm that dims the scene either entirely or partially based on the context of the scene (contextual) or locally around the threat, while keeping the threat itself undimmed. The optimal combination of fusion method and amount of dimming is determined by means of a second human conspicuity experiment. In a final human experiment, we tested if moving objects influence the preferred amount of dimming. Our work shows that fusing GV into IR scenery images improves the human recognition task on semi-hidden targets. Moreover it demonstrates that a relatively simple pixel-based approach with a PCA-based weighted fusion scheme is the optimal fusion method among those considered. Additional results show that, especially, so-called contextual dimming improves target recognition in very complex scenarios and that moving objects require slightly more dimming in order to obtain the required performance.","image fusion; human recognition; infra-red; Laser Range Gated Viewer; saliency; Image Quality Metrics; conspicuity experiments","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Intelligent Systems","","Media & Knowledge Engineering","",""

Covering an area of approximately 615 km2, the estuary is among the largest estuaries in the United Kingdom. Adjacent to the Wash estuary, the Fenlands are situated, a low lying area covering almost 3900 km2. Within the last century several coastal flood disasters and near flood disasters have occurred in the area. In view of the predicted climate changes it is proposed to construct a privately funded storm surge barrier across the estuary, including a tidal power plant to generate marine power. The thesis focuses on establishing the technical and economical feasibility of such combined structure, taking into account the effect of the barrier on the tidal amplitude within the basin by means of a storage basin approach. Furthermore both the present values of the investment costs and the revenues from generating energy and reducing the flood risk are computed over the structure’s lifetime. The main conclusions are that technically it is feasible to construct a tidal power plant and a storm surge barrier within the Wash estuary. However, presently the computed break-even energy price is too high for the project to be competitive with other low carbon energy sources. Hence, the project is considered to be not economical viable. In the performed economical analysis possible financial incentives from both the UK Government and the European Committee, such as: carbon pricing, buy-out price and Feed-in-Tariffs are not included.

The performance of the wave tank under the aforementioned various conditions is observed. As a result the appropriate parameters to be used for the numerical experiment are obtained. Finally, simulations are carried out to calculate the wave forces on a cylindrical pile and the numerical results are compared to the results obtained using the Morison formula. During validation, it is observed that the wave tank gives good results with an error of 0.24% in the wave amplitude at a grid density of 100 cells per wavelength and CFL number 0.1 for a fifth order Stokes wave of amplitude 0.05m and wavelength 2m. A recent study using a different approach reported a requirement of 200 cells per wavelength. Thus, the performance of the wave tank in this study is considered very good. The calculation of wave forces also shows promising results. The wave forces from REEF3D seem to be slightly under estimated compared to the Morison force in the four numerical experiments carried out. There exists a possibility of erroneous calculation of the Morison force. There were no instabilities in the solution from the numerical calculations. Due to the absence of simple experimental data for wave force on a cylinder and time constraints, validation is attempted only through Morison formula by adding the formula in the code.

First, we derived a method to combine the evidential value of different partial Y-chromosomal DNA profiles of different stains. The method consists of finding a lower bound for the likelihood ratio when more than two propositions are compared and where we don't need the prior probabilities of the different propositions. Second, we made a simulation model to investigate the dendence of autosomal and Y chromosomal DNA profiles by assuming that everybody with the same Y-chromosomal DNA profile has a common ancestor and simulating the assignment of autosomal DNA profiles over different family tree structures. The results can be used in practice as scientific support for the assumption of independence between the Y and autosomal profile. Third, we developed a model to interpret (low-template) DNA profiles which is able to give the likelihood of observing the DNA profile given any allele-combination of the donor. This model assumes that a DNA profile is a result of a stochastic process where the input are the alleles of a possible donor. This model uses the information in peak heights without using any threshold. The model shows promising results in determining the combined evidential value of several low template DNA profiles that were obtained from the same stain.","Combining Evidence; forensic; DNA profiles","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Statistics","","","",""

People do not like to wear bicycle helmets, especially in Europe. They are perceived as ugly and uncomfortable. People tend to feel they look stupid wearing them, and can be safe without them. Recently, manufacturers have been developing urban or lifestyle bicycle helmets. These are bicycle helmets specifically targeted at the urban environment. They aim to be more fashionable than the sporty helmets used on racing bikes. However, the urban helmet has not yet proven very popular. In this project, a new urban helmet has been developed for people who cycle on a frequent basis in the age of 25-30 years old. The research conducted shows that this target group often finds the thought of carrying around a helmet inconvenient, and does not like the styling of the helmets currently on the market. For them, these disadvantages outweigh the plus of the extra safety which a bicycle helmet offers. Therefore, only few people wear a bicycle helmet. This project has focused on increasing the convenience of a helmet, and improving the aesthetics. The final design is a bicycle helmet with an integrated lock and integrated lights. The aesthetics have been designed according to stigma-free product design guidelines, in order to be more acceptable to the target group. The lock improves convenience, since the helmet does not need to be carried around anymore. Furthermore, it increases the security of a bicycle parked in the city. The lights improve visibility of the cyclist, and relieve him from having to wear clip-on lights. The stigma-free aesthetics liberate the helmet from its stereotypical look and integrate helmet and head better. The final prototype is perceived by users as more convenient and beautiful than helmets currently on the market.

(mentor); Knulst, A.J. (mentor)","2012","Usability issues have been observed in luminaire repositioning, during surgical operations. These difficulties were confirmed to be related to the kinematics of the translational subsystem of the suspension mechanism, specifically the possibility of singularity. Due to which the required force for luminaire repositioning depends on the spatial arrangement of the mechanism. Based on these findings, the goal of this research is to design a surgical luminaire suspension system that improves luminaire repositioning. With the hypothesis that a suspension mechanism without the possibility of singularity will improve luminaire repositioning. Within this research framework, the task was specified to the design of a passive serial suspension mechanism for the surgical luminaire that improves luminaire repositioning and can be easily actuated. This design project exists of two parts, a conceptual design process and a validation of the design. Based on a function analysis of the suspension it was chosen to focus the conceptual design process on the translational subsystem of the suspension. A computer aided method was devised to optimise the mechanism kinematics to the required movement space in the operating room. Which resulted in 13900 serial combination of revolute joints, prismatic joints and links. Based on a scoring routine, a selection of concepts was made and further assessed. The resulting design is an adaptation of the translational subsystem of the conventional suspension mechanism and is considered most feasible. The adaptations consist of a rail system from which the mechanism is suspended and a wrapping pair that couples the two vertical rotations of the pendant-type mechanism. As a result, the horizontal movement space is described without singularity and the movement space is improved. To validate the design and test the hypothesis, a full scale prototype has been build and tested in a user experiment with 14 participants. The prototype is based on a donated conventional suspension system that is adapted to easily switch between the (new) coupled state and the (conventional) uncoupled state. All participants completed an equal movement sequence in both states, thus creating paired measurements of input forces and the position of the mechanism’s end-effector. Based on the consistency in work between opposite movements in one state it was determined that the movement forces in the new design are indeed independent of spatial arrangement, whereas the reverse is true for the uncoupled state. Further analysis between states shows significant improvement in movement duration, work and jerk cost for the coupled mechanism. Also, qualitative data collected during the experiment show that participants significantly favour the coupled mechanism. With these results it can be concluded that the hypothesis is valid and that the research goal has been accomplished.","surgical lighting; luminaire; suspension mechanism; design; validation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-06-07","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

(mentor); Van Swaaij, R.A.C.M.M. (mentor)","2012","Heterojunction with intrinsic thin-film (HIT) solar cells combine the strengths of amorphous and crystalline silicon to create very efficient and stable devices. In fact, they have the potential to replace solar cells based on monocrystalline technology; the current solar cell market leader. The production can be done cheaper, at lower temperatures and with a potentially higher open circuit voltage Voc. To advance the technology, much research is done in optimizing the performance of HIT devices. For research purposes it is very valuable to completely understand the physics of HIT devices. A model that can adequately describe the behaviour of the device could be used to simulate the performance of different architectures, without going through the process of manufacturing, measuring and characterization. This would significantly speed up the optimization process. Unfortunately, no such model exists and thus a lot of research is done to find one. To aid in this, the goal of this thesis is to find the dominant electronic transport mechanisms in HIT solar cells, because despite several previous studies on this, no consensus has been reached. To characterize the currents mechanisms that are present in the device, a number of measurements were performed, most importantly of which is the dark current-voltage (JV) measurement, where the temperature was varied. From this measurement, four current regions were distinguished: the reverse bias region (V < 0) , the low forward bias region (0 < V < 0.4) , the high forward bias region (0.4 < V < 0.7) and the current limited region (0.7 < V < 0.9). For every dark JV measurement, each region was fitted with a fitting function. The information from these fittings can be found in the optimized fitting parameters and the choice of fitting function that could most accurately describe the current. From the optimized fitting parameters the activation energy of the saturation current Eact and exponential factor A was extracted. From A it is also possible to calculate the diode ideality factor n. These quantities are unique for a certain current mechanism and as such can be used to identify the dominant electronic transport. It can be concluded that the dominant current in the low forward bias region is best described by the multitunneling capture-emission model, with an activation energy Eact;LFB = 0.3 - 0.45 eV and a logarithmic slope of A = 3.5-4.5 V-1. The dominant electronic transport mechanism in the high forward bias region is still unclear. The combination of Eact-HFB = 0.55 -0.75 eV and ideality factor n = 1.25 - 1.4 does not correspond to any known current mechanism. However, an alternative method calculates the average ideality factor to be ~1.8 - 1.9, which would lead to the conclusion that the current is dominated by a recombination current. For very high bias, the current is limited by a space-charge limited current. A series resistance was not observed, probably due to the low area of the measured samples. The reverse bias is usually reported to be dominated by a everse-bias generation current, but it is reasonable to assume that the actual dominant electronic transport is a combination of a parallel, ohmic resistance path and the reverse-bias characteristics of the tunneling current that dominates the low forward bias. Additionally, the influence of the thickness and doping level of the amorphous emitter layer was investigated. However, possibly due to drift in the depositions and inaccurate thickness specifications, this has not yielded many results. The only trends that have been observed are that a decrease in the doping level of the emitter increases the passivation and Voc and that the thickness of the emitter layer influences the activation energy of the low forward bias. However, these trends are quite weak and additional research needs to be done before anything can be concluded.","HIT; Solar cell; electronic transport","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Photovoltaic Materials and Devices","",""

No long-term contracts or large upfront investment required; resources are available on a pay-per-use basis. Consequently, a thousand servers used for an hour are as expensive as using one server for a thousand hours. It also enables resources to be provisioned according to demand, reducing unnecessary costs, while simultaneously making it resilient against significant and unexpected increases in demand. This model greatly reduces the risk and startup costs to innovate and disrupt. The rise of cloud computing has placed existing application owners in a challenging position. Their application is often not designed with this level of flexibility in mind. Because of the time and money invested in an existing application it is likely preferable to use this investment rather than abandoning it. Starting anew would also require a larger and relatively long-term investment that carries more risk. For this reason a hybrid approach to cloud computing could be an attractive means to leverage past investments as well as benefit from cloud computing. Through the use of an industrial test case we have explored some of the opportunities and challenges of cloud computing from the perspective of an application that was not designed with cloud computing in mind. These insights as well as the system's current limitations to scale led us to create a working prototype to store a subset of data to Amazon's Simple Storage Service (S3). Based on our results, storage costs for this subset of data are reduced twenty fold, the administrative burden to scale is completely transferred to Amazon and performance remains acceptable despite an overhead of 88 milliseconds due to internet latency. The prototype serves as a concrete proof of concept that demonstrates hybrid cloud computing can be a viable means to improve an existing system.","cloud Computing; hybrid; existing business application","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Web Information Systems","","","",""

(mentor)","2012","Liquid silicon is found as the material combining both the advantages of high quality silicon devices and the low cost solution processing method. Single-Grain Thin-Film Transistors can be produced by Excimer Laser Annealing of the resulting film and grain location control by the µ-Czochralski process. Other works have used spin-coating and inkjet printing for liquid silicon based devices, however both processes are not roll-to-roll process compatible. In addition a high thermal annealing step (650°C), incompatible to plastics, is required for the reduction of hydrogen content before laser crystallization. In this work, both issues are focused on. A precursor of the gravure printing process, doctor blade coating, is used to imitate a roll-to-roll compatible solution process and is optimized to produce uniform films of liquid silicon. Excimer Laser Annealing is used as a low temperature pre-annealing method to decrease the hydrogen content for crystallization. Pure cyclopentasilane has been used as the liquid silicon material. Silicon dioxide surface modification by 0.55%HF dip results in a better wetting of the liquid together with an elevated temperature of 70°C. Higher temperatures lead to even better wetting properties, but more liquid silicon will evaporate. After UV polymerization of the CPS for 20 minutes and thermal annealing at 350°C for 1 hour, an a-Si layer has been formed. Excimer Laser pre-annealing of many low energy shots removes hydrogen without significant deterioration of the film. A maximum grain size of 5µm has been produced by using a long pulse configured laser recipe that decreases the number of shots linearly while increasing the laser energy density by 50mJ/cm². SG-TFTs on polyimide have been manufactured at the maximum processing temperature of 350°C. The mobility of the NMOS was ..., and the mobility of the PMOS was .... [to be obtained by mid June]. Finally, a next step towards gravure printing has been taken, by advancing the doctor blade coating method to the removal of the excess layer while keeping the cavity patterns in the film filled. Blade elasticity is a dominant factor in manual blading. An elastic blade can remove more excess than a rigid blade since the flexibility allows adjustment on the surface, but will also remove the liquid from inside the patterns. A combination of a rigid blade and the careful excess removal by the elastic blade gives the best results. This work shows the potential of liquid silicon, and brings us closer to the mass production on flexible substrates using this new material.","Liquid Silicon; Doctor Blade Coating; Low Temperature Annealing; SG-TFT","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2013-06-05","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","Electronic Components, Technology and Materials","",""

(mentor)","2012","To ensure efficient and reliable operation of power amplifiers it is very important to precisely measure and control the power of the signal they transmit. A device most often used to do precise power measurements of RF systems is the so-called RF power detector. As this detector is used as measurement device the precise measurement ability of the RF power detector is very important. For the precise predictability of the output power of power amplifiers the transfer of the RF power detector has to be fixed and accurately known. In this thesis we develop a new calibration method for the transfer stabilization of logarithmic power detectors. Via thorough investigation at system level and circuit level it is shown that the proposed method can be used to continuously calibrate the transfer of a logarithmic RF power detector to a predefined and fixed position over mismatch, part-to-part spread, temperature and input frequency. The method depends on a novel switching algorithm around a log device that is capable to do continuous slope, intercept and dynamic range correction on the transfer of the logarithmic power detector. When accurate enough, the method would make calibration of each individual device unnecessary. Furthermore a new method is presented that can be used to extend the dynamic range of log detectors. System simulations show that the calibration method leads to the wanted transfer stabilization of the logarithmic power detector. A critical part of the new logarithmic transfer calibration method is the need of an accurate multiplication procedure at the input of the logarithmic device. For this accurate multiplication a new accurate gain fixation procedure for a non-linear high bandwidth gain stage was developed. A big part of the thesis is dedicated to the investigation and circuit implementation of this new accurate and fast gain fixation procedure. The gain stabilization method leads to the implementation of a new innovative gain fixation system, including several new architectural innovations. One of these innovations is the implementation of a new accurate ripple blocking system with relative small form factor and fast response time. Simulation results of the circuit implementation of the gain stabilization system prove that the accuracy of the gain stabilization of the non-linear high bandwidth gain stage is well within the required specifications.","RF; power; detection; transfer; stabilization; detectors; calibration; detectors; slope; intercept; dynamic; logarithmic; rms; continuously","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","","",""

Ciudad Juarez is an ideal case study with one of the highest levels of abandonment estimated between 25 and 30%. The reasons for this are multiple and point towards a complex mesh of forces that transgress the scope of the built environment. They encompass entangled dimensions of political economy and socio-economic developments, which only touch the built structure of actual housing at the very last stage. Major issues on the basis of abandoned housing are the drug trafficking and the resulting violence. Inhabitants experience insecurity, extortion and human rights violations due to the ongoing drug war. The government has proven to be inadequate to solve the problems, and even worsened the situation. The ongoing problematic social and economic situation is only increasing the existing poverty. Site research in Juarez furthermore revealed a city that is struggling with lack of urban planning, municipal infrastructure and an economy that is heavily dependent on global investments in the maquilla production industry, which is at present in a state of decline. In addition to poor urban planning, there is a fundamentally flawed system in the manner in which social housing is conceived, designed, produced inhabited and devaluated in Mexico. These factors create a cycle of decay and dysfunction, from which abandoned housing becomes one of many spatial consequences. The studio developed architectural counter-proposals that seek to break these cycles of urban blight and decay. The site which is used as an example expressing the issue of abandoned housing is ‘Riveras del Bravo’. The issues mentioned above all account for Riveras as well, furthermore, Riveras is experiencing more site-specific problems. Due to its isolated location, lack of civil amenities, the municipality not taking responsibility, flooding problems, open sewerage, mono-functionality resulting in lack of employment opportunities, lack of public transport and the small size of the houses. The demographic problems concern a concentration of population with low income and low education. A group strategy has been developed that seeks to reconfigure the area spatially, socially and economically in a way that disrupts the mono-functional planning and urban isolation. More specific to my research question is the need for access to health care and education. The research question concerns how a health care clinic department with educational facilities can architecturally contribute to the needs for civic amenities, which in turn might decrease the issue of abandoned housing.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2012-07-10","Architecture","DSD","","Urban Asymmetries","",""

CIGRE report 25/23-01 mentioned the failures caused by free particles and foreign bodies represent 20% of the total distribution of defect type in GIS failures. The presence of these particles results in a local field concentration which influences the insulation medium and can result in breakdown. Under AC voltage, particles can start “moving"" or ""jumping"" into higher electric field regions. Breakdown may occur if stressing overvoltages, e.g. AC + VFTO, DC + VFTO and AC + LI would occur at the particle get close or attached to the HV conductor In thesis the influence of free moving particles on the breakdown strength in GIS under different voltage stresses are investigated. For this purpose Different GIS test setups have been used. Particles lengths ranging between 2 to 30 mm have been investigated at 4bar gas pressure. The results have shown that the particles size of 5 mm and longer can start jumping under AC voltage, while shorter particles were tend to show only a little movements The visual observations have shown that the particles were moving towards the HV electrode and solid insulators inside the GIS. Therefore the particles as small as 5 mm are considered dangerous to the insulation system under continuous operating AC voltage. A breakdown area have been distinguished based on the particles length under AC + LI. the particles of 15 mm length and longer are critical under AC + LI. The investigation under AC + VFTO has been performed with the maximum peak 2.1 p.u. At this level, the breakdown has been observed with the 30 mm particle at 90% of the distance gap. During the experiments partial discharge measurements have been performed by means of:  the conventional method (IEC 60270)  the UHF method  the acoustic method The PD results have shown that some defects can cause a PD level higher than 10pC.

(mentor); Verlaan, J.G. (mentor); Vranken, J.L.M. (mentor); Bots, A.W.O. (mentor)","2012","The main research objective of this study is to gain more insight into the uncertainties that are occurring in maintenance projects. A lot of research has already been performed on the subject of budget overruns in large scale new development infrastructure projects, however, information on budget overruns in maintenance projects is lacking. Uncertainties are an important contribution to the cost increase of (infrastructure) projects. During a project unforeseen events are always occurring. This is taken into account by adding an item ‘unforeseen’ to the cost estimate. The actual occurring unforeseen costs can be split up into three categories: unforeseen costs in the execution phase, contractors bid uncertainty and ‘other unforeseen’ due to, amongst others, further specification of the project. It appears that in new-to-build projects the unforeseen in the execution phase (quantified by additional works) can be as high as 25 to 30 percent of the total project costs. In maintenance projects this is a lot lower: a maximum of five percent. This has to do with the repetitive character of maintenance works, the often limited project size, the possibility for detailed inspections and the fact that the works often take place in already stirred ground. Though, maintenance projects are characterized by a relative large uncertainty between the initiation phase and the start of the execution. This is because in maintenance projects one never starts with a ‘green-field’ situation. In other words, the initial state is often unclear in the early phase of the project, and this is especially the case for unique, technical complex projects, such as control system projects. Because this report was initiated by the Airfield Maintenance Services (AMS) division of Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, applying the information found on the basis of the main research objective is a second goal of this thesis. It is in the ambition of AMS to be reliable and predictable. Not only when it comes to the management of its assets, but also when the financial performances are concerned. Also within the rest of the organization accurate cost estimates are seen as an important means towards more efficient and effective cost control. This enables them to make better informed decisions. Therefore, the second research objective of this study is to improve the early-phase cost estimation process of maintenance projects and to find out whether probabilistic cost analysis techniques could be of value in this process. The scope of this study is limited to the CAPEX projects; the large renovation projects. The current practice in the cost estimation process at SCHIPHOL GROUP is that every year in the first quartile a business plan for the upcoming five years is made based on the company’s strategic goals. The input for this business plan is the budget estimates that are provided by the maintenance managers of AMS. At this moment uniformity is lacking in these estimates. Moreover, when the estimates are made the scope of the project is often still very unclear. Based on this business plan, after further specification, the project budgets are determined in the fourth quartile. The annual budget for the next year is the project budgets combined. From a comparison between the business plan, the annual budget and the actual expenditures in the projects it appeared that the latter are significantly lower. This can be mainly explained by the fact that throughout the year projects have been removed from the business plan scope. However, a statistical analysis of the projects itself shows that on an average the expenditures were 7% higher (with a standard deviation of 34%) than estimated in the business plan. This can be further specified per project type. Because the project budget estimates were made in a later stage, they are more in line with the actual costs. What also showed from this analysis is that smaller projects show a larger variation in the nominal unforeseen than larger projects. This could indicate that in maintenance projects larger projects can be seen as a cluster of smaller projects with relatively little overlap between them, thus acting as a portfolio where overruns in one part of the project are compensated by underruns in another. The cost estimation process can in first instance be improved by creating uniform estimates in combination with a clear definition of the scope. When, next to this, the costs are booked into the accounting software system in a corresponding manner, a database can be built with very usable information. At first this information can be used to gain insight into the size of the cost items. If needed, it will then be able to make decisions accordingly. Further this can be used as a starting point for new estimates, which will make them more reliable. In the second place it is recommended to do the estimate in a probabilistic manner. This means that the total estimated amount is represented by a probability function with an average value and a standard deviation. With this a probability of exceeding the chosen project budget is introduced. In this way one recognizes the uncertainty of an estimate and this information can be used to determine the budget. There are different methods by which a probabilistic cost estimate can be made. In this thesis it is recommended to do this statistically (with the use of historical data) and not Bayesian. This is related to the issue that it appears to be difficult for cost estimators to estimate extreme values, uncertainties and risks. It should be noted that when historical data is not present, the Bayesian method can be used until enough statistical information is gathered. For the determination of the project and the annual budgets the following is proposed. When the annual budget is applied for one can take the uncertainty of the estimates into consideration. This becomes relatively smaller when the projects are bundled in a portfolio and regarded as a whole. The annual budget can be set to a value equal to the sum of the project cost averages plus a value of k times the standard deviation. Subsequently the projects can be given a budget with a probability of exceedance of 0.5 or even higher. Next to this a contingency fund with a size of the earlier mentioned k times ? can be kept at the management level of AMS. If it seems that the projects will be more expensive than the set budget the project manager can request for extra budget from this contingency fund, but only on the basis of solid argumentation. It should be noted that it is not in everyone’s interest to make the estimates more accurate and transparent. Some stakeholders could benefit from a large budget and more freedom when it comes to the allocation of financial resources. This could lead to strategic behavior. Budget slack is an example of this. This means that one applies for a larger budget to make it easier to reach a target. Also there is the MAIMS (money allocated is money spent) principle, which means that one is inclined to fully spent a given budget, even though this is not always necessary for the originally set scope and quality of the project. By using the in this thesis proposed estimation method and budgeting process, these effects can be diminished, by increasing the transparency and starting off with tighter budgets for the projects. Besides, it is regarded in the best interest of the entire organization when transparency and reliability of the estimates is increased, such that more efficient and effective cost control is possible. Finally, the estimation process of Schiphol AMS can be improved by starting the projects more early. When there is already a preliminary design of a project before the budget is set in the final business plan, a part of the uncertainty in the scope and in the further specification can be reduced. Information of the project organization within SCHIPHOL GROUP and the contractor can serve as valuable information here. This does not necessarily have to cost extra money and time, since a part of the engineering of the project that needs to be done anyway is only moved forward in time. On top of that there is added value in the fact that more reliable estimates can be delivered.","costs; probabilistic; analysis; risk; estimation; estimate; cost; Schiphol; maintenance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","","",""
