(mentor); De Gijt, J.G. (mentor); Van Dijke, A. (mentor); Bakker, K.J. (mentor); Pasterkamp, S. (mentor); Hilgers, J.C. (mentor)","2016","Without doubt the need to give a founded estimation of the remaining life span is needed. In the NEN 8700 and 8701 and the guideline of Rijkswaterstaat (RBK) a way to determine the structural reliability is given. The corresponding estimate of the remaining life span is based on but not equal to the suggested reference period of the loads. These can vary from 1 to 50 years. The main objective is to calculate the remaining life span. The idea is that the reliability index decreases and the failure probability increases in time. Deteriorating materials and changing loads are the main reason for this. To find the reliability index full probabilistic models are a possibility. For these calculations a lot of parameter input is required and the calculations are often difficult, time consuming or need specialised software. As an alternative the Eurocode and also SBRCUR 186 give partial safety factors to make reliability-calculations without the need of actual probabilistic computations. As a start the quay wall is assessed by simplified hand calculations to find the most critical failure mechanisms and other aspects, such as input parameters. Information that can be found in the archive of the municipality of Dordrecht is used as first input. The second step is to find a more detailed way to model the structural reaction of the loads. It is chosen to use Plaxis. A strutting wall and the large amount of piles in combination with a small retaining screen make it necessary to use a 3D model. The computation time is extensive and therefore a 2D model was made. This model is calibrated on the 3D model by means of the critical aspects in the construction, which were found in the hand calculations. With the 2D model it is possible to make a large amount of computations to estimate the sensitivity on certain scenarios within a limited time span. The fact that there are many unknowns makes this useful and even inevitable. The reliability indices follow from a given set of partial safety factors for which the construction passes all unity checks. By analysing the fault tree the reliability index is found in more detail. Each failure mechanism is investigated separately to calculate the overall reliability index without making any probabilistic computations. By extrapolating the indices from the time of construction via the present condition to the crossing with the required reliability the remaining life span is found. At the time of computing there were no inspection results available. The information that was used resulted in an unsafe structure. By improving the soil retaining screen and a complete inspection the remaining life span could be 40 years and 33 years for the unfavourable scenarios. The scenarios are based on soil mechanical reactions on an overly dredged port basin, an extreme ground water level and pile geometry. Some main remarks are placed with this method: *The consequence class is assumed to be 1. *The extrapolation of the reliability indices is assumed to be linear. *The Eurocode is used to assess the strength and some of the old building materials that are not used anymore (smooth reinforcement steel) are not treated in detail in the codes. *It is assumed that the partial safety factors in SBRCUR 186 are calculated in a similar way as CUR 211 and CUR 166, on which it was based. This is the way how the importance of the different failure mechanisms, as parts of the total (6.25), is determined. *The use of different guidelines that were not meant to be used together in this manner makes that the error of the method is estimated to be 50%. The partial safety factors have an error of 0.05 to 0.10 in 1, resulting in an error of the reliability index of approximately 10%. Due to the extrapolation the error increases to 50% and even 100% taking into account modelling errors. This is shown by a grey band in the graph. As a direct result the main recommendations are given to be: *The retaining screen has to be improved and the relieving floor has to be inspected or the remaining life span is 0 and the quay should be replaced. *Redo the calculations using inspection results and make detailed calculation after inspections. *In a few years the quay wall should be assessed again to find a new reliability index. A third point on the line to extrapolate should give more insight to the distribution. Alternatively one could predict the material properties to predict a future reliability index. Challenges with the reference period could arise. *The Eurocode, or a part in the specialised NEN 8700 series should give calculation rules for common old building materials. *SBRCUR 186 should give the fault tree and parts of the total reliability index for each of the failure mechanisms to make calculations for all the given main types of quay walls possible. As a result the background of the given partial safety factors, which are sometimes counterintuitive, is also known in more detail. *An experienced engineer could be able to fit the uncertainties into scenarios. The large errors and scenarios give a wide range of the remaining life span. A detailed inspection to the general outline, state and the material properties of the structure should be done beforehand. *More quay walls should be assessed to validate the usefulness of the presented method.","remaining life span; fault tree; reliability index; Dordrecht; quay wall","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","","51.811462, 4.655477"

(mentor); Riches, P.E. (mentor)","2016","Collagen gels hold great promise in the field of tissue engineering as collagen is highly biocompatible, biodegradable, abundant in nature and it provides an optimum environment for tissue regeneration and restoration of normal tissue function. However, collagen hydrogels have poor mechanical strength due to low collagen proportion and thus are not capable of substituting native tissue without special treatment. The latter usually involves methods that impart some degree of cytotoxicity and impede optimal regeneration. In this study, hyper-hydrated collagen gels were concentrated without using any method that reduces cellular activity. Gels were left to self-compress in a laterally confined manner for a considerable period of time to expel excessive interstitial fluid and to transform to relatively concentrated collagen sheets. These collagen constructs may be seeded with cells and constitute an excellent starting material for building a tissue. The main goal of the study is to create and mechanically characterise self-compressed collagen gels, identifying the mechanical effect of expelling fluid by taking into account their two-phase nature. Plastically compressed collagen gels of three different concentrations were tested under unconfined ramp hold compression assuming biphasic theory. A finite element (FE) model was developed to simulate the experiment and analyse results by numerically fitting a solution to experimental data. The FE model was fitted to the experimental results using a numerical iteration algorithm to predict the values of material parameters. The collagen matrix was modelled as a neo-Hookean material, isotropic and homogeneous. Permeability of collagen gels was assumed to follow the strain dependency of Lai and Mow (1980). Collagen samples were also tested under dynamic loading to explore the frequency dependence of phase lag (?), storage and loss modulus. Results indicate that after confined self-compression for 18 hours, collagen density of gels increased almost 10 times, Young’s modulus ranged from 0.76-1.1kPa and zero-strain hydraulic permeability decreased from 51 to 21 mm4/Ns with increasing collagen content. The FE model coupled with the optimisation algorithm can detect differences in material parameters among gels of different collagen concentration and can reveal the poromechanics during loading. Further, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) revealed a profound increase of phase lag (?) and dynamic modulus with increasing frequency. The present work is the first work that studies the mechanical properties of concentrated collagen gels using biphasic theory. It constitutes a strong base from which more complex constitutive behaviour can be applied to the FE model. Although, the collagen concentration method via confined self-compression that was adopted did not result in collagen constructs strong enough to substitute native tissue, further compression of those materials in a laterally confined controllable manner could increase collagen density and mechanical properties, even in the range of body tissues.","collagen gels; self-compression; biphasic theory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-03-31","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

(mentor); Cankurtaran, P. (mentor)","2016","Study towards subjective factor of QOL in developing countries is being underdeveloped. Moreover, QOL enhancements in developing countries are mostly focused on and through its objective factor. This might due to the correlated subjective factor to objective factor within the poor objective factor of QOL context. Those solutions considered as less empowering and outside dependent for the people. Thus, study and attention towards enhancement through the subjective factor of QOL is needed. The solution resulted expectedly can empower the people more. This study intention is to find an alternate solution that focuses on the subjective factor of QOL. SDT and its ability to spur intrinsic motivation proposed as one of the solutions. SDT with its three ingredients (autonomy, competence and relatedness) suggested can help people to achieve their state of wellbeing as they pursue their valued outcome. This wellbeing is aligned with what the subjective factor of QOL means by happiness and satisfaction. Thus to study that proposition in a tangible way, a tool was designed and evaluated in this research. The tool is intentionally designed to spur volitional behavior to solve one of the QOL problems as the outcome or goal. Two different set-ups were designed to see the occurrence of the intrinsic motivation by implementing and not implementing three SDT ingredients of basic psychology needs. The result shows that feeling of autonomy, competence and relatedness are supported in the tool with SDT embedded. It also shows a positive result on internalization of intrinsic goals. Interest and enjoyment as the self-report measure of intrinsic motivation also appear positive. Whilst, the result of those values appear negative on the tool without SDT embedded. Overall, the study shows that SDT with its intrinsic motivation can enhance subjective factor of QOL. The intrinsic motivation towards intrinsic goals can have an impact on extrinsic goals as its derivative value. Some of the objective factors of QOL are considered as part of extrinsic goals. Hence, the intrinsic motivations’ occurrence might also impact the related objective factors of QOL. But this proposition needs to be further studied. Thus spurring intrinsic motivation through SDT can enhance subjective factor of QOL, and if it has an impact on the related objective factors of QOL, it might have the ability at some extend to enhance the overall QOL. Researchers and designers can consider using SDT in their solution to improve QOL strategically within the context of the developing countries.","quality of life; subjective quality of life; self-determination theory; better employment; vocation; intrinsic motivation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Van der Veen, G.J. (mentor); Kerst, S.M.A.A. (mentor)","2016","Rapid growth in automotive sector and stringent safety requirements have led to the need for more sophisticated feedback mechanisms for the vehicle systems. One of the major breakthrough is anticipated with the use of estimated loads with help of a Load Sensing Bearing. Load Sensing Bearing is a concept in which strain is measured on a hub bearing unit with help of strain gauges and this measured strain is used to estimate the load generated between the road surface and the tire. Different kind of algorithms to estimate the load from the measured strain on a bearing are found in literature. These algorithms are based on the signal analysis and filtering of the measured strain signals. Moreover, the position of strain gauges to measure the strain on bearing are decided based on the intuition. It is expected that if the model of the internal load distribution of a bearing is included in the estimation process, in conjunction with the measured strain, the developed algorithm can give more accurate estimation of a load. A methodological approach of estimating an applied moving load from the measured strain and using the information of a load distribution is developed using a representative beam model. Also, the effect of different parameters affecting the estimation of load is quantified using the strain-load relation. To get an estimation of an applied moving load on an average sense, least square analyses were introduced. It was found that if the information of the uncertainties in parameters is included to estimate the load with help of the Weighted Least Square, the results were significantly improved. Further, in absence of the information about the uncertainty in parameters, usefulness of the iterative reweighting least square – a heuristic least square method – is also checked. Least square methods also gave insight to the suitability of different strain measurement positions by the measure of a goodness of fit. It is concluded that if the information of load distribution and uncertainty in parameter is used, in addition to the measured strain, to estimate the applied moving load; the resulting estimation is accurate up to 2.5% with 95% confidence bounds for a certain strain measurement positions using Weighted Least Square method. This methodology will be useful for further exploration in the field of a Load Sensing Bearing to improve the load estimation and as well as to formulate the optimization strategy for the placement of strain gauges on the bearing.","Load Sensing Bearing; Load Estimation; Strain; Uncertainty Analysis; Weighted Least Square","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","Engineering Mechanics","",""

(mentor); Van der Helm, A.J.C. (mentor); Schutte, S. (mentor)","2016","In this project, a solution and prototype was developed for Mapiq that enables users in shared workspace environments to find a workspace, and increases the effective efficiency of existing resources through a social system. In shared workspace environments such as university libraries and an increasing number of offices (like clients of Mapiq), desks are allocated through the first-come first-serve method. This creates uncertainty with the users of these workspaces, as they are never sure where a workspace is available. The first part of the system is a method of reliably measuring a human presence at a desk. Knowing whether or not someone is sitting at a desk is the first step in collecting the information needed to show users a free workspace. The second part is the design of a set of interactions and rules that encourage people to provide the extra information that is needed. This extra information is needed because people tend to leave their belongings on a desk to claim it, even though they are not present, a bit like the behaviour that can be seen with pool chairs in holiday resorts. If a purely sensor based approach was used, there would exist large discrepancies between the information in Mapiq. These two parts come together in the design of the ""Desktimer"", a small device that is placed under each desk. This device allows users to make ad-hoc ‘reverse reservations‘. If a user provides an estimated time of absence, a desk will go into ‘temporarily free‘ mode, allowing other people to use the desk in the meantime. The solution was arrived at through a process of iteration and evaluation, with a final large scale user test to test the most important hypotheses that informed the design. The functional prototype was developed through a simultaneously performed iterative process, and culminated in a device that is capabable of all the designed user interactions.","DFI; interaction; workspaces; prototyping; iteration; social system","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2018-03-31","Industrial Design Engineering","Human Information Communication Design","","","",""

It explores whether interpersonal touch that is mediated has the same social and cognitive effects as unmediated touch, and in particular how rich the medium needs to be to induce certain responses. The increased interest in mediated touch for interpersonal interactions that has been developing over the recent years has resulted in various studies and prototypes. The application of these prototypes shows interesting potential: communication of simple ideas, establishment of emotional connectedness between distant lovers, or even recovery from stress. An intriguing component of human touch is physical warmth. Warm physical contact could potentially increase feelings of interpersonal warmth, causing a subconscious influence on our social judgment of others as having a ‘warm’ (generous, caring) personality. The suitability of thermal stimuli as a modality for the communication of specific information has been investigated on several occasions. It appears particularly suitable for communication of emotionally charged messages. The discrete nature of thermal stimuli and apparent suitability for affective communication, alongside the supposed ability to increase psychological interpersonal warmth, create plausible reason to think that it could be a valuable medium for individuals who have trouble recognizing and expressing emotional information through more traditional channels. This inability to recognize and express emotions is part of a personality construct called ‘alexithymia’. To gain a deeper understanding of the opportunities and limitations of warm, mediated social touch, this master thesis explores how mediated touch and physical warmth could be applied as a wearable messaging tool to create an emotional connection between an alexithymic and a non-alexithymic partner. By conducting explorative user tests with the thermal messaging prototype, a comprehensive overview has been formed of the importance of certain themes for creating the desired interaction. The tests have also provided rich insights on the user perception and experience of using thermal messaging to communicate affectively in this specific context.","mediated social touch; physical warmth; alexithymia; affective communication","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2016","The problem of testing the performance of an attitude control system presents new challenges and opportunities when conducted on a CubeSat scale. This is the result of drastic reduction in physical properties (size, mass, torques) as well as project resources (funds, manpower, time) when compared to traditional satellite programs. This thesis presents an analysis of the problem of validating active attitude control of a CubeSat before launch and a proposed methodology that is demonstrated on the Colorado Space Grant Consortium’s PolarCube satellite. In order for an attitude control system’s performance to be measured, it must be provided with a physical environment that allows the system to act similarly to how it would in orbit and its behavior must be recorded in such a way that metrics of performance can be derived. To date, published tests of this nature on CubeSats have been limited in their precision due to uncertainty in external torques on the attitude control system and have mostly been conducted on commercially available attitude control system modules. A string suspension testbed was chosen to provide a simulation of microgravity that allows the system to rotate free of friction. This thesis builds on the practices for string suspension testing developed for the MicroMAS CubeSat mission in which a ""fit-predict-fit"" method of producing metrics of attitude control system performance was first implemented for CubeSats. The project set out to identify and solve points of failure that were limiting measurement performance of the tests conducted on the MicroMAS system and ultimately produce more accurate measurements and predictions of testbed and attitude control system dynamic response. An engineering model of the satellite bus was designed and built to provide independent power, wireless communication and data handling to the attitude determination and control subsystem. An attitude determination method was developed using MEMS magnetometers, accelerometers and rate gyroscopes to operate within a laboratory environment. A model of the dynamics of the test model’s behavior in the testbed was created to generate predictions of the test model’s response to test conditions, act as a platform to compare measured and expected test results, and verify the attitude determination method. Attitude determination performance was determined through a combination of direct testing and dynamics modeling in software. The methods found a maximum (worst case scenario) heading determination error of 4.6 ? after feed-forward correction based on characterization tests. Oscillation tests were used to determine the external torque properties of the string suspension testbed to within two significant figures, a drastic improvement in performance compared to the MicroMAS test results. Less than $300 were spent on hardware dedicated to testing. The overall system is marked by its simplicity and cost-effectiveness. The results will render attitude control validation testing and consequently the use of active attitude control more accessible to future CubeSat missions. Improvements in performance when compared to the MicroMAS test results were identified as the result of more robust and flexible software modelling of string suspension testbed dynamics, improved methods of characterizing testbed external torque properties as well as improved attitude determination performance.","attitude; control; CubeSat; string; test; hardware in the loop; determination; testbed; method; microgravity; simulation; validation; XBee; Arduino; PolarCube; Space Grant; TU; Delft; Boulder; pointing; magnetometer; imu; system; ALL-STAR; COSGC; nanosatellite; satellite; reaction wheel","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Spaceflight","","Space Engineering","",""

Using non-uniform fluid oscillations it even showed possible to make particles hover or rise against gravity. Non-uniform fluid oscillations are defined as sawtooth-like wave shapes, whereas uniform oscillations are found using sinusoidal wave shapes. This thesis uses the nonlinear Boussinesq, Basset and Oseen (BBO) equation to numerically predict single particle migration (horizontal) and settling (vertical) behavior, using non-uniform fluid oscillations. It was found that particle migration and an improvement in average settling velocity of approximately 2.5 times the terminal velocity are numerically possible by using non-uniform fluid oscillations. These average relative particle velocities proved to occur due to the inclusion of the history or Basset force.","hindered settling; oscillations; solids; migration; non-uniform; uniform; settling; basset; history","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore & Dredging Engineering","","Dredging Engineering","",""

(mentor); Trottemant, E. (mentor)","2016","Allseas engineering BV is an offshore company that uses underwater vehicles for conducting subsea operations. The two primary classification of such underwater vehicles are: Remote operated vehicle (ROV) and Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). As the names suggests, the former requires a human operator to control and the latter is a fully autonomous vehicle. As of now, the company (and most of the offshore industries) customarily use ROVs. In the recent past, Allseas was inclined to use AUVs as a measure of reducing the operational costs and conducted tests runs with an industrial grade AUV. But the test runs were unsuccessful and the plan of using such an AUV was dropped. It was concluded that the major problem was in launch and recovery operations of the AUV, which were conducted from the deck of a ship. To be specific, the disturbances from the ship’s thrusters, ocean currents, and waves, were proved to be impossible to compensate for by the AUV during the launch and recovery operations. Therefore, this thesis aims to investigate on underwater docking capabilities of AUVs, which not only eliminates the launch and recovery issues but improves AUV’s overall operational capabilities. In this thesis, a docking problem is formulated and the solution to the problem covers the following aspects: modeling of AUV, motion control of AUV, and guidance strategies. For the motion control, an appropriate model of the vehicle is necessary. Various models used in the literature were studied which include: 6 degree of freedom (DOF) non-linear model, 3-DOF horizontal plane model, and 3-DOF vertical plane model. As an example, a 6-DOF non-linear model of ARIES AUV from literature was decoupled into the respective 3-DOF models. These models are used for controller design and docking strategies. A linear parameter varying (LPV) frame work based, gain scheduled feedback and feed forward controllers were developed for the control of vehicle heading and depth. The controller design involves the following steps: Firstly, a third order Quasi- LPV control plant for heading and depth were derived from horizontal and vertical plane models. Then, linear controllers (gains) were designed for fixed values of scheduling variables. Based on the dimension of the scheduling variables, a stability preserving interpolation of these gains were performed to obtain the final controller. A PI controller was designed for controlling the longitudinal velocity of the vehicle. The performance of the controllers were checked on 6 DOF and 3 DOF models of the ARIES AUV. Finally, two docking strategies: Three point and N-point, were developed using lookahead based path following and investigated their performance for two scenarios: stationary dock and non-stationary dock. The docking strategies addressed the docking problem in two aspects: geometric path generation and path following. Finally, the controller performance in closed loop, as in, the guidance, tracking controllers, and vehicle dynamics was compared for the two developed strategies. It was shown that the N-point docking strategy yielded better convergence to the paths than the three point docking.","autonomous underwater vehicle; remote operated vehicle","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","systems and control","",""

However, fewer studies are reported on the application of this technology. The objective of this thesis, undertaken from October 2014 until June 2015 at Delft University of Technology, was to offer the methodology in the optimization of the LED-based photocatalytic reactor. A model-based optimization methodology is proposed for an annular photocatalytic reactor which is used to purify the toluene in the air. Based on the mathematical model developed in the previous studies, a multi-variable optimization methodology is formulated in gPROMS with which all the optimization assignments were carried out. The objective of optimization is to maximize the conversion of the toluene while minimizing the investment spent. The optimization of the reactor is achieved by changing the design variables, which are related to the reactor dimension and light sources. Several optimizations were performed from a simple two-variable assignment to the complicated one with four variables. The optimization results demonstrate that the multi-variable optimization methodology successfully achieved the reactor optimization. Several geometric parameters, such as reactor length and radius, are crucial in determining the performance of the reactor which mainly concerns the light distribution and mass transfer in the reactor. Therefore, the optimal dimension of the reactor is shown based on the optimization results. In addition, the issues of difficulty in solving numerical algebraic equations and weakness of gPROMS with higher order are also discussed.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Shimmy, or wobble, denotes the unstable self-excited oscillatory motion of the wheel around the steering axis and can be found in vehicles with castor wheels. For bicycles this oscillatory motion is normally in the range between 5 - 13 Hz. Shimmy could be frightening, dangerous and even fatal if not controlled in time. The introduction of electric bicycles led to a growing occurrence of shimmy at low speeds and thereby raised the demand for a better understanding of this phenomenon. Desirably, it is known which parameters must be adjusted to prevent shimmy in future bicycle designs. However, the literature study prior to this thesis revealed that this is rather complex and many contradictory results were found. This raised the demand for a model that could predict the behaviour, and hence the influence of parameters on the wobble mode. The most widely used bicycle model nowadays, the Whipple-Carvallo bicycle model can not predict shimmy behaviour and it became clear that the bicycle model must be extended with additional degrees of freedom to account for frame compliances. The position and orientation of this degree(s) of freedom affect the predictions. However, it was unknown which additions should be made for correctly predicting shimmy and the predictions could not be validated with measurement data. Within this study, the shimmy vibrations of four female and two male bicycle models are measured for three different drivers with 16 to 19 accelerometers, a steer angle sensor and a speedometer. The frequency and amplitude growth are extracted as a function of forward speed. The corresponding bicycle-driver parameters are also measured. Both results accommodate the validation of bicycle models that can predict shimmy behaviour. The typical mode of vibration is also extracted and it was observed that front fork, rear frame and rear rack bending is apparent. The driver also oscillates in the shimmy frequency and relative motions between the driver and bicycle were observed. The deformations of the rear frame appeared to be complex and can be approximately described by deflections around two lines in the frame; One more vertical and one more horizontal line. The mode shapes give directions for improving the model-based shimmy predictions.","shimmy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-03-18","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Hekkenberg, R.G. (mentor); Romeijn, A. (mentor); Dijk, M. (mentor)","2016","In the last decades a lot of oil platforms have been built. According to Infield (Infield, 2015), there are over 800 oil platforms out in the ocean. These platforms need to be decommissioned at the end of their lifetime. The Pioneering Spirit (PS), is a state-of-the-art multi-purpose twin hull vessel with the capability to decommission and install oil and gas platforms. To lift these platforms, the vessel is equipped with the so called Topside Lift System (TLS). This system enables the vessel to decommission or install complete topsides, up to a weight of 48,000 tonnes, in one single action. During the design of the PS, limited detailed information on platforms was available. With more information revealed by various tenders, the widening procedure during the new-build-phase was initiated. However, even after this widening, the vessel is not able to handle all existing platforms. The extreme dimensions of several platforms makes it challenging to design a ship which is suitable for all platforms. In this research, the most cost effective modification to extend the topside lifting capabilities of the Pioneering Spirit is investigated. To find this modification, first the performance limiting factors, with respect to topside lifting, of the vessel are identified. Research indicates that the performance limiting factors of the vessel, are influenced by five topside characteristics. These characteristics describe the topside and its location; the weight of the topside, the length of the platform, the width of the platform, the air gap under the topside and the water-depth. The performance limiting factors are used to identify the group of platforms which cannot be lifted by the PS. This group of platforms forms the potential market for the modified vessel. For this potential market, Allseas’ platform database is used. The database is based on data of Infield (Infield, 2015) and contains over 750 platforms worldwide. For the PS, topsides with a weight of less than 10,000 tonnes are not relevant. Unfortunately, the information in the database is not complete for each platform. Platforms that lack essential information are not taken into account. The known potential market for the PS contains 37 platforms, with a topside weight range between 18,000 and 52,000 tonnes. Many of these platforms suffer from more than one limitation of the vessel. The potential platforms are used as a guideline to assess viable modification concepts. For instance, the maximum liftable weight does not need to be higher than the heaviest potential platform. There are four viable concepts generated to overcome the performance limiting factors. These are: adding additional TLS beams, extending the vessel’s bows, widening the slot and use connection bridges. These concepts are combined in several different modifications to extend the lifting capability. To be able to compare the modifications, on a ratio between the investment, running costs and income, two key figures are used. The return on investment (RoI), which indicates the efficiency of the investment (Investopedia, n.d.) and the financial result. In case the RoI of multiple modifications are equal, the financial result will be decisive. The most cost effective modification is a small modification with only the connection bridge. This modification enables the system to lift 4 additional platforms.","Pioneering Spirit; Pieter Schelte; Allseas; Topside; Decommissioning; Design; Modification","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-03-30","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Marine & Transport Technology","","(MT) Design, Production and Operation","",""

(mentor)","2016","Double degree thesis: Part A: Civil Engineering Part B: Science Communication The first forms of automated vehicles (level 1 and 2) are already available at dealers, and next levels are being developed at this moment (level 3 and up). Literature indicates two development paths for automated vehicles: an autonomous and a cooperative path. Autonomous vehicles only monitor the driving environment, whereas cooperative vehicles also communicate with other vehicles or roadside systems. This thesis consists of two parts: one (part A) researching the mobility impact of these two development paths, the second (part B) develops a method to include the public in decision making around automated vehicles. Part A: Modelling the mobility impacts of automated vehicles Governments are eager to know the impacts that automated vehicles have on mobility. Investment plans and policies can be made with this information. Current macroscopic models that assess the large-scale impacts of automated vehicles are complex, unsuitable for explorations with many uncertainties and are not able to simulate multiple vehicle types. This thesis aims to explore the impacts of early forms of automated vehicles (level 1, 2 and 3) on mobility. To cope with this problem a System Dynamics model (SD-model) is built. This model is based on the structure of the ScenarioExplorer, a model developed by TNO in the 1990s. The SD-model is strongly explorative and does not make use of an explicit road network. The goal of this model is to capture the most important effects of automated vehicles, but not to go into all the details. As the structure is simple and the run time is short, the model can be used to assess different scenarios. In this model the road capacity, value of time and fuel economy effects of automated vehicles are researched. The different levels of automated vehicles are modelled as different user classes in the mode choice, time of day choice and the assignment. This is novel for modelling automated vehicles on a large scale. In the assignment PCU factors depended on the penetration rate are used per vehicle automation class. This PCU makes it possible to translate results of microsimulations easily to large scale models and to simulate mixed traffic. The SD-model is compared to three macroscopic models and historic data and shows similar results. In addition, other tests point out that the model is suitable for explorative studies. Simulations with the SD-model show that due to the benefits automated vehicles bring, they will lead to extra car traffic in all researched scenarios. In the cooperative development path, the travel times on characteristic relations will roughly stay the same due to capacity benefits. In the autonomous development path, the average speeds drop due to less capacity benefits. The model shows that early forms of automated vehicles will not reduce congestion and in most scenarios have a negative effect on mobility. The only benefits early forms of automated vehicles entail are for the drivers, but not for mobility as a whole. Governments should therefore invest in other measures to stimulate the mobility. Due to the increase in car traffic, more emissions are expected. Part B: A more responsible innovation through the use of a constructive dialogue Societal impacts of automated vehicles can be large, not only on mobility, but also on safety, privacy or security. Complicating aspect is that automated vehicles both influence the living environment of the consumers and other road users. Literature indicates that at this moment the public (both user and other road users) are important stakeholders, but are not enough involved in the automated vehicle innovation. Due to this, and other flaws, the automated vehicle innovation cannot be called a responsible innovation. not involving the public constitutes the risk of neglecting their fundamental ethical principles, as their opinions remain unheard. This research aims to develop a method to involve important actors and to translate their ethical principles into starting points for a design of future automated vehicles. The values of four important actor groups (the government, manufacturers, consumers and non-consumers) are investigated. The method aims to be a constructive dialogue method. The value profiles created from the questionnaire show that opinions of the various actors differ. All actors agree that safety is the most important value. Differences are that the government and non-consumer value traffic flow, whereas the car manufacturers value spending time differently and self-determination for the driver. The cooperative path therefore seems attractive for the government and the non-users, whereas the car manufacturers are most likely to be in favour of the autonomous path. The survey shows no preference for one of the two paths from the consumer. The value profiles created from the questionnaire show that opinions of the actors differ. All actors agree that safety is the most important value. Differences are that the government and non-consumer value traffic flow, whereas the car manufacturers value spending time differently and self-determination for the driver. The cooperative path therefore seems attractive for the government and the non-users, whereas the car manufacturers are in favour of the autonomous path. The survey shows no preference for one of the two paths for the consumer. To create a common value profile a dialogue is needed, this is done in workshops. Tests with the constructive dialogue workshops show promising results: tensions in values become clear and the students reach consensus in the workshop. This is empirical evidence for what Van de Poel (2013) describes in his paper on specifying values to design requirements. The set-up seems to be a way to involve the different actors. This method is therefore a step towards a more responsible innovation for automated vehicles. Another promising aspect of the method is that the new ideas which are not mentioned in literature on self-driving cars arise in the sessions. This research contributes to a more responsible innovation as stakeholders are involved. Still, other important steps have to be taken. The method which is developed in this thesis should be used by manufacturers to give input to future designs or by governments for policies. Future research should focus on the validation of the workshops and the embedding of the method.","Self-driving car; Automated vehicle; Value sensitive design; Responsible reserach and innovation; RRI; System Dynamics; Mobility; Simulation; Double degree","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","Science Communication Track","","","",""

The business models and product designs of companies that are able to profit from an above average product lifetime were studied. The levels of applicability of product design strategies for the business model archetypes of the framework were studied by comparing measured levels of application to the indications in the framework. Using the acquired data, possible relationships with product classes and types were analysed statistically.

The aim of the thesis is to establish a well validated fully nonlinear numerical wave tank for the simulations of complex fluid-structure interaction of moored floating offshore structures. The numerical computations are carried out using the fully nonlinear numerical fluid-structure interaction solvers, interFoam and interDyMFoam, from the open-source CFD libraryOpenFOAM®. These solvers make use of a fully nonlinearNavier-Stokes/VOF solver for the computations of the two-phase flow field, where the interDyMFoam solver also utilises a 6-DOF motion solver to compute the motions of the floating structure. These solvers were extended with waves2Foam, a wave generation and absorption toolbox, developed by Jacobsen et al. (2012). The extended interFoam and interDyMFoam solvers, hereafter referred to as the waveFoam and interDyMFoam solver, were utilised for the computations of fluid-structure with fixed and moving structures respectively. Furthermore, an implementation of catenary mooring lines is provided by Niels Jacobsen (Researcher/advisor at Deltares), for the simulations of the mooring system of the floating structure. Finally, the fully nonlinear potential flow solver, OceanWave3D, was utilised in a fully nonlinear and fully parallelised domain decomposed solver, developed by Paulsen (2013) and Paulsen et al. (2014b), for the efficient computations of realistic sea states. Here, the outer wave field is described by the potential flow solver, whereas the inner wave field, in the vicinity of a given structure, is described by the interDyMFoam solver. The waveFoam and waveDyMFoam solvers are carefully validated either in terms of convergence by grid refinement or by comparisons to experimental measurements. Special attention is paid to the waveDyMFoam solver with respect to the computation of the flow induced motions of a moored floating wind turbine. The ability of the numerical model to accurately reproduce experiments, performed with the generic OC5 floating wind turbine model in the MARIN Concept Basin, is also investigated. The Navier-Stokes/VOF basedwaveFoam andwaveDyMFoam solvers were evaluated with respect to wave propagation and wave structure interaction in a two-dimensional set-up. A grid convergence study was performed on the propagation of a fully nonlinear stream function wave. The convergence rate of the two-phase numerical solution to the single-phase stream function solution was verified. Successful computation of wave loading on a partially submerged fixed horizontal cylinder was provided. The accuracy of the numerical model, with respect to fluid-structure interaction for free and forced motion of a structure, was verified with the generation of surface waves by the forced oscillation and the free heave decay of a horizontal cylinder. These two-dimensional cases were also used to verify the efficiency of two meshing tools, provided by the OpenFOAM® toolbox. These meshing tools were shown to provide excellent results, and more importantly, provided a less complicated method for generating surface boundary meshes of complex three-dimensional structures. The waveDyMFoam solver is used for the computation of free and moored decay test of the three-dimensional floating wind turbine model. The accuracy of the numerical solution was verified against numerical computations from the work of Dunbar et al. (2015) and physical experiments performed at MARIN. Finally, a proof-of-concept case is performed, involving the modelling of a three-dimensional moored floating wind turbine subjected to irregular uni-directional waves. In these numerical computations, the potential of the waveDyMFoam and the domain decomposition strategy are evaluated.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Offshore Engineering","","Floating Structures","",""

(mentor)","2016","Declining production, continuously rising cost levels, low oil prices and the subsequent declining reserves, are forcing the oil and gas industry to reduce its operating expenditures. This study focuses on how the best maintenance policies for the power generation on unmanned satellite gas platforms of Total Exploration and Production Netherlands can be found. The research question is stated as follows: ""What is the optimal maintenance interval for power generation on a satellite gas platform to maximize net income?"" To answer the research question, a reliability model, based on a published model, has been designed. The model assumes a continuously degradation of technical system. A published model for parameter assessment of a maintained technical system is used to estimate the failure behavior of the technical system. Consequently, the maintenance actions that can be done on the technical system are assessed by defining two improvement parameters. These assess the executing time and define the maintenance related costs. A decision model determines what preventive maintenance action is most cost efficient, while maintaining a specified minimum reliability level. A case study on two satellite gas platforms is carried out. The two platforms differ significantly in daily production. As a result, the low producing gas platform has more potential to reduce costs than the high producing platform. The low producing platform needs to decrease its maintenance activities significantly to reduce cost, while the high producing platform needs a high minimum reliability level in order to avoid too much downtime. This research provides a scientific basis to determine whether the production rate of an asset is low enough to reduce the maintenance activities that are in place. It's recommended by the author to focus more on cause of failure in corrective maintenance logging. Also, the study needs to be repeated in more detail to get a better understanding of the technical systems. Lastly, the research has to be done on all mechanical systems that have to be included in the ``long fix'' interval to determine whether a save in costs of logistics can be made.","Maintenance","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-03-28","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Secretary of the section Offshore and Dredging Engineering Secretary of the section Ship Design, Production and Operations Maritime and Transport Technology Department (M&TT)","","Offshore Engineering","",""

The plasma actuator efficiency was tested for dielectric barriers with a thickness between 0.5 and 1.5mm and made out of four different materials: Kapton, Lexan, PTFE and silicone rubber. Also, ns-DBD plasma actuators were investigated for their use as de-icing devices.

The ns-DBD plasma actuator could serve a double purpose on a wind turbine rotor blade by being both a flow-control device and a de-icing device.

(mentor); Sonneveld, M.H. (mentor)","2016","Introduction into the subject: ?Over the last years, more Dutch citizens have been travelling around the world and unfortunately this leads to more Dutch patients in hospitals in far away countries. This results in more requests by Dutch patients to be repatriated (transported back home) by airplane. Some of these patients are intensive care (IC) patients, who are very fragile and require extra medical devices, such as a breathing system. Repatriating IC patients by airplane can be divided into three main steps: 1. The patient is transported from a foreign hospital to the medical cabin inside the airplane. ? 2. The patient is then transported by air. ?3. Finally, the patient is transported from the medical cabin to a hospital in the Netherlands. Because existing medical transport services are expensive and required a lot of time, a new safe and fast service was designed, the Guardian journey. The design was established by five master students during a Joint Master Project in 2014. ?Currently, the Guardian journey mainly covers the second and third steps of repatriation. ?The second step is covered by a modular medical cabin and is named the Guardian concept. The Guardian concept can be installed in a commercial airplane and is equipped with all the necessary medical devices to treat IC patients. The third step is covered by the existing Mobile Intensive Care Unit (MICU) service. MICU safely transports IC patients on the road to the hospital. ?? The first step of repatriation is not yet included in the Guardian journey. Research shows that this part is the most critical part of the entire repatriation. This graduation project offers a solution to this problem with a safe transport situation for the first step. The solution also supports a safe transport of the IC patient from the medical cabin to the MICU in the third step. Problems in the first step ?In the first step the main problems occur when the patient is moved between the bed or stretcher and when the patient is brought to the transport vehicle. Problem 1 ?Lines connecting the patient to medical devices get loose or twisted. Problem 2 ?Medical devices flip or fall off the stretcher or bed. Both problems could lead to the patient becoming disconnected from the medical devices. If this happens, the patient is not provided with medication or can no longer be monitored by the medical team. This could lead to life-threatening situations. Problem 3 ?Because the first step has not been considered yet, no attention has been given to how the medical team should operate and cooperate. Moreover, working with medical experts from a foreign country presents new issues due to culture differences. Research: ?The first step to designing a safe transport situation was conducting research in the intensive care field. The outcomes of this research are summarized in the following four crucial aspects, which are used as base for creating the final design. Including these four aspects also provides a solution to the problems defined in the first step.?? 1. Having the patient be connected to the medical devices at all times. ?2. Monitoring the patient at all times. 3. Coordinated working procedure 4. Clear communication Final design: ?The final design consists of two parts, a mat-system and two accompanying guidelines. Mat-system: ?The IC patient, medical devices and the lines are installed on the mat-system, according to one configuration. This way the patient and medical devices are safely transferred between bed or stretcher as one package in one go. With strips the medical devices and line are fixed on the mat-system. As a result, the medical devices and lines are in a stable position, ensuring the vital connection between patient and medical devices. In addition, the monitors are visible for the medical experts at all times. ??Besides using the mat-system to transport the IC patient from a foreign hospital to the medical cabin (step 1), it can also be used to safely transport the IC patient from the medical cabin to the MICU outside the airplane in step 3. Accompanying guidelines: ?The accompanying guidelines support a coordinated working procedure and clear communication for using the mat-system in the first step. The first guideline tells the medical team step by step how the IC patient and the medical devices need to be installed on the mat-system. ?The second guideline describes the installation steps of the IC patient on mat-system in the medical cabin in airplane. Color-system: ?The final design consists of a color-system. Hereby each medical devices is allocated to one color. On the mat-system, the color-system is used to indicate with which strip the medical devices and lines must be fixed. The same color system is applied in the two guidelines to support the medical team with a correct and fast installation. The color system is also applied in the interior of the Guardian concept to indicate the positions of the medical devices on the wall and medical unit. ?Evaluation of the final design and the next step: ?A prototype is made of the mat-system and is together with the guidelines tested in a User Study. After testing and evaluating, it is concluded that the final design can offer a solution to the problems identified in the first step and can create a safe transport situation in the first (and partly third) step. Including a safe transport in the first step will bring realization of a complete Guardian journey closer. To make the final design reality the following main actions are recommended. First, the prototype must be improved according to the defined recommendations. Next, the improved prototype must be tested with more medical experts and (real) patients. Hereby it is important to test how the installed patient and medical devices on the mat-system are transferred between beds. Second, it is recommended to investigate the usability of the final design in the third step. At last, a business plan needs to be written. Hereby it is essential to analyze the commercial feasibility of the final design.","transport; design; healthcare; patient; Guardian","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Snelder, M. (mentor); van Nes, R. (mentor); Wiggenraad, P. (mentor); Van Daalen, E. (mentor); De Vries, M. (mentor); Flipse, S. (mentor); Wehrmann, C. (mentor)","2016","Double degree thesis: Part A: Civil Engineering Part B: Science Communication The first forms of automated vehicles (level 1 and 2) are already available at dealers, and next levels are being developed at this moment (level 3 and up). Literature indicates two development paths for automated vehicles: an autonomous and a cooperative path. Autonomous vehicles only monitor the driving environment, whereas cooperative vehicles also communicate with other vehicles or roadside systems. This thesis consists of two parts: one (part A) researching the mobility impact of these two development paths, the second (part B) develops a method to include the public in decision making around automated vehicles. Part A: Modelling the mobility impacts of automated vehicles Governments are eager to know the impacts that automated vehicles have on mobility. Investment plans and policies can be made with this information. Current macroscopic models that assess the large-scale impacts of automated vehicles are complex, unsuitable for explorations with many uncertainties and are not able to simulate multiple vehicle types. This thesis aims to explore the impacts of early forms of automated vehicles (level 1, 2 and 3) on mobility. To cope with this problem a System Dynamics model (SD-model) is built. This model is based on the structure of the ScenarioExplorer, a model developed by TNO in the 1990s. The SD-model is strongly explorative and does not make use of an explicit road network. The goal of this model is to capture the most important effects of automated vehicles, but not to go into all the details. As the structure is simple and the run time is short, the model can be used to assess different scenarios. In this model the road capacity, value of time and fuel economy effects of automated vehicles are researched. The different levels of automated vehicles are modelled as different user classes in the mode choice, time of day choice and the assignment. This is novel for modelling automated vehicles on a large scale. In the assignment PCU factors depended on the penetration rate are used per vehicle automation class. This PCU makes it possible to translate results of microsimulations easily to large scale models and to simulate mixed traffic. The SD-model is compared to three macroscopic models and historic data and shows similar results. In addition, other tests point out that the model is suitable for explorative studies. Simulations with the SD-model show that due to the benefits automated vehicles bring, they will lead to extra car traffic in all researched scenarios. In the cooperative development path, the travel times on characteristic relations will roughly stay the same due to capacity benefits. In the autonomous development path, the average speeds drop due to less capacity benefits. The model shows that early forms of automated vehicles will not reduce congestion and in most scenarios have a negative effect on mobility. The only benefits early forms of automated vehicles entail are for the drivers, but not for mobility as a whole. Governments should therefore invest in other measures to stimulate the mobility. Due to the increase in car traffic, more emissions are expected. Part B: A more responsible innovation through the use of a constructive dialogue Societal impacts of automated vehicles can be large, not only on mobility, but also on safety, privacy or security. Complicating aspect is that automated vehicles both influence the living environment of the consumers and other road users. Literature indicates that at this moment the public (both user and other road users) are important stakeholders, but are not enough involved in the automated vehicle innovation. Due to this, and other flaws, the automated vehicle innovation cannot be called a responsible innovation. not involving the public constitutes the risk of neglecting their fundamental ethical principles, as their opinions remain unheard. This research aims to develop a method to involve important actors and to translate their ethical principles into starting points for a design of future automated vehicles. The values of four important actor groups (the government, manufacturers, consumers and non-consumers) are investigated. The method aims to be a constructive dialogue method. The value profiles created from the questionnaire show that opinions of the various actors differ. All actors agree that safety is the most important value. Differences are that the government and non-consumer value traffic flow, whereas the car manufacturers value spending time differently and self-determination for the driver. The cooperative path therefore seems attractive for the government and the non-users, whereas the car manufacturers are most likely to be in favour of the autonomous path. The survey shows no preference for one of the two paths from the consumer. The value profiles created from the questionnaire show that opinions of the actors differ. All actors agree that safety is the most important value. Differences are that the government and non-consumer value traffic flow, whereas the car manufacturers value spending time differently and self-determination for the driver. The cooperative path therefore seems attractive for the government and the non-users, whereas the car manufacturers are in favour of the autonomous path. The survey shows no preference for one of the two paths for the consumer. To create a common value profile a dialogue is needed, this is done in workshops. Tests with the constructive dialogue workshops show promising results: tensions in values become clear and the students reach consensus in the workshop. This is empirical evidence for what Van de Poel (2013) describes in his paper on specifying values to design requirements. The set-up seems to be a way to involve the different actors. This method is therefore a step towards a more responsible innovation for automated vehicles. Another promising aspect of the method is that the new ideas which are not mentioned in literature on self-driving cars arise in the sessions. This research contributes to a more responsible innovation as stakeholders are involved. Still, other important steps have to be taken. The method which is developed in this thesis should be used by manufacturers to give input to future designs or by governments for policies. Future research should focus on the validation of the workshops and the embedding of the method.","Self-driving car; Automated vehicle; Value sensitive design; Responsible reserach and innovation; RRI; System Dynamics; Mobility; Simulation; Double degree","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-03-25","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transportation and Planning","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Wearable devices have paved way for several context-aware applications in the field of health-care and sports to improve the well-being of users and their performance for human augmentation. During rehabilitation patients need accurate feedback that can empower and improve the speed of recovery. On the other hand competitive athletes need a reliable, flexible and real-time feedback on their performance and technique. In this thesis, we present a framework capable of performing Micro-Activities Recognition (MAR) by decomposing complex activities. These models employ data only from the wearable devices. We present two real-world applications, viz., (i) the analysis of the Lunge exercise performed during knee rehabilitation and (ii) the study of the Stroke activity in long-track speed skating. Hitherto, most of the models used additional data such as camera and 3D tracking for identifying activities. The models proposed in this thesis aims to go one step forward to understand fine-grained activity (micro-activity) information. In knee rehabilitation, we proposed models to identify the exercise performed by the patient and its micro-activities. Providing feedback in these systems is non-trivial due to the overlapping labels. The feedback provided using the models proposed is based on the labels that are highly similar. In speed skating, we aim to identify the micro-activities of the stroke to determine its frequency, and other characteristics of the speed skaters. The model identified the top signal/IMU that can classify a stroke and its micro-activities accurately. The top signal identified the correct number of strokes across all laps. The model was also able to classify a stroke performed in straight and curve sections. Furthermore, the average length and offset values of a stroke for a complete lap is 5.4% and 135 ms respectively. In this thesis, we derive fine-grained activity information using data from IMUs. The models identified the top signal that maximizes the micro-activity recognition among all the signals. This information can be used to determine the optimal placement of IMUs and also to reduce the data collection/processing. The fine-grained information obtained using MAR can provide meaningful feedback for human augmentation systems.","wearable; activity recognition; machine learning; pattern recognition; sport engineering; speed skating; rehabilitation; embedded system; smart devices; gesture recognition; Human Augmentation; IMU; knee rehabilitation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2017-04-29","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Embedded Software Group","","Embedded Systems","",""

This is of particular importance for front suspension and steering system as the latter is the only tactile connection between road and driver. The vibration feedback from the tires to the steering wheel delivers both useful and disturbing information for the driver. Both effects build up the disturbance response of a coupled system, consisting of subsystems such as the tire, front suspension, power steering and upper steering column. A brief summary is given on the current state of the vehicle development process with the focus on steering (sub)system development. Potential risks, challenges as well as possibilities are presented. Gaps in the development process are identified in both the target cascading phase as in the validation phase, potentially allowing to significantly decrease development time while simultaneously reducing costs. Structuring methods such as LM FBS have great potential to close both gaps, as within the framework of LM FBS both coupling (predicting) and decoupling (target cascading) are theoretically possible. The dynamic behavior of individual subsystems is coupled allowing for a quantitative prediction of the performance of the steering in the early development phase. Decoupling of the steering system allows to some extent to cascade requirements from total vehicle level to (sub)system level. Thereby enabling concurrent design as requirements are no longer reliant on the mutual influence of (sub)systems on each other, allowing groups to work parallel on different (sub)systems. The accuracy of the coupled and/or decoupled responses is judged with reference to full system simulation models or subsystem models (tires, suspension, steering gear, upper steering column).","Substructuring","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-03-29","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","Engineering Dynamics","",""

The soil is improved by the use of a column supported embankment, consisting of sand columns installed in a soft soil layer and a sand platform. The efficiency of this method is defined in terms of stress transfer and settlement reduction. When the soil improvement is finished and the land will be used, there are conditions concerning bearing capacity and settlement behavior. To this extent two important parameters were defined. i.e. the incremental efficiency (the load increase in a sand column over the total surface load increase) and incremental settlement reduction ratio (the settlement of the improved soil over the settlement of the unimproved soil (i.e. soil that has not been improved by sand columns), under loading). To determine the efficiency of the soil improvement, a number of tests were performed on site. Tests included plate load tests (in this thesis referred to as zone load tests). The load tests were simulated in Plaxis, with the known load/settlement results the model could be benchmarked. Furthermore soil samples were taken and tested to determine the local soil characteristics. The parameters derived from the soil tests are also used in the Plaxis calculations. Plaxis allows for a step-by-step consolidation of the soft soil in which the columns were installed. It can be seen that the stress distribution changes for different stages of consolidation. The columns are first constrained by the very stiff soft soil layer (due to high excess pore pressures under loading). When the pore pressures dissipate the constraining stress is lowered and the column head expands. Under vertical loading the stress in the column head has a funnel shape, due to the displacements in the outer ring of the column head. Based on the Plaxis calculations it can be concluded that when a load is activated on top of a surface of soil that has been improved by the use of sand columns (with a center-to-center distance of three meters), given that the platform is thick enough, 60% of that load is transferred to the column. With a greater center-to-center distance between the columns that percentage decreases, e.g. 28% for a column spacing of five meters. Compared to existing theories by Hewlett and Randolph (1988) and Zaeske (2001) (it should be noted that most existing theories assume presence of geosynthetic reinforcement, which is not the case for this project) the calculated column force is relatively low. A minimal thickness of the sand platform is needed to facilitate maximum efficiency. The thickness as determined by the Plaxis calculations are lower compared to existing literature. With platform heights of up to seven meters no full arching was observed, however partial arching did occur as evidenced by the efficiency values.","CSE; Column Supported Embankment; Sabkha; Soil Improvement; Columnar Inclusion; Dynamic Replacement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-03-24","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Section Geo-Engineering","","","",""

QKD makes it possible to generate encryption keys through the use of strongly correlated photons. This would allow two parties to securely communicate with each other without any possibility of their conversation being hacked. CQT has already demonstrated a QKD free space-link in 2005. The main challenge now lies within the creation of a global QKD network. One possible way to do this is through the use of nanosatellites. As CQT has no experience in designing nanosatellites, a first step towards this goal is to design a satellite which allows the team to test a version of their payload. The main purpose of the thesis work is to present a reliable design for CQT’s first nanosatellite, SpooQySat-1, through the implementation of a systems engineering approach. The requirements as first defined by CQT are revised and redefined through the use of a requirements discovery tree. After the requirements list was complete, an orbit analysis has been carried out to ensure the best suitable orbit was selected for the mission. This, together with the requirements, served as input for the design analysis. A concept of operations has been generated, leading to a realistic power budget that has been compared to the estimated incoming power for various cases. A communication analysis has been carried out taking into account the noisy environment of Singapore. COTS component selection has been carried out for all subsystems. To ensure maximum reliability, a risk analysis has been implemented. Data regarding CubeSat failures has been gathered to inform the risk analysis. The outcome of the risk analysis was a mitigation strategy that allowed a new design iteration to ensure maximum reliability.","satellite; design; system engineering; quantum technology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-03-24","Aerospace Engineering","Space System Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","Since their development in the 1970s, mesoscale atmospheric models have been used for a variety of meteorological applications. Over the years, the models have evolved and nowadays, state-of-the-art atmospheric models are capable of operating on spatial resolutions in the order of kilometres. In the hydraulic engineering community, atmospheric models are used for operational flood protection. HIRLAM is used in the Netherlands with typical spatial resolutions of 11 km. These scales are too coarse to correctly predict small scale effects such as squall-lines and convection cells. Furthermore, the resolution is too low to accurately capture the land-water boundary. The state-of-the-art models of today are capable of predicting small scale meteorological events that might be of interest for hydraulic engineers. The goal of this study was to successfully use a state-of-the-art atmospheric model at high-spatial resolutions to investigate the possible added-value of these models for hydraulic engineering purposes. The problem that was addressed concerns wave growth at short fetch. This is specifically important for wave prediction on rivers, harbour basins, and small lakes. Deltares [2013] investigated the predictive capabilities of SWAN for short fetches (< 5000 m) at Lake IJssel. SWAN computations were performed for a selection of 20 cases and they found uncertainties in the model predictions for wave heights (Hm0; rbias = -15%, SI=-11%) and wave periods (Tm-10; rbias= -15%, SI=-11%). It is believed that this is partially due to inaccurate representation of the wind variability near the land-water transition. A model of the atmosphere was set up using the non-hydrostatic state-of-the-art mesoscale model WRF. The model covers a total area of 3240 x 4050 km. Initial and boundary conditions were derived from ERA-Interim and using a series of five nests, a horizontal resolution of 500 m was realized for the area around the northwest of Lake IJssel. Two storms were hindcasted; storm 1 from January 3rd 2012 to January 7th 2012 and storm 2 from December 4th 2013 to December 8th 2013. The model was validated using wind and temperature observations from the KNMI and Rijkswaterstaat at Lake IJssel. Overall, the model is in good agreement with the observations. Statistical analyses of data, showed that the uncalibrated model performed well in terms of wind speed (around Lake IJssel; storm 1: rbias <5%, SI ? 10%; storm 2: rbias 10%–20%, SI ?20%) and wind direction (around Lake IJssel; storm 1: bias ? 3°, RMSE ?10°; storm 2: bias 4°–15°, RMSE ? 20°). Large errors were found for the surface temperature of Lake IJssel. SST updates from ERA-interim do not represent the temperature of Lake IJssel, and were structurally over-predicted (storm 1: 2°C or 70%; storm 2: 2.5–3°C or 70%–75%). A non-stationary SWAN model was set up using calibrated setting (WTI2011) to perform wave simulations at Lake IJssel. To be able to use the friction velocities (instead of the diagnostic 10-meter wind speed) in SWAN, an extra step was required. The friction velocities from WRF were transformed to `pseudo winds' by using the drag relation Wu [1980] from SWAN inversely. The model was validated for the two storms using observations of wave height H_m0, wave periods (Tp, Tm01, Tm02, Tm-10) and 1-D wave spectra. For wind directions along the shore normal (239°N ± 20°), negative biases were found for the wave heights (Hm0; storm 1: 0.13%, -0.21% for location FL48 and FL49 respectively; storm 2: -0.18%, and -0.11% for location FL48 and FL49 respectively) and wave periods (Tm-10; storm 1: 10%, 7% for location FL48 and FL49 respectively; storm 2: –7%, –4% for location FL48 and FL49 respectively). A part of the error was caused by the already existing errors in the wind data from WRF. 2-D wave spectra from SWAN predicted disturbances for the stations FL48 and FL49 during slanting fetch conditions. Alongshore propagating low-frequency wave components were predicted and the bended coastline enhanced the disturbances. No directional observations were available, but the qualitative agreement between the 1-D spectra suggests that the SWAN predictions are realistic and that the measuring locations FL48 and FL49 are disturbed by energy that is not in aligned with the wind direction. To investigate the effects of high spatial resolutions in WRF, both storms were simulated using five different horizontal resolutions of 2700, 1500, 900, 500, and 300 m. Analysis showed that only little differences between the simulations occur during calm periods. The simulations did react differently during periods of rapid variations in the wind field. Investigation of the origin of these rapid variations showed that these mainly occurred during periods of precipitation (often combined with passage of weather fronts). A particular event with very high velocities (>30 m/s) was investigated. The specific event turned out to be a gust front coming from a convection cell. The simulations responded differently to the event; with increasing resolutions, higher velocities, precipitation rates, downward velocities, and other locations were found. Finally, for the highest resolution (?x = 300 m) artificial disturbances in the atmospheric pressure were found, indicating limitation to the validity of the chosen model settings. To assess the effects of the spatial resolution of the wind field in SWAN, both storms were simulated using the 2700, 1500, 900 and 500 m wind fields. The same method, using pseudo wind speeds was applied for the use of the friction velocity in SWAN. However, for the specific purpose of dealing with wave growth at short fetches, problems were found near the land water boundary. Because the resolution of the wind fields were relatively coarse compared the length scales associated with short fetches, wind field data did not accurately model the land-water boundary. Therefore, an extra preprocessing step was used to exclude land points from the WRF wind field, and to extrapolate water-based data to the land-water boundary. Time series of the results showed equal performance for all simulations, no differences due to the wind field resolution were found. Further investigation of the spatial variability of the wave field showed that the effects of the wind streaks were also shown in the SWAN results. This resulted in differences between the simulations up to 6\% near the coast. In conclusion, the results showed that the model was still able to produce results that were in agreement with observations, and simulations with other resolutions, without showing signs (in the variables: pressure, temperature, humidity, and wind) of instabilities. This suggests—in agreement with Hong and Dudhia [2012]— that the model indeed still produces reliable wind results for resolutions up to 500 m. A specific event was investigated that turned out to be a convection cell that clearly showed the different reaction to increasing resolutions, higher velocities (horizontally and vertically), higher precipitation rates, and different locations for the convection cell were found. The coarser resolutions (?x =2700 m and ?x = 1500 m) hardly showed any deviations in wind speed due the cell, while the higher resolutions showed strong surface winds of up to 32 m/s. Simulations with SWAN showed only little variation based on the resolution of the wind field. The added value of these models in relation to wave modelling can be found from the better representation of the surface features such as the land-water boundary, and land-use for the determination of the roughness, which allow for the prediction of wind above harbour basins and river, possibly leading to more accurate predictions of wave characteristics on these locations. Furthermore, the prediction of convective processes such as squall-lines and convection cells could be a valuable addition for operational wave (en wind) predictions.","WRF; SWAN; numerical modelling; waves; wind; high-resolution; wave growth; boundary layer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Environmental Fluid Mechanics","","52.870100, 5.108020"

(mentor); De Lille, C.S.H. (mentor)","2016","Something interesting is happening. More and more companies are servitizing their business in order to gain competitive advantage. This graduation thesis focuses on service orientation (SO). Service orientation is the degree to which a company is set to move from selling products to delivering integrated products and services that deliver value in use. The transition is particularly interesting for Ideate, which specializes in helping clients by developing new services or improving current services. The Ideate consultants wanted to know what they can learn from their clients’ ‘status’ in the servitization process. Therefore, this thesis aims to answer the following question: How can Ideate deploy service innovation in a way that fits the service orientation of their (potential) clients? In order to answer this question, it was important to first know how to determine service orientation. By means of case study research, an assessment of the SO of ten large, commercial companies was made. It was concluded that in order to analyze a company’s service orientation, its dynamics and complexities should be maintained. This insight resulted in the development of a novel and unique methodology to assess service orientation, called the gear system approach. The gear system approach identifies all individual elements that influence service orientation. Subsequently, it uses a metaphor to map them in a way that emphasizes the effect they have on each other, their relative importance and illustrates a transition over time. All attuned to the characteristics of the industry and its context. The case study research has led to ten different service orientations, captured in gear system visuals. For Ideate, the best moment to determine the service orienation of a client is at the intake phase; the phase prior to the start of a project. This allows them to anticipate to it during the entire course of the project. The current intake process of Ideate was analyzed, after which results were combined with the findings of the case study research. Throughout this gradutation project, the gear system approach has proved to be more than just a tool for analysis. It is a means to understand, capture and communicate service orientation. Therefore, it was used as the foundation of a tool that Ideate can use in daily practice. The result is the project gear system: a tool to determine a project approach attuned to their clients’ service orientation. The tool consists of three parts: 1. The client gear system, to capture the client’s drivers, challenge and (missing) capabilities; 2. The Ideate gear system, to assess which of Ideate’s capabilities can complement the client’s; 3. The project gear system canvas, to find a suitable approach for a service innovation project together with the client. A new intake process was designed using this tool and an additional support file that lists general insights from the case study research. The ideal execution of a series of subsequent steps was determined. Following the steps ensures that both parties trust and understand the project approach that comes out of it. The structure of the process helps making a complex task such as the assessment of service orientation manageable and comprehensible. Moreover, the process creates a cooperative atmosphere between the Ideate consultant and its client. It builds trust in the service design process that will follow during the project. Insights from this graduation project can be used directly and will help Ideate to grow as a company.","servitization; service innovation; tool design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Zaadnoordijk, W.J. (mentor); Hrachowitz, M. (mentor); Hanssen, R. (mentor); Collenteur, R.A. (mentor)","2016","The objective of this study is to improve the simulation of deep groundwater levels by time se- ries models with pre-defined impulse response functions. This is attempted by adding a conceptual non-linear root zone model to simulate the recharge series to the model and by testing the use of a separate response function for the percolation zone. Three root zone models are developed based on two different recharge mechanisms: preferential flow, percolation, and a combination of the two. The performance of these models is compared to a linear model that is commonly used in time se- ries models to simulate the recharge. The approach is applied to groundwater level measurements in the Veluwe, a largely forested area in the Netherlands characterized by thick unsaturated zones. The effect of groundwater extractions and land reclamations is added to the model to further im- prove the simulation of the groundwater levels. The models are tested on three observations wells with increasing thickness of the unsaturated zone, varying from 7 m to 29 m to 49 m. The results show that model performance is improved by the implementation of a non-linear root zone model, particularly in simulating the peaks and lows in the groundwater levels. The recharge fluxes simulated by the non-linear models show different patterns that are physically more realistic than those simulated by the linear model. It is shown that different recharge series result in simulated groundwater levels that are very similar. This is a clear example of equifinality and it is recommended to introduce new sources of information to validate the modelled processes (e.g., water content measurements of the percolation zone or actual evaporation data). For the shallow well, the models with a single response function are selected as the best. The largest improvements for the deeper groundwater levels are obtained by the addition of a separate response for the percolation zone. For example, the average deviation from the observed ground- water levels decreased 0.18 m to 0.08 m for the deepest observation well by applying the separate response function. The models with an additional response function were better at simulating the estimated time to peak, the time it takes a recharge pulse to cause a peak in the groundwater levels. The time to peak is introduced in this research as a qualitative indicator to validate the modelled processes. The simulated responses indicate that the groundwater levels respond very quickly to water that leaves the root zone, even though the percolation zone is tens of metres thick. For each of the observations wells it is investigated if adding the effect of groundwater extrac- tions or land reclamations of Flevoland to the models improves the simulation of the groundwater levels. For the shallow well it is concluded that either the effect of land reclamations or groundwater extractions needs to be taken into account. Since these two stresses are correlated, it is concluded that only one of these should be taken into account when no further information is available to con- strain the models. For the medium deep well, the additional stresses did not significantly improve model performance and it is concluded that they do not have to be taken into account for this well. For the deep well, model performance is improved by both stresses. The largest improvements are observed when the effect of groundwater extractions is considered in the model. For implemen- tation of these stresses, the entire simulation period should be used for calibration, or constraints have to be implemented to obtain realistic results.","Time Series Analysis; Deep Groundwater levels; Geohydrology; Non-linear; Conceptual root zone model; groundwater recharge","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water Resources","",""

(mentor); Tabeau, K. (mentor)","2016","‘How can front-line staff and their leaders be motivated intrinsically/ extrinsically to steer a behavioural change that facilitates empathic customer understanding among front-line staff and creates meaningful interactions with customers?’ – this is the underlying question behind the work done towards this report. By leveraging digital tools, KLM seeks to enhance employee efficiency, in addition to delivering uniform service through behaviour training. There is however a hesitation in anticipating new change. This is because a majority of employees at KLM have been a part of the company for over 20 years and have been acclimatised to traditional methods of working. New adoption of tools will require new type of motivation. In this regard, through gamification, there lies an opportunity to create a single platform where employees can be triggered to interact with various colleagues, co-learn and be intrinsically motivated to achieve their goals. A behavioural change roadmap was developed at the beginning of the project to prioritise the nature of the motivations based on the organisational changes in the time line. This was used to create a concrete direction on how behaviour change can be achieved objectively. It consisted of a series of steps including triggering, follow-up and sustaining motivations of employees. The two departments in focus for this project are the front line staff of Passenger Services, comprising of ticketing, check-in, service, gate agents, team leaders and the front-line staff of In-flight Services, comprising of cabin attendants, pursers and pilots. To understand the user and comprehend the recurring problems faced by them, a thorough user research was performed. As a result three concepts are proposed in the project, a (board based) game called ‘In Situ’, a digital app for service training called ‘KLAPP’ and a collaborative tool within the operational apps (mini-app) called ‘Co-lab’ The end result of the project 'In Situ’ was chosen. This game that triggers front-line staff to be more customer driven by empathising on a wide range of customer problems and exchanging personal experiences on the job. This is based on three focus areas - service, sales and safety. ‘In Situ’ has a second version that focus on building empathy between leaders and employees.","behaviour change; gamification; KLM","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Roscam Abbing, E. (mentor); Patron, F. (mentor)","2016","This master thesis focuses on designing for short-term driving experiences. This strategic opportunity is discovered through a user-centered approach focused on understanding Millennials: people born between the 1980s and 2000s. Millennials are crucial to BMW because they are reaching economic independence and becoming future potential BMW customers. Moreover, they show different interests and behave differently from previous generations. In fact, Millennials are delaying their car purchase and opting for more flexible and open models such as renting or car-sharing. Since Millennials are not bound to a car they own, this generation is enjoying a longer and richer driving exploration phase. This differs from previous generations and indicates that Millennials are not only more knowledgeable and aware of different car offerings but expect cars to fulfill a new need: an enjoyable short-term driving experience. Finally, as current BMW customers gradually embrace new technologies in their lives, they become more similar to how Millennials think, behave, and build expectations. All of this should have an impact on how BMW design cars today. This project focuses on the need for intuitiveness, guidance, and communication for occasional driving with unfamiliar cars. The main goal is to provide an outstanding first brand experience, as a way to differentiate BMW among other car brands. Interviews and ethnographic research with Millennials show three sequential emotional pillars essential for a good short-term driving experience. These are (1) feeling of control, (2) feeling of expertise, (3) feeling of surprise and fun. Furthermore, five areas of improvement for BMW were highlighted in order to facilitate the aforementioned emotional pillars. These are (1) management of fast access functions, (2) information management, (3) car language, (4) automation adoption, and (5) personalization. Based on research, design principles and three different tools are developed in order to help BMW UX designers understand and empathize with Millennials when designing for this new generation. Finally, three design concepts illustrate the ideal characteristics of the new short-term driving experience in the BMW car. Ultimately, this project contributes to the efforts of making BMW and the automotive industry more user-centered.","Millennials; Automotive industry; BMW; user-centered innovation; strategic design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Calabretta, G. (mentor); Sankatsing, J. (mentor); Veldhuis, T. (mentor)","2016","The Challenge Because of high financial pressure and other reasons, KLM has chosen to transform into a customer experience (CX) focused company. This means that the customer should be set central in every phase of the airline’s processes, services, innovation projects etc. Therefore, new teams and organizational structures will be formed. Although this transformation is already happening, the daily practice of the future CX teams is still very unclear. The current very technical and process-driven way of thinking and working should be replaced by a customer centric approach. This challenge was described by KLM as “what will happen on the first day, when the CX organization is ready to start? How can we make sure that our way of working then changes? And what means ‘working in a customer centric way’?” Starting with this problem definition, the graduation assignment was described as: “Design a platform and strategy to facilitate the change of daily project practices to a CX focused way of thinking and working in KLM.” Research Findings After exploring the transformation of KLM, literature research, external and internal research were conducted. The literature study found e.g. that KLM’s strategy, to focus on customer intimacy as one of three strategic value disciplines, is a by competition imposed strategy into a ‘red ocean’ (Kim & Mauborgne, 2005). This is because competitors like Ryanair also start to focus on a tailor-made, intimate approach towards customers. The role of designers can be seen as creating the ‘New Workplace Experience’, while facilitating the internal change. The use of tools and methods as ‘boundary objects’ (Carlile, 1997, 2002, 2004) can help to research, visualize and create a CX by enhancing knowledge exchange. External research with 13 interviews in corporates and agencies focusing on CX, provided insights about the formation of a CX organization and the daily work in it. Results show that the mind-set to work customer focused is characterized by aspects like empathy and curiosity, a trial and error approach, handling uncertainties and team work with several stakeholders. Various skills are important to improve a CX, e.g. understanding abstract information while creating tangible results from it, basing decisions on CX data and working transparently beyond the boundaries of departments. Furthermore, a range of customer centered tools and methods was collected (e.g. storyboards, customer journey mapping and role play). After researching supportive project management, the facilitator role, and structural changes, in the next step the question of ‘how to introduce a CX focus in an organization’ is examined. The findings are clustered in top-down and bottom-up measures, such as spreading the CX vision in every department, while translating the story into ‘department languages’ (top-down). Bottom-up e.g. a project-based learning by doing approach can help to let employees find their own way to improve the CX. Informal routines within teams can help to trigger a new way of thinking and working. After the ‘ideal CX organization’ has been researched, a comparison with the internal status of KLM was done. As results several potential challenges for different positions and teams in KLM have been found. E.g. future CX Managers will have to find agreements with a wide range of stakeholders. In the cross-functional CX team, the various department representatives are challenged to ‘spread the CX virus’ to their project teams, which might not see their link to a CX. Those teams e.g. will also need to learn methods to research and communicate a CX. Designed solutions In an iterative process a range of solutions was created to trigger a CX focused way of thinking and working in KLM. A crowdsource campaign within KLM will lead to a digital toolkit to share CX methods. This makes tools & methods easily accessible, invites different departments and individuals to reflect on the own impact on CX, increases the knowledge exchange within KLM and uses practical examples to trigger a customer centric thinking among employees. By introducing the concept of CX Labs, i.e. physical spaces to co-create with customers, an inspiring atmosphere for teams and customers is created, which makes the change of KLM to a CX organization visible and tangible. This concept can easily be connected to trainings and other initiatives within KLM. It was developed and prototyped in the Non-Schengen KLM lounge at Schiphol airport. As means to implement the new rules of working in KLM, a new informal ‘Networker’ role was created and rotating leadership was proposed. These measures use the social aspect of organizational change, e.g. by making change a social event as Networker of a team. The boundary to learn via direct customers contact can be overcome with a playful approach, as well as the boundaries to address teamwork problems directly. Thus the dialogue between different parties can be eased with the proposed means. Overall the designed solutions and the CX Lab prototype were evaluated very positively and as useful measures to change daily practices towards being more customer centric. First steps were taken to implement them, e.g. with a follow-up CX Lab customer session in the KLM lounge.","Customer Experience","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

(mentor); Mugge, W. (mentor); Schouten, A.C. (mentor)","2016","Currently haptic technology is being widely implemented in applications such as tele-operation. One of the main concerns are the communication delays due to the visual or haptic feedback signals traveling long distances. Also, different subsystems handling visual and haptic feedback cause modality-specific delays causing asynchrony between visual and haptic cues. It is not known how human performance and control strategy is affected by visuohaptic delays during manual control tasks, where humans are continuously controlling and observing a system. In this study an inverted pendulum balancing task served as the manual control task. Participants were required to keep the pendulum upright for 30s with various delays (0, 150, 300ms) in visual and/or haptic feedback provided by a screen and a haptic device (HapticMaster MOOG inc). The task performance was measured in fail rate (amount of failed trials) and RMS theta (root mean square of the pendulum angle measured from the upright position), while human control strategy was evaluated with reversal rate (corrections per second) and RMS xd_hand (root mean square of the hand movement speed of the human operator). The main findings are: 1) adding haptic guidance improves task performance; 2) adding haptic feedback reduces the hand movement speed and the amount of corrections made; 3) Communication delays degrade the task performance more than modality-specific delays; 4) Large delays in haptic guidance feedback evoke an aggressive control strategy. In general adding haptic guidance improves task performance with manual control tasks, however humans adapt an aggressive control strategy when large haptic delays are involved.","inverted pendulum; visual delay; haptic delay; haptic guidance; human control strategy; manual control; human-machine interaction","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","Biomedical Engineering","",""

Statistical inference is executed on the environmental data to produce a 100-year environment. This 100-year environment is then simulated to calculate the loads that occur when the vessel is under the influence of the 100-year environment. An alternative for this method is response based design. In response based design, measurements with a 3-hour interval of the environment over a long period of time are used to simulate the behaviour of the FPSO. The simulation provides a data-set of dominant loads for the mooring system over the time period. With extreme value theory the tail of this data is fitted on a generalized Pareto distribution. With this distribution a 100-year extrapolation can be made that results in the 100-year extreme loads. This could result in a more realistic value of the extrapolated loads in comparison with the conventional method. In (Oostra 2015) this method is applied for a specific case and extrapolated for 1 load parameter (Line tensions). In this thesis it will be studied if response based design can be used as a general tool to calculate reliable 100-year return levels for the dominant load parameters. This resulted in the following research question; “Is it possible to apply extreme value theory in an efficient way during the design stage with the use of hindcast data for the assessment of mooring configurations? To study this possibility a method reconstruction is performed to check the reproducibility of the three main steps that need to be taken in extreme value theory. These steps are first pre-processing of the raw environmental, secondly the simulation that provides the responses the third and final step is performing statistical inference on the response data to produce extrapolations. The robustness of the method is proved by executing a parameters study. In this parameter study several cases with variations in input parameters, configurations and environments are studied. Most cases gave reliable extrapolations. An exception is the 3X3 mooring system which has a significant difference in mooring system stiffness for in-line and in-between line translations. It is also noted that the accuracy of the fit depends on the arbitrary decisions made by the user during the process. To limit these arbitrary decisions, the possibility of using a Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution is studied. Monthly and annual load data is fitted to a GEV distribution. This resulted in reasonable extrapolations and passed all goodness-of-fit tests for the annual data. In comparison with the conventional method the extrapolations where approximately 30% lower. The monthly data didn’t result in a reliable fit. To produce reliable extrapolations with monthly data, time dependent parameters need to be included to compensate for the seasonal variations. The final step was a case study. In this case study extrapolations for all dominant load parameters for a 3X3 mooring configuration are obtained. Four variations of the mooring system are studied. For all four variations good extrapolations are produced. It can be concluded that the performance of the methodology isn’t influenced by the individual mooring line make-up. For four out of five dominant load parameters reliable extrapolations are obtained. Extrapolations for the horizontal offset are less reliable due to the difference between in-line and in-between line stiffness in 3X3 mooring configurations. This problem can be coped with if directionality is included. To include directionality, the mooring configuration is divided into several sections. For these sections 100-year return levels are calculated individually. The answer to the research question is: It is possible to produce reliable 100-year extrapolations for shallow water by fitting responses from quasi-dynamic simulations of environmental data to a generalized Pareto distribution for the most dominant load parameters, with or without some adaptions to the methodology depending on the mooring lay-out.","extreme value theory; turret; floating structures; Statistical inference; Dynfloat; response based approach; data fitting","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-02-22","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Ship Hydromechanics & Structures","","Offshore & Dredging Engineering","",""

The main research question this research sought to answer is: What are the value drivers that determine the turnaround time of the aircraft engine combustor maintenance repair and overhaul process from a Lean Six Sigma perspective? From literature and preliminary research it was possible to identify TAT value drivers and define performance criteria. The main value drivers have been found to be capacity, capabilities and components. Planning and routing have been defined as influential factors that aid in steering the process. In order to come to this answer the current state of combustor maintenance at KLM E&M has been analysed, using the Six Sigma Define, Measure, Analyse, Improve, Control (DMAIC) framework. A conceptual framework including the value drivers was developed. Using this framework and Lean Six Sigma tools the combustor maintenance process has been analysed in order to define the main relationships between value drivers, as well as the current state performance at KLM. In order to simulate the process and test the effects of changes to the value drivers the current state process was modelled in Simio. Using this model it has been possible to define TAT and to test the influence of the value drivers.

(mentor); Van der Voort, H. (mentor)","2016","Knowledge valorisation is the process of creating value from academic knowledge. Value creation from academic knowledge, especially technological research, can serve as a driver of economic growth. Therefore, improving valorisation results, i.e. value creation from academic knowledge is an issue that received a lot of attention the past years. The Dutch government has set a mission to increase valorisation of academic knowledge. For doing so knowledge on valorisation processes is needed. A knowledge gap exists on the relation between valorisation processes and their output. This study addresses this knowledge gap. The objective of this study is to gain understanding of knowledge valorisation processes and their outcomes in terms of market reach and time to market. Particularly, understanding the outcomes and factors that play a role in determining the outcomes of valorisation processes is the aim of this study. Therefore, main research question is formulated as: What are the outcomes of knowledge valorisation processes of university driven research and how can the variation in outcomes be explained by factors in the process of valorisation? Based on literature research three groups of factors are identified that play a role in determining the output of valorisation: characteristics of the knowledge, characteristics of the market and university –industry interaction. The process is characterized as a 3 stage process, with the first stage the phase when initial research (academic research) takes place. The second stage is the commercialisation stage in which iterative steps iterative steps between additional research and product development take place. This stage is successful when a suitable, profitable market application is found. The process then moves on to the market introduction stage in which the products and or services are launched into the market. Results from data analysis in this study show that the nature and innovativeness of the knowledge influence the output of valorisation, i.e. determine or limit the resources needed and what can reasonably be spent. Furthermore, collaboration with industry and previous knowledge are found to have an effect on the output of valorisation, i.e. determining the resources available in the process. This study thus confirmed the effect of knowledge characteristics and university – industry interaction on the output of valorisation processes. The variance in output of the processes is explained with knowledge characteristics determining the amount of resources needed to have a successful market introduction, while the interaction with industry determines the availability or acquisition of these resources. The knowledge gained in this study extends the existing scientific knowledge framework on valorisation by providing an integrative view linking the existing knowledge on barriers in the process to the process itself and output of valorisation process. Furthermore, the knowledge in this study provides understanding of how output of valorisation is influenced by factors that play a role here. Besides the scientific contribution, this study provides insight in how the success of valorisation processes can be influenced. This knowledge is useful for researchers as well as institutional and governmental policy makers for improving valorisation results.","knowledge valorisation; commercialisation; knowledge","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Innovation Systems","","MOT","",""

(mentor)","2016","Engineers are still looking for ways to improve the performance of materials used in aircraft. A major step was going from metal parts to laminates in order to save weight significantly. Those laminates existed of fibres with a constant orientation, and became laminates with changing fibre directions. Variable stiffness laminates (VSL) are used for its possibility of exploiting the anisotropic properties of composites. In order to improve the buckling load of a panel, VSL are used. Those laminates steer the loads through the laminate. This is beneficial for maximising the buckling load of a panel. An optimiser is built by the Delft University of Technology to optimise VSL by changing its fibre orientations throughout the entire panel. A manufacturing constraint is added to the optimiser to prevent the fibre paths to have a turn radius of smaller than 0.333[m]. Plate designs with fibres paths having a smaller turn radius than this constraint, are assumed to be unmanufacturable. The software optimises fibre paths of VSL against buckling and keeps the stiffness of the entire plate equal or higher than the quasi isotropic design. Since the aircraft of nowadays are stiffener dominated, an extra functionality is added to the optimiser. The optimiser is further developed to be capable of optimising stiffened plates. Stiffeners are taken into account during the optimisation. Extra functionalities such as integrated stiffeners are introduced. These are stiffeners sharing layers with the plate. The extended optimiser is verified by comparing the internal loads from five cases with the values calculated with ABAQUS. After having the optimiser verified, it is used to calculate results for twelve different cases. Those cases range from square unstiffened plates to rectangular plates with two stiffeners. The results show the influence of stiffeners on the optimised panel with changed fibre paths. Those cases are compared to the plate designs with the stiffeners excluded from optimisation. Performance increases of up to 174% are obtained for balanced symmetric laminates. The results show clearly that when stiffeners are added to a panel, the area in-between the stiffeners can be treated as a simply supported plate. Integrated stiffeners also show a buckling load increase of 113% with respect to the quasi isotropic case. The fibres of the buckling optimised plates show a relating behaviour. Fibre orientations going towards [45,-45] are present in buckling critical areas. Near stiffeners and near edges, [0,0] areas are present in order to introduce the load through the structure. A relation is found between having more [0,0] orientations in the inner plies of the laminate and significantly more [45,-45] orientations at the outer plies of the laminate. The outer plies are more critical for buckling, which requires more fibres being close to a [45,-45] in order to higher the buckling load. The inner areas are less vulnerable for buckling, which creates the opportunity of creating stiffness in the inside of the laminate.","optimisation; stiffener; variable stiffness laminate; fibre steering; composite; laminate","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures and Computational Mechanics","","","",""

Gesture control as one of the Natural User Interface, shows a limited usage, by mainly being used in the entertainment industry. The property of gesture control was seen to be potential to contribute to smart living, thus this thesis was initiated to seek to introduce gesture control in a smart living context. The final design is a smartphone gesture library that offers twelve functions which allow the control of home appliances and smartphone. The functions include; Wake up the device, Make a call, Answer a call, Snooze a call, Reject a call, Launch the messenger, Activate the camera, Launch the recorder, Snooze an alarm, Turn off an alarm, Launch the music app, and Start remote control. The Start remote control function allows the home appliance control applicable to blinds/curtains, lighting, speaker, and thermostat. The gestures are designed to be intuitive, based on the design strategy: be a part of original actions, resemble customs or personal rituals. It reduces steps of interactions by being part of original actions. This supports automation and smart living. Lastly, the gestures are natural. Designed subtle or not noticeable, the use of gestures does not raise any social awkwardness. In the final evaluation test, the final design earned positive feedback from the participants. In conclusion, this master thesis, “Smartphone controlled home environments” achieved an interaction design that shapes user’s life smarter, by providing intuitive and effortless gesture control realized through a smartphone that applies to both of the smartphone and home environments.","gesture; gesture control; interaction; smartphone; smart living; interaction design; human-computer-interaction; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

The aim is to estimate through a tactile interaction the mass of the object and the friction between the object and the (unknown) surface where it is placed. The thesis focus on the use of Recursive Least-Squares algorithms. An explicit derivation, in a matrix form, of these algorithm is presented. The persistent excitation problem is taken under analysis since it is one of the key element for a correct parameter estimation. The thesis brings under study a novel simulated experiment where a robot finger pushes and excites the dynamics of a rigid movable mass in order to estimate the properties listed above. Because of the mobility of the object, signal discontinuities (during the pushing action) are the challenges of the estimation strategy. Possible solutions are implemented and results are discussed.","robotics; object; interaction; impedance; friction; estimation; Recursive Least Squares","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-09-30","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control","","Systems and Control","",""

(mentor)","2016","The thesis project is originating from a start up project under the name of Phonotone. This start-up company wrote the assignment for the design of the interactions and interface of a new platform for young producers of digital music in The Netherlands. The assignment was written as a starting point for this thesis and was meant to give directions for the explorative research on the subjects of music production technique, and the context of the future user of this product. It stated that modern young music producers have many social media accounts to maintain, and pointed in the direction of developing a service where these accounts can be operated from a single dashboard. The state-of-the-art research was aimed at increasing the knowledge about the current state of technology in music production and interface design in music production software. A glossary was set up in order to explain the abbreviations and terminology that the world of music production houses. The state-of-the-art research set out to explore the new technological possibilities that artists can utilise today. One of the findings was a new product technology in connecting software and hardware using Ableton and Max. An in-depth interview was conducted to get more familiar with the target group; young music producers. In these interviews, which were conducted at the homes of the participants, the daily lives and context of these producers should become apparent. Another point of interest was the music production process. The results showed that the producers were not at all looking for a website to own and maintain, but were rather interested in quick feedback from their fans. Furthermore, the producers were looking for good connections with their fellow artists. Another interesting finding was that it was often expressed that the participants experienced that their audience on social media seemed more interested in their off-topic content instead of their posts about their music releases and news. Using these results, a production timeline could be constructed, on which the thoughts and actions of the interviewed producers were set. This production timeline was given the characteristics of the design process, containing a fuzzy front end, an ideation, a conceptualisation, and an evaluation phase. This represented the experienced process of music production for the producer. A market exploration to current music apps yielded many results in various categories. A selection, made to narrow down the results, filtered down the results; applications that enable a musician to produce and promote music, and additionally, allow the user to engage into collaboration with other musicians. From this selection, six apps were chosen for comparison; Splice - an add-on for the DAW Ableton Live, Blend and Kompoz – both desktop based community collaboration services, Speazie – an iOS mobile application for music recording and collaboration, Figure – an app for making beats and sharing the result, and Songtree – an app for dubbing over sounds and collaboration options. This comparison produced the finding that the compared applications are offering possibilities to collaborate with anyone over the world; meaning that any user can connect to any user via their project. The outcome of the interviews formed the basis for an analysis on which the interactions and experience could be designed. An interaction vision was composed out of the analysis of the results from the interviews. One of the most important interactions that followed from the analysis of the current interactions showed that the producers were focussed on content that would generate the most likes from their fans on their social media page. The earlier mentioned expressed dissatisfaction about social media exposure was labelled the ‘attention gap’. Another phenomenon showed that the producers seemed to be dissatisfied in general by the use of social media. At the same time positive remarks about social media were expressed, in respect to agenda utilities and maintaining contacts. This phenomenon of contradictory sounds was labelled ‘the Stockholm syndrome’; because the producers were held captive by their social media captors in a metaphorical way. Another important finding describes the positive attribution of collaborations with other artists by the interviewed. Benefits mentioned were that it would speed up the production process, not only in the beginning (the ‘fuzzy front end’ in which samples are sought and a set up is made) but also when finishing up a track. A new interaction vision could be formed using the current interactions analysis. The vision was set to the qualities of playing with Lego, of which a mind map was made to find the categories to base the important qualities on. These qualities, emerging from playing with Lego are: Playful exploration, elemental learning, open source creativity, and belonging. These qualities would form the basis for the interaction design of the application. The application should enhance this feeling in the use. Therefore a scenario was made, portraying these qualities in the context of the backstage. The result could be converted into several sub-scenarios, which could be used for the diverse design iteration rounds. In the first design iteration, a cultural probe research was set up to gain insights into some extra habits of the target group online and in social media. One of the findings was that important moments in their career matter to the artist and this is proudly shown on social media. To determine the user flow for the new application, the second iteration was focussed on interactions in context. A contextual observation was done in a backstage situation. The findings that were done contributed to the construction of the user flow diagram of the application. The next design iteration was focussed on the graphic design of the application. Menu layouts were explored and a test determining the association between sound effect icons and sound effect names was conducted. The results originating from this study indicated a strong association between the distortion effect and its designated icon design. This was included into the final design. The dynamics of the interface were explored in the fourth design iteration. This concluded into specific points of interest for the gestures in interaction; the playful interaction swipe and the Collab showcase planet display. The last design iteration before concluding into the final design set out to explore and re-affirm the users’ willingness to share their material in collaboration using an online survey. The results showed, as was concluded earlier after the interviews, a positive attitude towards sharing own work. The final design could be developed following the five design iterations. This was done by combining the results of these cycles and implementing their conclusions and recommendations. In this phase some more guiding decisions were being put. The application would only be made available to users on the same network. This followed the need of the producers to strengthen their connections with other artists and in combination with the set context this was the best to simplify communications. Another decision was to combine the gesture interactions for the playful exploration and the proud moment showcase of earlier applications. The result was an application that allows users to log in, search for other people on the same network, see their collaborations and explore their music. Collaborations can be made with 2 – 4 people in total. The applications’ main activity, the collaboration, encompasses a workspace to which the online sample storage of the user can be linked. Sound can be added into the project using the record function. Via the library function, the samples of other participating users can be viewed and used, but only for as long as the Collab instance is active. Collab results can be shared to diverse social media of which the accounts can be connected to the application by the user. These actions show the transition from the interactions of playful exploration, elemental learning, open source creativity, and in the end the feeling of belongingness. One of the objectives of the project was to work out a prototype in such a degree that it could genuinely test the designed interactions and could be used to verify the designed experience. The prototype was developed according to the hypothesis that the designed interactions should emerge from the combination of the app required operation interactions and interface design. This is why the focus was on developing the prototype using Adobe CS Flash in combination with Actionscript 3.0. The prototype was tested using two types of evaluation methods. One was a usability test in which the participants were informed of the project and application beforehand and were then given the prototype and asked to fulfil assignments with it. The other test was an open assignment where two participants were asked to act out the functionality of the application while collaborating on a track. The final conclusions were that the playful exploration part was experienced as smooth. The elemental learning interaction with the product emerged on multiple occasions of the participants learning quickly using the simplified icons. The open source creativity could best be described as naturally, from the results of the second experience test. The feeling of belongingness was not directly proven from the test results but could be extrapolated. This experience was concluded from the finding that the participants were quick to invent use situations and atmospheres. The attributed fun value to the application by the participants is analysed. This concludes that a playful application could be an appropriate, and possibly even a welcome tool, given that it supports the functionality needed to synthesise material that can be of use, both in playful and professional musical co-operation, and thus can aid in the feeling of belongingness. The final project recommendations are about the ideal team composition, and state that to continue the project, a number of specialised team members would be chosen. The continuation of the recommendations for the evaluation of the design proposes a different evaluation approach within a real life context. Another recommendation is to develop the application in an earlier stage, with minimal functionality, to focus on the interaction design.","music production; music promotion; interface; interaction; experience; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","","",""

The key step in the searching process for a content based image retrieval system is calculating the similarities between the query image and the images in the database, follow by generating a ranked list based on the similarities. In this thesis work, we give a framework to solve the above problem, which contains three parts: image representation, feature combination, and ranking. In detail, firstly some representations are extracted from the query image and the images in the database. Then some similarities are calculated for a query-image pair. At last, the ranking algorithm is used to get a final rank from the similarities vector. For each part of the framework, we propose some candidate methods, and their characteristics are studied in detail. By applying the framework, a simple way of combining multiple image representations are introduced, and its performance is evaluated in the experiment. The results indicates that their is a notable improvement by combining multiple image representations than using them individually. Besides, this work also studies how to treat the ranking problem as a classification problem. Several asymmetric classification losses are proposed and compared. The comparison results give some instructions of how to design a good classification loss for the ranking problem. At last, we build an end-to-end trainable content based image retrieval system based on the convolutional neural network (CNN). The experimental results for the end-to-end system are not satisfactory, where the reasons are analyzed and some potential solutions are proposed.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science","","Media and Knowledge Engeneering","",""

Enceladus did not disappoint: After Cassini's arrival in the Saturnian system interest has surged for this tiny moon. Many fascinating phenomena are taking place and Cassini has been observing these phenomena since 2005. From its rich and diverse surface, to its connection with Saturn's E-ring, to its high albedo; all are special phenomena. What makes Enceladus unique, however, is the region near its south pole. There, geysers spew material, including salts, from the interior of the satellite into space through openings in its icy crust. These openings or cracks are called ``tiger stripes'' and their orientation and position prove to be difficult to explain. The area near these tiger stripes is anomalously hot, with temperatures reaching far higher than anticipated. These high temperatures indicate heat is being transported from the interior to the surface, but this happens only near the south pole. The observed heating output is much larger than can be explained by current models for planetary heating. These observations make Enceladus and especially its south pole one of the most fascinating places in our Solar system. One special feature on Enceladus is its subsurface sea. Enceladus' subsurface sea is likely confined to the southern latitudes. Since the tiger stripes are located at the South pole and Enceladus' subsurface sea is likely confined to the region below the South pole, these two features seem linked. Did Enceladus' subsurface sea play a role in the formation of the tiger stripes? ince the field of ocean dynamics is very large, attention is restricted to one type of motion in the ocean: wave attractors. A wave attractor is an attractor for internal waves. These are waves that have their maximum displacement in the interior of a fluid. This is different from surface waves, which have their maximum displacement at the surface. These internal waves can only exist when the fluid in which they propagate is stratified in density, i.e. the density decreases continuously in the direction opposite to gravity, or angular momentum. Such a stratified fluid is a stable system and occurs in many places in the Earth's oceans. Fluid bodies in nature are often stably stratified in density due to differences in temperature or salt concentration. This provides these fluid bodies with a restoring force in terms of gravity that is absent in homogeneous fully-contained fluids. This restoring force points in a particular direction (radially for the density-stratified fluid), which renders the fluid anisotropic. Perturbations of such stably stratified fluids appear as waves that orient themselves to the anisotropic direction; i.e. they propagate under a particular fixed direction that is inclined with the anisotropy direction. Waves of given frequency (e.g. tides) preserve this inclination when reflecting from any boundary, in particular also when reflecting from a sloping boundary. The consequence of this constraint is that for almost any shape of basin, these waves are focused onto a particular limit orbit, called wave attractor. The focusing on an attractor is accompanied by an intensification of the wave field, such that intense shearing motion is confined to the immediate vicinity of the wave attractor. The two requirements for wave attractors to exist are tides, which excite internal waves, and a stratification, which carries the internal waves. Enceladus experiences tides due to its eccentric orbit. The stratification can be in angular momentum, certainly present for a rotating Enceladus, or in density, which is created by salts and these have been observed in the geysers, or a combination of both. So the two main ingredients for wave attractors to exist are present on Enceladus. On Enceladus the top of the basin is formed by the icy crust above its south polar sea. The locations of the tiger stripes could be those locations where the wave attractor reflects from this top boundary. The wave attractors focusses energy on its path and the elevated temperatures at the tiger stripes could be due to the wave attractors. The wave attractors allow the phenomena of the tiger stripes and the localized heat output to be explained by processes in the interior of a fluid and ties the observations of salts in the geysers and Enceladus' eccentric orbit to these features. Wave attractors provide a unique approach in the field of planetary sciences, not only because they are a new idea in this field, but also because a direct relation between processes in an interior sea and the (observed) behaviour of an icy crust are used to explain observed features on an icy crust. Furthermore, wave attractors might have applications at other icy satellites. The so-called chaos terrain on Europa might be caused by an wave attractor that changes its path due to changing boundaries of the liquid beneath the chaos terrain.","Enceladus; Tiger Stripes; DFGEM; Internal Gravity Waves; Wave Attractors","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Spaceflight","","","",""

Nowadays computer models can fairly accurately predict radar performance if sufficient atmospheric input data is available. While many studies are dedicated to accurately model radar performance, little has yet been done to define how accurate and how high in resolution atmospheric data must be to suffice as input for accurate radar performance prediction. My study takes preliminary steps into finding horizontal and temporal resolution requirements for different weather conditions. The study is particularly of interest to the Royal Netherlands Navy as they currently predict radar performance with a single vertical profile and thereby assume that the atmosphere is horizontally homogenous. My thesis clearly shows that using a single profile can result in erroneous radar performance predictions. In these cases 3D dimensional data is required, which, for example, numerical weather prediction models can obtain. In additions to the description of my topic above, I have attached my abstract and preface.

(mentor); Jepma, E.J. (mentor)","2016","In this graduation project, vmbo-pupils have been researched so videos (for ARTtube) and a museum tool (for Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen) can be designed. This research concludes with guidelines, which can be used when designing an art educational product for this target group. Based on these guidelines mix&fix a portrait has been created, with this application pupils create a portrait of art from the museum’s collection. This portrait will reflect both their taste and style. Context Art education is of high importance in the Netherlands and the government obligates both cultural and educational institutions to have a vision on art education and to ensure that young people come in contact with the richness of culture. According to museum educators, art educational initiatives are created to teach pupils about the value (meaning and effects) of art. Teachers visit museums with pupils to offer them a positive acquaintance with art and to give them the chance to take an extensive look at art. Both teachers and museum educators emphasize on the need of engaging the pupils during the museum visit Research In the research sessions with vmbo-pupils, it became apparent that pupils expect museums to be boring, but informative. Due to group pressure and the popularity-assumption (learning is for nerds, high grades are uncool) pupils experience a high threshold before opening up. Combining these factors creates a situation in which the pupils are unlikely to have a positive experience in the museum or with the art. When researching the pupils’ perspective on visual arts, it was found that pupils are mainly interested in the process of making an artwork and the artist that created it. They want to understand the world of the artist. Based on the interviews, literature study and research sessions, a list of guidelines has been created. These were used during the ideation and conceptualisation phase. At the end of this project, the concept was evaluated with these guidelines. The guidelines were related to guiding the pupils, offering freedom of choice, educating the pupils, entertaining the pupils and connecting the pupils to the artworks and artist. Designing The designing phase starts with a design brief for both the videos and the museum tool For the videos, this was where my involvement stopped. The goal of the to-be-designed museum tool will be to encourage the pupils to follow their curiosity throughout the museum. The interaction should be guiding and engaging. Mix&fix a portrait has been developed based on these guidelines. First – the pupils have to do a personality test to discover their temperament. Based on their temperament, they are sent through the museum. Their route will come across paintings of artists with the same temperament as the pupil. When the pupils have found the painting, they will receive information about the artist and the process of creating the artwork. If they appreciate the painting, the pupils can decide to use part of the painting. These parts are then combined into a portrait. When validating the concept proposal, it was found that pupils appreciate the routing and paintings along the way and that they felt engaged with the process of creating the artwork. But pupils experienced moments of uncertainty when deciding whether they should look at the painting for a longer amount of time or if they were allowed to continue their route. Therefore some adjustments have been made. In the design proposal, pupils would only combine their painting into a portrait when they finished the entire route. In the final design, the pupils look at a painting and receive some information, they are encouraged to select the painting, they can immediately select the interesting part of the painting and add this to their portrait. Thereby the pupils start creating the portrait after selecting their first painting, this will also give them a better view on the amount and parts of paintings that they still need. Evaluation The final concept still needs to be tested on the user experience when used by a complete class of vmbo-pupils. Afterwards the application should be developed and the usability test should be tested. The entire customer journey should be tested in pilots. Only then the concept can be implemented.","user research; application; vmbo-pupils; museum","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design For Interaction","","","",""

The battolyzer is a device that works as a rechargeable battery, and that is capable of performing highly efficient electrolysis with any excess electricity. The battolyzer was based on the Nickel-Iron-Battery, which was developed by Thomas Edison and Waldemar Jungner, and on alkaline electrolysis. Both are well-established technologies that were developed more than a century ago. <br/>The main research question in this thesis is: ""Is an energy storage system based on Nickel and Iron suitable to operate as an integrated battery and electrolyzer, and what would be the overall energy efficiency of such a device?"".<br/>Firstly, a test-series that was designed to simulate various real-life situations, including partial and full charging and discharging, rapid switching, continuous overcharging, and the around-the-clock cycling. Neither the battery, nor the electrolysis have noticeably deteriorated after the many cycles. The remarkable finding is that the reversible discharge capacity of the battery is not adversely affected by such harsh test conditions.<br/>Secondly, the gas quality was analyzed, qualitatively and quantitatively. The outcome of these tests was that overcharging leads to gas production with a Coulombic (or Faradaic) conversion efficiency of equal to 100%, within the experimental accuracy.<br/>In a final step, optimal operating conditions for the battolyzer have been identified. Tests show that the overall energy efficiency of the battolyzer could surpass 90%. However, the most remarkable finding of the whole project is the stability of the energetic efficiency at 80-90% over many different types of cycles, including all cycles to simulate real-life situations.<br/>We anticipate these results to be a starting point for a robust grid-scale energy storage solution in a low-cost, abundant-element based, intrinsically flexible device that has close to full-time operability: as electrical power storage, switchable electricity supply, and as a hydrogen producer.","battolyser; battolyzer; nickel-iron battery; hydrogen production; Energy Storage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2022-08-31","","","","Electrical Engineering | Sustainable Energy Technology","",""

(mentor)","2016","The United States of America – and more specific the state of Illinois – are dealing with a problem of Asian carps spreading from inward waterways to the Great Lakes. The Asian carp was originally brought to America to be used in study?s on agricultural pounds, but escaped after series of flooding. The Asian carp has no natural enemies in the waters of the United States and are heading via the Mississippi River to the Great Lakes.The threat of the Asian carp lies in the special? property that these fish have a large appetite and tend to eat everything in their way which is smaller than them. They reproduce rapidly which means that in relatively short periods entire areas can be cleared from plankton and aquatic plants. Their presence can ruin entire vegetation?s and especially when the would enter the Great Lakes, huge economic and environmental problems could arise. Due to these imminent problems multiple studies have been made to stop these fish, but yet so far no actual solution has come up. Even an electrical curtain wasn?t able to stop them. The only connection between the Mississippi River and the Great Lakes – the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal – is a perfect location for a structure that can stop these fish, but still allowing the inland water vessels to gain access to Chicago and the Great Lakes. This canal is designed as part of the sewage system of the Chicago Area Waterway System and is needed to remain a proper water quality – closing this canal off will lead to large investments in multiple wastewater treatment plants. A proper solution is therefore desired which lead to an passage for vessels without providing a passage for fish heading upstream towards the Great Lakes. A surroundings and stakeholders analysis showed that the best location for such a solution will be in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal near the place Lockport. Meeting the requirements the best solution for this problem is the design of a water-free vertical boat lift?. This design can be combined with the renovation/renewing of the current Lockport lock in the canal. The water-free vertical boat lift has similarities with a regular vertical boat lift, but has the special property that it lifts the vessels to the upstream water level without the help of water. A vessels will enter the lock chamber via two vertical lifting doors whereafter the water is drained out of it. The vessel will the lower until it rests on inflatable rubber bags on the floor. Hereby all the water and fish will be caught in a water storage area underneath the lock chamber from where the water and fish will be released downstream again. Afterwards the empty lock chamber with the vessel will be lifted to the upstream water level from where water can be pumped back in and the vessel can continue. The lock chamber is made out of steel walls of 7,5 meters high in combination with a steel/concrete combined floor of 18,5 meters width and 100 meters length. The concrete slab will be inclined to gain a 1:20 slope for a proper outflow of the water and fish. The inflatable bags are placed over the width every 10 meters and the 2x2 meter gaps are placed in pairs of two in-between. The lock chamber is closed-off by two vertical lifting gates and is supported by 42 steel cables with a diameter of 103 mm distributed over the length. The cables will go up over large pulleys, which will be mounted on the total construction for support. The counter weights have to be adjustable due to the difference in weight of the lock chamber when filled and emptied. By using variable weights the mass can be regulated, which leads to better handling of the lifting/lowering equipment. This report shows that a decent solution to stop Asian carp from invading the Great Lakes lies in the form of a vertical boat lift that lifts the vessels without the help of water. Further researches will lead to a better conclusion regarding the feasibility of this design and the applicability to the Chicago Sanitary and Shipping Canal regarding the main objective: stopping fish from invading Lake Michigan!","Asian carp; Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal; Chicago; Great Lakes; Lake Michigan; Lockport; Mississippi; fish; barrier; CSSC; CAWS; GLMRIS; invading; invasion","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Structures","",""

(mentor); Mulder, M. (mentor); Paassen, M.M. (mentor)","2016","Aircraft manual control tasks require simultane- ous control of multiple degrees-of-freedom. Unfortunately, most multi-axis human-operator modeling is limited to the modeling of multiple fully-independent axis. Therefore our goal is to contribute to the understanding of multi-axis manual control behaviour and develop a more realistic picture of dual axis manual control behaviour. The results of the human-in-the-loop experiment carried out in SIMONA Research Simulator has facil- itated the study of four distinctive phenomena which are proven to occur in multi-axis control tasks: performance degradation, axis asymmetry, crossfeed and intermittency. Crossfeed occurs when operators’ inputs in one controlled axis feed into another controlled degree-of-freedom, thereby affecting overall control performance. Intermittency is a type of non-linear behaviour, caused by time-varying axis prioritization. Three conditions were experimentally tested in the presence and absence of motion: the full dual-axis control task, single-axis roll task and single-axis pitch task. The results of the data analysis show that the error variance and crossover frequency indicate that the performance is worse in dual axis than it is for its baseline single-axis condition. The performance in the roll axis is consistently worse than pitch, thereby proving axis asymmetry. Motion has been found to improve the error variance and stability of the system. The application of independent forcing function signals in both controlled axes, resulted in the detection of crossfeed in dual- axis tasks from spectral analysis. Furthermore, using a novel extended Fourier Coefficient method, the identified crossfeed dynamics explains up to 20% of the measured control inputs and improves modeling accuracy by up to 5%. Dual axis control behaviour is less accurately modeled with linear time-invariant models, and with more unaccounted for peaks, gives an indication of intermittency.","manual control cybernetics; system identification; Fourier Coefficient Method; multi-axis control","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-03-15","Aerospace Engineering","Control and Simulation","","","",""

Research groups cannot perform valuable scientific inquiry without working together with other researchers, due to the growth of knowledge, high specialization of scientific domains, quickly changing technology, and the appearance of complex problems. Individual scientists or single research groups do not possess enough knowledge, expertise and time to perform research which is appreciated by the funding agencies and academic publishers (Hara, Solomon et al. 2003). Nowadays research funding agencies, like the European Science Foundation prefer interdisciplinary, international and inter-institutional collaborations (Sonnenwald 2007), because these have been shown to increase the quality of research, contribute to the growth of scientific knowledge (Wray 2002).<br/>Natural sciences and especially life sciences faced a drastic change in data management, analysis and sharing practices due to the widespread use of inquiry methods generating terabytes of data. This change is represented in the appearance of specific tools designed for life scientists to handle scientific workflows or to help computation of data (De Roure, Goble et al. 2007, Goecks, Nekrutenko et al. 2010).<br/>Virtual Research Environments (Collaborative Virtual Environments, Collaboratories, Cyberinfrastructure, e-Infrastructure, Collaborative e-Research Communities, or Virtual Research Communities) are innovative, online, community-oriented, flexible, and secure working environments designed for scientific research groups working together (Candela, Castelli et al. 2013). VREs have the potential to change research practices, make the academic research faster, more efficient and even more transparent (Junge 2007), or even speed up the shift between fundamental research and applied science, and improve social and economic well-being (Dutton and Jeffreys 2010). Therefore, it is not surprising that research policy makers at institutional or European levels would like to develop and employ virtual research environments (Dutton and Jeffreys 2010, EU retrieved at 28-04-2015). But scientists in life sciences think differently about this topic (Allan 2009). While the EU is investing into the development of monumental VRE projects and universities build their environments separated from each other, scientists would like to use their legacy systems. Some research suggests that what they need is access to data storage and computational resources (including grid computing); as well software and services, but they do not need VREs (Allan et al. 2006).<br/>To investigate this discrepancy between science policy makers and life science researchers, I have performed an extensive literature review, did interviews with VRE researchers, developers and users, and performed an online survey filled in by potential and actual VRE users. By generating a theoretical framework from the literature and related theories, I could rank the factors found throughout the research that determine the attitude of life science researchers towards VREs and to build a virtual collaboration readiness model. This model illustrates the requirements that need to be fulfilled to reach to a state, in which all the circumstances are given to help scientists from life sciences to adopt to virtual research environments. Finally, detailed recommendations to distinct stakeholders are listed in the Discussions.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(mentor)","2016","A change in the access and egress system, like a new metro line, will automatically influence the station choices of train travellers. Given the fact that several new large public transport connections will be opened in the near future, there is the need to precisely forecast how the distribution of train travellers among stations will change, as it may give cause to (logistical) changes in the operation of the railway system. The most important factors for choosing at which station people will access the train are their origin and destination (ATOC, 2009; Hoogendoorn-Lanser, 2005; Debrezion, et al., 2007). Nevertheless, the current prognosis model of NS, De Kast, is however not able to realistically forecast the effect of new or significantly improved public transport connections to train stations on the distribution of train travellers among these stations as it does not take into account the train travellers' origins and destinations and different access/egress modes. This research therefore develops and estimates an origin-destination based station choice model that takes into account the access/egress modes walking, bicycle, car, and public transport. For an origin-destination based approach, detailed information about train travellers' origins and final destinations is required (ATOC, 2009; Wardman, et al., 2007). Nevertheless, filling a complete origin-destination matrix for a detailed geographical scale for all train travellers in the whole Netherlands would require massive amount of data, which simply is not available. Therefore, in this study, the city of Amsterdam was treated as an internal area with origins and destinations at the lowest geographical scale, hence the four-digit postal codes. Then it has been examined which destination stations in the rest of the Netherlands had the same distributions among the origin stations in the internal zone, hence the Amsterdam region. The results indicate that from the first intercity station onwards, where one would always travel to by an Intercity train instead of by a local train, the station choice probabilities are equal. This implies that all origins and destinations from the specific intercity station onward can be grouped into the same external zone. This implies that travellers that travel from the internal area to any destination station in the specific external zone would choose the same origin (intercity) station in the internal area to get there. On the short distance, this is however not justified as local trains mostly call at more stations in the internal area. Another external zone is therefore added between the long-distance external zone and the internal area, to account for the short distance trips. Then, using the survey data, per external zone the percentage of train travellers that travels to (inbound) or from (outbound) each internal zone is defined. This results in a relative distribution of train travellers between the considered in- and external zones for both in- and outbound trips. The shares are then multiplied by the number of travellers that travel from or to the external zones. It results in the number of train travellers between the in- and external zones, for in- and outbound trips. The danger of the revealed preference method is that it is unknown what the actual choice set was. To create choice sets that are logical and feasible to the respondent, conditions are applied to create origin-destination specific choice sets for each access/egress mode. Maximum travel times for walking and cycling are used to exclude unfeasible alternatives. Also, by conducting quantitative research based on the same survey data, the maximum extra time that people travel longer than the fastest possibility has been calculated for each access/egress mode both absolutely and relatively. Separately for each access/egress mode, utility functions are applied to the alternatives in the choice set to predict the station choice probabilities. As there appeared to be significant correlations among alternatives with the same access/egress mode, a nested logit model is used with the modes as nests. The included attributes that have been estimated using the Klimaat V survey that are significant, are the access/egress travel time by each mode, generalized travel time by train, intercity frequency at the station, number of metro lines at the station, number of bus/tram lines at the station, context constants for bicycle and car for inbound trips, and for public transport when travelling to an airport. The only significant differences between inbound and outbound trips are the mode specific constants of car and bicycle, caused by the vehicle availability at stations compared to at home. As for the rest, the choice behaviour is equal. The trip purpose of the train traveller appeared not significant at all. Finally, the predicted station choice probabilities per OD-pair are multiplied by the number of train travellers per OD-pair, which results in the number of train travellers per OD-pair that travels via a certain station with a certain access/egress mode. This is done for both the null situation and the new situation and the ratios between them are growth factors per station that form the input of De Kast. The model has been validated with the Ringlijn metro line case in Amsterdam. The model outcomes are comparable to the revealed results. It has finally been applied to forecast the effects of the Noordzuidlijn metro line in Amsterdam, with logical results: a steady situation at Amsterdam Centraal, 18% growth at Amsterdam Zuid, and a loss of passengers at most surrounding stations. When also including the future PHS timetable of NS in the model, the growth at Amsterdam Zuid rises to even 34%. The origin-destination based approach has appeared to be a strong tool for station choice predictions. By using revealed preference survey data to define the aggregation, calculate the OD-matrix, define the choice sets and estimate the model, it is possible to design an origin-destination based station choice model that gives logical forecasts and has a good model fit. Recommendations for further research and model improvement are to include vehicle availability and international travellers more extensively in the next Klimaat survey, and conduct a research about the behaviour of international and leisure travellers. Also, a limitation is that this model is currently limited to the current train travelling population. It should therefore be researched how the new train travelling population can be calculated for after the opening of new public transport connections to stations, or how the proposed model can cooperate best with the exogenous module that currently calculates that. Finally, a second validation is needed with a case in another city to see whether the parameters from the Amsterdam case are generically applicable. Other applications for the model might be forecasting the effects of new train stations and timetable changes.","choice modelling; station choice; access/egress systems; revealed preference; railway; train","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Transport and Logistics Group","","Transport, Infrastructure and Logistics","",""

(mentor); Pohlmeyer, A.E. (mentor)","2016","The Europe Container Terminals in the Port of Rotterdam is using Remote Control Crane Operation to increase the overall productivity of so called ship-to-shore cranes that (un)load incoming container ships. With Remote Controlled Operation (RCO) the operators are no longer positioned in a cabin high in the sky, but operate the crane behind a desk in an office hundreds of meters away. User research conducted by &ranj serious games showed the operators perceive this new type of work to be less engaging than operating a crane from the cabin. In this project, gamification was used to increase the level of work engagement of remote control crane operators of ECT. In the project a user-centred design approach was taken. Extensive research on the user, his task and motivations, the context and the organisation laid the foundation for the design of a gamification system showed on a display of the remote control system called; Kist Conflict. Kist Conflict is a playful territory battle for teams of six operators working in the same room (berth teams) that revolves around the challenge of collaborative productivity of crane operation in a responsible way. A digital prototype of Kist Conflict was created and used to evaluate the user experience and its effect on the work engagement. A user test with operators (N=7) showed the majority of the operators liked interacting with the game because it offered meaningful feedback on performance and progression, and playfully tapped into the machismo of the operators. However, a questionnaire on the perceived level of work engagement in the future showed no increase their perceived work engagement. The sentiment of video-games in relation to a serious work environment, in combination with a sceptical mindset caused by experiences in the past for a share of the operators, appears to influence the perception of its success. To allow Kist Conflict to stimulate work engagement of the operators, the gamification design has to be carefully framed to avoid the image of a video-game. Gradual implementation, starting with feedback on the upcoming task and the eventual performance of the team, is advised as a first step.","gamification; serious game; crane operation; container terminal; work engagement","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2017-03-11","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Persuasive Game Design","",""

(mentor)","2016","Segmentation and annotation of tumors in CT scans of the brain is a cumbersome time-consuming task for medical experts. Carefully annotated data can be used to build training data sets for machine learning frameworks, with the ultimate goal to fully automate this process. This thesis focuses on acceleration of the annotation process by implementation of an interactive accelerated segmentation model rather than implementation or evaluation of the machine learning part. The Chan-Vese model is an active contour model which can be used to detect objects for which the boundaries are not necessarily defined by gradient. An energy functional is minimized by evolvement of the contour. Evolvement of the contour in a numerical approximation, which uses finite differences and a level set formulation, is determined by solving a Partial differential equation (PDE) with an iterative solver. This thesis presents implementations for both 2D and 3D which use Successive over-relaxation (SOR) to solve the PDE. This computationally intensive task benefits from acceleration to keep the feedback loop, in the process of tuning parameters and convergence to the searched segmentation, as short as possible. The effect of varying the different parameters of the model are visualized for different examples images to allow for educated guesses. Accelerated implementations which leverage Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) on a Graphics processing unit (GPU) are presented and compared to sequential and multithreaded OpenMP implementations. Evaluation of the CUDA implementations with single precision on a POWER8 platform with a K40 GPU shows a speedup of 56 and 107 over sequential implementations for 2D and 3D respectively","Chan-Vese model; Segmentation; SOR; CUDA","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","Computer Engineering","",""

Ontwerpen leent zich namelijk goed als betekenisvolle context voor het aanleren en verdiepen van vakconcepten door leerlingen. Gedurende ontwerponderwijs bedenken, bouwen, testen, evalueren en presenteren leerlingen oplossingen voor een reëel ontwerpprobleem. In de vernieuwde examenprogramma’s voor bètavakken wordt vaardigheid in ontwerpen en het beredeneren van een ontwerpproces met gebruikmaking van vakconcepten verplicht gesteld. In Nederland bestaan echter nog geen ontwerpmodules die kennisopbouw gedurende ontwerponderwijs effectief faciliteren. Om conceptuele kennisopbouw tijdens ontwerponderwijs te ondersteunen, blijkt formatieve toetsing op geschikte momenten en met behulp van bijpassende instrumenten essentieel. Er blijken echter ook geen richtlijnen te bestaan om ontwerponderwijs en formatieve toetsing succesvol in te zetten. In dit onderwijskundig ontwerponderzoek worden daarom richtlijnen opgesteld, geschikte toetsingsmomenten vastgesteld en een scala aan mogelijke toetsingsinstrumenten voorgesteld om ontwikkeling van effectieve ontwerpmodules mogelijk te maken. Hiertoe worden meerdere sociale onderzoekstechnieken ingezet om input te krijgen vanuit zowel de theorie als uit de praktijk, door middel van onder andere literatuuronderzoek en interviews met docenten en leerlingen.

It describes the design process of an interactive installation concept, for museums owning historic artefacts, to be used by families and visiting schools with a focus on children as a target group. It starts off by describing the lack of interactivity between children and objects in showcases as a problem and aims to solve this by designing an interactive exhibit. As a prime example of a museum that faces this issue is Museon, a culture and science museum in The Hague. Their museum has been used to conduct research and test a prototype. A concept is proposed designed especially for their collection and their museum environment. The different stages of the design process have all been documented sequentially in this report. In stage 1, an elaborate research is described beginning at how people learn in general and specifically in museums. It moves on to observational research and briefly discussed the current museum market. In the second stage both ideation and conceptualization are documented resulting in a rough description of a concept. In the third and final stage, embodiment, this concept is further explored and detailing is discussed in an effort to optimise the experience. The report concludes by evaluating the results of the project as a whole and deems the concept promising and feasible enough to consider realization at Museon or a similar museum. It recommends one final iteration to solve some of the remaining issues.","museum; installation; interactive; historic; museon; drawing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor); Van Halem, D. (mentor); Gude, J.C.J. (mentor)","2016","The actual European Union (EU) guidelines for allowed concentration of arsenic (As) in drinking water fix a maximum of 10 ?g/L. However, this limit is expected to become more stringent: the recommended health related limitation from the US Natural Resources Defense Council is below 1 ?g/L. In Dutch groundwater treatment plants, the produced drinking water is already far below the EU guidelines due to As removal during sand filtration. On the sand grains, Manganese dioxide (MnO2) is present. MnO2 is able to oxidize As(III) to As(V). This is advantageous because As(III), usually the prevalent specie in groundwater, is uncharged and more difficult to remove. On the other hand, negatively charged As(V) molecules can be easier removed by positively charged iron (Fe) (hydro)oxides in filters. The oxidation of As(III) to As(V) during filtration of groundwater in presence of MnO2 needs to be understood in order to improve this process by adjusting the operational parameters of treatment plants. My research focused on the processes of As(III) oxidation to As(V) by MnO2 at neutral or slightly alkaline pH. I also took into consideration the role of (oxidizing) Fe as inhibitor in As(III) oxidation and as remover of As. I performed laboratory three groups of experiments at the TU Delft Waterlab and at the treatment plant of Vitens in Loosdrecht:  Jar tests using demineralized water with low concentration of As(III) and powders containing MnO2  Jar tests using demineralized water with low concentration of As(III), powder containing MnO2 and oxidizing Fe(II).  Column tests using groundwater after aeration with As and Fe, and fresh grains containing MnO2 In the three experiment groups it is resulted that:  With lower concentration of purer MnO2 materials, oxidation of As(III) to As(V) was the main process involving As.  As removal in presence of MnO2 material was enhanced by addition of Fe(II) to the system. However, the addition of Fe(II) inhibited As(III) oxidation by MnO2. This inhibition is avoided in experiments with delayed addition of Fe(II), when the As(III) oxidation step is completed.  The MnO2 in the column was active in the oxidation processes of As and Fe. When the free surface MnO2 grains is still largely available, the resulting As concentration was lower than 5 ?g/L. Afterwards, when more grain surface is occupied by Fe and other compounds, As removal decreased. In conclusion, Fe inhibits As(III) oxidation by MnO2, but it is also responsible for As removal. The inhibition processes suggested by the results are competitive oxidation and surface disturbance. The relative importance of these two processes should be studied further. Regarding the operational parameters, tests with a broader pH range can be performed. Moreover, the influence of filter bacteria has to be considered as well.","arsenic; arsenic oxidation; arsenic removal; manganese oxides; iron; rapid filtration","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2019-03-11","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Sanitary Engineering","",""

(mentor); Calabretta, G. (mentor)","2016","The main goal of this project is to introduce a new brand identity for the Mexican restaurant chain Popocatepetl. The owner of the chain is Debuut, which has 27 restaurants in the Netherlands. However, it doesn’t have experience in re-branding an existing chain. It has been successful in developing new restaurants throughout the years. This chain is located in seven cities in The Netherlands and faces financial decreases. The brand is very general and targets at a broad range of audience, which makes it hard to specify a distinct brand personality. The main research questions for this project are: How to establish a brand identity for Popocatepetl, a Mexican restaurant chain since 1983? And how to involve the company during this design process to give a better understanding of brand-driven innovation as strategy? During this project the brand is seen as a guideline throughout the entire design and strategy process. This approach is called brand-driven innovation (Roscam Abbing, 2010). This means that the new brand identity of Popocatepetl will help the company to get ideas that stay on brand regarding its interior, assortment, website, events etc. In this report the brand identity of “Popo” is established and applied in different design layers. The four design phases & results In order to solve this problem different studies are conducted. The project uses the four design phases of the double-diamond model (British Design Council, 2005). The discover phase is the internal and external analysis of the market. The define phase defines the design objectives, the develop phase shows the final brand identity, and the deliver phase includes an implementation plan and further recommendations. Internal & external analysis The first phase gave information about the current situation: what the visitors think and what the market of restaurants shows. The main findings were that: Mexican food is currently perceived as generally known food, which doesn’t feel like a special dining experience. Yet the place itself feels comfortable for many visitors. The external analysis shows that Popocatepetl doesn’t meet certain requirements as its competitors does. These competitors have a concept that’s kept simple, with a concise assortment and which targets a specific need of the consumer. Also focus on the food assortment is important. It should be relevant for customers; is it fast, does it have a high quality standard, is it affordable, or is it a combination of all? This point brings us to the last requirement: value for money. This one isn’t price related but experience related. A high experience can still be given for a low price range as long as the concept is kept simple. Brand vision of company It is important to note that the corporate strategy of Debuut has a high influence on the final brand identity. Popocatepetl currently doesn’t fit into the current product portfolio of Debuut, because it only serves one kind of experience: the Mexican experience. Debuut wants less of this theme, because it doesn’t feel a strong connection to provide the actual culture of Mexico. It thus wants to use Mexico as an inspirational source rather than a strong element to show in its aesthetics. The final brand identity “Popo” The final brand identity will be used for the abbreviated name: Popo. The modern areas of Mexico City, such as Roma Norte, are the inspirations for Pop. These areas are enclaves of cultural expressionism: it supports its community in local agriculture, small business, and artists. This mindset is used for the brand identity Popo that promises the following: “Popo wants me to be an inspired and excited guest. It claims to be caring, daring, and creative. It dares to express its ideas and inspires me to express my ideas. The soft and edgy side in Mexican food and nature are perfect sources to change my current status quo. This place is an escape from my daily rush. Popo becomes part of my social life, where ideas are shared and moments are remembered. “ Five design guidelines are made to follow the brand promise of Popo. The guidelines are supported with six characteristics that help to create concrete ideas for Popo. It also helps the company to have a structured way of establishing (new) brands for their future restaurants. Implementation plan & business case It’s recommended to implement the final concept Popo in several phases. The first year (2016) can be used as pilot phase where new elements, such as the food, work-wear, and small interior changes can be implemented in the existing locations. Feedback obtained during this stage will be used to optimize the final concept Popo, which will be implemented entirely in the existing location in The Hague (Nov, 2016). This stage also allows the company to align with its stakeholders e.g. franchise holders. The other seven locations are remodeled after the first opening of Popo The Hague. For future implementation the company must think of yearly events and even another version of Popo that is suitable for railway stations, shopping centers, and tourists. When investing 3 million for the seven locations it’s reasonable to expect that the new turnover equals the annual turnover achieved in 2008: Popocatepetl’s best year. The business case is calculated with the current average spending of 26,95 per person. When the new Popo wants to achieve its annual turnover it must attract an additional amount of 157 visitors per day for all seven locations. The figure below shows the business case. Recommendations The recommendation is to focus on the food, the story of the food, and its interior. These elements are quite a change for people. Therefore it is important to note that a good introduction of these elements is necessary. Other features can be used in the future, but again, this needs to be done with a good introduction and small steps to get everyone on the same line to understand the new Popo.","brand strategy; retail design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

The main objective of the thesis is the application of a procedure that predicts the fatigue crack growth behaviour in case of a tubular T-joint under axial load. This procedure relies on the basic formula of fracture mechanics approach during crack propagation (Paris law) and uses simplified geometries to simulate stress field at the vicinity of the crack and fatigue crack growth results from small-scale steel welded specimens to introduce material constants. The validity of the applied procedure is checked by fatigue crack growth tests on a realistic geometry tubular T-joints. Furthermore, the differences in fatigue crack growth behaviour between welded and base material specimens are examined as well as the effect of a single stress tensile peak on welded, base material small-scale specimens and tubular joints. The effects of stress range, stress ration, mean stress and load sequence are also included in this study.","steel structures; fatigue; fracture mechanics; overloads","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural and Building Engineering","",""

(mentor); Fu, A. (mentor)","2016","Networked control systems (NCSs) are control systems in which the control loops are closed through a communication network. These systems usually consist of sensors, actuators, controllers and communication devices. The disruption of these control systems can have a significant impact on public health, safety and lead to large economic losses, e.g. the electric power distribution, natural gas distribution and transportation systems. This indicates the importance of protecting the NCS against a malicious party which is attacking the cyber infrastructure. Hence, the NCS should be able to prevent or survive the attacks attempted by the malicious party. This thesis examines an NCS using a recently presented asynchronous event-triggered implementation. This implementation only uses one bit for each transmission, which largely reduces the total number of transmissions. Implementing an aperiodic controller means that sensor and control communications are limited to instances when the system needs attention. Due to the fact that transmissions only take place when control action is needed, it is imperative that these are not tampered with by a malicious party. Considering the principle of an asynchronous event-triggered based NCS, a security strategy is presented which can deal with eavesdropping, data modification and compromised-key attacks. The strategy consists of three main parts: encryption of the single bit sampling transmissions, key updates to spare the transmitted packages' length and the injection of dummies into the wireless network.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC)","","Systems and Control","",""

Real-option analysis (ROA) is a technique for valuing flexibility to adapt to an uncertain future which can be included in the traditional Cost-Benefit Analysis. However, current practice of real options in transportation infrastructure decision-making is limited and therefore this research aims to investigate to what extent ROA can be a valuable addition. Based on the application of the Simplified Decision Tree Method and Binomial Option Pricing Method in two different case studies and on interviews conducted, it can be said that ROA is valuable as it can enrich the decision-making information for certain Dutch transportation infrastructure projects. Essentially, ROA leads to optimal decision-making, additional strategic insights and it supports adaptive decision-making. However, there are also practical limitations for the application of ROA in organizations such as the current standardized decision-making process, the additional time and effort and complexity of the application. Therefore, a trade-off between the added value and the additional effort has to be made. Further research into the methods and the effects of assumptions, applications on different types of infrastructure projects and dealing with projects influenced by many uncertainties is recommended.","real options; transportation infrastructure projects; decision-making; flexibility; case-study; Cost-Benefit Analysis","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering, Systems and Services","","Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and Management","",""

(mentor)","2016","A demand to use mud as fill material for land reclamations has emerged over the past years. Such reclamations start with pumping a muddy suspension into an area enclosed by dikes. The particles in suspension then settle to form a mud layer, so that the supernatant can be removed. This filling process may be repeated several times to completely fill the reclamation area. In 2016, an example of such a reclamation will be constructed in the Markermeer, the Netherlands. To make this work, it is essential to know the timescale of deposition and the properties of the formed soft mud layer. Formation of mud layers takes place in two steps. First, particles settle from a mud suspension and secondly, self-weight consolidation of a soft mud layer occurs. The goal of this thesis is to gain more understanding of factors influencing these two steps. More specifically, factors which are studied are the composition of the solid particles and the chemical composition of the water, together forming the mud mixture. Natural mud consists of different particles. Of these different particles, the clay particles are affected by the chemical composition of the water. This is because clay particles have a large specific surface area and surface charge, causing electrostatic interactions between them. The specific surface area and surface charge also mainly determine the plasticity of mud/soil. Under certain circumstances, clay particles flocculate, thereby forming flocs. Flocs settle more rapid than the individual particles, eventually forming a bed. Because these flocs contain large amounts of water, the formed beds are also very soft. The amount of water contained in the flocs is directly influenced by the size of the flocs (Winterwerp and van Kesteren, 2004) and the rate at which flocculation occurs (Mietta, 2010). The water content of the flocs also influences the settling and self-weight consolidation and thus, flocculation influences the formation of soft mud layers. From colloid chemistry, it is known that differences in the acidity of the water may influence the rate at which clay particles flocculate. To assess the impact of varying acidity on the settling and self-weight consolidation of mud, settling column experiments were set up in which the pH of the water was systematically varied. This was done for two artificial mud samples, i.e. a kaolinite and bentonite clay powder, and a natural clay sample, taken from the Markermeer. For the natural clay sample, the initial concentration was also varied. From the experiments, it can be concluded that there is an influence of pH on the settling and self-weight consolidation of mud, but mainly for samples with high to extremely high plasticities. For the kaolinite, a low plasticity mud, the effect of pH is rather limited. Hence, the influence of pH on the settling and self-weight consolidation of mud decreases with decreasing plasticity. This can be understood from a soil mechanical point of view: the factors determining the plasticity, namely the specific surface and surface charge, also directly determine the amount of electrostatic interactions between the clay particles. If the electrostatic interactions between clay particles in itself are small, their behaviour is also not noticeably altered by varying the suspension pH. For the natural sediment sample, containing large amounts of calcium carbonate, addition of hydrochloric acid is neutralized due to dissolution of calcium carbonate. However, the dissolution of calcium carbonate also leads to a release of Ca2+ ions, which also has a profound impact on flocculation. Because of the large neutralizing capacity of both the fresh water and the natural mud sample, no large changes in acidity are expected in the Markermeer environment, in spite of the presence of pyrite in the Markermeer bed. This confirms findings by Saaltink et al. (2016). The mineralogy of the present clay minerals exerts a much larger influence on the settling and self-weight consolidation process than suspension pH, which is reflected by large differences in gelling concentration and consolidated volumes between the three different mud samples. Self-weight consolidation marks the transition between fluid and soil mechanics. In fluid mechanics it is common to use the concentration or density to characterize mud layers. However, it is the relative water content of a suspension or mud layer, rather than the absolute water content (cf. density), that determines its settling and self-weight consolidation behaviour. This relative water content is given by the Liquidity Index, that is obtained by normalizing the water content of a suspension or muddy layer by its Atterberg Limits. Using the Liquidity Index enables us to compare different types of mud. The gelling concentration, a state parameter which is often used in cohesive transport modelling, is also related to a material property of mud, namely the Plasticity Index. A power law relation is proposed relating the gelling concentration to the Plasticity Index. Hence, a first estimate of the gelling concentration for different mud samples can be computed based on the Atterberg Limits of a mud sample. The undrained shear strengths of the consolidated samples, obtained through a shear vane test, are related to the respective average Liquidity Indices of these beds. For the natural clay, the Liquidity Index of the settled beds appeared to give a good indication of the undrained shear strength, and shows a fair resemblance with results obtained by Locat and Demers (1988) and Houston and Mitchell (1969). Summarizing: The suspension pH influences the settling and self-weight consolidation of mud, in particular for mud with high to extremely high plasticities. This can be attributed to the surface charge and specific surface area of the clay particles. Furthermore, it is found that the Atterberg limits are valuable material parameters, also from a fluid mechanical point of view. These Atterberg Limits can serve as a tool to predict the settling and self-weight consolidation of soft muddy layers.","mud; settling; self-weight consolidation; flocs; cohesive sediments; Markermeer; pH; solids composition","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-03-11","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","Hydraulic Engineering and Water Resources Management (TU Delft-NUS double degree programme)","",""

(mentor); Zadpoor, A.A. (mentor); Blankevoort, L. (mentor)","2016","Introduction. Aseptic loosening is indicated as the main cause of knee implant failure. Despite all currently used techniques, it remains challenging to diagnose an aseptic loose knee implant. A promising technique to reveal aseptic loose related implant motions is inducible displacement (ID). ID measurements are used to detect implant motion relative to the bone. To diagnose a loose implant via ID, motion thresholds are required. Such thresholds are dependent on a number of subject specific factors including bone material, loading conditions, used implant and interface contact properties between implant and bone. Such thresholds do still not exist. As a first step towards subject specific motion thresholds, a finite element (FE) model can be used to investigate the factors affecting ID. Objective. To set-up and to validate a finite element model that can be used to simu-late inducible displacements of a tibial component of a knee implant. Method. As a basis for the finite element modelling, a previously performed experimentally study was used. This study provides data and material to build two finite element models. One model represents an aseptic loose (i.e., silicone layer between implant and bone) tibial component and a model represents a fixed (i.e., cemented) tibial component. FE-models were based on quantitative computed tomography (QCT) scans of the cadaveric tibiae. The experiments were simulated on the FE-models and the ID compared to the experimentally determined ID. Inducible displacements were expressed in terms of rotations and translations. Sensitivity analyses were performed in order to investigate the effects of assumptions during the modelling process on ID. The following assumptions were analyzed; bone material properties, load application points, interface contact properties, silicone layer stiffness and cement material properties. Results. Loose implant; translations due to top implant loads were found in good agreement to the experimental translations. FE determined rotations were considerable higher. Rotations and translations due to side implant loads were considerably less in the FE-model. Fixed implant: No clear agreement was found after comparing experimentally and FE determined displacements in the cemented implant model. A sensitivity analysis reveals that the implementation of interface interaction properties led to a considerable reduction of the error between experimentally and FE determined ID. A sensitivity analysis reveals also that experimental loading conditions were not correctly applied leading to a considerable increase of implant rotations. Effects of variations of bone material properties on ID are found negligible. Conclusion. Two FE-models were build. A model representing a loose implant and a model representing a fixed implant. This study shows that: i) The implementation of interface interaction properties contributes to a considerable improvement of realistic FE determined ID. ii) Experimental data used to validate FE-simulations should be sufficiently accurate to analyze a cemented implant and be suitable to implement in a FE-model. iii) Bone material properties have a small influence on ID and might be implemented in a simplified way. Further research is required to optimize the validation of the FE-models.","inducible displacement; FEM; knee implant; total knee replacement; validation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Biomedical Engineering","","Tissue Biomechanics & Implants","",""

(mentor)","2016","The nuclear reactors currently in operation utilise only a small fraction of the available natural uranium. By continuing in this track, known resources will be depleted too soon. Furthermore, Light Water Reactors (LWR) need to be shut down periodically so that refueling can take place. On top of that, their spent fuel must be safely stored for thousands of years. These unfortunate facts call for nuclear reactors which can convert non-fissile isotopes to fissile ones and produce less long-lived transuranic elements. Such a reactor is the Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR). In this project in-house developed codes were used for neutronics (DALTON) and burnup (LOWFAT) calculations. The isotopic evolution of nuclides in the core and in the fertile blanket was simulated for two different initial core loadings: a mixture containing 233U as the fissile material and a mixture with transuranium elements (TRU) produced by a LWR. Moreover, the transition from the second configuration (actinide burner) to the first one was investigated. The results showed a huge reduction in the share of the initial isotopes for the TRU-started MSFR after one century of operation. The amount of 233U in the reactor core at that time is equal to the amount needed to create an initial inventory of a 233U-started MSFR, while the 233U to keep the reactor critical can be covered by the 233U bred by the 233Pa extraction from the fertile blanket. Both these facts lead to the conclusion that a transition from a burner to a breeder MSFR is possible.","MSFR; Breed; burnup; fertile blanket; burner","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Applied Sciences","RST/Radiation, Science and Technology","","Nuclear Energy & Radiation Applications (NERA)","",""

(mentor)","2016","Given the current vulnerability of the profitability of power plants to price volatilities and government policy changes, the role of risk considerations in power plant investment decisions becomes increasingly important. However, when we look at simulation studies that look into the long-term impact of different policy designs on electricity markets, most researchers still tend to rely on risk neutral investment logic. A plausible reason for this is that a common approach to include risk aversion in investment logic does not yet exist. Therefore I have included three different concepts on risk aversion in investment decisions in EMLab-Generation for my Master Thesis research, in order to look into the potential effects of risk aversion on technology choices and security of supply: conditional value-at-risk (CVAR), constant absolute risk aversion (CARA) and constant relative risk aversion (CRRA). The results show mainly that each of the concepts make agents move more towards generating technologies higher in the merit order, however in a different way. Where CVAR makes agents switch in technology choice mostly in times where electricity prices are low, CARA and CRRA make agents switch in technology choice where prices are volatile. This shows that the choice of risk aversion concept matters. On top of that it raises questions regarding how different policy designs could interact with risk-averse investment behavior through their effect on electricity prices.","power plant investment decisions; constant absolute risk aversion; CARA; constant relative risk aversion; CRRA; conditional value-at-risk; CVAR; security of supply; generation mix development; agent-based modelling; EMLab-Generation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Engineering Systems and Services","","Energy & Industry","",""

(mentor)","2016","Inventory management is one of the cornerstones of supply chain management as inventory consists of a key contributor in all supply chains. In the supply chain sector, many inventory management-related problems have been broadly investigated and discussed over the years. It is of great importance for the supply chain of a company to make proper decisions when it comes to plan the order quantity or the time of placing an order, the safety stock that should be keep, the optimal location for its warehouse or other related decisions. Further, it is understood that defining “how much to stock” is closely correlated with defining “how much to order”. Hence, each firm follows a specific replenishment policy according to its needs. One categorization among inventory replenishment policies is made with respect to the inventory review interval (IRI). The IRI refers to the frequency of reviewing the inventory to determine when orders must be placed for replenishment. However, the IRIs differs among policies and companies. According to this categorization inventory replenishment policies can be either continuous or periodic. In the continuous review process, the inventory levels are continuously reviewed, and as soon as the stocks fall below a predetermined level (known as the reorder point or reorder level), a replenishment order is placed. This research is conducted from the scope of a specific company’s supply chain, company X that is an international book seller. Company X is currently one of the many clients of Accenture. Company X is currently using an inventory replenishment policy similar to the (s,S) policy. However, company X is in a transition phase aiming to change this current inventory replenishment policy to the so called Min/Max replenishment policy. The Min/Max inventory replenishment policy is based on the EOQ calculation. At this project conducted by Accenture, Macomi, a business consulting firm, provides the simulation capabilities. A discrete event simulation model was built for providing company X with the optimal EOQs of company X’s suppliers for the new replenishment policy by Macomi with the author’s contribution. However, it is unknown how the IRI of the current or the new inventory replenishment policy can influence the supply chain performance of Company X. The author of this thesis built with Macomi a simulation model and adapted it afterwards in order to conduct this research. The author contributed in building the simulation model with Macomi and parametrized it afterwards along with collected data of company X provided by Accenture for her research purposes. From the aforementioned, the aim of this research is to explore the relationship between the IRI and supply chain performance of company X. Hence, the main research question that needs to be answered is: “What are the effects of review intervals on the supply chain performance of company X?” The following sub questions are intended to be answered in order to answer to the main research question presented above. Those are formulated below: 1. Why it is important to focus on the IRI and what theories are relevant regarding the IRI? 2. Which inventory replenishment policies and IRI ranges are relevant to company X’s case? 3. How can supply chain performance be defined and measured, in the case of company X? 4. How can one test the effect of IRIs on supply chain performance of company X? 5. How do supply chain performance metrics behave under different IRIs for company X? First, in order to understand the purpose of inventory management, theoretical drivers of inventory were gathered. This includes the analysis of the currently used inventory model. Also, measures were 13 selected to rate the performance of inventory management practices, the KPIs. This step is achieved by conducting first a literature review. A top down approach is applied for that purpose starting from general notions such as supply chain management and narrowing down step by step in a systemic way to the IRI that is the key concept of this research. Second, an embedded case study strategy was used, specifically company X ‘s case, in order to scope the research. A discrete event simulation model was built for providing company X with the optimal EOQs of company X’s suppliers for the new inventory replenishment policies by Macomi with the author’s contribution. After the model was finished, the author built another version of the model to use it in order to answer the relevant research questions. The simulation model’s main outputs are inventories and service levels expressed in Key performance indicators (KPIs). The author’s model is based on Macomi’s model and is used to conduct this research to identify the impact of the IRI on supply chain performance. Hence, first the conceptual design of the simulation was developed using IDEF0. The conceptual model was perceived as a system. After defining the inputs, controls mechanisms and outputs as seen in the following figure, the system that was perceived as a black box was opened up using the DEMO methodology. DEMO was selected as a suitable methodology in order to map the business processes that are relevant to the inventory management and inventory control of company X. Figure 1: The conceptual design of the simulation presented as a system diagram. Afterwards, the model is implemented in the S3N interface. Before using the simulation model to run the tests, the author verified and validated the model. Subsequently, the design and the execution of experiments followed. After having executed all the experiments, the author proceeded in exporting the relevant KPIs for obtaining the results and for being able to analyze them afterwards, for all the 57 products that were selected from the product list. There are two relevant KPIs: “Inventory final product” and “% Delivered on time versus Requested. As expected, the results showed that both KPI values decline as we move from smaller to bigger IRIs: both the finished inventories and the service levels decrease as we move from smaller to bigger IRIs. However, if one looks at the scale, it is not that strong. Further, looking at both the two different KPI behaviors, they are consistent in their decrease. However, it is noticed that the decrease is not that intense, and hence, the influence of the IRIs is not that big. Moreover, it was observed that as long as 14 the IRIs are fluctuating from 1 day to 1 month, the KPI values do not decrease that significantly. The KPI values drop faster as we move the IRI beyond one month. Hence, valuable recommendations are made from a business perspective and from a scientific perspective as well. For instance, from a business perspective, a recommendation for company X would be to estimate if the Min/Max policy that is proposed to be “a real time” policy is indeed beneficial: Based on the results of this research, it could be stated that the Min/Max policy works efficiently with the low levels of inventory that are kept, but still, the review interval of the inventory does not seem to influence the service level and the inventory KPI. Thus, paying for the real time policy implementation, from the IRIs perspective does not seem beneficial enough since during one month period it is not needed to have a real time observation on what is happening to the inventories. More specifically, the results showed that the influence of the IRIs is not that important when they are less than one month. In other words, there is no need for investing on expensive software that helps company X managing and controlling the replenishment of products in real time because both inventories and service levels decrease with a low rate. From a scientific perspective, a knowledge gap was tackled as there was not much literature found regarding the impact of the IRIs on supply chain performance. Further, this research was scoped for a specific company; company X, in order to answer to the research question “What are the effects of review intervals on the supply chain performance of company X?” Thus, from a scientific perspective, it was not clear how supply chain performance could be influenced by different IRIs. Hence, the author selected a case in order to narrow down the scope of the research. However, limitations that occurred are presented and discussed. Hence, based on the result interpretations and the limitations that are observed, someone in the future could perform another case study to test this model for another company with different supply chain. Nevertheless, one could go further and perform a more fundamental study and not take just one case of company, but perform a more controlled experiment in which he is going to turn all the variables that have been thoroughly discussed during the implementation of the experiments.","replenishment policy; inventory review interval; discrete event simulation; KPIs; inventory","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-05-31","Technology, Policy and Management","Multi Actor Systems","","Management of Technolog","",""

(mentor); Kolstein, H. (mentor); Hendriks, M. (mentor)","2016","Initiation and propagation of fatigue cracks under heavy traffic loading is one of the most frequent causes of damage for road steel bridges. A particular case where fatigue phenomena have often been observed is the orthotropic steel deck (OSD). Due to its intricate layout with plated structural components in different planes and the inherent vulnerability of the employed welded connections to fatigue, bridges with this type of deck require accurate fatigue verifications. In the process of fatigue assessment an important part of uncertainty is the fatigue loading, commonly expressed in the form of stress variation at each detail. This stress-time history is typically related to certain bands of amplitude of stress cycles and their corresponding number. Thus, acquisition of relevant information for these aspects becomes important. Since, as representative as possible fatigue assessment is sought, strain measurements are utilised, so that bridge-specific load characteristics can be obtained. It is therefore examined to which extent relevant fatigue load information can be obtained through these monitoring in OSDs. It is further of interest to which extent, based on the identified load attributes, the stress histories at other details can be simulated. For practical investigation of the foregoing a case study is used, where strain measurements at specific locations of an OSD have been conducted. An approach is formulated based on bridge weigh-in-motion (B-WIM); a technique to weigh vehicles as they pass above a bridge. The main principle of B-WIM is the comparison of the measured response with a corresponding theoretical one, based, in this case, on a FE model. The peculiarities of the OSD result in various parameters that can affect the stresses and should be allowed for in the modelled response. The employed approach is structured in such a way so that the influence of these parameters can be examined. Application of the approach results into identification of transverse position and wheel loads. Then, simulated stress derivation at strain gauge locations based on identified characteristics and certain assumptions is realised. Comparison of these stresses with the corresponding measured ones gives an insight on the accuracy of the whole task. Unfortunately, acquired information on loads, transverse positions, wheel types etc. cannot be directly verified due to absence of reference values. Inspection of the comparisons between modelled and measured stresses shows a relatively good agreement in the overall shape, which implies close approximation of the wheel load-transverse position combination. In the vicinity of the sensors located under the deck plate, however, the effect of additional parameters like the wheel footprint increases. A number of factors thus act in a combined way affecting the stress ranges and leading, locally, to higher discrepancies. The discussed influence is further verified by a sensitivity analysis. Generally, it can be concluded that information such wheel loads, approximate transverse position of the wheel and wheel type (single or double) can be obtained through appropriate processing of the measured strain signal. Further, verifications need to be made, including comparisons with reference values so that an insight into the accuracy can be obtained. For further derivation of accurate stresses at deck plate details based on identified attributes, greater attention must be paid to the expected wheelprint (depending on the wheel load) as well as the correct inclusion of the possible stress reduction effect caused by the asphalt wearing surface.","fatigue stresses; load identification; orthotropic steel deck; bridge weigh-in-motion; heavy traffic loads","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Structural Engineering","","Structural and Building Engineering","",""

An important performance parameter in these photo-lithographic machines is the so-called stacking precision, which is a measure for the accurate stacking of multiple layers during the photo-lithography process in the xy-plane. The stacking precision is, amongst others, hampered by disturbances. Currently, a model is used to predict the disturbances and, subseqently, this information is used to compensate for stacking misalignment by active control. Some of the model parameters, used in the model, are not accurately known which result in inaccurate stacking compensation. The model parameter accuracy can be improved by using experiments subjected to model parameter calibration. Unfortunately, model parameter calibration may be hampered when choosing an insufficient experimental set-up. For example, it can lead to severe model parameter correlation. One way to improve the stacking precision is to calibrate the model parameters of the model by means of an optimal conducted experiment. Two experimental cases of the model are optimized using two different objective functions. Case 1 contains model parameter 1 and 2, and case 2 contains model parameter 1 and 3. A D-optimality objective function, which is the determinant of the information matrix, and an ACE1-optimality objective function, which focusses on the correlation between specified model parameter and the eigenvalues of the information matrix associated to the same model parameters. An optimization algorithm is used to perform the complex experiment optimization problem that originates by the characteristics of the model. Eventually, it is possible to acquire an optimal experiment which can increase model parameter accuracy and, therefore, give a reduction of worst-case stacking misalignment error by 54.4% and 9.4% when considering a 95% confidence bounce for model parameter case 1 and 2, respectively.","Experiment design; parameter estimation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-03-07","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Precision and Microsystems Engineering","","","",""

One of these aspects is the process of lane changing and car following behaviour. These two aspects determine the general longitudinal and lateral driving behaviour. Mathematical models that describe these types of movements for each individual vehicle provide the building blocks for microscopic simulation. In most models, these two aspects are modelled independently, but newer models, such as the integrated driving behaviour model (Toledo, 2003), attempt to mould this into an integral decision structure. This research attempts to validate the lane changing and car following behaviour of three models: FOSIM, VISSIM and the aforementioned Integrated driving behaviour model. These models are compared against a dataset from TNO of the motorway A270, in situations where free flow conditions apply. The models are tested on the desired speed distribution, the merging point distribution, the accepted gap distributions and the lane change distribution. The lane changes that are being found are classified by their distinctive causes, the so-called “triggers”. Six triggers are defined for lane-change classification. The main result is that calibration and validation play a major role in the validity of the models. For all tested simulation packages, their default parameters did not reflect the observed data. This means that the driver’s attitude and the traffic conditions have a large impact on the general driver behaviour. In free-flow traffic conditions, Dutch drivers tend to be risk-averse, as reflected in the low number of voluntary lane changes and the wide gap acceptance distribution. This risk-averseness is usually not part of a model’s default parameter set and therefore calibration is essential to simulate the traffic correctly. Furthermore, the different triggers helped to get a clearer view about what type of lane changes occur, where, and why they occur. The FOSIM simulation results show that this model has serious limitations. A main point is that this model is too deterministic regarding driver characteristics. Although in theory probabilistic factors could be added to the model, further advancements of the model, such as implementing probabilistic behaviour, requires reprogramming of the simulation package, which was not possible within this research. VISSIM gave better results, but it over-estimates the number of voluntary lane changes in free flow conditions on Dutch motorways when using the default behavioural parameters. Further calibration of these parameters did partially correct this error, but the remaining estimation errors differ per voluntary lane change trigger; courtesy and speed gain related lane changes are under-estimated while lane changes to keep right were over-estimated. Furthermore, the gap acceptance behaviour was not much improved. This may indicate that other boundary conditions, such as traffic generation, where wrongly assumed in the simulation. Also, one could argue if a gap selection algorithm could improve the accuracy. Further research is required to test these hypotheses. The Integrated driver behaviour model could not be completed within the time constraints of this research, but analysis of the car-following aspect of this model shows that this model has some limitations that could be easily solved by several counter-measures. Driver observation and acceleration behaviour issues could be solved by integrating psycho-physiological factors into the model, such as observation thresholds and multiple acceleration regimes. A main recommendation is to perform more validation research of current models to gather more calibrated parameter sets for a wide range of traffic conditions. The used data collection method, road side cameras, was an accurate enough method to gather enough data for this research. This method can be widely applied for other researches too with different camera mounting points, such as lamp posts and sign gantries. The triggers that have been defined in this research could be used in other studies to find if there are differences in driver behaviour for each trigger. However, within this research, 10 to 15 percent of the lane changes could not be classified in one of the six triggers. This may indicate that there is either a classification error or a missing trigger. For VISSIM, ranges of recommended parameter values for Dutch traffic in free-flow have been found and are provided in this study.","simulation; lane change; behaviour; calibration; model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","Transport and Planning","",""

(mentor); Blom, A. (mentor); Mosselman, E. (mentor); Heineke, D. (mentor)","2016","A hydrodynamic study shows high flow velocities at the IJsselkop bifurcation during the design discharge of 16,000 m3/s. The study, performed in 2005, concludes that these velocities might affect 1) the stability of IJssel river bed and 2) the stability of the grass cover layer of the flood plain at the bifurcation. This report provides a better insight in the behaviour of the river branches at the IJsselkop bifurcation during the design discharge. Furthermore, the likeliness has been studied that these flow velocities influence the stability of both the grass cover layer of the flood plain and the bed of the river IJssel. Additionally, it shows the effect on the discharge distribution at this bifurcation if large scale erosion of the grass cover or IJssel bed occurs. The route of the Rhine river towards the sea has changed several times the last few hundred thousand years. It deposited its sediment on various locations with a variation in sediment size, depending on its river type. The top layer of coarse sediment is located close to the surface in the Eastern part of the Netherlands. Additionally, the supply of coarse material results in a coarse top layer of the river bed around the bifurcation at the IJsselkop. The IJssel river bed top layer consists of coarser material than the Lower Rhine bed as a results of the geometry of the rivers. The IJssel bed consists of a coarse layer of approximately 1 m thick on top of a layer with finer sediment. The subsoil of the flood plain consists of ‘sandy clay’, which has been determined from stratification data. The level of the IJssel bed decreases with 1 – 2 cm/yr between 2002 and 2013, which is in the same order of magnitude as the decrease in water level. The stability of the IJssel river bed during design discharge has been assessed based on detailed drilling data. Three situations has been analysed for an insight in the behaviour of the river bed. The first situation is initiation of movement based on uniform sediment, which is based on the Shields mobility parameter. The second situation is initiation of movement based on mixed sediment. This is based on the hiding and exposure mechanism, which reduces the stability of the bed material. The third situation includes instantaneous shear stresses that are imposed by the presence of dunes. The analysis showed that a large area of the considered IJssel river bed can be assumed to be unstable during design discharge conditions. The stability of the flood plain has been assessed with a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the stability of the grass cover. A flow at the flood plain directed from West to East, the lateral discharge, is the result of the water level differences between the two branches just downstream of the IJsselkop bifurcation point, caused by the less gentle bed slope of the IJssel river than that of the Lower Rhine. High flow velocities are present at the entire flood plain, except for the Northwest part. The quality of the flood plain depends on the characteristics of the grass cover and clayey subsoil. The critical flow velocity is 1.3 m/s and 2.0 m/s respectively, based on a `poor’ to `normal’ grass cover quality and a flow duration of 20 hours for these velocities. The presence of discontinuities in the grass layer can initiate local erosion by the presence of turbulent flow and a weakening of the top layer. The lateral discharge may increase significantly as a result of large scale scour of the flood plain. The influence on the IJssel discharge has been estimated with a rough and conservative approach. The consequences of a break-up of the top layer in the IJssel river bed are assessed with a numerical model, Delft3D. Three scenarios are assessed: a hydrodynamic computation, morphodynamic computation and imposing an artificial deepening. The discharge of the IJssel varies from 43% to 47% of the Pannerden Canal discharge during the peak discharge. The velocity profile of the Delft3D model shows that the flow velocity in the IJssel is large compared to the flow velocity in the Lower Rhine and Pannerden Canal, which is the result of the small wet cross-section and the relatively steep bed slope of the IJssel. No significant changes are observed of the hydrodynamics when a morphodynamic update is applied. Only a small amount of sedimentation/erosion at the end of the flood wave has been observed. An artificial deepening of the IJssel has been imposed in the third simulation, to simulate the break-up. The deepening does not lead to other significant changes in water levels, flow velocity, discharge and bed level. Based on these computations it has been concluded that in the case of a break-up no large scale changes are expected to occur.","IJsselkop; bifurcation; rivers; bed stability","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-03-07","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Kamp, L.M. (mentor); Koenen, S. (mentor); Van Heijst, R. (mentor); Van Beers, C.P. (mentor)","2016","The pharmaceutical sector is more and more going in the direction of using living systems to produce the drugs, also known as biopharmaceuticals. The innovative capacity for biopharma firm has proven to be high, making them interesting sources for new innovative drugs for the market. Bringing a new medical drug to the market is a long and challenging process for companies. The average cost is about $1 billion with a time frame of 10 to 15 years from that an innovative idea is created until a drug is successfully launched in the market, and far from all ideas makes it all the way. This phase is also known as the ‘Valley of Death’, which only by the name indicates how difficult a trip across here is. However, many biopharma firms are still small in size compared with the huge pharma firms, and therefore have quite some troubles when traveling through the valley of death. In other words, they commonly lack key resources and capabilities to make it to the market. The purpose of the thesis report is to explore the valley of death in the biopharmaceutical sector. The focus is to understand how biopharma firms experience the phase, and to identify key actors and factor that play a role here, and their interconnections to each other. Moreover, the aim is to identify various strategies that biopharma firms can use to overcome the barriers that stand in the way of successfully introducing an innovative product in the market. The main research question used was ‘What are key actors, factors and strategies that impact how biopharma companies move a radically new product from invention to a first market introduction?’ In order to investigate this topic further, exploratory research was done to contribute to the current lack of understanding the valley of death in a comprehensive way. The research approach consisted of a combination of three different methods, to cover both theoretical and practical aspects on the topic. Additionally, the three methods were combined to tackle the exploratory research, since it wasn’t known in advance where the most information would be found. The first method was systematic literature review, which studied the current literature stream from the search phrase ‘valley of death’ in the title of the articles. The second method was carrying out interviews within the organization of Vintura, a consultancy firm focusing on life sciences and health care topics. Finally, the third method was company interviews with four biopharma firms, by interviewing two persons within each firm. Each method was used to answer all the sub questions in the thesis, and in the end all the results were consolidated into final answers to the sub questions, leading up to an answer for the main research question. The literature review provided information from a historical and academic perspective, however the literature on the valley of death is quite limited. The Vintura interviews provided a practical approach for the topic, with more interconnections and strategies described. Finally, the company interviews with the biopharma firms gave insights straight from the firms themselves, on how they experience the innovation process and its challenges. The interview set-up for the biopharma company interviews was interactive, resulting in interesting visual overviews of interconnections between actors and factors. The combination of all results provided good answers to the sub questions, and in total to the main research question. The valley of death is an uncertain and risky phase for companies that takes between 10 to 15 years to complete. Overall, the results show that biopharma firms should aim to achieve six goals in the valley of death: (1) develop the right product, (2) find sufficient funding, (3) have the right skills & resources at the right time, (4) make an intellectual property set-up, (5) plan & execute clinical trials, and (6) increase product development speed. In other words, aiming to reach these goals in the best way would provide a higher chance to deal with the valley of death successfully. Moreover, many key actors and factors were found. Examples of actors are regulatory authorities, contract organizations, hospitals, and various scientists, while some examples of factors are design of clinical trials, access to capital, and human resources. The thesis results also provided many relations and interconnections between actors and factors, connected to the six main goals presented. As an example, in order to work towards the goal to develop the right product, the actor ‘project manager’ in combination with the factor ‘leadership skills’ showed to be a critical element needed to get a good process running. Similar interconnections were found for other actors and factor per main goal. Finally, many strategy suggestions were identified from all the research methods, with specific links between a strategy and a barrier. An example of a strategy is ‘evaluate knowledge gained in clinical trials and tackle issues’, when dealing with commercial issues with the product. From all the results in the thesis, a theoretical model was created to visualize causal relationships between actors, factors and strategies in the valley of death. The model shows an overview of the six goals, with a detailed sub model per goal explaining the dynamics and connections. The model consists of the following elements: (1) a goal, which is one of the six main goals, (2) facilitators, which are actors or factors that positively contribute to reach the goal, (3) barriers, which are actors or factors that are blocking the goal, and (4) strategies, which are specific suggestions on how to tackle each barrier. Overall, this model provides a visual and practically usable tool to understand the main mechanisms in the valley of death, and concrete suggestions on how to increase the chances to survive the valley of death. The model can have a managerial impact for biopharma firms, by offering an overview of the key goals and the challenges. Furthermore, the model adds to the literature and previous research by providing an overview of interconnections and strategies that previously could not be found in the literature. It is recommended to verify the model through further research, by qualitative or quantitative approaches to find out if companies in the biopharma sector agree with it. Moreover, the model could partly be valid for the pharmaceutical industry, or be adapted to other relevant high-tech industries, which can then be investigated in future research.","Valley of Death; Biopharma; Innovation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Values, Technology and Innovation","","Management of Technology","",""

With the introduction of the OV-chipkaart (the smart card of the Dutch public transport) new data of passengers became available. Therefore the NS developed a new method of calculating passenger punctuality. Based on the check-in and checkout locations and the check-in time, for every passenger a promised journey (in Dutch: Reisbelofte) can be determined. This promised journey is the travel options with the earliest arrival time. Based on the realisation data of the trains and the checkout time, the delay of every passenger can be calculated. In this method of calculation more than 20 assumptions are made. In this research all assumptions are analysed. If possible the impact of each assumption on the passenger punctuality is calculated. The result is a possible error of approximately 2 percentage points. To improve the passenger punctuality two models describing passenger punctuality were analysed as well. The first model is developed at ProRail and the NS, the second model is proposed in this research. Both models try to describe passenger punctuality based on process indicators: performance indicators of the business unit Transport control and Traffic control. For both models the correlations between the various indicators are calculated. The results are comparable and for both models the strongest correlations are only moderate at best. The process indicators are focussed on delayed or cancelled trains while passenger punctuality describes delays of passengers. In a case study of a smaller area of the Dutch rail network, every correlation is calculated again. Some results differ significantly from the correlations in the entire rail network. This implies that localised steering to improve passenger punctuality might be more effective.","Passenger punctuality; Key Performance Indicator; Traffic control; OV-chipkaart","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Transport & Planning","","","",""

(FLG) is interested in further developing their composite product family. Therefore it set out an assignment for the development of a conceptual design of a composite main fitting of a cantilever type nose landing gear. This assignment has been conducted at FLG from the 23rd of March 2015 to the 22nd of January 2016. The main fitting of the nose landing gear of the NH-90 helicopter has been chosen as reference design. Through the use of analytical and numerical methods and tools, a conceptual design is developed which shows the technical feasibility of a composite main fitting. It was furthermore shown that a small size and highly specialized main fitting, as found on the NH-90, does not result in a feasible business case. The weight savings are limited in comparison to its metal equivalent, and the manufacturing costs of the components are high. It is shown that the business case becomes more feasible for large main fittings, as found on medium to large commercial aircraft. Larger and thus heavier composite components are proven to be more cost-efficient. A case study has shown that the design is scalable with relative ease. It is thus recommended to investigate the potential of such large main fittings. This research has provided insight in future opportunities for the composite product family and has given FLG an outline of the conditions in which a composite main fitting could achieve a feasible business case.","main fitting; composite materials; conceptual design; manufacturing methods; feasibility","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2016-03-04","Aerospace Engineering","Mechanics, Aerospace Structures & Materials","","Design & Production of Composite Structures","",""

(mentor)","2016","Small blind estuaries are a common phenomenon on the coast of Nicaragua, but unfortunately not much is known on their hydrological characteristics. A blind estuary can be identified by a sandbar that temporarily closes the estuary from sea. These blind estuaries often have very diverse flora and fauna on which they play an important ecological role. Mangrove forests growing in this ecosystem often play a central position, and are valued for a wide range of functions, productivities, uses and values. Unfortunately these forests are also under threat of destruction, which is often caused by human influences. In this research human impact, as well as the impact of drought caused by an El Niño event, have been included to understand the influence of a blind estuary on the well being of the mangrove forest. The study was performed in a blind estuary at the Pacific coast of Nicaragua; located near the village El Ostional. During a fieldwork period of approximately three months, the study area was observed and measurements on predominantly water levels and salinity were conducted. The resulting information was used (1) to classify the separate morphologic, biologic, and social structures in the area, (2) identify the interactions between mangrove well being and hydrological characteristics, and finally (3) do more in-depth analyses on the salt intrusion occurring in the area. The estuary contains two main landforms; the sandbar separating estuary and sea, and the back-barrier floodplain behind it. The sandbar is formed by wave action, and can be ruptured due to a highly seasonal river discharge. The floodplain inundates when accumulation of water behind the sandbar increases. A variety of common mangroves like the Red and White mangrove, and the Buttonwood tree, can be found in the floodplain. The floodplain next to this is home to the Tea mangrove, a very rare and low salt tolerance mangrove tree. Together these mangrove trees form an interior mangrove forest. The inhabitants of El Ostional mainly use the floodplain to shortcut their route to the shore. Their main interest in the estuary is for the fishes it provides. The inhabitants on occasions like to 'help' the sandbar to open, in order to have easy fishing possibilities. Inundation in the floodplain is revealed to be extremely beneficial for the mangrove population. The crab population in the floodplain turned out to play an important ecological role, where their burrows increase permeability. This enhances infiltration into the soil, which increases soil moisture and decreases soil salinity. The blind estuary is, although stressed by drought, able to maintain relatively low salinity levels. This is caused by a steady fresh groundwater inflow. An overall outflow of estuary water occurs through the sandbar, where head differences between sea tide and estuary water level are the main forces that induce a transmission through the sandbar. The resulting relatively fresh water in the estuary permits the growth of the Tea mangrove. A mainly pressure induced muted tide is revealed in the estuary. Together with the fresh water inflow and wind influence, a circulation is established that reveals a well-mixed salt intrusion, which is caused by over-wash events. Would the sandbar be ruptured manually during drought, then the result is an increase in salinity that would be devastating for the Tea mangrove, but supply the estuary and mangroves with more water and provide the connection between sea and estuary necessary for fish reproduction. Salt intrudes the floodplain during inundation, when sea water evaporates and salt is left behind, which accumulates in the soil. The more infrequent the inundation, the higher the salinity in the soil. This only occurs in the floodplain. Salt intrusion in the subsurface of the Ostional area is due to pressure differences between fresh water in the aquifer and sea tide. This induces a mixing zone of which the interface is still near the shore; most of the wells in Ostional maintain potable water salinities. In order to protect the mangrove forest, it is thus important to protect the complete ecosystem, in this case especially the crab population. It further is important to ensure the maintenance of a groundwater inflow, by protecting the upstream forests that enhance infiltration to the groundwater system. Whether the manual rupture of the sandbar during drought is considered problematic depends on the the value given to the Tea mangrove, the other mangrove population, or the nursery function the estuary provides. Further research and monitoring for the Ostional area is necessary to confirm the formulated hypotheses, and in order to keep track of salt intrusion in the estuary and subsurface.","estuary; mangrove; multi-method; hydrology","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Water Management","","Water Resources","",""

(mentor); De Koning, J. (mentor)","2016","Probably all readers can relate to the following story: after an exhausting flight, you finally end up on your destination. However, instead of immediately starting your holiday or business trip, you first have to wait before leaving the plane, wait at customs and wait in the toilet queue before finally reaching the last stop: the baggage reclaim area. The bags are not there yet.. although the belt starts rotating. After looking at the last few bags making their fifth round, it hits you and you start wondering what to do. There is only one thing left to do, queue up in front of the customer service desk and ask whether your bag might not have made the plane. As found, this happens to 1% of all travellers. Taking into account how many passengers are travelling (in 2014, KLM flew more than 40 million customers) and how often passengers fly this leads to the assumption almost all travellers will have experience with missing baggage. The International Air Transport Association (IATA), a trade association for airlines, has set up two regulations aiming for all airlines to track baggage on the reclaim belt and during custody changes in baggage handling. As a respond to the IATA aims and the changing customer expectations within the aviation industry, KLM asked for this graduation project. Currently the app Follow my Baggage is being developed, for passengers to track their baggage real-time. However input for the app is lacking on (individual) incoming baggage level. A research question has been created: “How can KLM obtain data on individual (incoming) baggage level and use this to both make their customers feel more secure and optimize their processes?”. Research has been conducted in the form of literature- and user research, resulting in a design brief for the solutions to the research question. KLM has set its goal for 2020 to lower their irrate (number of mishandled bags per 1.000 passengers) from 24 to 20 by improving their baggage handling processes. According to KLM’s vision, the company strives for being customer centric, innovative and efficient. These three pillars are used throughout this graduation project. Two outcomes for this project were expected: 1) a product and/or service to make customers feel more secure regarding their baggage and 2) a back-end solution enabling process optimization and the functionalities of outcome one. By answering the research questions, a foundation has been created for the designing of the outcomes: via using both new and already existing tracking events, the individual tracking of baggage should be viable. For customers it should be known whether their baggage has made their destination, when it will be on which belt and if a delay will occur, what it means for them. For KLM, the information would increase the process insights and therewith the possibility to improve and optimize the baggage process, decrease the number of incorrect claims and complete the overview of all processes together. The first outcome is proposed as a product-service-system (PSS) including three products and/or services together with a future vision on the baggage reclaim. The three products are the following: 1) An extension to Follow my Baggage; which allows the passenger to constantly check the last seen location of their personal baggage and to receive information on the unloading process, where to pick up their baggage and how long it will take for the baggage to arrive on belt. 2) How to walk bag; a sign providing guidance to the baggage halls and correct belt per flight. It provides the time needed to walk to the relevant baggage hall and how much time the passenger has before the baggage is expected. 3) Progress bar; a sign indicating the process’s progress, hung above the baggage belt. It communicates which activity is being worked on, how far the process is executed and at what time the baggage of a certain flight is expected on the belt. The second outcome exists out of six new tracking events, supported by RFID (Radio Frequency Identification, a technology using radio waves to transfer data) embedded bag tags and antennas placed throughout the airport and equipment. The six tracking events are the following: bag unloaded, bag in cart, bag on belt, bag recognized on airport (in transfer), bag loaded and within outbound system. It is chosen to include outbound baggage, since most mishandling of baggage occurs in transfer connections. This back-end system enables amongst others the tracing of exceptions within the process, more accurate estimation of lead times, making an inventory on baggage arriving and being present at Schiphol and speeding up baggage reconciliation (taking out baggage of the aircraft’s compartments and containers when the passenger boards too late). The project is concluded by elaborating on the contribution of this project on the three pillars. 1) Customer centricity: by offering the three product-services to the customer, the customer knows what to expect when entering the final airport and will feel more secure about their baggage. 2) Innovation: the back-end covers the transfer connections whereas up until now there is only little knowledge available. 3) Efficiency: by using data from the back-end, processes can be optimized by for instance improving the lead times, making the baggage handling more efficient. Wrapping up this summary, as IATA has set the resolutions in 2016 and 2018, other airlines will start responding to their aims as well. The main recommendation for KLM is to start implementing the back-end and customer front-end as soon as possible to grasp the competitive advantage of offering these services. The financial advantages outweigh the investments needed. This makes the opportunities described worthwhile investigating.","KLM; Baggage; Tracking; Customer centric; Secure; Process optimization","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Strategic Product Design","","","",""

Current products and services for consumers focus on providing insight into energy usage data, to enable the users to gain knowledge about their energy consumption and the possible improvements. Based on interviews with end-users, it appears however that many consumers are not willing to, or capable of, interpreting the data into relevant information. They do not have enough knowledge to use the resulting data, or they do not want to put too much effort in getting and understanding the data. New Product-Service-Systems (PSSs) should therefore focus on increasing the capability of consumers to understand the data and on increasing the willingness to buy and use these new PSSs. Three horizons are defined to categorize new PSSs of Fudura for the Business to Consumer (B2C) market: [1] insight & advice, [2] optimization and [3] Internet of Things (IoT). Eight concepts are proposed to fit in these three horizons and enable potential customers to stimulate energy efficiency in households. A roadmap is presented to explain the strategy that Fudura should use to reach the vision defined in the three horizons.","Home Energy Management System; Energy; Transition; Strategy; Roadmap","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Brand-de Groot, S. (mentor); Overdijk, M. (mentor)","2016","This master thesis shows the development of the facilitation tool 'Imaginarium'. Imaginarium is a facilitation tool that allows its users to experience visual thinking and apply it to their endeavors. Imaginarium is based on the visualisation process that Jam Visual Thinking has developed over the years. The visualisation process is the process of a group of stakeholders visualising their collective ideas in one visual, with the help of a Jam facilitator. The need for Imaginarium emerged from the fact that there are many people who do not have the available resources to hire Jam, yet would greatly benefit from the visual thinking method. Added Value The development of Imaginarium required a comprehensive definition of the added values that Jam delivers with their visualisaiton process. The tool’s requirements were based on these added values. There are seven defined themes in the values that Jam offers their clients with their visualisation process. These themes originate from three types of added values: elimination of complexity, elimination of miscommunication and the involvement of all relevant stakeholders. Combining these, the main value that Jam offers is shared understanding in groups. This is the core function of Imaginarium. The seven themes are: Give overview of complex information systems Involve all relevant stakeholders Make abstract information imaginable Encourage a constructive mindset Allow people to be open and honest Engage people in a fun experience Give a group a sense of direction Process Steps The visualisation process in this case is considered the process that begins with the scope of what the client wants to visualise and ends with the group of participants having a visualisation that perfectly represents their collective story. The first step in the process is the harvest step. During this step all input from the participants is collected. The relevant information is captured in word or image. It is important that all participants’ input is treated equivalently. The second step is the conceptualisation step. During this step the Jam facilitator integrates all captured information into one structured visual. The information is combined with a visual metaphor, that makes the story easy to understand and more relatable. The Jam facilitator then makes the visual of the participants. The Building step is when all participants start changed and developing their visualised story until they are able to perfectly communicate what they want to communicate. This is an iterative process that goes from decision for large compositional aspects towards smaller detailed aspects of the drawing. Design Description The tool is a set of 70 images that come with an instruction book that explains how to use them. The images lend themselves quite nicely to be used as visual metaphors. This allows users to express complex and abstract ideas with visual metaphors. By doing this, the participants are likely to have meaningful discussions. When visually expressing themselves, the users are challenged to fit an image in the overall story and connecting it to the other visual elements. To achieve this the users have answer specific questions for each image. These questions have proven to make the users consider the images as actual objects, either in letral or metaphorical sense. This, in turn, allows users make abstract information relatable. Through the questions the images are visually related to each other. This creates an overview of all information. Additionally the content of the images allow the users to easily find a relation in meaning. Either because the relation of two visual elements make sense (for example a tree grows fruit, fruit is used in a recipe by a chef) or because the images contain a common object (for example a man pouring water and a boat floating in water). This encourages users to create a single coherent visualisation of their story that contains several relatable metaphors. The process of using the set of images contains a step that makes each individual create and visualise their own story, and share it with the group afterwards. This allows the users to express their own personal and honest opinions and ideas. Coincidentally it forces the participants to listen to each other. There are two additional steps that facilitate an iterative process. The initial step makes users collect all images that they deem somewhat relevant to their story. This is similar to the harvest step in Jam’s process. The second step makes them decide what part of the story is essential and which images visualise that. One participant becomes the ‘game master’ during the process. The role of this game master is similar to a facilitator, he or she takes the group through the process and makes sure they follow the rules that are written in the instructions. This should keep the group focused. Finally, the instruction indicate that one of the users should present the story to the rest of the group. This allows them to evaluate their visual and gives them insight into what should be changed, removed or added.","Visual Thinking; Facilitation; Facilitation tool; Shared Understanding","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2018-03-03","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","","52.00170, 4.36893"

(mentor); Roscam Abbing, E. (mentor)","2016","In this master thesis a data based Product Service System is proposed, which will trigger and raise awareness regarding the unperceived environmental factors affecting our life quality and enable users to take action. The Atlas Network serves as a boundary object bridging the gap between our perception of environmental effects and their harmful reality. The problem is that environmental problems are not merely environmental, but human, for they are affecting directly our habitats and quality of life. Environmental effects are one of the ‘wickedest’ problems in our reality; they are unique, complex and require various stakeholders, which often contrast in interests. In essence, the project goal is to promote perception about air pollution effects locally, which in turn will lead to care and want to know, that will lead to behavior, that will mitigate the effects on human health globally. There is plenty of evidence linking environmental pollutions with human health. Although there is an abundance of technology and data available nowadays to promote the perception of this significant link, it is not directly perceptive to our senses, for some of the effects are virtual, making them both harder to perceive in the first place, and even harder to care about, or want to know. Moreover, the data itself has innate problems, being massive, exclusive and passive, it does not fully employ the potential it can have for humanity. The project achieves its goal with the design of a physical data animation system, and its implementation in multiple locations worldwide. Atlas makes the intangible data tangible by means of design and its integration with technology, and transforms the data from Massive to Focused, from Exclusive to Inclusive (e.g. general public accessibility), and from Passive to Active. The system includes a dedicated public-space as a part of a placemaking strategy, where the dynamic public sculpture animates the pertinent environmental data in the most perceptive way, and public sitting defines a perimeter creating an environment. Atlas Air is designed to trigger curiosity in a seductive way, not emphasizing the fearful and dangerous nature of air pollution, but rather presenting it in an attractive, dynamic and exciting package full of possibilities for improvement and change. Creating an experience of positive enlightenment. From literature research encompassing findings from various fields, including psychology, sociology, neuroscience, information design, urban geography and management science, it was concluded that in essence, we know what we want to know, not necessarily what we need to know. Therefore, the design strategy suggested concentrates in changing the want. If people will be curious and care to know the things they need to in order to aspire to have better personal health and better life quality, they might act to improve it. Since not many similar projects as the strategy and P.S.S. proposed exist in the market, a deeper analysis was made to four selected projects, that aim to promote awareness for some invisible effects. From an analysis using objective and subjective parameters based on the literature review insights, data design effectiveness scoring was done. At an early, conceptual phase of the process, two focus group sessions were held with pertinent stakeholders and potential investors. These were done in order to qualitatively verify the system’s concept desirability, viability and feasibility. From these sessions it was concluded that the system would be indeed best if it would be dedicated to a singular, specific effect, and that it should employ a familiar, seductive and intuitive design language. They found the concept both desirable and needed. At a later stage of the design process, quantitative verification was done via target users questionnaire, verifying the concept is desirable, viable and feasible from the general public point of view (160 participants). It aided in the selection of air pollution as the system subject, and in crafting the system’s value proposition; identifying potential stakeholders and partners according to public expectations. The final design of the system was reached after an ideation phase in which four concepts were selected. The chosen concepts were then evaluated individually and comparability to each other using a perception effectiveness chart, which was devised by the author. In addition, a roadmap to realize the product service system over a span of ten years was created. The Atlas Air Network consists of two components to correspond with the intended user experience a physical and a virtual one. The physical component is a dynamic structure and environment that aims to trigger and entice the user. The virtual component of the system is a web platform that corresponds with the third stage of the user experience, which aims to enable users to take personal and public actions. The P.S.S works in the following way. At the back end (i.e. operational processes and activities that are not visible to users) data of effects is gathered through sensors from relevant partners such as Aclima, a leader in sensor technology, then useful data is selected, aggregated and designed. At the front-end (visible to users) effects are animated via the public sculpture, displaying ideal, safe, and not safe levels. Every fifteen minutes effects are displayed in relation to other places, informing via relativity, and motivating the Atlas best place competition. Actions and recommendations are available via web platform interaction, where users find out what they can do to help and even vote on related petitions. Although there is no monetary profit directly gained from this system, its value is measured in terms of health benefits, social benefits, intellectual property, technological development, policies changes and users participation. In addition to the non-monetary value gained by the system, its monetary value is incredible, due to amounts of money and resources spent on air pollution damages that can be saved. Therefore, the Atlas Air network monetary value proposition can be described as a loss prevention strategy. If the Atlas Air will prove successful, its local placemaking strategy, once duplicated, will become a global placemaking strategy. Caring locally in order to change globally.","Placemaking; Health; Life quality; Environmental design; Data visualization; Data animation; Perception; Best-place ranking; Air pollution; Information overload","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

This limits its acceptance within co-design and maker culture. The research question is: How to create greater acceptance among the general public regarding the AM technology and its products? In order to achieve this a product category needs to be selected that can benefit greatly from the capabilities of digital design and manufacturing.

To validate these assumptions a test case was developed in which local design and production of simple wearables played a major role. This took place in a local urban context. In order to facilitate this a digital design tool combined with a mobile digital knitting machine was developed to allow for a rapid co-design track. The wearables would be produced by the consumer themselves. The final design of the garment depends on the consumer’s choice of material, shape and pattern.

The actual test garments where well received, even tough the machine did not perform without flaw.

(mentor)","2016","In 2011, the Wageningen University discovered and patented a new process for crystallization of sugar. In this process ethanol is added to the sugar solution and water is selectively removed by a zeolite. Royal Cosun renounced the idea of working with zeolites, but remained interested in the concept of anti-solvent crystallization. The study started out by analyzing the expected benefits of a process based on anti-solvent crystallization. The energy consuming process of water evaporation is no longer needed if only anti-solvent crystallization is applied. However, the concept introduces an energy consuming separation step to recover the anti-solvent. A literature study was conducted to determine the properties of the anti-solvent (ethanol) and the basic principles behind anti-solvent crystallization. Various models for the solubility, the viscosity and equilibrium data of sucrose mixtures were compared and validated. The model based on the modifed UNIQUAC method turned out to be in close agreement with a variety of solubility sources and validated, by the authors, for the expected ethanol concentrations and temperatures used in the process. Several process designs were considered for the new concept and a selection was made based on criteria provided by Royal Cosun. The selected process design consists of distillation columns to recover the ethanol, a crystallizer suitable for cooling and anti-solvent crystallization and recompression evaporators. Over the last years the Cosun Food Technology Center (CFTC) developed Mat-lab/Simulink based models of almost all the components of the sugar factory. These components can be linked together to represent the total sugar production plant. This model was also used for the study, however this meant that certain changes had to be made. Various new process blocks were developed that allow for anti-solvent crystallization. After several runs of the new model it turned out that only anti-solvent crystallization could not provide a high enough crystal yield. Therefor an additional cooling effect was considered. After optimizing the ratio cooling crystallization/anti-solvent addition it became clear that more cooling crystallization would result in lower energy consumptions. Finally two concepts were compared to the reference case, the traditional process. The results from the model showed that the new concept had a reduced energy consumption. However, the reduction is not enough to compensate the reduced electricity generation and the investment costs.","anti-solvent; antisolvent; sucrose","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2021-02-01","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","Process and Energy","","Process","",""

(mentor); Roscam Abbing, E. (mentor)","2016","Bol.com hosts an online marketplace for transactions of consumer goods offered by other collaborators. Collaborators choose to sell on bol.com, since they are the number one online retailer in the Netherlands and Belgium serving 6.2 million customers with 1 million visits per day. Focus is laid on enabling scalable network expansion of bol.com’s online marketplace. This expansion will become beneficial by bringing in expertise through their collaborators. The graduation project aims to shape a self-service capstone that facilitates their submission of content (product information). Design thinking is acknowledged and recently much appreciated by companies that pursued conventional iterative processes. Design thinking is integrated in the process steps of the project. Starting with understanding the context, followed by empathizing with collaborators, facilitating collaboration sessions, creation of service proposition/design and ending with enabling bol.com. A model of the self-service capstone is proposed with attributes that contribute to a seamless self-service experience. A capstone was used as inspiration due to its crucial nature as a top stone used in architecture for balance. By immersing in the world of the collaborators several strategic opportunities arose. Interviews were held that lead to the creation of a collaborator journey. Results showed, of all collaborators, currently business sellers face the biggest struggles. Despite their effort their content is not always shown on the webshop. Focus is laid on business sellers in the next steps due to their lack in control and having the least powerful position in the network of collaborators. Co-creation sessions were held with carefully selected business sellers and internal employees for ideation on the submission of content. Results were seven inspiring and thought through ideas. An internal rating session was held at bol.com based on four iterated and drawn-out co-creation concepts. Selected bol.com stakeholders were asked to join in a rating session, where criteria were based on attributes in the self-service model. From ideation in co-creation, insights of previous steps and internal rating with bol.com stakeholders, the concept COACT was created. The concept fits within the defined service proposition based on “co-managing content”. The proposition describes the value for the business sellers; being able to evaluate content in the assortment that they care about. COACT provides control on what content is shown on the webshop, by giving business sellers the option to accept or decline changes from other business sellers that sell the same product. The final blueprint shows the orchestration of onstage and backstage alignment needed for COACT. Validation by online prototyping shows business sellers are willing to use COACT preferably starting with a desktop version. The self-service capstone will be reached with the implementation of community interaction, facilitated partly by COACT. With the creation of a community model, the pillars that are needed for setting-up an online and offline community of business sellers is visualized. The pillars, valued transactions, are based on a literature review and experiences of business sellers from interviews and the co-creation sessions. Bol.com will take on a moderation role – act as the foundation - to make sure this community keeps on interacting adequately.","self-service; online marketplace; co-creation; content management; service design; service blueprint; community model","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Gillebaart, E. (mentor)","2016","Topology optimization is the process of optimizing both the material layout and the connectivity inside a design domain. The first paper on topology optimization dates back to 1904, when the Australian inventor Michell derived optimality criteria for minimum weight truss structures. In 1988 Bendsøe and Kikuchi published the pioneering paper ""Homogenization approach to topology optimization"", laying the foundation of numerical optimization methods for topology optimization. Since then, extensive research has been performed both in academia and industry trying to solve different topology optimization problems. Due to its general applicability, topology optimization has been applied to the design of many morphing aircraft structures including morphing leading edges, trailing edges, or both. It has also been applied to complete morphing wings. Morphing structures have the ability to change their shape throughout the flight. This allows for possible weight savings and/or drag reduction, resulting in a reduced fuel consumption. Despite the great interest in morphing winglets from both Airbus and Boeing, topology optimization has not yet been used to design morphing winglets, except for previous work done by E. Gillebaart and R. De Breuker. This thesis continues with the research by focusing on the following research objective: ""Developing a software tool to design amechanism for morphing winglets, using ground-structure based topology optimization, by improving, extending, and expanding the previous 2D inhouse tool."" The research in this thesis is based on previous work done by the faculty. The previous 2D tool is improved, its capabilities are extended and the tool is expanded to 3D. The current tool effectively demonstrates how topology optimization, based on the ground-structure approach, can be used to obtainmechanisms for morphing winglets. A two step optimization strategy is formulated, where the mechanism is designed in the first step and sized to obtain minimum weight in the second step. Both optimizations are done using the globally convergent method of moving asymptotes (GCMMA) optimizer, combined with the adjoint sensitivity technique. Due to the large rotations of the winglet, geometric non-linearity is taken into account using the Green-Lagrange strain measure. Various mechanisms for morphing winglets were successfully designed and sized both in 2D and in 3D. In 2D mechanisms were found where the cant angle could be regulated, in 3D mechanisms were found where both the cant angle and the toe angle could be regulated. An aerodynamic load case of 5 [kN] was defined. In 2D half of this loading was assumed to act on the mechanism, resulting in a minimum weight of 15.0 [kg]. In 3D the minimum weight was found to be 48.0 [kg].","topology optimization; Green-Lagrange; geometric non-linearity; optimization; GCMMA; morphing; morphing winglet","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Aerospace Structures and Materials","","Aerospace Structures and Computational Mechanics","",""
