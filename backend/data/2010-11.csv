(mentor)","2010","Global turmoil concerning fossil fuels, questions relating to sustainable sources of energy and difficulties with sharing knowledge led to the creation of the Energy Transition Model (ETM) in the start of 2008. The ETM aims to be a transparent, comprehensive, fact-based, and independent model about energy related matters, ranging from CO2 emission levels to sustainability targets. The original ETM was developed in Microsoft Excel® until the beginning of 2010. Because of the choice for Excel as a platform for the model, it suffered some serious limitations such as versioning, limited availability, and lack of compatibility. Independent of the chosen software, the company faced issues with the high level of complexity and a lack of transparency. Due to these limitations, the plan arose to develop software that relies on open standards, and independent, open-source software, so the model could be used without depending on commercial software packages. In the first attempt to create a new application it was tried to translate the Excel calculations to the desired programming language Ruby on Rails. Due to the model’s complexity this approach proved to be fruitless quickly. The way of thinking in the software development did not match the model’s design. While attempting to clarify the design of the model, it became clear the new model had to be developed in another fashion. This resulted in the research question of this thesis: What method should be used for the further development of the ETM to fulfill Quintel’s requirements? Combining model and software development methods into one resulted in the Object Oriented Modeling (OOM) method. The modeling steps in the OOM method are based on the model cycle, and the software steps are based on a combination of Boehm’s spiral model and iterative and incremental development (IID). The OOM method has resulted in the development of a network structure of converters in the model, which the software can use in a standardized calculation. For the ETM, this converter concept uses the thermodynamic law of conservation of energy and has become basis of the model. The basic structure of the converter concept supplies the required transparency of the model, and provides the flexibility to adjust or extend the model. In conclusion, the way of thinking for both the software and the model was combined in the OOM method which resulted in the converter concept. This has led to a model that fulfills Quintel’s requirements for the ETM.","energy; transition; model; software; development; method; OOM; OOP; cycle; IID; spiral","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy & Industry","","Systems engineering, Policy analysis and Management","",""

(mentor); Haas, E.M. (mentor); Arends, G. (mentor); De Waal, V.H.A. (mentor)","2010","Introduction Contractors and clients in the construction industry are increasingly interested in possibilities to reduce CO2 emissions and energy consumption. In the civil engineering industry most CO2 emissions are due to the production of construction materials and construction of a structure. The research focuses on the differences between insitu and prefab concrete construction and whether or not there is a significant difference in energy consumption and CO2 emission between the two construction processes. The research will cover the entire production and construction process; from the winning of the primary material to the delivery of the structure. Quick scan tool To determine and quantify the differences between the two construction methods a tool is developed, called the quick scan tool (QST). This tool is focussed on the construction of a viaduct. The QST defines four elements in a viaduct: Deck/beams, columns, abutments and foundation. There are 5 construction methods defined to nuance the results of the tool. From insitu construction in its most basic form, to fully automated produced prefab elements. With the definition of each construction method, calculation values are appointed. Emissions factors are gathered from multiple sources. The production and construction process is divided in four phases of emissions: Material, transport, factory and onsite. Results The QST shows that reductions in CO2 emissions and energy consumption are possible when constructing with prefab. The reductions originate from three sources. 1) Prefab structures are constructed with high strength concrete (C53/C65), therefore less construction material is required. Due to the reduction of construction material less CO2 is emitted. 2) The process of prefab construction is more efficient than insitu. Especially the emissions onsite are reduced, because less equipment is required onsite and project time is shorter. The emissions due to transport, will in general, be higher. 3) A prefab deck is constructed with box beams, this results in less force on other load bearing elements and reduces their size. All comparisons in the research are made to “the worst case scenario”, a predefined case which is an insitu concrete structure, constructed with the least environmental friendly electricity. With prefab concrete construction a total reduction of 23% can be obtained in comparison to “the worst-case scenario”. Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis shows there are a number of possibilities to reduce the energy consumption and CO2 emission of a project. Reducing construction weight and reducing construction material have the most significant influence on the emissions of a project. The implementation of green electricity in factories and onsite is one of the easiest ways to reduce CO2 emissions, especially combined with the implementation of (electrical) tower cranes. Especially with prefab construction optimizing transport routes is beneficial. Other CO2 reducing measures, like carpooling or hybrid cars have less effect on the CO2 emission of a project. The influence of each of these measures on the energy consumption and CO2 emission of a project depends on the type of construction method which is researched. Discussion The results of the tool should be put in the right perspective, due to considerable differences in calculation values and emission factors found in literature. These differences originate from differences in; scope, used data and assumptions. Due to the great array of data used by research institutes the data is difficult to assess. Future Construction companies have a number of tools at their dispense to reduce CO2 emissions in construction industry. Constructing light, reducing the quantity of construction material and utilizing the more efficient process of prefab construction are the most important. Other more well-known options like using green electricity and carpooling have less impact. To which extend construction companies are going to implement these measures depends on how the matter is incorporated in tenders. Governments have two possibilities to reduce CO2 emissions on a project level. A maximum CO2 emission can be defined or companies could get reimbursed by reducing CO2 emissions. The willingness of the government to tackle environmental problems is important in this matter.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction Processes","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","Data quality is often described as “data that is fit for use by data consumers”. The development of the internet and the various web technologies has increased the expectations of good data quality level among the data consumers. Web portals are meant to attract a wide variety of users and serve as an important means to access data in this information era. There is a need to assess the quality of these data, and so a framework to assess the data quality is wanted. This thesis proposes a framework to assess data quality in university web portals. The proposed framework captures essential DQ dimensions in four categories namely Intrinsic, Representational, Contextual, and Accessibility. In order to develop this framework, DQ dimensions were derived from literature. Next to that special attention was given to data consumers (users of university web portals), this led to the expansion and modification of the dimensions to emphasize the growing importance of the user’s perspective. The set of DQ dimensions has been tested with users using two pre-validations before the final validation of the framework. The proposed framework containing 35 dimensions is validated with user groups of two different universities: TU-Delft, The Netherlands and Pondicherry University, India. The validation showed that all DQ dimensions in the framework were valuable and important from the data consumer’s view of perspective. As an evaluation approach, this framework has been compared with an existing portal data quality model and found this new framework has important DQ dimensions in the context of a UWP. As a consequence, the proposed framework emphasizes the user’s perspective on data quality.","DQ dimensions; Data Quality framework; data consumer perspective; UWP (University web portal)","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Science /Information Architecture Track","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","The greater pressure from both customers and regulators to maintain and enhance service reliability, while at the same time controlling costs, has caused many utility distribution businesses to adopt Asset Management (AM) as their framework. Therefore, AM is widely being applied in asset intensive industries around the world. Generally, AM consists of data driven decision-making processes with the goal of deriving the most value from utility assets within the available budget. Asset intensive industries rely on asset data, information and asset knowledge as key enablers in undertaking both strategic AM activities and operational activities. Good asset information (timely, reliable and accurate data) enables better decisions to be made such as determining the optimal asset maintenance or renewal frequency for an asset. Consequently, in the past years utilities have progressively created databases to record asset or business data such as failure, maintenance, operation and cost. However, in many cases, the available data required to track asset population reliability are not sufficiently rich to provide a basis for straightforward decision-making processes. However, the determination of asset population reliability requires collection of data and systematic and scientific evaluation of data on equipment failures. In this MSc thesis project, a systematic approach for analyzing asset life data (data describing equipment lifetime) in presence of incomplete data by means of statistical analytical methods is introduced and applied in a practical case for medium voltage cable joint populations. The analysis in this thesis mainly focus on a statistically based approach which uses data available from the past to predict short term reliability of this specific group of assets.","Asset Management; Distribution Network; Cable Infrastructure; Life Data Analysis; Failure Rate; Aging Infrastructure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-12-01","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Electrical Power Engineering","","High Voltage Technology & Asset Management","",""

(mentor)","2010","High rejection rates indicate that prosthetic users are not satisfied with the performance of their arm prostheses. In theory, one of the advantages of shoulder controlled prosthesis, compared to myo-electric prostheses, is that the user gets direct proprioceptive feedback about opening width and pinch force of his prosthetic hand. However, commercially available voluntary closing prostheses require too high operating forces, which leads to discomfort and disturbs the direct proprioceptive feedback. The purpose of this study is to find an optimal operation force, at which the prosthetic user gets the best force feedback during comfortable prosthesis operation. During experimental research, subjects where asked to reproduce a certain reference force, with and without a visual representation of the force produced. The subject’s performances of blind generated forces regarding the reproducibility, stability and repeatability were evaluated to find an optimal cable force. The performances of male and female subjects, as well as the performances of subjects with and without arm defect were compared. As a result the optimal operation force level was found between 20 and 30 N for male and female subjects without arm defect. No differences in stability and repeatability performance were found between subjects with and without an arm defect. However, subjects with arm defect were found to have difficulties to reproduce high force levels. In line with this, the reproducibility optimum was found between 10 and 20 N for subjects with arm defect. It is concluded that of today’s commercially available arm prostheses only one is capable of creating pinch forces at the optimal cable activation force level of 20-30 N. The created pinch forces with this prosthesis are not sufficient to handle objects in daily life. Future prosthesis design should not exceed cable forces of 30 N when realizing the desired pinch forces for daily activities. Therefore transmission ratios or servo mechanisms might be needed to optimize prosthesis design.","arm prosthesis; proprioceptive feedback; body- powered prosthesis; voluntary closing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-12-16","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BMD/BCD","",""

The objective of this master thesis was to (1) assess the awareness of and preparedness for critical raw material risk of high-tech companies, and (2) develop an a tool for assessing the strenghts and weaknesses within a companies product development process when it comes to dealing with critical raw materials. Critical raw materials, whether through limitations of natural resources or political power, will become more and more of a risk for the different product developing industries over time. The threats to a company can be enormous as the lack of a material can mean that a product cannot be produced at all due to the unavailability of a critical part or a long certification period of a substitute product and its materials. This can lead to enormous losses and economic downturn for a company or even an entire sector. How to react to this threat will depend on the sector and product development process, as they are different for example in the building industry compared to the aerospace industry or to the production of consumer goods. Material criticality and volatile material pricing are issues that will become more and more of a risk to companies within the next 5-10 years. When it comes to dealing with critical raw materials, no matter what strategy a company will choose to implement conscious material use into their day-to-day activities, there will often be a lack of the required knowledge, experience, design skills, leadership and integration of the supply chain to deal with the challenge. To be able to make this transition, and keep on innovating in the meanwhile, a company might have to find ways to gain and spread knowledge throughout their entire value chain, from the product development teams (including fuzzy front end) to activities and services that are outsourced, for example manufacturing. As material conscious product development is not a widely spread phenomenon, there is no best practice of how to implement material awareness into a company strategy, its products and its supply chain. The proposed tool assesses the most important capapabilities at strategy, product development and supply chain level and identifies capability gaps where improvement is needed. The assessment can than serve as a guidance for choosing strategies and actions to reduce the critical raw material risk.","critical raw materials; material scarcity; product development; change","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Master of Science Strategic Product Design","",""

The project site covered an area in which two submarine canyons are located, respectively La Jolla and Scripps Submarine Canyon. Over 20 institutions collaborated on recording the hydrodynamics and morphological changes. The collective objective of these institutions was to gain more insight into nearshore processes. The canyons are responsible for substantial changes in wave energy distribution over an alongshore distance of a few hundred meters. The irregular wavefield that arises in the direct vicinity of the canyons results in a complex nearshore circulation and in morphological changes in the surfzone. The following research objectives were proposed for this study: 1) “What is the relative contribution to the alongshore current of (i) alongshore water level gradients due to the alongshore variation of wave set-up and (ii) obliquely incident waves?” And 2) “Can the numerical model Delft3D reproduce the order of magnitude and direction of the nearhore currents?” This master thesis describes the hydrodynamic circulation in the nearshore during the measurement campaign and the results of the numerical model Delft3D for two specific cases, respectively a day with wind sea and a day with swell waves. The incident waves drive currents and create wave set-up. Owing to the influence of the submarine canyons, alongshore gradients develop in the wavefield. It is concluded that the influence of the submarine canyons becomes more prominent in case of swell waves and therefore a larger alongshore set-up gradient arises. In both the observations and the model predictions an alongshore current develops strong enough to counteract the wave-driven flow.","Delft3D; NCEX; refraction; set-up gradient; wave-driven","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

It is important that an accurate dynamic aircraft model is provided in order to minimise the parasitic dynamics of imperfect dynamic inversion. Sliding Mode Control (SMC) feedback is applied to increase the robustness of the NDI algorithm especially in the case of a failure. SMC is well known for its strong robustness properties and controls the system using brute force. 1st order SMC is a discontinuous control algorithm and the chattering behaviour is highly undesired in practical applications. Therefore 2nd order SMC is applied on the critical rate control loop. This algorithm is less sensitive to noise and the control signals are continuous. It is shown that SMC can accommodate large uncertainties originating from control allocation error. Constraining the control solution minimises the parasitic dynamics and reduces the load on the feedback controllers. The Control Allocation problem is written as a low complexity linear program.

Its processor independent nature enables the instantiation and use of any suitable soft-processor core inside the fabric without significant modifications to the fabric hardware. Additionally, the fabric offers scalability on account of its 3D interconnect architecture that supports die-stacking to add additional processor cores to the CMP without increasing its area footprint. The hardware transactional memory system of the fabric reduces performance overheads of transactional operations, allowing transactions to complete execution faster. TMFab is shown to provide speed up as high as 3.44x for correctly partitioned independent transactions and can be used to analyze the points of contention for conflicting transactions. The fabric was synthesized for both Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) as well as 90nm semi-custom targets.","Hardware Transactional Memory; Chip Multiprocessor; 3D Network on Chip; Die-stacking","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics","","Circuits and Systems Group","",""

(mentor)","2010","Time-resolved image sensors enabling picosecond resolutions over large formats are needed in many advanced imaging fields, from fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to positron emission tomography (PET). Integrated single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) technology embodies the new frontiers of time-resolved imaging, namely better instrument response function, increased throughput and lower costs. SPADs have recently developed onto large arrays with increasing on-chip functionality. With larger array sizes however, the data generation rate has become a throughput bottleneck and thus necessitating an efficient data acquisition system. In this thesis a data acquisition system was developed, for one of the largest single-photon imager ever devised with 160x128 pixels capable of detecting the time-of-arrival of single photons with picosecond resolution. To handle the gigabytes of data generated every second, techniques such as a column based event-driven system for photon-starved applications was implemented. The thesis presents a test strategy and characterization methodology. Using the developed data acquisition system, the imager was tested and characterized successfully. To conclude, an example of a biological sample imaged with FLIM is shown as a demonstration of the potentialities of our system.","SPAD; TDC; data acquisition system; image sensor; FPGA; USB","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-02-15","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Microelectronics & Computer Engineering","","MSc Microelectronics","",""

(mentor)","2010","Masturbation is now proven to be beneficial to both physical and psychological well being. Within the focus of this project, in order to emphasize the aspect of well being the term autoerotic activity replaces masturbation. Autoerotic activity focuses on the whole body and any self induced erotic activity rather than only the stimulation of the genitals. It also covers activities that do not necessarily result in orgasm but still has an erotic value to contribute or affect personal well being. Moreover products play a supportive and enhancing role in female autoerotic activity. However products for female solitary use still do not enhance this aspect or address emotional needs and expectations of women. Therefore the design goal of this project is defined as: “to develop an autoerotic stimulator reducing negative emotions related to the usage while supporting the positive ones and reaching an engaging autoerotic experience in order to support the overall well being and health of the user.” The target group is selected as young women who are older than 20 years of age. After the definition of design goal and the target group; the project process consists of the literature research on autoerotic activity and the context research on emotions towards autoerotic activity; defining design directions, reaching a final concept and finally the evaluation of the concept through working prototypes. MINE is the product of an emotional approach to the design of an autoerotic stimulator. It focuses on the well being of the user through combining a self wash product, a shower puff and an autoerotic stimulator in a modular product. MINE is a long braided thread enabling three functions: self wash, stimulation of the inner thighs and stimulation of the genitals. The two parts of MINE, silicone and PE mesh are braided in one another in order to have an integrated multifunctional product yet undoable. The braiding supports user involvement and enables the user to chose a mesh thickness and texture suitable for herself. The modularity also allows the user to change the mesh as often as desired fir hygienic reasons and to take the wet piece away from the silicone piece to recharge. A wrapping cloth is provided with the product to wrap while recharging. This project showed that an academic study on emotional design of autoerotic stimulators and stimulation definitely holds challenges related to the sensitive nature of the topic however offers apparent benefits to the product group.","masturbation; design; emotion; context research","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design Engineering","","Design for interaction","",""

The most notable parts of this chapter are the large subsidence for Jakarta and the river discharges in the Jabodetabek area. While still operating on a macro level, bottleneck maps for the situ-situ and sea defense were made in chapter 3. These were inventoried using fieldwork and previous studies. The results of this inventory are three bottleneck maps for the situ-situ with the location of the situ-situ together with a value of damage potential, failure potential or risk of the dam. This approach was not taken for the sea defense due to an utter lack of data. A part of the missing information is gathered by field trips, but not enough to make similar quantifications as for the situ-situ. Instead, a bottleneck map for the sea defense was made based on the visual inspection itself. These bottleneck maps are not meant to give a list of all bottlenecks in the entire Jabodetabek area; merely a list of bottlenecks with a high risk. Locations with a high risk are the most promising locations that could qualify for monitoring and emergency solutions. Before the applicability of monitoring and emergency solutions in the Jabodetabek area can be assessed, an overview of relevant failure mechanisms is given in chapter 4 for both the situ-situ and the sea defense. Likewise, an overview of available monitoring sensors and emergency measures is given in chapter 5 and 6 respectively. This information all comes together in chapter 7. A selection of monitoring sensors is made for selected bottlenecks (from chapter 3) based on the conditions in Jakarta (chapter 2). These conditions and bottlenecks define which failure mechanisms (chapter 4) are dominant for the selected bottlenecks, and which monitoring sensors (chapter 5) are applicable. The dominant failure mechanisms together with the local conditions also determine which emergency measure should be used. There is a strong coupling between monitoring sensor, failure mechanism and emergency measure. The dominant failure mechanism determines which monitoring sensor should be used, and the failure mechanism together with the monitoring sensor determine the warning time. The warning time and dominant failure mechanism determine which emergency measure could be used. Finally, a pre-feasibility of the emergency measures and monitoring sensors is given, compared to conventional, completely new designs. The recommended monitoring sensors and emergency measures are put to the test in chapter 8 and 9 for respectively a situ dam design and a sea defense design. Both these chapters contain an application of monitoring sensors and emergency measures for an existing and a fictional, new design.","Jakarta; flood risk; urban flooding; flood drains","en","student report","TU Delft","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

(mentor)","2010","This thesis describes the research for, and the assessment of a new type of energy source and actuation, applicable to a Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV). From the preliminary study resulted a promising energy source: hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) which is combined with the basic principle of the internal combustion engine for conversion to mechanical energy. The combination of this energy carrier and the conversion into mechanical energy is achieved by applying catalytic decomposition. The focus of this thesis is to assess whether a catalytic driven process using H2O2, is suitable for functioning as: means of energy conversion at micro scale. To verify the potential of the proposed combination of principles, experiments are performed. A number of different catalysts are prepared and tested in an experimental setup which monitors process behavior, speed and temperature. The process behavior is recorded by a high speed camera, pressures are measured simultaneously by means of pressure sensors and the temperature is measured using a small thermocouple. Test results show that the use of manganese oxide deposited using acetate as precursor, leads to the fastest processes and highest pressures. Reaction times as low as 70ms have been recorded, resulting in pressure peaks exceeding 13kPa which is higher than predictions. The static pressures do correspond with theory and consist of only the pressure caused by the generation of oxygen. The water vapor generated during the reaction quickly condensates as the gas mixture cools down, leaving behind only oxygen gas at room temperature. This indicates an advantage of using a cyclic process, using the short term high pressure. The temperatures occurring during the decomposition process of H2O2, are around the 100oC due to the production of water vapor. This temperature is not exceeded since too little energy is present in the used 30% weight to weight (w/w) concentration of H2O2, as predicted. From high speed camera recordings the process behavior is monitored and shows that a catalyst deposited on a blank ceramic tile without the use of a porous zirconia layer, comes loose from the tile during reaction. This allows for an increased reaction surface which corresponds to shorter reaction times. Based on the theory and the tests performed, flight duration for 1ml of H2O2, will be around 17-57 minutes for respectively 30-98% w/w concentrated H2O2. Regarding the use of the proposed means of energy conversion from liquid chemical energy into mechanical motion, a number of sub system components are proposed, for smart system design. At the chemical side, further developments lie in the characterization, miniaturization and optimization of the catalytic process for use at micro scale. At the mechanical side, developments lie in the actuation system design which operates on the gas formation driven by catalysis of H2O2. Smart system design has to be applied in order to obtain a sufficiently high energy density regarding weight while still allowing for sufficient system endurance and fabrication.","micro-actuation; energy","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-01-06","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","","",""

(mentor); Silvester, S. (mentor); Knigge, J.D. (mentor)","2010","Today, the supply of energy is based on fossil fuels, which is often considered as an important cause of climate change. Moreover, the supply of energy is increasingly dependent of a few, sometimes political instable regions. An energy transition is needed for the maintenance of our welfare and environment. The needed energy transition will cause the system to change from a central continuous character, to a decentral and intermitting character and will put an extra focus on electricity as an energy carrier. This means that it will become more difficult to match supply and demand. By managing loads, demand has to match supply in the future. Since the Dutch domestic electricity demand accounts for almost one third of the total Dutch demand, it is logical that the electricity sector would engage consumers in efforts to manage load. But, the sector has difficulties engaging consumers, since the concept of behavioural change is already a difficult concept and is complicated further by the consumption characteristics of electricity. First of all, electricity is a commodity and is difficult to comprehend. Second, the consumer is generally low involved with the product, the product has a low cost priority and the consumer is ignorant of its own consumption patterns. Last, the problems connected to its consumption are too complex. Because this behavioural change is that complex, upfront user input is of great importance. It is important to understand current perceptions of consumers to guide desired behavior. The goal of this graduation project was to explore these perceptions by qualitative consumer research and to obtain inspiration for system development. The focus of development has been on the interface, since the interface is the system in users’ perspectives. The development vision of the system is based on open source to establish lasting and rich end-user involvement, cooperation between composite hard- and software components and kick-start innovation. The concept designed is named klik and is inspired by the insights obtained by the qualitative research performed and by theory on behavior steering design principles. Klik serves as inspiration for more detailed system development. The conceptual model created on adoption of demand management systems serves as input for further research.","user centred design; behavioural change; social marketing; qualitative research; demand side management; energy transition; interface design; open source","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","","",""

Nothing is further from the truth. This is specifically for the ice-skates used in short track skating which are bend in the direction of the corner to gain more grip. Several researches showed that the process of bending is difficult to master and requires a great deal of knowledge and experience. Nevertheless many benefits can be achieved by implementing a bending into an ice-skate. The product is called a dynamic ice-skate. The dynamic behaviour of the skate follows and adapts automatically to the trajectory of the skating stoke. This means that the skates have a better grip on the ice during the turns and the straight ends, improving the skaters performance. For this implementation no expensive bending tools and specific knowledge is required. The skate is compatible with current skating products such as skate-shoes and sharpening tools. The dynamic (bending) behaviour is based on a simple principle. Tilting the shoe ensures that the curved upper-blade deforms the skate-blade into a bend. A ball joint bearing which is incorporated into the tube helps to tilt the upper-tube. This principle is based on a simple cardboard sketch-model. Introducing the product will be first done for competition skaters. They can use this skate as a fixed skate and it will help to improve their technique even more. If the product is successful in this group (which happened also with the well known klapskate), the implementation towards the elite skating league will be easily made.","ice-skate; dynamic","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-11-19","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Integrated Product Design","",""

To ensure future funding of autonomous projects, the foundation initiated the Noblesse Oblige platform. The platform generates income through the (temporarily) employment of professionals at companies in exchange for a donation to Nobel. This project is about the conceptual design of the Noblesse Oblige platform. The analysis phase is used to explore the context of the project brief, to study relevant trends and literature and to verify possible needs and concerns of the different stakeholders by prototyping their experiences in a workshop. The various motives for participating in Noblesse Oblige, resulted in a list of requirements regarding the future service. In the synthesis phase, several online services designs (‘Dessin’) are generated and an optimal combination of ideas is selected; based on the outcomes of a basic requirements assessment and three evaluation sessions with experts. The concept phase is started with the creation of a multilateral service design concept, that connects the online service with an offline component. By means of a creative session, the formulation of a project metaphor and an additional study to the development of the social web, the provisional concept is translated in the Noble Intention Tool. The envisioned experience of this Tool is subsequently verified with a focus group and expert in the validation phase. The graduation project finally resulted in the conceptual design of the Noble Intention ToolKIT: Noble Intention ToolKIT The Noble Intention ToolKIT is a service pack for companies that want to start actualizing their Noble intentions on the spot. The provided service is based on a Noble Inspirator who donates his/her expertise to inspire a company on a Noble Topic. In exchange for the corporate Noble activity, the company donates money to a Noble Project of the professional’s and company’s choice. In return for this support, the Noblesse Oblige website offers professionals and companies an online platform to demonstrate their Noble Intentions. Virtual Hotspots mark the different locations of Noble activities on a digital map, and consequently show the spread and growth of the Noble network. To prolong the inspirational experience of the Noble activity and to incite companies to involve employees in their (Noble) business strategy, Noblesse Oblige also provides companies with a private Noble Community. On this private webpage, Noble Topics can be discussed and planned internally by means of an interactive timeline.

(mentor); Mulder, I. (mentor)","2010","Innovation is a procedure by which the thought process is changed through the introduction of new ideas, useful applications or new discoveries. In product (or service) development this means devising a product or service concept that satisfies the customer’s unmet needs. The goal of this project was to show how understanding the user will help Alcatel-Lucent inspire innovation in the telecom sector. This project primarily undertook the task of understanding the needs of a defined target group within the enterprise market, by conducting user-centred research. Once the findings were analysed, these were translated into innovative concepts. Finding a suitable target group for the project was important. The enterprise market is too broad so it is imperative to focus on a representative group that may increase the probability of encountering rich data. Contact centre agents make part of the enterprise market, and share many of the most important features with other groups within this market. The unique conditions of constant interaction with telecommunication devices in contact centres, makes it an ideal user-group for this research. A Contact centre (also referred to as call centre, customer interaction centre, or e-contact centre) is a central office (or point) within an enterprise which is dedicated to the handling and managing of all costumer contacts; be it by telephone, fax, e-mail, newsletters, postal mail, website inquiries, or chats. In order to understand and empathize with the users, personas can be created. Realistic characters can be created by taking the most important features of the target group. Personas help not only the design process but also the communication process with the different parties involved in the development. The two most interesting personas for this research are the ‘friendly receptionist’ and the ‘knowledgeable helper’. Creating a suitable research challenge is imperative, as it will guide the rest of the research. The following challenge is the most appropriate for this research: ‘What is communication like for friendly receptionists and knowledgeable helpers? What do they need in order to facilitate this kind of communication?’ Context-mapping methods were used for this research. These methods improve the probability of uncovering emotional and contextual information that cannot be found with ordinary research methods. Six users that comply with the characteristics of the personas were selected. By dividing the research into 3 steps (observation, sensitizing and interview) the prospect of encountering rich data was amplified. Analysing the data helps to find recurring patterns in the research. By dividing the findings into different groups we can find the most suitable for the development of an interaction vision. Breaking Homogeneity, Understanding the context and Empathy, are the most important findings of this research. By analysing them an accurate interaction vision was created. The interaction vision represents (as its name implies) the way the user will interact with the envisioned product. Getting this step right is essential to the creation of new ideas. Interaction vision. ‘Clarify the meaning of users communication, by creating enthusiasm in their jobs and enhancing the ability to share emotions and feelings with their clients’ Creative sessions stimulate the generation of ideas; different ideas were created by taking the basis of the interaction vision. Various ideas created during the several sessions and brainstorms were selected and ordered into topics. This helps to decide which of the ideas are the most interesting and potentially fruitful, for further concept development. By addressing a selected number of requirements the ideas were validated. The three most interesting ideas are: The Mat, Extra Sense and The Capsule. Each of these ideas is very innovative, and all three have the highest prospect of interest for further development. Concepts can be created by analysing the basics of each idea. The ideas evolved into concepts and emerged as: Footlight, Undertones and Dewpoint. ‘Footlight’ merges physical and digital products, as it adapts to the users needs and creates an overview in the workplace. 'Undertones’ extracts contextual information that can be used to empathize and understand the person you may be communicating with. ‘Dewpoint’ creates a new messaging system where messages are delivered the moment they are really needed. A film was created to communicate how understanding the user will help inspire innovation of new products or services for Alcatel-Lucent. By presenting the concepts in a situational manner, showing users interacting with the products, the film will inspire employees by presenting them with innovative solutions. Another important characteristic of the film is that it can be distributed with relative ease, and without explanation, so it can travel along the departments of the company inspiring its employees.","telecommunications; telecom; innovation; inspiration; user centered design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

The value chain is described along the global value chain framework of Gereffi, Humphrey, & Sturgeon (2005), who describe value chains as supplier or buyer driven. As the cashew value chain is trader driven (Gibbon, 2001), the framework is adapted. The main bottleneck identified in the value chain is that African countries miss a lot of value because only the production phase is represented significantly in the African countries. Cashew processing is fragmented and thus cannot maintain their market position. The four layer model of Koppenjan and Groenewegen (2005) is used as a framework to analyse the institutional environment. The four layer model categorises institutions in four layers: actors, arrangements, formal rules and informal rules. The bottleneck in the institutional environment is that African cashew processors need to fulfil food safety standards (such as the standard of the British Retail Consortium) and social working conditions standard (such as the Social Accountability 8000) to strengthen their market position. If the cashew processors do not fulfil the quality standards, they are likely to lose buyers in Europe and the US. The Food quality management functions model is developed by Luning and Marcelis (2007) to identify functions that contribute to the realization of food quality. This model is applied to cashew processors to identify bottlenecks in their quality management. Cashew processors need to develop a food quality management system themselves to fulfil the BRC requirements. This requires extensive knowledge on hygiene and quality management, which is currently not available at cashew processors. The cashew processors need quality management support to fulfil quality requirements such as the BRC food standard. In western countries often support is given in the form of a quality management manual, provided by the government, or by company headquarters, but these are largely absent in Africa. The quality management support is therefore given the form of a quality manual. A Cashew quality manual is developed to support African cashew processors. The goal of the Cashew quality manual is two-fold: to support cashew processors to gain certification and to improve quality. The current Cashew quality manual is designed in compliance with the BRC standard on food safety and the SA8000 standard for social working conditions, but in time other standards can be added. An implementation plan is composed that explains how the manual should be implemented. In this plan attention is given to adapting the manual to practice, training the employees and management, implementing all procedures, checking the company and improving the company based on the results of the check. The Cashew quality manual enables the cashew processors to cooperate more intensely with each other and traders because standardized policies and procedures permit easier communication. In this way the African cashew processors move from a captive relation with the processed cashew trader to relational governance.","Cashew; Africa; Global Value Chain; Institutions; Quality management","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2010-11-19","Technology, Policy and Management","Energy & Industry","","Energy","",""

This can eventually improve the image quality of PET scans by noise reduction and/or reduce the image acquisition time and the dose to the patient. Knowledge of the rise time of the scintillation pulse is also of great importance in the modelling of the physical processes involved in scintillations. Several setups are presented and assessed with the intention to develop a procedure that is relatively easy to implement and is suitable for determining scintillation pulse shapes of PET scintillation crystals, excited by 511 keV photons, with sub-nanosecond timing resolution. The emphasis is on characterizing the rising edge of the scintillation pulse. The time correlated single photon counting method was employed in all of the setup variations. A proof-of-principle of the applicability of a suitable measurement procedure is given, which achieves a timing resolution of 120 ps FWHM and was used to determine the exponential rise time of a lutetium-yttrium oxyorthosilicate (LYSO) scintillator to be 81 ps with an estimated uncertainty interval of [50,120] ps. Also recommendations for further work on the basis of this procedure are made.","PET; scintillation; pulse shape; rise time; LYSO; TCSPC","en","bachelor thesis","","","","","","","","2010-11-26","Applied Sciences","Radiation, Radionuclides & Reactors","","Radiation, Detection & Medical Imaging","",""

(mentor); Delft University of Technology (degree granting institution)","2010","In 2005 the Energy research Centre of the Netherlands (ECN) published its first version of the Offshore Wind Atlas of the Dutch part of the North Sea [3]. This version has been updated and improved using longer time series and another approach for the calculation of the roughness of the sea surface. In contradiction to other Wind Atlases which are based on measurements [28], use is made of data from the Numerical Weather Prediction model Hirlam. Measurements of wind speeds and directions are only used to validate the Wind Atlas. For the Offshore Wind Atlas, the Hirlam data is interpolated where for the vertically interpolation use is made of the Businger-Dyer profiles in combination with the Monin-Obukhov length [3]. One of the required parameters for the interpolation is the surface roughness. For land, it can be assumed constant while for sea it is variable. In the previous version of the Offshore Wind Atlas, the sea surface roughness has been determined using Charnock’s relation [9], where the so-called Charnock parameter is constant. In the new version, the equation of Hsu is introduced which states that the Charnock parameter is variable and dependent on the wave steepness i.e. the wave height divided by the wave length [19]. Assuming that the North Sea is a shallow sea and using the general wave equation, which relates the sea depth and wave length to the phase velocity of the waves, it was found that the wave steepness can be rewritten in a fraction of the wave height over the wave period multiplied by the square root of the sea depth times the gravitational acceleration. These quantities are derived from measured values which are interpolated to the location of interest. Using this approach, it is tried to improve the prediction of the wind speed distributions for a given location and altitude. Using wind measurements at several locations it was found that adding the wave data to the computations show a small improvement in the estimation of the wind speed distribution compared to the previous version of the Offshore Wind Atlas. For each measurement location and method, a two parameter Weibull distribution has been made, after which a comparison was done between the various shape and scale parameters. Generally, the scale parameter was overestimated by both versions of the Offshore Wind Atlas compared to the measurements. The cause of this behavior might be found in the data used to make the Atlas. The shape parameter is well predicted by the new version of the Offshore Wind Atlas due to the use of wave data. The influence of the wave data is found to be larger for lower altitudes than for higher altitudes. Besides Weibull distributions, also maps with average wind speeds are given by the Offshore Wind Atlas which are compared to older maps.","Wind Atlas; North Sea; Offshore; Sea Surface Roughness","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","",""

(mentor); De Boer, M.D. (mentor)","2010","Grid operators in the Netherlands are forced by regulations to introduce the smart metering service in the Netherlands. Consumers in the household have a better insight in their energy usage using the smart metering service. There are opportunities for the grid operator to cooperate with other service providers to share costs regarding the delivery of services to households, such as: 1) Share costs related to the data network; the creation of an own data network requires high investments. 2) Share costs related to service platforms, implementation of smart meters require high investments. The merits and demerits have to be clarified for different organizations in order to involve them in cooperation for the delivery of services to households. The aim of the research is therefore at the creation of viable business models for cooperating organizations that want to deliver services to households, therefore the research question is defined as: “How to share the merits and the demerits of the data network and of the service platform among the Dutch regional grid operators and the cooperating service providers, to make it a viable business model for the delivery of complementary services next to the smart metering service?” This research has an explorative nature; the required qualitative data is collected through desk research and through semi-structured interviews with 13 respondents. Theories and methods from academic literature that are used in this research are services value, service platforms, multi-sided markets, scenario analysis, design cycle of Verschuren, STOF method and STOF model. Other concepts that are explained are smart homes and smart metering. Also, the utility sector, the access services sector, the security sector and the healthcare sector are fully described regarding the services that they deliver to households and about their expectations of cooperation for the delivery of services to households. The scenario analysis is used to design six scenarios, the used dimensions are “regulation regarding the smart meter” and “standardisation and alignment of technology”. The scenarios were validated and three scenarios were selected to be used as a start point for the design of business models. Business models were designed using the design cycle of Verschuren, the STOF method, the STOF model and using multi-sided market theory. The business models are named “null scenario”, “centralized cooperation” and “complete integration” and all represented a different form of cooperation between the grid operator and service providers for the delivery of services to households. The main findings of the research –to answer the research question– is that there are three likely forms of cooperation between the grid operator and service providers, where the merits and demerits are shared in different ways to make the business models viable, which are: 1) The grid operator acts on an individual basis (null scenario business model) for the delivery of smart metering services to households. 2) The grid operator –just like other service providers– cooperates with the access services provider for service delivery to smart homes (centralized cooperation business model). Costs are shared regarding the data network, what results in cost-savings for the cooperating service providers. 3) The grid operator cooperates with the access services provider for their multi-sides service platform services. Smart meters –just like the service platforms of other service providers– are integrated and exist as a virtual service platform in the multi-sided service platform at the consumer side for service delivery. In this business model (complete integration), even more cost-savings are realized for the grid operator and for the cooperating service providers, because the costs of the data network and of the service platform are shared. This study contributes to the scientific economic discipline through the multi-sided market theory, to the scientific business model discipline through the STOF model and to the research domain on service platforms by providing an extensive explanation of this concept. On the practical side, this study provides the management of companies in the service provider market and in the energy market with information what can be used to make better informed strategic choices regarding their business.","smart metering; service platforms; multi-sided markets; scenario analysis; business models; STOF method; STOF model; utility sector; access services sector; security sector; healthcare sector; service delivery; smart homes; grid operators; design cycle; interviews","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Technology, Policy and Management","Infrastructure Systems and Services","","Management of Technology, Energy & Industry","",""

(mentor); Khosh Elham, K. (mentor); Gorte, B.G.H. (mentor)","2010","To meet the growing demand for sustainable energy, existing wind turbines have to be made more powerful and efficient. One of the research topics to achieve this, is the aero-elastic stability limit of the blades. This can be analyzed by the vibrations that occur on the blades during normal operational conditions. In this study high speed photogrammetry is used to measure blade vibrations of a model wind turbine. By placing targets on the blades of the wind turbine and taking images with two synchronized high speed cameras, the motion of the blades is captured. High speed cameras produce a large number of images, making manual target measurements impractical. In this study, it is investigated how target measurements in high speed images can be automated and what accuracy can be obtained for the reconstructed object coordinates. To automate the target measurements, a method is developed based on target detection and tracking. The targets in the images are detected using a threshold histogram segmentation. Since the targets describe a circular motion a circle is used as model to track its position in the sequence of frames. To measure the targets with subpixel precision, the edges of the targets are detected and a circle is fitted to the edges. To reconstruct the object coordinates a Direct Linear Transformation (DLT) is used. The DLT equations are linear and can easily be solved with standard Least Squares Estimation. The developed methods were used for an experiment in a wind tunnel, whereby images of a model wind turbine were made with an acquisition frequency of 500 Hz and a rotational speed of 260 rpm. Retro-reflective targets were put on the blades to identify the measuring points. Using the developed methods, the targets were successfully measured and tracked in the images of the experiment. Using the targets measured in the images, 3D object coordinates were calculated with an accuracy of 1.32 millimeter. The vibrations of a target were obtained by means of Principal Component Analyses (PCA). Using PCA, the track of coordinates of a target was transformed to a new coordinate system. The xy plane of this new coordinate system coincided with the rotation plane of the target and the z axis is perpendicular to it, containing the vibrations. The measured vibration had a maximum amplitude of 6 mm, with an accuracy of 0.56 mm in the vibration component. From the performed experiment with the model wind turbine, it can be concluded that the blade vibrations can be measured using high speed photogrammetry.","High Speed Photogrammetry; Wind Turbine Photogrammetry","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-11-16","Aerospace Engineering","Optical and Laser Remote Sensing","","Geomatics","",""

(mentor)","2010","In general all adults sleep seven to eight hours per night. In other words: human kind sleeps one third of their lifetime. Until now, there has not found scientific evidence for the function of sleep, but the theory most accepted is that sleep has a restorative function. Sleeplessness can cause serious health problems on the long run. In modern society there is much pressure to achieve, which is the reason why stress gets experienced as an issue more often. Nowadays there is one out of three people who have temporal sleeping problems. The vision of Philips Research is to enhance peoples lifes. Therefore there has been started a sleep enhancement project. Due to touch being closely related with emotional feelings and due to its intimacy, tactual properties are suitable to focus on in the project. The aim is to make the experience of falling asleep more pleasant, through a relaxing interaction with the design. The targetgroup are people between 25 and 45 years, who sometimes cannot manage to fall asleep due to stressful thoughts. The methods being used were mainly ‘Vision in Product design’, combined with contextmapping. End users were closely involved in the project. The analysis is thorough: with a literature study, interviews with several experts, contextmapping and deconstructing related products. The analysis is in this way a solid starting point to argue the design statement: ‘I want to create a predictive intimate experience which makes one enjoying entering a soft flow of letting go and winding down.’ The selected characteristics for the design phase need to be sensitive and understanding. It should behave accordingly. Furthermore, the design should attract attention and then it should feel predictive and loyal so that one could enjoy ones own relaxation transformation. At last the design should fit to the context of the bed. After the ideation, there were three prototypes realized. In this way the concepts could be evaluated, based on tactual experience. The concept which came out best was the cushion which slowly expands and shrinks. The design got further developed and evaluated with end users. Participants experienced it as a pleasant and relaxing feeling, while using the product. It got associated with sleeping with somebody and at the same time people followed the breathing rhythm unconsciously. There can also be concluded that the design vision fits with the cushion. The report concludes with recommendations related to the offered breathing rhythm of the pillow, further design recommendations and advices on upcoming research.","relaxation; sleep; breathing","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2012-01-16","Industrial Design Engineering","Design Aesthetics","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

The Integrated Architecture Framework (IAF) constitutes four abstraction levels: the contextual, the conceptual, the logical and the physical abstraction level. When forming an enterprise architecture, one often starts with the highest abstraction level, containing the least detail, and handles each abstraction level in succession. With each abstraction level more and more detail is added, until the enterprise architecture has been fully shaped. Enterprise architects of Capgemini have observed that in the subsidy market most competing organizations offer solutions that cover only one or maybe two abstraction levels of the IAF, mostly the third and fourth level, but there are no organizations offering end-to-end solutions, i.e. solutions which handle the three lower abstraction levels of the IAF in succession, known by these enterprise architects. A solution which covers these three abstraction levels of the IAF would give Capgemini a unique selling point. Within Capgemini it is believed that DEMO can provide a comprehensive and easy means to represent the interpretation of the second abstraction level of the IAF, i.e. the conceptual abstraction level. For the representation of the third abstraction level of the IAF, the logical abstraction level, the Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) is a well proven and often used standard at Capgemini. A a result they would like to know if DEMO can be transformed to BPMN, with the goal to incorporate DEMO and this transformation in the end-to-end solution Capgemini would like to offer.

(mentor)","2010","Since the introduction of Dance Festivals in The Netherlands in the nineties, the phenomenon has evolved into an experience industry on its own nowadays, and the offer in experiences goes far beyond only live musical performances. To stand out in such a crowded field as the Dutch Dance Festival scene, organizations are evidently engaging in the creation of distinct identities by focusing on niches in music, themes and atmosphere. Being an important player in the Dutch festival scene, Extrema organizes several festivals throughout the year, each having its Unique Selling Points (USP’s). One of the major festivals of Extrema is Solar Weekend. This three days during festival presents a crossover programming between pop, hip hop and dance music, and is a place where music and many other forms of art come together. Despite the broad offer in carefully themed (sub)cultural activities Solar provides, Extrema identified a trend of ‘planning through programs’ among visitors. That is, people tend to plan their visits by selecting only the most well known and popular performances just afore the start of the festival. Because of these biased plans, the public is likely to miss several important aspects of Solar Weekend that form the ultimate Solar feeling Extrema is aiming at. Next to that, is it also plausible that they pass by the tension that is deliberately built up and phased out by Extrema during the run up and aftermath of the festival via social media, which are important aspects of the total experience. Therefore, the design challenge of this graduation project was: “to design a playful and innovative expedition that enriches the total festival experience of Solar Weekend, in such a way that the ultimate Solar feeling is experienced.” For this end, the project was initiated with literature and contextual studies to Extrema, Solar Weekend and festival experiences in general. With the gained knowledge an interaction vision was created that supported exploration and ideation. By iteratively diverging and converging a concept, Solar Expedition 3.0, was created and developed so that it was ready to be evaluated and valued by potential participants: Solar Expedition 3.0 offers a limited amount of Solar Weekend visitors the possibility to be actively engaged with the enrichment of their personal festival experiences, from run up to aftermath. When participating, groups of friends are enabled to co-create their festival experiences on forehand, by designing and planning activities in an online expedition community. During Solar Weekend, all participants are led criss-cross through the festival with the use of Augmented Reality, thereby encountering all Solar ingredients and other participating groups in collaborative and playful activities. While joining in these activities, the participants are already busy with the creation of tangible memories that will revive the experience both online and offline after the festival has ended. The setup of the evaluation study was twofold as also Solar Expedition 2010 was examined through real life contribution of the test participants. Solar Expedition 3.0 was evaluated by means of a video review wherein it was depicted. Various strengths, weaknesses and recommendations were found as a result, which were used to refine the concept into a final design proposal. Solar Expedition 3.0 is a successful means to enrich and unify the three separate festival phases. Although this is accomplished by numerous interdependent aspects, participants pointed out that especially co-creation and the teasing storyline play a major role. By offering the opportunity to customize a versatile festival experience that comes with altered privileges, all participants are enabled to form a unique festival interpretation that facilitates immersive participation in the expedition. While taking part in playful activities, participants are able to step outside oneself and learn to value themselves and others consequently. Looking at the current behavior of Solar Weekend visitors, the expedition indeed secures a more concerned attitude throughout the three festival phases. By making sure that the offer of the expedition at the festival is as attractive as a favorite performance, participants realize that it is not only musical entertainment that provides them with enjoyment. To conclude, Solar Expedition 3.0 forms a good appendage to the current portfolio of Extrema as it fits Solar Weekend and its varied target group. It underlines the strengths of the festival through seducing visitors to actively explore and discover its versatility. In advance of realization however, a thorough implementation plan has to be written and important choices have to be made on how to move on.","Solar Weekend Festival; expedition; Interactive Storytelling; enriched experiences","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-11-12","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2010","In active, toddler sized hand prostheses the cosmetic glove introduces a stiffness which causes the required operation forces to be too high to be generated by toddlers. The Wilmer WHD-4 was measured with 3 different cosmetic gloves. Despite using gloves of identical size and brand, different glove stiffness characteristic curves were measured. The goal of this study is to design a voluntary closing toddler sized hand prosthesis using an adjustable glove compensation mechanism. A prototype of the glove compensated hand prosthesis (GCHP) was designed and manufactured. High friction locked the compensation mechanism over the range of motion and prevented it from functioning. To investigate the causes of the higher than predicted friction, the prototype was examined in assembled and disassembled state. Imperfections of the manufactured GCHP hand basis were causing the mechanism to lock. The GCHP hand basis is a complicated part to manufacture and proved to be susceptible to precision errors. A test block, based on the GCHP hand basis, was designed and manufactured to measure the standalone compensation mechanism. Springs with lower stiffness are used in the measurement to reduce the forces on the axes. The mechanism did not lock in place and the behavior was measured. It was concluded that the mechanism does not result in a proper compensation characteristic due to the high frictional forces. The solution lies in heat treatment of the cosmetic gloves. Heat treatment will decrease the glove stiffness significantly. The lower glove stiffness will be accompanied with two phenomena: the required spring volume will decrease and the forces on the axes of the mechanism will decrease. Both these aspects will decrease the friction present in the system. The conclusion of this research is that to make glove compensation possible, the stiffness and hysteresis of the cosmetic gloves has to be reduced. Heat treatment of cosmetic gloves presented by Herder et al. showed promising results and should be further researched.","","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-12-16","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BioMechanical Engineering","","BME","",""

In order for our solution to be generic, as opposed to related ISA extension approaches, we insert system calls into the original program to control the reconfigurable accelerator using a compiler plug-in. We define specific mechanisms for the communication between the reconfigurable device, the host general purpose processor and the main memory. The reconfigurable device is controlled by the host through system calls provided by the device driver, and initiates communication by raising interrupts; it further has direct accesses to the main memory (DMA) operating in the virtual address space. To do so, the reconfigurable device supports address translation, while the driver serves the device interrupts, ensures that shared data in the host-cache remain coherent, and handles memory protection and paging. The system is implemented using a machine which provides a HyperTransport bus connecting a Xilinx Virtex4-100 FPGA to the host. We evaluate alternative design choices of our proposal using an AES application and accelerating its most computationally intensive function. Our experimental results show that our solution is up to 5X faster than software and achieves a processing throughput equal to the theoretical maximum.","HyperTransport FPGA Molen","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2011-01-15","Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science","Computer Engineering","","","",""

Concerning solar water heating, installation and hardware costs must be significantly reduced to allow for successful market penetration. As an attractive approach to cost reduction, I propose to replace the glass and metal parts of a collector with less expensive, lighter weight polymeric components. The difficulty with using polymers within solar collectors, however, is that high temperatures are reached in which low end polymers would become unstable. To cope with these temperatures, conventional solar collectors are generally build from high temperature resistant materials. These materials are usually expensive, heavy, and have an overall high environmental impact. As such, the research question of the project was defined as;Is it possible to design a polymeric solar collector in order to reduce collector cost price and set the stage for successful market penetration? An optical device was developed which can be integrated within the transparent cover plate of a solar collector in order to limit the maximum temperature. It is this mechanism that makes the use of polymers within solar collectors possible. Such a polymeric solar collector is presented together with a suitable marketing strategy.","solar; energy; collector; sustainable; polymer; optics","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-11-12","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","DfS","",""

To accommodate the growth of cruise shipping in North-West Europe, the developers Consortium ‘Cruiseport The Hague’ wants to construct an outer harbour at Scheveningen; to this day, the harbour of Scheveningen is not able to receive today’s large cruise ships. Obviously, a cruise mooring facility has to be constructed in the outer port; however, this structure has to provide more than just the mooring of cruise vessels alone. A multifunctional structure was designed. The functions, besides providing mooring to cruise ships are an underground parking garage and substructure as a foundation for the cruise terminal and office towers (a ten level building). The objective of my graduation project was to design the substitute of the mooring facility with related construction method. Construction method alternatives for the mooring facility are developed by a global feasibility study. This study, in combination with a multi-criteria analysis shows that the caisson construction method is selected for construction of the mooring facility. The caisson method is investigated in further detail to conclude whether it is possible to design and construct a very large (area of about 50,000 m2) joint free caisson structure as a mooring facility. A global design has been prepared for all the construction stages of the caisson mooring facility (from the construction to the removal of the temporary construction pit). The report describes the design for a caisson structure, able to resist the forces working on it throughout its lifecycle. The technical feasibility of the mega caisson is evaluated using a hand calculation and a finite element model, ESA PT. Based on these models, it can be concluded that the use of a very large caisson structure as mooring facility is technically feasible. Furthermore, the study shows that, when it comes to the financial feasibility, the cofferdam method leads to the lowest construction costs.","Caisson; Joint-free; Multi-functional; Scheveningen; Harbour","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Hydraulic Engineering","","","",""

It is in continuation of the C,MM,N project started in 2006 by the 3TU and the Nature and environment to develop a ‘car of the future’. I set out with the conviction that, for a car to be meaningful people ought to use it. In 2020 the car will become part of a mobility service and money will be made over the lifetime of the car as it serves through several iterations of use. The service offers a vehicle tailored to the occasion, therefore the utilitarian aspects of the car become less important. The focus of society shifts from the quantative to the qualitative aspects of life. No longer do we measure the quality of our lives by our material possessions, but by our experiences. Therefore; “I want people to enjoy the sensation of motion, free from worries.” To achieve this, driver and the car should become one, providing the optimal sensation of motion. Networks provide all necessary travel information, enabling the driver to focus on driving. A social network is implemented in order for people to cooperate and fall back on in moments of need. By improving ‘visibility’ of the driver and giving insight into his actions on road interaction is made more personal and natural. The c,mm,n car incorporates three types of playto help us cope with the increasing difficulties of mobility and find creative solutions for our mobility problems. Bodily play, is incorporated in the c,mm,n in its ability to lean into corners, increasing the sensation of motion. On the other hand giving other road users insight into his actions and improving on road communication. Object play, is one of the great joys of driving; the mastery of the car. However the c,mm,n also stimulates the driver to master a fluid driving style in order to keep energy usage to a minimum. Social play, is an integral aspect of the c,mm,n as cooperation is key to optimal personal mobility. This is incorporated in various forms, which stimulate on road cooperation, focusing on communication, stimulating helping others and drafting. On the same time we should keep in mind that we have to work within the limits of the future, providing a car that is efficient enough to offer a decent range, a package providing for daily activities, while keeping size and weight to a minimum. The car is equipped with Michelin Active Wheels, which house electric drive, braking and active suspension, which enables leaning into corners. The car seats 4 persons, placed on top of two interchangeable 20kWh Lithium ion batteries. The passengers and batteries are placed within an extremely strong, low weight Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic safety cell. Further safety is provided by aluminum crash structure in the front and rear. Optimal aerodynamics are achieved by minimizing the frontal area and featuring a Kammback design, a back end tapered to approximately 50% of the maximum cross section.","automotive; car; auto; electric","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Integrated Product Design","","Automotive","",""

Voor een betere benutting van de vaarweg dient ook de vraag naar vervoer over water te steigen. Naast korte en betrouwbare reistijden is het belangrijk dat bedrijven zich dicht bij de vaarweg vestigen en een losvoorziening hebben aan het water. Qua oplossing voor een snellere en betrouwbaardere reistijd kunnen knelpunten opgelost worden door de vaarweg en bruggen te laten voldoen aan een bepaald profiel. Daarnaast hebben sommige gemeenten het plan om de industrielocaties te verplaatsen. Ook het opheffen van de spitsuursluiting zorgt voor een vlottere reistijd. Echter een spitsuursluiting is ingesteld om de wachttijd van kruisend verkeer te voorkomen.

De gemiddelde reistijd, afwijking van de reistijden en de wachttijden voor het kruisend wegverkeer vormen de belangrijkste uitvoer. Uit deze modelstudie bleek dat de beoogde reistijdverkorting (circa 10%) alleen gehaald kan worden als er gesleuteld wordt aan de spitsuursluiting. Echter de wachttijden voor het kruisend verkeer neemt toe. Om de wachttijd te beperken dient voor enkele stroomwegen de spitsuursluiting gehandhaafd te blijven.

(mentor); Lindenbergh, R.C. (mentor); Khosh Elham, K. (mentor)","2010","Glacier melting has become a key issue in the current discussion on global climate change. Glaciers of the Tibetan Plateau may be heavily affected by global warming. Hence, possible glacier melting over the plateau attracts the most attention. Possible glacier melting is evaluated via studies on mass balance of the glaciers. Glacier elevation change is an important parameter in mass balance assessments. Traditional observations of glacier elevation changes were acquired by surveying. As an example, a large elevation change of 1.5 m decrease was reported at Zhadang glacier on the southwest Tibetan Plateau between 2005 and 2006. Traditional surveying is expensive for large areas and is limited by the extreme terrain and weather conditions on the Tibetan plateau. Therefore, remote sensing techniques are preferred in the research on ongoing glacier elevation changes. The research method assessed here considers elevation changes obtained by comparing serial DEMs. Photogrammetry techniques are applied for DEM generation. The 2.5 m horizontal resolution satellite images of the ALOS PRISM instrument are used as base image. One PRISM scene centered at longitude 81°15´37”N and latitude 29°49´53”E, available at both Level 1A/1B and Level 1B2R/1B2G, is employed for DEM and quality evaluation. ICESat laser altimetry data from campaign L3I is selected as ground control points (GCPs). ICESat has decimeter vertical accuracy over flat terrain In this case ICESat elevations are chosen as GCPs because sufficient GCPs from other sources are not available. The DEM generation is performed in the ERDAS LPS 9.3 software. The quality of the resulting TDEM (Tibetan Plateau DEM) is evaluated by ASTER GDEM and by data from different ICESat campaigns. Compared with ASTER GDEM, the mean difference is -41 meters. The TDEM has a mean difference of 5-10 meters with ICESat data from campaigns L3H, L3J and L3K. It is concluded that TDEM’s accuracy is sufficient to detect 15 m elevation change in 10 year’s time, which correspond to an annual glacier elevation change rate of 1.5 meters. The accuracy of TDEM is notably better than ASTER GDEM. As one TDEM tile reports the elevation of a glacier at a clear moment in time, TDEM is more suitable than ASTER GDEM for glacier mass balance studies.","Tibetan Plateau; glacier; elevation change detection; DEM; ALOS PRISM; ICESat","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Aerospace Engineering","Remote Sensing","","Optical & Acoustic Remote Sensing","",""

(mentor); Den Uijl, J.A. (mentor); Blondet, M. (mentor)","2010","The aim of this thesis is to apply a reparation method, developed by the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú, on an adobe structure damaged by earthquake loading. This loading is applied with a shaking table test. Using these tests an ATENA- GiD model is made which is able to simulate the behavior of adobe houses under earthquake loading. A shaking table test is done to damage an adobe structure, after reparation, the structure is tested again and the test data of the original and repaired building is compared. The ATENA-GiD model is compared with the first shaking table test. The adobe model is made similar to earlier tests performed at the PUCP. The masonry is made with adobe blocks and mortar. The model is dried for 28 days and then subjected to an earthquake loading derived from the May, 1970 earthquake recorded in Lima. The tests consisted of 2 phases, the first phase with a maximum displacement of 30 mm and the second phase with a maximum displacement of 60 mm. Due to this loading, cracks became visible in the structure. These cracks are visible after a second phase, with a maximum displacement of 60 mm. To repair these cracks they are opened and cleaned with a drill and a hammer and pin. After opening, the cracks are repaired using two different methods, the “manual method” and the “silicone method”. The “manual method” consists of manually filling the cracks with the reparation mortar. The “silicone method” is a method where cracks are first covered with silicon and after hardening of the silicon, the reparation mortar is injected in the cracks. After 28 days drying, the structure is tested again with the same signal. Cracks are already visible in the first phase. In the second phase the structure partially collapsed. This is underlined by the data from the two tests. The natural frequency of the walls decreases during the first test. This implies that there is damage in the walls. After repair, the natural frequency goes up, but never reaches the original value. This implies the presence of non-visual damage. In the second test the roof detaches from the walls in an early stage of the test, this due to the non-visible damage that is not repaired and have weakened the structure. The detachment of the roof results in an structure with less stability and strength. Dynamic tests are expensive and time consuming, therefore It is important to find out what finite element software (FEM) can contribute to the research in adobe buildings in earthquake areas. In the recent past, FEM software was used on a very basic scale at the PUCP. With this thesis it is intended to explore the possibilities of using FEM software in the research of adobe buildings. This to further improve the research possibilities on adobe structures with respect to earthquake loading. The model for this thesis is made in ATENA-GiD. Due to the recent development of the scripts for this program, this study is one of the first trails for the program. Because of this, several bugs were detected. During the course of this thesis improvements have been made to the program due to close contact with the developers and the author. In spite of these improvements, the bugs in the program made it only possible to make a very basic model. This model has a coarse mesh and the material is modeled on a macro scale which means that the blocks, mortar and block-mortar interface are smeared out in the continuum. After repair the structure does not have the same behavior as the original test. Due to non visible damage that is not repaired, the structure loses strength and stability after the first test. Besides this, the repaired part is not as strong as the original masonry. Cracks between the longitudinal and transversal wall are very dangerous. The whole construction looses its stability and strength when these cracks are visible. ATENA-GiD can simulate the behavior in the elastic phase. The inelastic phase does not have similar results as with the PUCP tests. Improvements are made to ATENA-GiD throughout the course of this thesis. Due to lack of these improvements this model has a very coarse mesh, which was needed to reduce calculation time. Several updates in the program can now improve calculation time and therefore more time consuming models can be made, which will calculate the inelastic behavior better.","earthquake; Adobe; repair; damage","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","Structural and Building Engineering","",""

(mentor); Blom, C.B.M. (mentor); Romeijn, A. (mentor); Pasterkamp, S. (mentor)","2010","In some large cities, the infrastructure is elevated high above the ground. An elevated metro system has the advantage that its construction is cheaper compared to an underground metro system. The construction time is relative limited and the physical barrier is small. The large elevation has a positive influence on the visual hindrance of an elevated metro system as it creates a more open and lighter space below the structure. In the future, Rotterdam wants to extent its existing metro system. An elevated metro system high above the city is one of the possible concepts. The engineering office of Rotterdam Public Works is interested in this concept and moreover in whether there can be gained profit on the elevated metro structure by applying Ultra High Performance Concrete (UHPC) or Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) instead of conventional concrete. The objective is to determine the dimensions and normative structural verifications of the elevated metro structure when this is made of conventional concrete, UHPC or FRP and to compare these designs with each other. For the designs of the elevated metro structure made of conventional concrete, UHPC or FRP the focus is on the lightest railway girder and not on the minimum depth of the girder. The suitable elevation and span of the elevated metro structure are respectively 15 and 45 metres. The best concept for the concrete and UHPC railway girder is the precast segmental box girder with external prestressing tendons. The optimal concrete box girder has 6 prestressing tendons and a dead load of 102.02 kN/m. This optimal design is found by means of an optimisation process where the behaviour of the box girder is examined by changing several parameters. The normative structural verification of the optimal concrete box girder is fatigue of the concrete. By closer examination, it turns out that fatigue of the concrete is not normative when studied in more detail. As a consequence the verification of the ultimate resistance moment at t=0 is normative. The optimal UHPC box girder has also 6 prestressing tendons and a dead load of 69.4 kN/m. The normative structural verification of the optimal UHPC box girder is the ultimate resistance moment of the box girder at t=0. The design of the railway girder made of FRP is a sandwich girder and is based on a bridge concept. The normative structural verifications of the FRP sandwich girder are deflection of the girder and buckling of the core triangles. The dead load of the FRP sandwich girder is 34.48 kN/m. The difference in dead load between the three designed railway girders is quite large. The application of a lighter railway girder does however not result in a large reduction of the number of piles. This is due to the small weight contribution of the railway girder to the total vertical load at the piles and the large contribution of the bending moments at the foundation to the pile forces. The normative structural verification of the columns is stiffness of the viaduct. Applying UHPC or FRP instead of conventional concrete for the railway girder thus has a small impact on the substructure. The direct construction costs for the elevated metro structure with a concrete box girder are about 450,000 per span of 45 metres. When the unit price of UHPC is lower than  450/m3, the UHPC box girder becomes a serious competitor of the conventional concrete box girder from a financial point of view. For the FRP railway girder holds that FRP is currently far too expensive to compete with the (UHP) concrete box girder.","elevated; metro; concrete; UHPC; composite; FRP; ultra high performance concrete; fibre reinforced polymer","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","Structural and Building Engineering","",""

This research investigated how Van Raalte Displays should introduce the VR StoreStopper PRO on the German market in an effective and efficient way. At the moment this company is busy with developing the VR StoreStopper PRO, an innovative pavement sign. The VR StoreStopper PRO has a recyclable plastic frame, which is unique in the market as all pavement signs have an aluminum frame. These aluminum frames cannot be easily detached from the rest of the product and are therefore unrecyclable. At the moment Van Raalte Displays is improving this product by using injection molding which makes it possible to produce the product out of recycled plastic. At the moment there are many competitors on the German market that offer a large range of pavement signs, such as A-standards and mobile pavement signs. However none of these competitors offer a plastic recycled pavement signs, which makes the VR StoreStopper PRO a unique product to the market. Nevertheless this does not make it easy to introduce this product in Germany. This research has shown that Van Raalte Displays has more experience in the Dutch market than most competitors have on the German market. This results in the fact that Van Raalte Displays has a lot of product knowledge and many satisfied customers. These strengths should be used when entering the German market, which is economically growing and getting more interested in environmental-friendly products. This study indicates that the promotion of the VR StoreStopper PRO should be used to promote the Van Raalte Displays brand and eventually also the complete product portfolio. For the promotion of this product, this study specifies several possible promotional tools, such as e-mailing, advertising and the website.","pavement signs; marketing plan","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2011-11-05","Industrial Design Engineering","Product Innovation Management","","Strategic Product Design","",""

The designs differ from each other in the way literature is used as a method. Each design is based on a different book and a different angle (writer / narrative / character). Also the function of each design is different according to their location.

In what way do they influence each other, how can they benefit from each other and what conditions are necessary to create this sort synergetic relationship? A framework of theories and tools is developed which can help urban planners to implement urban public transport (upt) systems into the socio-spatial urban fabric in an efficient manner. The graduation project is the final project of the master track Urbanism at the Faculty of Architecture at the Delft University of Technology and is performed in collaboration with the Department of Traffic and Transportation at dS+V Rotterdam. Research techniques The different research techniques used within the course of the project are literature research, empirical research and location specific research and design. The literature study performed provides insight in the relation between upt systems and urban development and regeneration and the factors which could positively influence this relation. The empirical framework is composed out different cases and literature (primarily professional and policy papers). Special attention will be given to the relation of new peri-urban expansions in combination with an expansion of the urban transport system. Two cases have been extensively researched: Ypenburg (Den Haag) and IJburg (Amsterdam). The location specific research and design concerns the Vinex-neighbourhood of Carnisselande (Barendrecht). Location analysis is performed and design propositions on different levels of scale are made for the neighbourhood and its regional context. Results An important research outcome is that pt investments positively influences urban development and regeneration projects linked to pt investments. These positive effects are however modest and could be enhanced when proper design, planning and policy measures are being taken. These measures (involving pt design; urban design; pt system service and functioning and urban planning & policy) have been researched and summarized within the Planning & Design Tool booklet. This gained knowledge is next integrated into a design which is aimed to improve the quality of urbanity and pt system quality of Carnisselande. Design The design consists from adaptations and additions to the local and regional public transport network while the embedment of these networks into the socio-spatial fabric of Carnisselande and Barendrecht have been researched and designed. Different types of urban development zones are linked to the introduced pt system investment and provide the neighbourhood with the much needed possibility to develop into a neighbourhood with a more interesting, diverse and high quality urban environment, making it suitable for a larger mix of lifestyles and flavours and less dependant on surrounding regional urban centers. The more efficient and diverse pt system provides Carnisselande with a larger potential reach, which allows the inhabitants to reach more (work) facilities and places within the same amount of time while make Carnisselande more interesting for business and facilities to settle. The symbiotic design of the pt network and the urban socio-spatial fabric provide Carnisselande with the possibility to develop into a sustainable and interesting urban neighbourhood.","urban public transport; urban development; urban design; the Netherlands; urban regeneration; Vinex neighbourhood; design guidelines; IJburg; Ypenburg; Carnisselande","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-11-12","Architecture","Urbanism","","Urban regeneration","",""

(mentor); Diehl, J.C. (mentor)","2010","Approximately one million households in rural Cambodia still use kerosene lamps. The use of a kerosene lamp has a lot of disadvantages: It provides very poor light quality, is difficult in use and poses a fire and health risk. A substitute for kerosene light can be found in the provision of lighting through solar powered lanterns. A solar lantern can overcome the problems of kerosene lamps and provide a sustainable lighting solution in rural Cambodia. The up-front investment of a solar lantern is the most important barrier for the poorest rural households in Cambodia to adopt the technology. Providing a ‘rent-to-own’ service for the solar lantern to the customer can overcome this barrier. Rural villagers can rent a solar lantern from a local entrepreneur for a period of 12 months for the small daily fee of $0.06 USD (total $21.70). After one year the ownership of the lantern transfers from the entrepreneur to the customer. It is estimated that the entrepreneur can make a profit of $253 on an investment of $750. The project produced the following results: List of requirements for the solar lantern; a product-service system design; product distribution plan for the company; a marketing plan to market the scheme; business model for the entrepreneur and the company; expansion plan to expand business from one region to the next; and suggestions for new product development that is necessary for the product-service system.","solar lantern; rental model; Cambodia; BoP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Design for Sustainability","","Strategic Product Design","",""

(mentor); Koppels, P. (mentor)","2010","Since the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, where the Dutch Olympians won a record amount of Olympic medals, the Olympic Dream has yet again awoken in the Netherlands. The dream to stage the Olympic once again, exactly 100 years after the first and only Olympiad in the Netherlands, was aimed at 2028. So why would the Netherlands want to host such an event? And how show they tackle the assignment? After the Olympiad in Athens in 2004, the Dutch Olympic dream had gained enough support to establish a concrete movement. This was done by establishing the ‘Alliantie’, a collaboration between the Dutch Olympic Committee, the NOC*NSF, the national government, the provincial government and the municipalities of the four largest cities in the Netherlands. The ‘Alliantie’ were to lead the exploratory studies of the Olympic assignment in the Netherlands. This finally led to the ‘Olympisch Plan 2028’, a report which included the ambitions, challenges, strategies and future circumstances of the potential Olympic assignment in the Netherlands. Eight ambitions were distinguished, of which the ambition that will have the most dominant stamp in the Netherlands, is the spatial ambition. In this ambition branch the ‘Alliantie’ initiated a single workshop study in order to explore the spatial assignment the Olympics would impose in the Netherlands. This study provided the basic framework and information for numerous studies to follow. One of which is the study Deloitte and NIROV have conducted on the Dutch stakeholders’ willingness to invest in Olympic developments. This is where this research comes into play; how did former host cities tackle the Olympic assignment? First of all, a superficial scan was made of former hosts and Olympic researches. Quickly the conclusion was reached that the Olympic developments in a city do not always bring the supposed successes and increase in quality. In many cases the Olympic developments were not used, under used of not used correctly. This created so called ‘white elephants’, large venues and facilities that cost more money than they provide, which inevitably lead to high debts. Major international cities like Melbourne, Montreal, Sydney and Athens, were not able to coop with the developments after the Olympic circus had left town. So how could a small nation like the Netherlands be successful were other great nations and cities could not? Thus the second problem can be distinguished; how to fit the Olympic assignment in the Netherlands, especially the building left behind, the legacy. Therefore the following problem statement was made: Due to the lack of sufficient attention to the long-term objectives for the post- Olympic real estate, undesired ‘white elephants’ arise from the Olympic real estate legacy in the former host cities. What is legacy exactly, and how is it created? These question were the next step in identifying the problem. Legacy can be identified in two categories, tangible or hard legacy, and intangible or soft legacy. Soft legacy can be described as the values, the knowledge, the memories and the general Olympic thought the Olympiad provides the host city. Hard legacy is the architecture, the infrastructure and the economic impact the Olympics leave behind. However a conference held in 2003 discussing the term legacy and what role it can play in Olympic cities, came to the conclusion that legacy is multidisciplinary and dynamic and is affected by a variety of local and global factors’. Therefore legacy creation is unique is every single city and location, and it is thus difficult to make a general definition. The Olympic development process plays an important role in answering the question on how legacy is created. The process consists of three phases; the initiatory and bidding phase, theorganisation and realisation phase and the post-Olympic phase. How does legacy creation fit into this process? To answer the latter question, a conceptual model was made on what influences legacy. Indirectly the before distinguished local factors play a significant role. The traditional planning culture of a nation, region or city determines the possibilities and opportunities of Olympic developments. Directly, the used development structure that is used to accomplish the Olympic assignment, plays an even larger role, as it includes all the pieces of the puzzle that are needed for the creation of the Olympic developments. The aspects that have been identified to the development structure are the initiative, objectives, stakeholders, organisational structure, budget, financial structure and the interferences. In addition the consequences, i.e. legacy, of the compilation of these different aspects is also of importance to learn lessons from former Olympic host cities. In turn, within the development structure aspects a division can be made between characteristics on four different sustainable development ambition levels; the governance, social , spatial and economical level. The objectives, strategies and legacies all have different perspectives which include all the different levels. This entire process then produced the following research question; Which development structure1 has the greatest potential concerning legacy1 for an edition of the Olympic Games in the Netherlands in 2028?","Olympic Games; urban development strategies; legacy; development structure","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-11-01","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","Urban Area Development","",""

In Chapter 2, the Heston model will be discussed. In Chapter 3, the problem of potential negative variance is treated. We investigate several numerical methods which are designed to simulate the variance path, and we test them. We will choose one method as our candidate scheme for the multi-dimensional Monte Carlo method. In Chapter 4, we construct this method, which we name the Multi-dimensional Quadratic Exponential method (MQE).We test its performance in Chapter 5.

Despite the importance of the tube, the user experience throughout the tube feeding treatment was very unpleasant and intense. Further research regarding the user experience of nasoenteral tube feed- ing showed that patients experience many problems during the process of this kind of tube feeding treatment. First of all, bringing the tube in- side the patient’s nose, throat and gullet down to the stomach or small intestine feels very uncomfortable. Furthermore, patients experience all kinds of problems during the daily use of the tube: it causes pain, irritation or fear, it interferes with their freedom of movement, it makes them un- comfortable in public and it brings along a time consuming maintenance. The maintenance of the tube and accompanying system to administer the feeding is time consuming due to the fact that the whole system needs to be flushed with water several times a day to avoid obstruction. Besides, the tube is fixated with sticking plasters that need to be replaced two or three times a day as they don’t stay in place or cause irritation. Next to these problems, some also concern the removing procedure of the tube or inadequate knowledge of heath care professionals. During this project a concept of a tube holding device has been developed to improve the user experience of nasoenteral tube feeding. The concept focuses mainly on the daily use of the feeding tube as the problems that occur in this phase influence the user experience the most. Due to the new concept it is possible to fixate the feeding tube on the face of the pa- tient after it has been brought inside their digestive tract. Throughout the daily use of the tube, which can last for a few days or several weeks, the tube will now kept in place by means of the tube holding device instead of fixating the tube with multiple sticking plasters. The tube holding device consists of a clamp to fixate the feeding tube and a headband that can be placed on the head of the user. Together these parts make sure that the tube interferes less with the patient’s freedom of movement, which is a big improvement compared to the current situ- ation. Furthermore, the tube holding device avoids kinking of the tube, guides the tube naturally down to the administration system, captures the weight of the feeding tube and the fixation of the tube looks more subtle. Finally, the tube holding device makes sure that the patient wor- ries less about undesired movements of the tube as it is fixated quite tight inside the device and the maintenance of the tube is less intensive due to the fact that the sticking plasters are no longer necessary.","human-product interaction; product experience; user experience; emotion; design","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","","Industrial Design Engineering","Industrial Design","","Master of Science Design for Interaction","",""

(mentor)","2010","Buenaventura is a port-city located in the Colombian pacific coast: having a geostrategic position, equidistant to the main worldwide markets; moving 60% of the cargo country; being the most important Colombian port. Considered as an eco-region with many biodiversity, it attracts many tourists. Nevertheless, having all these geographical and physical advantages; Buenaventura has always been developed around the cargo terminal; leaving behind citizens social and spatial factors. Therefore, through a Maritime Terminal for Passengers I explore how architecture can react in order to generate city-revival; in a site which has the specificity of motion but not permanence: cargo, money, tourists, whales, ambient factors move; then, everything flows but nothing remains for its citizens. Even with the fluctuation and movement of everything, how to provoke Spaces of Permanence and Stability? Defining building spatial position through ships parameters, spatial organization was defined according with main citizens’ social needs: employment, public space and water service. Sea Water Surface and Rain Water Fall behaviors were parameters used for building spatiality definition: interweaving the waves like passengers, visitors and cars paths, to generate surfaces; than more than load-unloading passengers, contains activities and public space, and also surfaces able to collect rain water. Therefore, being more than a landmark, the building provokes stability through its spaces: new employment opportunities [sailing school, repairing boats, commercial areas, and restaurant]; more visitors, passenger, and then investors’ attraction; new city image [increasing city identity and appropriation feeling]; new public space [improving citizen’s spatial conditions and life quality]. Furthermore, the emerging attractive and monumental shape is not only effective according to the created new image, but also effective because of the new rain water collection system: an element able to collect in a high efficient way [3 times more than a normal surface] which helps to solve one of the population’s main problems: the lack of water service for a 10% of the inhabitants. All previous exposed facts provoke spaces of stability, city revival-dialogue between city–port; through an infrastructure project.","marititime terminal","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-11-20","Architecture","Architecture","","Hyperbody Graduation Lab","",""

(mentor); Den Braver, O. (mentor)","2010","Purpose: Executing the sideward skating push-off requires a skater’s full attention and capabilities. Ankle eversion (AE) occurs during the push-off with skaters of low and high skill levels. Controlling AE requires high muscle force. AE adds unnecessary stress thus fatigue is a likely consequence. A purpose for AE in speed skating has not yet been found. Ankle eversion (AE) is considered an unwanted distraction during the execution of the push-off. The first goal is to reduce AE during speed skating. Plantar and dorsal flexion is to be left unhampered. The second goal is to prove that the skating motions can be executed with reduced AE. Method: An orthosis was designed to reduce AE on the right leg only. Skaters (n=10) with low and high skill levels were recorded while skating with normal and reduced AE. Video analyses resulted in relevant angles to quantify skating motions. The tested skaters filled out a questionnaire about skating with reduced AE. Results: On average AE was reduced by 45 to 70% from approximately 13 to 4 degrees with the tested skaters. Skating motions could be executed with reduced AE. The overall rating by the tested skaters for skating with reduced AE was neutral to positive. The orthosis functioned properly but it was considered big and clumsy. Conclusion: There are no negative outcomes from the angle measurements or the questionnaire on skating with reduced AE. That is a very positive situation. An estimation of the required muscle force shows that the amount is reduced significantly when skating with reduced compared to normal AE. As a result a skater saves energy and is not distracted by AE when executing the push-off. Skating with reduced AE might have a positive influence on performance. This has not been measured. A redesign of the orthosis should be stiffer and more compact.","speed skating","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-11-05","Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering","BMechE","","Biomechatronics","",""

The Dutch Pavilion designed by MVRDV at the Hannover 2000 expo is one example of this disrepair. The post-use of these specific areas could be more optimal in use and with that even support the local urban and economical development. This research brings you in the complex world of urban area development specifically with the use of a World Expo. Such events are nowadays more and more used as a catalyst for large development projects and for the promotion of the city. This recent initiative should be examined. This research will take a critical look into literature studies and two complying World Expo cases are investigated on their post-use strategies. The result of this research includes a strategic plan which can serve as an advice to future host cities of World Expos how to implement an optimal post-use strategy for these World Expo areas.","World Expo; post-use; strategic plan; Lisbon EXPO'98; Hanover EXPO2000; urban development; economic development; urban area development; World Fair; mega-event","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-11-11","Architecture","Real Estate & Housing","","Urban Area (Re)Development","",""

(mentor)","2010","Municipalities in the Netherlands are required to improve the quality of the public services and become more accessible through the internet. Theory on transformation says that to acquire that goal these government organisations must transform their organisational structure to become more process and chain based. A lot of municipalities appear to be behind the national schedule. The most important reason why these municipalities are behind schedule is that implementation of structural organisational transformation depends heavily on employees understanding the importance and implications of such a change. To improve the process towards a transformed organisation, municipalities can use interventions and methods provided by consultancy firms such as simulations which can increase the understanding of the implications and importance of structural transformation in government organisations. However, currently, there is no measurement of the effect simulation games have on the understanding and acceptance under participants. This thesis describes the creation for a questionnaire as a measurement tool that will be able to measure the effect of serious games. It will measure the view of employees on factors that are relevant for transformation in government organisations. During this research, data that was collected before and after “chain simulation” sessions will be used to conduct an analysis to identify factors that were affected during these sessions. In addition, experts on developing and facilitating simulations will be asked to provide insight in the results found in this analysis. Based on these analyses, a conceptual model and a research protocol will be presented to explain how the questionnaire can be used.","transformation; serious gaming; simulation; validation; questionnaire","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2010-11-04","Technology, Policy and Management","ICT","","SEPAM","",""

(mentor)","2010","Climate change - and particularly its long term-implications - has become the greatest challenge that scientists and politicians have to face. The building sector worldwide and, more specifically, the existing building stock, have been identified as major contributors to both global energy consumption and environmental damage. This study aims at investigating the most appropriate measures for the refurbishment of the Architecture building of TU Delft (BK City) that, currently, lacks sufficient energy conservation measures and is characterized by its obsolete fabric and outdated building services systems. Moreover, the final proposals take into account the historical value of the building, along with its most essential features. The first part of the study is a theoretical approach to the problem that starts by defining the content of the terms ‘sustainability’, ‘refurbishment’ and ‘historic buildings’. Next, a framework of the ‘sustainable refurbishment of historic buildings’ in terms of legal, ethical and procedural aspects, is outlined, as well as the range of possible refurbishment measures that can be applied within this framework. After having analyzed the extent and severity of the problem with specific reference to Europe, this section ends by highlighting the potential of refurbishment and by providing a brief summary of the current status of well-known refurbishment policies in four European countries. The second part of the study is an investigation of the case-study building. Necessary information concerning the context of BK City is presented, ranging from climatic and geographical data, to specific information on the building, its history and its performance in terms of building physics. Here, the distinguishing features of the building are identified, as well as the permissible interventions. With regards to building physics, it is pointed out that the weaknesses of the building are, mainly, the out-dated exterior envelope and mechanical equipment, which result in a poor indoor climate, despite the excessively high energy consumption. The information in this section is essential for the development of the refurbishment strategies. Before elaborating on the refurbishment alternatives, an investigation is carried out to cluster all possible measures in 8 categories and cite relevant showcases and good practice examples of previously refurbished buildings. The most appropriate of these measures form the three proposed refurbishment Strategies of this Thesis, that range from basic interventions, such as cavity wall insulation, to more sophisticated solutions, as is the use of fuel cells. Advantages and disadvantages, application guidelines and market availability for each measure are provided. The objective of the last section is to evaluate the impact of a selection of the aforementioned measures. For this purpose, a model is provided that allows the static calculation of the heating and cooling demands that will keep the indoor climate of the building at comfort levels. The results of these calculations are further analyzed and discussed. The conclusions suggest that the existing building is wasteful in its use of energy resources and, thus, huge possibilities lie in its refurbishment, even if only moderate measures are applied.","sustainable refurbishment historic building BK City monumental","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Design and Construction","","Structural and Building Engineering","",""

(mentor); Pater, C.J. (mentor)","2010","Worldwide rising gas demand is creating new opportunities for low-permeability gas reservoirs to be exploited with large hydraulic fracturing campaigns. These so-called tight gas reservoirs have been subject of much research over the past three decades, primarily because it is difficult to optimize recovery. In this thesis, post-fracture production of tight gas reservoirs is simulated and interpreted through well test analyses. The focus lies on the impact of unconventional reservoir behaviour, specifically the impact of leakoff water on gas production and assessing the accuracy of post-fracture evaluation using production data and well tests. Specific characteristics of tight gas reservoirs, such as high capillary pressure, a ‘permeability jail’, and reservoir heterogeneity, may invoke phase trapping mechanisms that could potentially harm gas production. The ‘permeability jail’ is a hypothesis that gas-water relative permeability functions include a large saturation range with little or no fluid mobility, caused by the complex pore-structure of tight gas sandstone reservoirs. This thesis presents reservoir simulations of both the short and the long-term gas and water production, performed with a commercial numerical simulator. Simulations show that high capillary pressures alone do not harm gas production significantly. Assuming a permeability jail in lower-permeability reservoir zones in a heterogeneous reservoir results in an extended cleanup period and a reduction in total recoverable gas. This result is comparable to the simulation of mechanical or chemical damage to the reservoir surrounding the fracture, or so-called fracture face damage. With mechanical or chemical damage, the water production is impaired initially and slowly recovers with time. This distinguishes this type of damage from a permeability jail, which shows rapid water flow-back of approximately 50% of the leakoff water. Finally, the impact of leakoff water on a permeability jail is severe. Therefore, it is advisable to control leakoff during the treatment. The simulation output data is analyzed with a commercial pressure transient analysis software package. The well test analyses show that a heterogeneous reservoir with permeability jail damage can also be interpreted as a homogeneous reservoir with either a very short or low-conductivity fracture: all three hypotheses fit the well-test data. This confirms that well tests may be inconclusive for distinguishing among these cases. Subsequent performed simulations show that reduction in fracture length does not extend the initial cleanup period, but strongly correlates with a shift of the production decline curve to lower gas rates. A reduced fracture length and damage from leakoff and a permeability jail are therefore distinguishable. On the other hand, it’s difficult to separate production results for a model with a low-conductivity fracture from a model with permeability jail damage: both show strongly reduced initial gas rates and followed by long cleanup periods. Water production can be used to discriminate between a fracture with reduced permeability and reservoir damage, however. This allows for a correct diagnosis and appropriate actions to be taken to optimize subsequent fracture treatments.","tight gas reservoirs; hydraulic fracture; production evaluation","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-11-12","Civil Engineering and Geosciences","Geotechnology","","Petroleum Engineering","",""

(mentor)","2010","Serious games are an important tool in creating, explaining, building, deploying and evaluating solutions for complex multi-actor problems. The Indian electricity challenge is such a complex multi-actor problem which forms the content of the Indian Electricity Game. To become a success it is necessary that serious games, like the Indian Electricity Game, are adjusted to the culture of its players. By playtesting with the targeted players, game designers are able to adjust their serious games to the culture of the targeted players. However, due to a lack of time, high costs and the need for a good first impression, playtesting is not always possible. This problem statement led to the following main research question: What method is able to adapt serious games to the culture of the players without playtesting them with these players? In an answer to this main research question, this research proposes the culture driven game design method. This method consists of the culture driven game design iteration which is embedded in the iterative Triadic Game Design development model. The iteration consists of three steps. In step 1 the culture difference between the playtesters and the targeted players is assessed using a questionnaire. In step 2 the assessed culture difference is translated to a set of potential conflicting game elements. In step 3 the relevance of the conflicting game elements is determined. When the relevant conflicting game elements are mitigated in the proceeding design step, the game is adapted to the culture of the players. The culture driven game design method was evaluated by means of two case studies and an expert interview. In these case studies the Indian Electricity Game was used that was developed during this research at the Centre for Study of Science, Technology and Policy (CSTEP) in Bangalore. It was concluded that the culture driven game design method was able to adapt the Indian Electricity Game to multiple groups of players with a different culture without playtesting the game with these players. However, further research is needed to evaluate if the method is also applicable to other types of serious games and other types of cultures.","Culture Driven Game Design Method; serious games; serious gaming; culture; game design; Indian electricity game; CSTEP","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","2010-11-09","Technology, Policy and Management","Systems Engineering","","SEPAM IA","",""

As a result, different solutions, applications, technologies, etc. are popping up in the Dutch electricity sector, which support this development. Literature names several important upcoming developments of which “Battery Storage Systems” is one. Therefore, in this thesis the following main research question is answered: What is the most promising future business model for Battery Storage Systems in the Dutch electricity system? In order to answer this research question, five sub research questions are defined and divided among three core research phases. The first phase deals with an extensive literature / desk research phase. During this phase the relevant scientific knowledge related to business models is gathered, which is used to carry out a solid scientifically proven business model research. The leading business model literature used in this thesis is related to the scientific research of Osterwalder. Next, this phase deals with the current Dutch electricity system and the environmental forces, in order to determine the current and future system requirements. By taking the total system requirements into account acceptable solutions for all relevant actors involved can be achieved. Thereafter, the Battery Storage Systems (BSS) technology itself is analyzed, in which the technology, applications and alternative technologies are a major issue. At last, this phase ends with a value assessment in which the (future) system requirements, BSS applications and alternative technologies are valuated. The results of this assessment, most promising applications and relevant actors, are used as the basis for the following research phases. The second phase continues current scientific research by executing an extensive field study. During this field study, executing expert interviews was the core element to gather all the relevant data required. The required data consisted of two main elements, namely validating the data gathered during the previous phase and collecting additional data for covering all the business model issues. Validating the previous phase was required as most collected data is based on case studies carried out in different surroundings. Furthermore, the interviews were set up according and in order to cover the nine building blocks of Osterwalder’s business model framework. The interviews were hold among seventeen interviewees, with a response rate of 100%. All those interviewees had a great understanding about the specific case and shared relevant and interesting information. During the last core research phase the three most promising business models (RGO, Private and Provider) were designed and evaluated. The main difference between those business models is the usage and ownership of the BSS technology. The evaluation existed of a feasibility assessment and a comparison in order to determine the strategic fit with the current business models of the relevant actors. From this assessment it is clear that the RGO model is the most valuable future model, as it provides the most benefits for the total Dutch electricity system and actors involved. Nevertheless, this assessment also concludes that all three business models encounter different resistance when implementing in practice. The RGO model will mainly encounter resistance from the current Dutch electricity law and regulation, as storage is still unknown in those rules and guidelines. Therefore, it is highly recommended to implement storage purposes in the Dutch electricity law and regulation in agreement with all relevant actors involved, which can be a long and intensive implementation process.","business models; Battery Storage Systems; Power Sector; Dutch electricity system; interview","en","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Technology, Policy and Management","Infrastructures, Systems and Services","","Management of Technology, Energy & Industry","",""

(mentor); Stouten, P. (mentor); Westrik, J. (mentor)","2010","Het doel van deze master thesis was om inzicht te krijgen in hoeverre de ruimtelijke structuur debet is aan de problemen in naoorlogse wijken als Pendrecht en Zuidwijk. Dit in relatie met de huidige aanpak van wijkvernieuwing en herstructurering van deze wijken. Deze vernieuwing en herstructurering is met name gericht op programmatische ingrepen en de aanpak van de buitenruimte terwijl de ruimtelijke structuur van hoofdlijnen en buurtlijnen binnen deze wijken niet of nauwelijks ter discussie staat. Het probleem dat zich in deze situatie mogelijk voordoet is dat wijken als Pendrecht en Zuidwijk een wijkeconomie hebben die teveel gericht is op de economische activiteit wonen. Winkels en bedrijven binnen de wijk zijn in deze situatie vrijwel volledig afhankelijk van de lokale vraag (van bewoners) naar goederen en diensten. De reden dat er weinig vraag van buiten deze wijken is heeft met name te maken met de ge-ïsoleerde ligging van de wijken, dat zich in relatie met deze thesis vooral manifesteert als een gebrek aan verbindingen op meerdere schaalniveaus. Uitgaande van een suburbaan woonmilieu is deze geïsoleerde ligging een voordeel; men gaat vaak juist in een dergelijke wijk wonen om ‘de drukte van de stad’ te ontsnappen. Een aantrekkelijk suburbaan woonmilieu waar de kwaliteit van de woningen en het woonmilieu goed is. Waar de vraag naar woningen binnen de wijk hoog is en secundaire voorzieningen als winkels hiervan profiteren door de omzet die de winkels in relatie hiermee kunnen realiseren. In een dergelijke situatie is er niets aan de hand; een dergelijke wijk heeft een duidelijke economische en sociale toegevoegde waarde die voor zowel bewoners, als investeerders, als de overheid en de stad als geheel een positieve bijdrage levert. Het probleem dat de wijkeconomie een primaire gerichtheid heeft op de activiteit wonen doet zich pas gelden op het moment dat er andere nieuwe suburbane bijkomen die beter voldoen aan de wensen van woonconsumenten. Hierbij kan gedacht worden aan suburbane wijken met bijvoorbeeld grotere en kwalitatief betere woningen en een kwalitatief betere woonomgeving. Deze nieuwe wijken trekken veel mensen aan vanuit wijken als Pendrecht en Zuidwijk waardoor het aanzien en de sociaal-economische positie afneemt. De meest draagkrachtige mensen vertrekken en minder draagkrachtige mensen komen in de plaats en voor een wijk die in grote mate afhankelijk is van de economische activiteit wonen kan dat een groot probleem zijn omdat onder andere het (financiële) draagvlak voor allerlei voorzieningen afneemt terwijl er vaak juist meer beroep wordt gedaan op sociale voorzieningen. Dit in combinatie met de geïsoleerde ligging van de wijken zorgt ervoor dat het animo voor parti- culiere investering in winkels, bedrijven en andere panden minder wordt. Dit terwijl aan de andere kant meer (semi-) publieke investeringen nodig om deze achteruitgang te stoppen. Bij het doen van deze vernieuwingsinvesteringen wordt er vaak van uitgegaan dat het woon-milieutype (groen suburbaan woonmilieu met lage dichtheden en een geïsoleerde ligging) nog steeds voldoet. Dit uitgangspunt manifesteert zich ruimtelijk gezien, onder andere in programmatische ingrepen waarbij meergezinswoningen worden vervangen door eengezinswoningen. Mijn hypothese is dat dit woonmilieutype niet meer voldoet om de wijk weer economisch en sociaal vitaal te maken en belangrijker; vitaal te houden. De stelling is dat de zeer sterk gereguleerde stedenbouw van vlak na de oorlog een ruimtelijke structuur tot gevolg heeft die niet of onvoldoende in staat is om andere primaire economische activiteiten te trekken dan ‘het wonen’. De mogelijke oplossing, waardoor mogelijk andere primaire economische activiteiten en daarmee particuliere investering aangetrokken worden is om de ruimtelijke structuur aan te passen waarbij uitgegaan wordt van een stedelijke structuur die gebaseerd op een meer de liberale stedenbouw principes van eind 19e en begin 20e eeuw. Het essentiële verschil tussen deze stedenbouw-kundige principes is dat de ruimtelijke structuur in wijken die gebaseerd zijn op meer liberale stedenbouwkundige principes is opgebouwd uit (hoofd)lijnen en niet uit vlakken zoals dat het geval is bij wijken die onder zeer streng gereguleerde stedenbouw zijn ontstaan.","stedelijke vernieuwing; ruimtelijke structuur","nl","master thesis","","","","","","","","","Architecture","Urbanism","","","",""

Currently pilot project are implemented and the next step is to embed Smart Grids into the electricity system. This requires new institutions, because of the new possibilities of a Smart Grid. There are two challenges to embed the Smart Grid into a town in Shenzhen where this study was based. (1) Unequal distribution of benefits, the distribution system operator has to implement a more expensive grid which lowers sales. (2) Large electricity users which cover 70% of the total consumption do not benefit from the Smart Grid like residential and small commercial usage. To counter the first challenge trade-offs need to be made between economic viability and sustainable performance. Large electricity users could be incentive to install renewable energy sources but still remain an issue for the Smart Grid. One way or the other, strong governmental regulation is necessary since the market does not converge towards a Smart Grid.","Smart Grid; China; Institutional design; DSO","en","master thesis","","","","","","","Campus only","2010-11-01","Technology, Policy and Management","Policy, Organisation, Law and Gaming","","","",""
